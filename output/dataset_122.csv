2764426,Jarrett v R [2014] NSWCCA 140,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 29 June 2007, when the complainant was 12 years old, she was indecently and sexually assaulted by the applicant. He threatened to commit suicide if she told anyone. The complainant did not then contact police, although shortly thereafter she told her sister and some friends. In October 2007, the complainant contacted the applicant, telling him she could no longer remain silent. Distressed, the applicant was admitted to a hospital. Whilst at the hospital he made admissions to staff about the offences. The police were notified and contacted the complainant. She declined to be interviewed. It was only in January 2009 that the complainant eventually gave a full account to police. The applicant was charged with a number of offences

The principal prosecution evidence at trial was a video of the complainant's police interview and the applicant's admissions at the hospital. As required by s 306X of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), a mandatory warning was given about drawing adverse inferences from, or giving disproportionate weight to, evidence of a vulnerable person in a recording. The jury sought and was granted access to the video, along with other evidence, in the jury room. No further warning was given or sought. Moreover, the trial judge went no further than to suggest the applicant's admissions might have been unreliable because of his mental state at the time they were made.

The warning that delay in complaint in sexual offence proceedings does not necessarily indicate a false allegation and that good reasons may exist to explain the delay was given: Criminal Procedure Act, s 294(2)(a)-(b). Unless there is sufficient evidence to justify such a warning, no warning is to be given that delay in complaining is relevant to a victim's credibility: s 294(2)(c). The applicant at trial made no argument that the evidence justified such a warning. The only warning sought in respect to delay in complaining was that the applicant had lost the chance to obtain evidence contemporaneous with the offences alleged in the complaint, thus suffering a ""significant forensic disadvantage"". Section 165B of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) requires a warning to the jury if the court is satisfied that delay has caused a ""significant forensic disadvantage"", subject to any good reasons why such a warning should not be made. The trial judge was not satisfied that the delay had caused such a disadvantage.

The applicant sought leave to appeal his conviction and sentence on the following grounds:

(i) the jury should not have had access in the jury room to the video of the complainant's evidence in chief without a further warning about placing too much weight on it;
(ii) failing to warn the jury that the applicant's admissions may have been referring to someone other than the complainant;
(iii) failing to provide a direction regarding any significant forensic disadvantage suffered by the applicant from the delay in complaining;
(iv) not giving a direction that delay in complaining could be considered in assessing the complainant's credibility;
(v) in respect to sentencing, failure to take into account the mental condition of the applicant at the time of the offence.

The Court held, granting leave to appeal for ground 3 but dismissing the appeal and otherwise refusing leave to appeal on all other grounds:

In relation to (i):
(per Basten JA, R A Hulme J agreeing)

1. A miscarriage did not result from allowing the jury to have access to the video in the jury room or from failing to provide a further warning about its use. The warning given earlier was sufficient and the nature of the jury's request - asking for the video along with other evidence - suggested it would not be misused: [69]-[75].

R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; 63 NSWLR 628; Galvin v R [2006] NSWCCA 66; 161 A Crim R 449 considered.

(per Campbell J)
2. Allowing the jury unsupervised access to the video was an irregularity but it did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice: [93]-[95]. 

Gately v The Queen [2007] HCA 55; 232 CLR 208 applied.
R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; 63 NSWLR 628 not followed.

In relation to (ii):
(per Basten JA, R A Hulme and Campbell JJ agreeing)

3. The forensic disadvantage of the direction proposed is patent: it is unlikely to have assisted and would potentially have caused egregious prejudice as it suggested the applicant may have committed similar offences against another person: [29]-[30].

Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 referred to.

In relation to (iii):
(per Basten JA, R A Hulme and Campbell JJ agreeing)

4. No significant forensic disadvantage was caused by delay: the applicant knew a complaint was in contemplation well before it was made and he arguably contributed to the delay by his threat to commit suicide. Even if such a disadvantage was established, the applicant's threat to commit suicide provided good reason not to warn the jury: [60]-[64].

In relation to (iv):
(per Basten JA, R A Hulme and Campbell JJ agreeing)

5. The evidence was not sufficient to justify a warning that delay was relevant in assessing the complainant's credibility. There were inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence that went to credibility but these did not provide the basis for a direction based on delay under s 294(2)(c): [49]-[50].

Commissioner of Stamps (South Australia) v Telegraph Investment Co Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 44; 184 CLR 453; Plaintiff S297/2013 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] HCA 24 applied.
Kilby v The Queen [1973] HCA 30; 129 CLR 460; Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427; Suresh v The Queen [1998] HCA 23; 72 ALJR 769; R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109 considered. 

In relation to (v):
(per Basten JA, R A Hulme and Campbell JJ agreeing)

6. The sentencing judge gave careful attention to the applicant's mental health. Even if that was not the case, there is no basis for finding that a less severe sentence was warranted in law: [85], [96]




			Judgment

 

1BASTEN JA: The applicant was convicted of several offences of sexual assault on the complainant, identified as JT, a 12 year old friend of the applicant's daughter. The offences took place on the evening of Friday, 29 June 2007. The applicant was charged in 2009, but the trial did not come on until November 2012, when the applicant was convicted by a jury on each of four counts. He has remained in custody from the date of conviction, namely 30 November 2012.

 

2On 31 January 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Black DCJ to fixed terms of 12 months and 18 months on two lesser offences and sentences of eight years, each with a non-parole period of five years and a balance of term of three years, on the two more serious offences. The sentences were fixed to run concurrently from 30 November 2012. The non-parole period is due to expire on 29 November 2017.

 

3The applicant sought leave to appeal against the convictions and sentences.

 

4The evidence before the jury fell within a limited compass. The principal evidence was that of the complainant, whose evidence in chief consisted of a video recording of her interview by a police officer. There was brief evidence given by the complainant's sister and her mother. Her sister gave evidence of a complaint at the end of 2007, in terms which were not entirely consistent with the complainant's evidence in court. The mother's evidence was not of complaint, but confirmed that the applicant had bought the complainant a mobile phone in September 2007. The investigating officer also gave largely formal evidence in chief, but in cross-examination provided the content of two further complaints to school friends, the content of which was relied on by the defence as partly inconsistent with the complainant's evidence in court.

 

5The second part of the prosecution case involved statements made by the applicant when he was admitted to the Richmond Clinic, at Lismore Base Hospital, in October 2007, when he believed the complainant had gone to the police. Three witnesses gave evidence of statements which were capable of being understood as admissions by the applicant that he had sexually assaulted the complainant.

 

6The grounds of appeal, as developed in submissions, were broadly in the following terms, namely that the trial judge erred in:

 

(1) allowing the jury to have the video of the complainant's evidence in chief in the jury room, without a proper direction under s 306X of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW);

(2) failing to give directions concerning circumstantial evidence with respect to the alleged admissions at the Richmond Clinic;

(3) failing to give adequate directions as to the forensic disadvantages faced by the appellant by reason of the delay in complaint, and

(4) not giving directions that the jury could take delay in complaining into account in assessing the credit of the complainant.

 

7With respect to the appeal against sentence, the only error alleged was in failing to take into account ""the mental condition of the applicant"" at the time of the offence (ground 5).

 

8No direction having been sought or complaint made during the trial with respect to the matters the subject of grounds 1, 2 and 4, the applicant required leave to rely upon each ground pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The appeal based on ground 3 required leave under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In each case, the Director opposed a grant of leave. For the reasons given below, there should be a grant of leave to appeal with respect to ground 3, but the appeal should be dismissed. Leave under rule 4 should be refused with respect to grounds 1, 2 and 4. The appeal against conviction fails.

 

9There was no substance to the application with respect to the sentence; leave to appeal should be refused.

 

Factual background

10The applicant's daughter was the complainant's best friend. The complainant often stayed with her friend in the applicant's home. She knew the applicant well and referred to him by his initials, JJ. On her description of the events on the Friday evening, the applicant and his friends had been drinking. When they left the applicant's daughter had gone to bed; the applicant then asked the complainant, ""Do you want to watch a movie?"" He said she could lie on the sofa-bed in the lounge room and he put on a movie. The complainant laid down on a couch and the applicant lay beside her. The applicant tickled her and kissed her, put one hand under her shirt and felt her breasts, saying ""They're nice little ones."" (That activity constituted the first charge, being indecent assault of a child under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).)

 

11The applicant also put his hands down the complainant's pants, ""started playing with me, and then he took my pants off."" (That constituted the basis of the second charge, being another act of indecent assault.)

 

12She said that the applicant then ""licked me out"", a complaint of cunnilingus and the basis of the third charge (of sexual intercourse without consent, knowing she was not consenting, being under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61J(1)). He then had penile intercourse with the complainant (being the second charge under s 61J(1)).

 

13The complainant slept on the lounge that night, but when she awoke in the morning, ran into her friend's room and laid in bed with her. The applicant came in later with cups of tea and vegemite on toast for breakfast. She stayed at the house on the Saturday and on Saturday night the applicant said to her, ""Don't tell anyone, this is our little secret and if you tell anyone I'll kill myself.""

 

14The history of complaints will be addressed shortly; she did not agree to record an interview with police until 28 January 2009. On that day she was interviewed by Detective Senior Constable Rebecca Scott. She gave further details of the conduct constituting the second and third charges which had significance because of some degree of inconsistency with the evidence of earlier complaint to her sister and school friends. The complainant gave evidence of the applicant kissing her, lying on top of her and playing with her belly button, and then feeling her breasts. The following questions and answers were recorded:

 

""Q162. So then tell me how your bodies were positioned then.

A. Like, he tickled me and I've, like, I was on my side and I've rolled over like that, and I said, Don't, and then he kissed me and, because I was laying down ... he rolled on top of me so I had nowhere to go - 

...

- and I've just held my mouth, like, just didn't kiss back. 

... 

And then he rolled off me and I've just quickly rolled back over, and then he's just played with my belly button, and then went down my pants and then took 'em off.

 

Q165. OK. So how were you lying when he took your pants off?

A. On my side but then he, like, went down on me and he opened my legs - 

...

- and he put, he said, I don't know what he said but he put the blanket over his head and over me when he was doing that, and I don't know, I was just, I had my face turned to the TV with tears rollin' down my face and I was shaking.

 

Q167. OK. Sorry, he pulled your pants down and that's when you said he went down on you?

A. Yeah, but he played with me first.

 

Q168. OK. Played with what?

A. With my vagina.

 

Q169. And what did he use to play with you?

A. His hands.

 

Q170. And where did he put them?

A. Just on my vagina.

 

Q171. Did he put them on the inside or the outside?

A. No, he didn't, like, finger me.

 

Q172. OK. You said he didn't -

A. No.

 

Q173. - finger you.

A. He just - 

 

Q174. And what's, and what's fingering?

A. Where, isn't where he sticks his fingers in you?

 

...

 

Q180. OK. And you said he went down and before you said to me he licked me out.

A. Yeah.

 

Q181. Can you tell me what that, what you mean by that.

A. Like, he used his tongue to, like, play with my vagina.

 

Q182. Did you put his tongue inside or outside your vagina?

A. No, he didn't put it inside.

 

...

 

Q185. OK. Did he put his tongue inside or outside the lips of your vagina?

A. Well, the clitoris.

 

Q186. He was, he put his tongue on your clitoris?

A. Yes.""

 

15At the trial the complainant's sister gave evidence of a conversation in which the complainant had described to her the events of the evening in question, stating that the conversation would have been ""at the end of 2007"": Tcpt, 27/11/12, p 37(30). She described the complaint in the following terms (Tcpt, p 33(15)-(50):

 

""A. Yeah. And then he started touching her and licking her and then after a couple of hours someone was knocking on the door and it was ...

...

 

Q. - 'Started touching her'?

A. Yep.

 

Q. 'and started licking her'?

A. Yeah. He was fingering her.

 

Q. I beg your pardon?

A. He was fingering her. 

 

Q. And he was fingering her, and anything else?

A. And he was licking her out.

...

 

Q. So apart from touching her and fingering her and licking her out, did she say that he did anything else to her?

A. He had sex with her.

 

Q. When she said that he had sex with her, did she say anything about in what sort of positions they been when he had sex with her?

A. I can't really remember, I think she said it was from behind. ...""

 

16In cross-examination, the sister was asked questions about the person who came to the door (""he was looking for his little sister [that] ran away"") and about the complaint of ""fingering"". In re-examination the prosecutor led from the sister (without objection) evidence that in her police interview she had been asked whether the words that he ""fingered"" her were said by the complainant or were the sister's own words and she said ""they were my words.""

 

17There was discussion in the absence of the jury about the re-examination, counsel for the accused stating that the re-examination was ""unfair"", saying that he had ""no difficulty with the questions that were put, but they were put in isolation"": Tcpt, p 42(5). He then asked the prosecutor to ""fulfil the context"". That was done in the following passage:

 

""Q. Can I just get you to follow from A31 you said this to the police officer:

 

'And then he likes she starts shaking and stuff and he was laying next to her and then he put the blanket over them and stuff and yeah he fingered her and stuff like that.'

 

And I think following over the page the police officer said 'And stuff like that, what else did he do, what did she say' and you said 'He licked her out and stuff' and Rebecca says 'Yeah' and you add 'And then he raped her'. That's what you told Rebecca at the time?

A. Yes.

 

Q. Then if I can just go lastly towards the bottom of page 4 Rebecca asked you about rape and said this 'Like did she tell you what, did she describe to you what she meant by rape' and you said 'Oh she didn't say rape she like, like having sex with her' and Rebecca said 'Is that what she said' and you said 'Yeah' and Rebecca said 'So she told you what' and you said 'That he was - that he started having sex with her'?

A. Yeah.

 

Q. Then right at the end there was that further bit that I put to you this morning about where Rebecca asked you again about the use of the word fingered?

A. Yeah and that was my word.

 

Q. You said at the answer to 45 that you think that they were your words?

A. Yeah. 

 

Q. You weren't certain about it?

A. Yeah.""

 

There was no further questioning of the sister.

 

18Before dealing with the manner in which that evidence was dealt with before the jury, it is convenient to summarise the evidence of statements made at the Richmond Clinic. The applicant was admitted to the emergency department of Lismore hospital on the previous night. He spoke with a mental health nurse, Dennis Casey, on the morning of 2 October 2007. Mr Casey was invited to read part of his notes as his evidence in chief, including the following (Tcpt, 28/11/12, p 75(5)):

 

""Lying in bed sobbing. John tells me he interfered with a 13-year-old girl two months ago at his home. He denies any other contact. Yesterday she rang him to say she had had enough of remaining silent. John says he is terrified that she will tell someone and he will lose his kids and go to gaol. ...""

 

19Immediately before Mr Casey spoke to the applicant, the applicant had received five mg of valium orally. Mr Casey described the effect as ""mildly sedating, mildly tranquilising, [its] effects would be to reduce anxiety"": Tcpt, p 80(10). Later on 2 October, the applicant was given Zyprexa, which Mr Casey described as a powerful sedative used in the management of psychosis: p 82. Mr Casey was cross-examined as to whether the applicant may have said that ""he had been told that he interfered with a 13-year-old girl"", thus recounting an allegation rather than the fact: Tcpt, p 85. Mr Casey did not recall that being said.

 

20The second witness was Gregory Telford, who had been a counsellor working with Aboriginal people with drug or alcohol related problems in Lismore, employed by the Department of Community Services. Mr Telford was asked to read a passage from his notes of his conversation with the applicant, which he did at Tcpt, 27/11/12, p 56(1):

 

""'I said JJ I need to make you aware that I've come down to see you, I know what you're here for, I have to tell you straight up that prior to me talking with you that should you mention the young girl's name I am a mandatory reporter and I'll have to notify the authorities'.

 

Q. I think he replied?

A. 'Yeah that's okay'.

 

Q. Did you then ask him a question?

A. Yes.

 

Q. Tell us what you asked him?

A. 'Is it true that you had sex with the young girl'.

 

Q. And if I can just assist you, did he - was his answer  'Yeah'?

A. Yes.

 

Q. I think you at that point pointed out to him that she was still a minor?

A. Yes.

 

'John said I want to take responsibility for my behaviour. I said in that case you need to notify the police. John said if I do that I could go to gaol. I said do you want to take responsibility. John said yes. I said notifying the police would be part of that process.'""

 

21Mr Telford agreed that the applicant was ""quite medicated"" at the time of the conversation. In cross-examination he agreed that he had made no note of the conversation at the time and that his statement was prepared three years later, in December 2010. He had a later conversation with the applicant in 2009, apparently shortly before he was charged, at which time he denied the allegations of having sex with a young girl.

 

22The cross-examination of Mr Telford focused primarily on his lack of contemporaneous notes of the conversation and the proposition that the applicant was not in a fit state to discuss matters in 2007 because he was heavily medicated.

 

23The third witness in this group was consultant psychiatrist, Dr Igor Petroff. He spoke to the applicant at Lismore Base Hospital at about 7am on the morning of 2 October 2007: Tcpt, p 66(5). He formed the view that the applicant was ""a mentally disordered person but not a mentally ill person"": Tcpt, 27/11/12, p 65(5). Dr Petroff's note was: ""Disability Support Pensioner has sexually abused daughter's 13 year old friend some months ago. Now all came to a head with the girl abusing him yesterday. Now terrified of going to gaol, threatening to kill himself"": Tcpt, p 65(15). In cross-examination, he accepted the following proposition (p 67(10)):

 

""In relation to your conversation with him, did he say to you anything along the lines of, that he's been told, other's have been telling him that he has sexually abused a 13 year-old girl?""

 

24On 12 October 2007 Detective Senior Constable Scott, then a member of the Ballina Joint Investigation Response Team (now called the Ballina child abuse squad), spoke with the applicant saying that she had information ""that he may have sexually or indecently assaulted a 12 year old girl"" and identified the complainant. Her evidence continued (Tcpt, 28/11/12, p 88(35)):

 

""Q. Did he respond in any way?

A. Yes he was quite emotional and was crying.

 

Q. Did you ask him at that stage if he wished to be interviewed by you?

A. Yes I did.

 

Q. Did you afford him the opportunity to seek legal advice and to make a phone call to get legal advice from a lawyer?

A. Yes.

 

Q. Is that what happened?

A. Yes that's what's happened and he -

 

Q. As a result of seeking legal advice, did Mr Jarrett indicate to you at that stage that he didn't wish to take part in an interview?

A. That's right.""

 

25At that point, the trial judge intervened to tell the jury that the applicant was entitled to exercise his right to silence and nothing could be held against him for exercising that ""absolute right"": Tcpt, p 89(5).

 

Directions - admissions at Richmond Clinic

26It is convenient to deal with the complaints concerning the trial broadly in the order in which they arose at the trial. The first concerned the manner in which the trial judge left to the jury the admissions made in October 2007, whilst the applicant was a patient at the Richmond Clinic. Immediately before the summing-up, counsel for the accused, in addressing the jury, emphasised that Mr Telford had no contemporaneous notes and accepted that the applicant was heavily medicated when he spoke to him. When he was not, some two years later, he denied the allegations. With respect to Dr Petroff, emphasis was placed on his acceptance that, despite the terms of his note, he was told by the applicant of an allegation against him, rather than the fact of the conduct alleged. With respect to Mr Casey, counsel focussed on the imprecision of the language of ""interference"" with a young girl: Tcpt, 29/11/12, p 29(45). He suggested that the jury ""would not be able to confidently place any weight on these so called admissions"": p 30(19).

 

27The trial judge, appropriately, dealt with the evidence quite briefly in his summing-up. It had been a short trial and the jury would no doubt have had a ready recollection of the evidence given over less than four full days. He noted the prosecution submission that the applicant had made admissions of sexual misconduct ""consistent with the allegations in the indictment although not expressly related to any particular count"": summing-up, p 9. He noted the defence case that the applicant had been on some medication, that Dr Petroff had described the applicant as ""mentally disordered"" and that anything he said whilst in the Richmond Clinic ""may be unreliable"": pp 9-10.

 

28No complaint was made then (or on appeal) as to the way in which the admissions were left to the jury. Rather, the challenge asserted the need for a further direction, albeit one not sought at trial. It was submitted that because none of the statements made to hospital staff identified the complainant, that matter was left to be inferred, the inference being described as ""circumstantial evidence"" requiring a warning as to the need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the fact to be inferred. The suggestion was that a direction should have been given that the jury must be satisfied that the applicant was referring to the complainant, as an ""intermediate fact"", as described by Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 at 581.

 

29In response to an invitation to identify the proposed direction, counsel for the applicant stated that it should have included a warning about drawing inferences where there was ""a reasonable possibility that the applicant was referring to someone else"": CCA Tcpt, 15/05/14, p 4(35).

 

30The forensic disadvantage in seeking such a direction is patent. Understandably, counsel for the defence did not raise any such issue with the jury. Had he considered seeking a direction in the terms now proffered, it is highly implausible that he would have sought it. Not only was such a direction unlikely to have assisted, the more fundamental problem of potential egregious prejudice was fatal to the suggestion. This is a paradigm case for the application of r 4: leave to rely upon ground 2 should be refused.

 

31The submissions as to ground 2 strayed into other territory. It noted that two of the witnesses had referred to possible sexual interference with a ""13 year old"" and, in one case, to an event which had occurred ""two months ago at his home"", whereas the event had occurred over three months earlier. The submissions also referred to the inconsistency between Dr Petroff's note of the applicant saying that the girl had rung him on the previous day and the complainant's evidence that he had rung her and that she had told him to leave her alone and said that she had ""told people"".

 

32Once the evidence from hospital staff was admitted, there were forensic difficulties for the defence in deciding how to deal with it. The discrepancies could be noted, but there must have been a risk in placing too much emphasis on them, given their nature.

 

Credit of complainant - delay in making complaint

33Ground 4 suggested error in failing to direct the jury that they could take into account in assessing the complainant's credibility the delay on her part in making a complaint. It was submitted that there was ample opportunity to complain, first to the person who came to the door in the course of the events, secondly to her friend (the applicant's daughter) that night and, thirdly, to her mother. Reliance was placed on the apparent discrepancy between the complaint eventually made to her sister and to two friends that she had been ""fingered"", although it was not her sister's evidence that she had used that word. The applicant submitted that there had been opportunity to speak to the police in October 2007, but she did not do so.

 

34Counsel for the applicant relied upon statements made by the High Court in Kilby v The Queen [1973] HCA 30; 129 CLR 460 at 465 (Barwick CJ) and in Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427. However, these decisions provided no assistance: the former involved the situation under the general law and the latter involved the application of a statutory provision in Victoria which the applicant claimed was ""similar to"" the relevant legislation in this State, whereas in fact there were significant differences.

 

35Quite apart from questions of discretion, the applicant had to bring himself within the terms of s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Act which states:

 

294 Warning to be given by Judge in relation to lack of complaint in certain sexual offence proceedings

 

(1) This section applies if, on the trial of a person for a prescribed sexual offence, evidence is given or a question is asked of a witness that tends to suggest:

 

(a) an absence of complaint in respect of the commission of the alleged offence by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, or

(b) delay by that person in making any such complaint.

 

(2) In circumstances to which this section applies, the Judge:

 

(a) must warn the jury that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false, and

(b) must inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault, and

(c) must not warn the jury that delay in complaining is relevant to the victim's credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to justify such a warning.

 

36The critical difference between the statutory provision as in force at the date of the applicant's trial and that in force when Crofts was determined, was the addition of s 294(2)(c) by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) Act 2006 (NSW).

 

37The present concern is not with any possible prejudice to the accused in responding to a delayed complaint, but the possibility that delay casts doubt on the credibility of the complainant. The common law assumed that it did, and that juries needed to be told that was the case. In more recent times, the underlying premise has been doubted, as has the failure to distinguish between adult and child victims and between alleged aggressors who were strangers, as opposed to close friends or relatives. In Suresh v The Queen [1998] HCA 23; 72 ALJR 769 at [5], Gaudron and Gummow JJ noted, referring to Gaudron J's explanation in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 515, that ""the assumption that the victim of a sexual offence will complain at the first reasonable opportunity is an assumption of doubtful validity, particularly in cases of child sexual assault."" In R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109, Howie J stated at [123] that ""there is in my view absolutely no justification for applying such a highly questionable view of the reasonable conduct of traumatised adult females to young children.""

 

38The introduction of paragraph (c) in s 294(2) significantly recasts the section. It must also be read as complemented by s 294AA which, in respect of relevant sexual offence proceedings, prohibits the judge warning a jury that ""complainants as a class are unreliable witnesses"" and in particular prohibits a warning to a jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant.

 

39There is no need to explore the history of the common law in dealing with ""delay"" on the part of a victim of sexual assault in complaining. The correct approach to the progressively amended statutory provisions is identified in the joint judgment of Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Commissioner of Stamps (South Australia) v Telegraph Investment Co Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 44; 184 CLR 453 at 463:

 

""The result is that both the Act which is amended and the amending Act are to be read together as a combined statement of the will of the legislature.  Thus the effect of the amending Act may be to alter the meaning which remaining provisions of the amended Act bore before the amendment.""

 

That approach was recently adopted with respect to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in Plaintiff S297-2013 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] HCA 24 at [25] where Crennan, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ stated:

 

""The numerous amendments that have been made to the Act form part of its legislative history and bear legitimately on its construction.  They are to be construed as part of the Act, so as to be read together 'as a combined statement of the will of the legislature'.  The timing of amendments might assist in determining the 'hierarchy' of apparently conflicting provisions of the Act as amended, but notions of 'implied repeal' have no place.""

 

40Bearing these considerations in mind, the operation of s 294(2) involves three elements. The first is that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not of itself indicate falsity of complaint, because there may be good reasons why the victim hesitated or refrained for a period. That element is inconsistent with the assumption of fact expressed by Barwick CJ in Kilby (at 469) that it is ""a strong, but not a conclusive, presumption against a woman that she made no complaint in a reasonable time after the fact"".

 

41Secondly, removing the presumption did not deny the possibility that in some cases absence of complaint within a reasonable time might cast doubt on the complainant's credibility. There is no presumption either, however, as to how particular facts will operate. The termination of a relationship (particularly one of dependency) may be seen to free the victim of a constraining force, or (especially if the termination was bitter) it may provide a motive for fabrication. These are pre-eminently matters to be left to the jury. Where the complainant has provided an explanation for delay or absence of complaint, the credibility of the explanation may itself be a significant matter to be considered by the jury.

 

42Thirdly, accepting that each case must be considered on the evidence, it is logical to conclude that the jury should be given appropriate assistance by the judge in explaining how delay may be relevant to the victim's credibility in the particular case. Nevertheless, a warning (which, in context, is of an adverse inference) is not to be given unless there is ""sufficient evidence to justify such a warning.""

 

43The imprecision in the language is appropriate for two reasons. First, and most obviously, both the circumstances and the nature of the warning will vary from case to case. This is not an area in which a standard form of warning is appropriate. Secondly, the requirement of ""sufficient evidence"" must not only mould the content of the warning, but it must also fit with the mandatory directions required by paragraphs (a) and (b). Without being prescriptive, there must be something in the evidence sufficient to raise in the judge's mind the possibility that the jury may legitimately consider that the delay could cast doubt on the credibility of the complaint. Usually, one would expect that such matters would have been put to the complainant in the course of cross-examination. Those very matters may constitute the ""good reasons"" why there was no timely complaint for the purposes of par (b), but, if not believed, may form the evidence justifying the warning under par (c).

 

44In the present case, the jury might well have dismissed the possibility of complaint to the person who came to the door in the course of the evening as not constituting a reasonable opportunity. There would also have been good reason to doubt that, assuming the complaint to be true, the victim would complain to the daughter of the offender, who was her best friend. It might be equally unlikely if the complaint were untrue. Different considerations would arise with respect to the victim's mother, but she gave evidence of a hostile relationship at the relevant time and of the unwillingness of the complainant to talk to her about anything. Again, if accepted, that would have provided good reason for the failure to complain to the mother. A further reason was given by the complainant herself in the course of her police interview, namely that she was scared to complain because ""he convinced me and make me believe if I told anyone he would kill himself"": ERISP Tcpt, Q404.

 

45The applicant submitted that the discrepancies between the content of the complaints and the evidence given by the complainant herself provided a basis for warning the jury in terms that might cast doubt on her credibility. Detective Scott was asked whether she had interviewed a school girlfriend of the complainant (who may be identified as A). She agreed that she had conducted a recorded interview on 11 February 2009. She also recorded an interview with a second young person (referred to below as R). In cross-examination, counsel for the defence led from Detective Scott details of what A and R had told her. With respect to A, all that she initially said was that the complainant had told her that the applicant ""took advantage of her"": Tcpt, 28/11/12, p 95(32). On being asked for details A stated that the complainant had said ""[t]hat he fingered her."" That evidence was consistent with the first recounting of the complaint to the complainant's sister, and may have cast doubt in the jury's mind on the sister's evidence that the complainant had not actually used the word ""fingered"".

 

46With respect to R, counsel for the defence put the following conversation to Detective Scott, which she accepted (Tcpt, pp 96-97, 99):

 

""Q. And what did she say to you?

A. She said she was laying down watching a movie.

 

Q. Mm?

A. And he, like he laid down and started hugging her and she thought it was normal and then he started like touching her and stuff and she got really uncomfortable but she like froze up and then he started to, like, finger her.

...

When he just tried like and then he put, he put himself on top of her and like tried to kiss her and stuff and then he's like ""I'm gonna get a condom"" and then he came like he came back with and said something like'

...

And then he like, then he kinda like, he was feeling her again and he started to have sex with her but she was like laying this way and he was laying next to her like from behind but like but not like up the arse and yeah and then he like finished and he was like hugging her and stuff.""

 

47Again, there was the reference to the applicant starting to ""finger her"" and the suggestion that he had intercourse ""from behind"". Each of those elements was relied on as inconsistent with the complainant's evidence.

 

48The trial judge gave a warning as required by s 294(2)(a) and (b). He also noted the disparate positions taken by the parties with respect to the inconsistencies. Noting that there was no full complaint to the authorities until January 2009, the trial judge also said that there had been complaints to three individuals, including the complainant's sister, the content of which were before the jury. He continued (summing up, p 9):

 

""The Crown basically say well it is broadly consistent, the defence say it is significantly inconsistent so it is up to you what you make of it but those are their respective positions and as you have only just been hearing about all that, I do not think I need to go into anymore about that.""

 

49On one view, it was open to the defence to contend that, by January 2009, when the complainant told her story to police, she had confused or added to the events of the evening in question. However, close attention to the supposed discrepancies might not have assisted the applicant. As noted above, the complainant's sister said that she had made an assumption about digital intercourse and the other complaints contained even less detail than the complaint to the sister. What might have cast doubt on the complainant's credibility was not the delay in complaining, but the inconsistencies between her complaints and her evidence. As to that, much was said in addresses and it was not the basis for a direction based on delay.

 

50As with the previous ground, no request for further directions having been made, the terms of the proposed direction required to be identified. The terms of the complaints having been elicited by counsel for the defence, there must have been a careful strategic assessment of how far the issue should be taken with the jury. The discrepancies between the evidence of those to whom complaints had been made and the evidence of the complainant no doubt favoured the defence; on the other hand, the fact of three complaints, two to her school friends and one to her older sister, may well have strengthened her credibility. A significant proportion of the cross-examination by counsel for the defence was directed to the content of her complaints to her school friends and her sister. Further, significant emphasis was placed on the discrepancies in the evidence by counsel in addressing the jury. He submitted that the complainant was dishonest: Tcpt, 29/11/12, p 23(50) and p 28(47). He expressly dealt with and dismissed the prosecution's categorisation of the inconsistencies as ""slight differences"": p 28(5). In such circumstances, counsel may or may not have perceived merit in having the trial judge give a balanced direction to the jury with respect to such material. There was a real risk that such a direction would weaken the defence case. In these circumstances, the absence of a request for a further direction is understandable. Leave should not be granted to allow the ground of appeal.

 

Delay - forensic disadvantage to defence

51In Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79 at 91, the joint judgment of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

 

""The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay ... and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury.  The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy.""

 

52The applicant contended that this was such a case, although the delay was not of the same order. However, the applicant accepted that, the prosecution having been commenced after 1 January 2009, the relevant law was to be found in s 165B of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That section reads:

 

165B Delay in prosecution

 

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding in which there is a jury.

 

(2) If the court, on application by a party, is satisfied that the defendant has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay, the court must inform the jury of the nature of that disadvantage and the need to take that disadvantage into account when considering the evidence.

 

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

 

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in informing the jury of the nature of the significant forensic disadvantage suffered and the need to take that disadvantage into account, but the judge must not in any way suggest to the jury that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict the defendant solely because of the delay or the forensic disadvantage suffered because of the consequences of the delay.

 

(5) The judge must not warn or inform the jury about any forensic disadvantage the defendant may have suffered because of delay except in accordance with this section, but this section does not affect any other power of the judge to give any warning to, or to inform, the jury.

 

(6) For the purposes of this section:

 

(a) delay includes delay between the alleged offence and its being reported, and

(b) significant forensic disadvantage is not to be regarded as being established by the mere existence of a delay.

 

(7) For the purposes of this section, the factors that may be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

(a) the fact that any potential witnesses have died or are not able to be located,

(b) the fact that any potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable.

 

53The effect of this provision is:

(a) to prohibit the judge from directing the jury ""about any forensic disadvantage the defendant may have suffered because of delay"" otherwise than in accordance with the section (subs (5));

(b) there is a duty to warn, but only where the judge is satisfied that the defendant has ""suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay"" (subs (2));

(c) the obligation to warn is subject to a rider where there are ""good reasons"" for not taking that step (subs (3));

(d) the judge is prohibited from suggesting that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict ""solely because of"" the delay or the disadvantage (subs (4));

(e) subject to the last prohibition, no particular form of words need be used (subs (4)).

 

54Consistently with this scheme, the judge must identify the significant forensic disadvantage and must inform the jury of the nature of that disadvantage; the direction will therefore need to be case specific. In directing the jury of the ""need"" to take that disadvantage into account, it will usually be expected that a direction would identify, so far as it is not obvious, how the disadvantage may affect the jury's consideration of the evidence. This aspect of any direction will not be straightforward: the usual consequence of delay is the loss of evidence or the loss of opportunity to test evidence; each involves a counterfactual assumption.

 

55Prior to the summing up, the trial judge outlined the general scope of the topics he proposed to cover. He specifically invited suggestion from counsel for the defence as to whether ""anything should be said about delay"": p 116(40). Counsel invited a direction on the basis that there had been ""significant forensic disadvantage"", namely, (1), ""had there been an immediate complaint the complainant may have been taken to the hospital and vaginal swabs and the like taken""; and (2) ""the accused has not been able to muster witnesses who would have matters fresh in their memory, because of the delay, the loss of time, memories fade ..."".

 

56The trial judge accepted the point about ""medical examination"" but sought detail as to evidence of loss of memory. In response, defence counsel noted that he had spoken to the applicant's daughter who was unable to pinpoint the precise evening and say whether the complainant had slept with her that night: p 117(40). On being pressed for other examples of disadvantage, counsel was unable to provide any and agreed that ""that's as high as it goes"": p 119(25). The trial judge indicated that he would be happy to assume that the daughter's position might have been different if the complainant ""had gone to the police the next day"" (p 119(45)-(50)) but declined to give a direction on the basis that, in the absence of any evidence, there was nothing specific to direct the jury about. Further, while accepting that the applicant had not been told of the precise charges or indeed any detail about the complaint, he had been on notice from October 2007 of allegations by the complainant of sexual assault, which were sufficiently distressing to cause him to be admitted for several days to the Richmond Clinic at Lismore. Subject to the debate about who initiated the phone call, he does not seem to have been in doubt that the complainant was directly threatening to go to the police in October 2007.

 

57The trial judge did point out to the jury, in a neutral fashion (described by counsel for the applicant as ""insipid"") that there was ""no relevant medical evidence"" because there had been no contemporaneous complaint, but did not identify that as a significant forensic disadvantage to the applicant.

 

58With respect to the inability of the applicant's daughter to identify the night in question, the written submissions for the applicant stated that the judge said ""he would not give such a direction because police had spoken to the appellant in October 2007."" It is correct that the judge put that in the course of argument to counsel for the applicant, but the reason he gave for not giving a direction was that ""at the very least it seems to me that there'd have to [be] some evidence about that"": pp 119-120. Counsel did not seek to call evidence, being content to rely on his statement that he had had a conference with the daughter (apparently shortly before the trial) and that she had no recollection of the events of the evening in question.

 

59To assess the challenge to the trial judge's refusal to give the proposed form of direction, it is desirable to identify how the question should be approached. However, the operation of s 165B should not become encrusted with judicial exegesis of the kind surrounding the ""Longman direction"", which led to its enactment. Suffice it to say, there are a number of broad considerations which bear upon its application in the present case.

 

60First, the proper focus of the section is on the disadvantage to the accused; it does not reflect any degree of prejudgment of the reliability of a complainant's evidence with respect to a sexual offence, aspects of which underlay certain observations in Longman: see Spigelman CJ in JJB v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 126; 161 A Crim R 187 at [4]-[8].

 

61Secondly, the concept of delay is relative and judgmental. Where both complainant and law enforcement authorities have acted with all reasonable expedition, it is not usually apt to describe any lapse of time as involving ""delay"". Delay is suggestive of hesitation or indecision of the complainant or inefficiency on the part of authorities. That is not to say it involves blameworthy conduct: quite significant lapses of time may be reasonable in the context of a child who is the victim of sexual assault. Whether that which is not unreasonable constitutes ""delay"" for the purposes of s 165B will depend upon particular circumstances.

 

62Thirdly, although various factors may contribute to a delay, where a significant element is misconduct on the part of the accused, any resultant forensic disadvantage may not be characterised as a consequence of delay or, in the alternative, may provide a good reason for a judge not to give a direction, pursuant to the permissible exception in s 165B(3). In the present case, the complainant alleged that the applicant had said to her, ""this is our little secret and if you tell anyone I'll kill myself"": ERISP Tcpt, Q47. It is doubtful whether such a manipulative threat of self-harm, made by the father of a 12 year old girl's best friend, is any less deplorable than a threat of harm to the victim. If the trial judge had been satisfied that such a threat had been made (and it appeared to be corroborated by the documented circumstances of the applicant's admission to Richmond Clinic when he understood a charge might be laid against him, he then being suicidal) that would have provided a good reason not to treat the direction as required or, if the power were engaged, a good reason for not exercising it.

 

63Fourthly, if the accused is put on notice of the complaint, any failure to make inquiry or investigation thereafter will not normally constitute a consequence of the delay, but a consequence of the accused's own inaction. The applicant complained that the trial judge took that into account, but he was wrong to do so. However, the circumstances of his admission to the Richmond Clinic in October 2007 were inconsistent with the position of a person told of a potential allegation for the first time or even after warning, where he knew the complaint was utterly false. If he had wanted further details from the complainant as to the time and place where the offence was said to have been committed, there was no evidence that such information would not have been provided, even if she declined to be interviewed. (At that time it seems the police knew few details.) Further, since he feared gaol, it would not have been unreasonable for him to seek legal advice at that time, as he did in March 2009, when the police had a basis to charge him. However, there was also no basis in the evidence for inferring that, if told of the general nature of the charge, he would have made inquiries at that time of his daughter.

 

64In short, the assertion that the trial judge should have been satisfied that the applicant had suffered a significant forensic disadvantage as a consequence of delay, has not been made good. Even if it had been, there were good reasons why the trial judge would not have erred in declining to give a direction in the terms sought.

 

65The operation of the relatively novel provision in s 165B warrants a grant of leave to appeal on this ground, pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Nevertheless, an appeal based on that ground must be dismissed.

 

Jury access to complainant's evidence

66Ground 1 asserted that the trial miscarried because the judge allowed the jury to have access to the video of the complainant's evidence (constituting her evidence in chief) in the jury room. That course was said to be inconsistent with the approach required by R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; 63 NSWLR 628. The ""balance of evidence"" was disturbed in circumstances where the other evidence was available only in a paper transcript.

 

67The error was compounded, the applicant submitted, by the failure to give the jury a warning at the time access was provided, pursuant to s 306X of the Criminal Procedure Act. That section states:

 

306X Warning to jury

 

If a vulnerable person gives evidence of a previous representation wholly or partly in the form of a recording made by an investigating official in accordance with this Division in any proceedings in which there is a jury, the judge must warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the evidence being given in that way.

 

68Those two steps in combination were said to result in a miscarriage, in accordance with the reasoning of this Court in Galvin v R [2006] NSWCCA 66; 161 A Crim R 449 at [63]-[64] (Howie J).

 

69The written submissions for the Director responded in the following terms:

(a) no objection was taken to the course adopted at trial, nor was a further direction sought; accordingly leave was required pursuant to r 4;

(b) the jury had in fact been warned on an earlier occasion in compliance with s 306X;

(c) when seeking access to the video, the jury also requested the transcripts of the complainant's evidence and that of Detective Scott, which incorporated the evidence of complaints made by the complainant to A and R, the likely purpose being to allow the jury to compare the alleged inconsistencies between the complaints and the complainant's evidence in chief and her cross-examination;

(d) the procedures set down in NZ were not mandatory; the jury was not merely given the video, but the entirety of the complainant's evidence in transcript; NZ did not prescribe a necessary consequence of a failure to give a warning at that stage; and

(e) any question of imbalance or unfairness is more likely to arise where an accused has given evidence, so that the jury has before it in visual form the evidence of the complainant, but not the contradicting evidence. The applicant did not give evidence; nor was there other evidence significantly contradicting the complainant.

 

70At the outset of the oral argument, counsel for the applicant indicated that, having read the Director's submissions, he no longer pressed ground 1. On being questioned by the Court, he indicated that he would withdraw the ground in so far as it relied upon NZ, and based the argument upon the application of s 306X. The issue having been raised, however, it was appropriate for this Court to satisfy itself that there was no proper basis for granting leave under r 4.

 

71The principal judgment in NZ was given by Howie and Johnson JJ, Wood CJ at CL and Hunt AJA agreeing. (Spigelman CJ dissented on the basis that allowing the video tape evidence to go to the jury in the jury room gave rise to a relevant imbalance and led to a miscarriage of justice.)

 

72After a comprehensive review of the authorities in many English-speaking jurisdictions, the joint reasons stated that ""to preserve the balance and the fairness of the trial, the videotape should not as a matter of course be sent to the jury room after the jury retires to consider its verdict"": at [196]. Howie and Johnson JJ further opined that ""the judge should give a warning to the jury as to the caution with which they are to approach the replaying of the videotape of the evidence in chief of a witness ... [B]ecause they are hearing the evidence ... repeated for a second time and well after all the evidence, they should guard against giving it disproportionate weight simply for that reason and should bear well in mind the other evidence in the case"": at [208].

 

73Nevertheless, the joint reasons made it clear that the Court ""should not lay down any rule of practice or procedure to be followed in every case where the evidence in chief of a witness has been given by the playing of a videotape"": at [210]. Howie and Johnson JJ declined to adopt any inflexible position with respect to circumstances where a judge might allow the jury to have the tape replayed without any warning or reminder of cross-examination: at [211]-[212].

 

74As already noted, the applicant's trial was relatively short and the evidence fell within two tranches. The first, being the evidence of the complainant and the second being the evidence of the hospital staff. The primary challenge to the complainant's evidence in cross-examination arose from the evidence of complaint tendered through Detective Senior Constable Scott. This material fell within a reasonably narrow compass. The only evidence called for the defence was that of the applicant's sister who, relevantly with respect to the complainant's evidence, spoke of two issues. The first was that, at the applicant's request, she had explained to his children (including the complainant's friend) that the applicant had had a vasectomy and could not have any more babies. This formed the basis for a suggestion that the complainant may have known that fact otherwise than because the applicant said she would not get pregnant when he ejaculated inside her. The second aspect of the evidence was that the applicant complained to his sister of impotency problems frequently in 2006. That evidence was relied on to cast doubt upon the claim that he had managed penile intercourse with the complainant.

 

75As ground 1 was eventually argued, the focus was the failure to give a second warning pursuant to s 306X at the time the jury was provided with the video evidence. However, the warning having been given early in the trial, there was no realistic likelihood that the jury would draw an inference ""adverse to the accused"" because of the way the evidence was given: that had been adequately explained. The rest of the warning required by the section, namely that the evidence not be given ""any greater or lesser weight"" because of the way it was given would not in terms have addressed the question of balance. That issue was, however, expressly addressed by providing the whole of the transcript of the complainant's evidence and the transcript of Detective Scott's evidence. The jury were reminded to check anything they heard against the transcript in the event that there was any issue in their minds about any passage in the tape: Tcpt, summing up, 29/11/12, pp 23-24.

 

76In the circumstances, counsel was correct to accept that ground 1 did not warrant a grant of leave in circumstances where the procedure had been accepted by counsel for the defence at trial and no further direction had been sought.

 

Challenge to sentence

77The notice of appeal identified error with respect to the sentencing of the applicant as a failure to take into account ""the mental condition of the applicant that prevailed at the time of the offence"": ground 5. In the course of the hearing, the temporal limitation was removed. The mental state of the applicant at the time of the offending might be relied upon to reduce the importance of general deterrence in fixing a sentence; the continuing mental state of the applicant might demonstrate that the term of imprisonment would constitute more severe punishment for him than for a mentally robust offender.

 

78Relying upon the reasoning of Sperling J in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, the applicant submitted that mental health considerations could result in (a) moderating the importance of general deterrence; (b) reducing the level of moral culpability and (c) increasing the hardship of incarceration.

 

79Viewing the matter generally, reference was made during the sentencing hearing to the significant evidence of a psychiatric history involving treatment for depression since 2003 and admission to the Richmond Clinic following the death of the applicant's mother in 2006, after an attempted suicide.

 

80Counsel recognised that, in the judgment on sentence, there was reference to ""significant issues impacting upon the offender which will make time in custody somewhat harder than for persons not having those problems"", which was identified as a basis for a finding of special circumstances, relevant to the relationship between the non-parole period and the total sentence. Since that factor was taken into account, appropriately, the challenge focused on the question of reduced moral culpability and the reduced significance of general deterrence.

 

81This submission should be rejected for two reasons. First, the sentence was imposed, and reasons given, immediately following the hearing on 31 January 2013. The trial judge made several appreciative references in his reasons to the submissions of counsel for the applicant. In the course of the hearing, counsel tendered a medical report containing a psychiatric assessment by a Dr Pearson, which pre-dated the trial. The transcript records that the judge read the report when it was tendered: Tcpt, 31/01/13, p 8(30). Counsel then noted that the offences were ""clearly serious"" and called for a period of imprisonment ""that reflects the need for general deterrence for these matters"" and stated that he did not propose to make submissions in relation to those issues: p 8(32)-(35). Nevertheless, he identified the circumstances giving rise to the applicant's depression and mental health difficulties by reference to matters set out by Dr Pearson and in the recent pre-sentence report dated 22 January 2013. Accepting that the applicant ""knew the nature and quality of his conduct"" he nevertheless submitted that there can be ""some level of general deterrence moderation for this matter"": p 10(19). He submitted, further, that ""because of the defendant's mental illnesses that the time that he spends in custody will be exacerbated"": p 10(22).

 

82Given that the sentences were imposed immediately following submissions by the parties, and given the submissions made as to the relevance of the mental health issues, there is no reason in principle to suppose that the submissions were not properly considered, because not expressly addressed in the reasons.

 

83The second reason for rejecting the submission relates to an alternative basis for identifying that proper weight may not have been given to a specific mitigating factor, namely that the sentences actually imposed were outside an appropriate range. That was not the case with respect to the applicant. Counsel's submissions at the sentencing hearing addressed the JIRS statistics provided for the relevant offences. His submissions involved three elements: first, that the objective seriousness of the offending was below the mid-range. Secondly, that the middle or median terms for the more serious offences ""appear to be periods of imprisonment of between five and six years in the non-parole and a period of nine to ten years in the head terms"": p 11(3). Thirdly, he submitted that total concurrency was appropriate. Taking these matters into account, he submitted that an appropriate total sentence period would involve ""a non parole of five to six years with head sentences somewhere in the vicinity of eight to ten years"": p 11(20).

 

84Neither party paid particular attention to the range for the lesser offences, (nor were they the focus of submissions on the appeal). At the sentencing counsel for the applicant sought to characterise them as ""preparatory"" and warranting ""substantial if not total concurrency"". To a large extent the prosecution's submissions supported the approach adopted on behalf of the applicant.

 

85In the result, the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period and balance of term precisely in line with the bottom of the range proposed by counsel for the applicant. All sentences were wholly concurrent. The proper conclusion is that the sentencing judge gave careful attention to the submissions of counsel for the applicant. Even had that not been the case, there was no basis for this Court to be satisfied that a less severe sentence was warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(3). The absence of merit in the application requires that leave to appeal against sentence be refused.

 

86There is one further issue with respect to the sentences. Although the Director submitted that no error had been demonstrated by the challenge raised by the applicant, he noted that there was an error with respect to the imposition of fixed terms for the two lesser offences. Each involved an offence of aggravated indecent assault (dealt with at the sentencing hearing as arising under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act) and carried a standard non-parole period of five years. Because the sentences were to be wholly absorbed within the non-parole periods for the more serious offences, it was practical to set fixed terms and, indeed, the prosecutor invited the sentencing judge to do that. However, to take that step is to decline to set a non-parole period, a power which is available under s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), but not in respect of offences subject to a standard non-parole period. The Director further contended that the judge had erred in failing to give reasons for not fixing a non-parole period, contrary to the obligation in s 45(2). With respect to the latter complaint, the failure does not invalidate the sentence: s 45(4). The problem arising from the lack of power to decline to specify a non-parole period cannot be so simply disposed of.

 

87This problem and the authorities addressing it were thoroughly reviewed by R A Hulme J in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213; it has continued to arise in subsequent cases.

 

88The difficulty was addressed by Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed) in Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 (the appellant is referred to in the media neutral citation as Hristovksi). After noting that the problem was not so acute where another error had been identified warranting intervention by the court, Johnson J stated that ""in the absence of a ground of appeal which is upheld by this Court, no basis exists to intervene and impose a fresh sentence on these counts"": at [65]. He concluded that although the sentences were ""contrary to the terms of the statute, the error ought not be treated as one affecting the validity of the sentence"". Johnson J also noted that such an error may be corrected under s 43, which could allow the sentencing court to reopen the proceedings on its own initiative.

 

89In the present case both of the fixed terms sentences have now expired (the longer sentence having been served by 29 May 2014) and there is no practical purpose in taking any further step with regard to those sentences.

 

Orders of the Court

90The Court should make the following orders:

 

(1) With respect to the appeal against conviction, grant leave to appeal with respect to ground 3, but dismiss the appeal.

 

(2) Otherwise refuse leave to rely upon grounds 1, 2 and 4 pursuant to Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.

 

(3) Refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

 

91R A HULME J: I agree with Basten JA.

 

92CAMPBELL J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft. Subject to two matters, I agree with his Honour's reasons.

 

93The first matter concerns Ground 1 which his Honour deals with at [66] - [76]. Since NZ was decided, the High Court of Australia has dealt with jury access to pre-recorded evidence of a complainant in a trial for sexual offences in Gately v The Queen [2007] HCA 55; 232 CLR 208, an appeal from Queensland. The statutory provisions are not entirely the same, but what the Justices said about jury use of pre-recorded evidence depends upon ""fundamental characteristics of Australian trial processes, particularly for the criminal trial"" rather than on the precise content of the particular legislative scheme in question (at 235 [88] per Hayne J). The approach adopted by the High Court in that case is, in my judgment, somewhat more prescriptive than the approach adopted by this Court in NZ.  As Basten JA has demonstrated at [71] - [73], the approach of Howie and Johnson JJ, agreed to by the other members of a five-judge bench, was that the Court ""should not lay down any rule of practice or procedure"".

 

94In Gately Hayne J said (with the agreement of Gleeson CJ and Heydon J) (at [94] - [96]) that for reasons of the preservation of fairness and balance it would ""[s]eldom ... be appropriate to meet a request [that the jury be reminded of the evidence] by giving the jury unrestrained access to the recording to play and replay"". Such a request ""should ordinarily be met by replaying the evidence in Court in the presence of the trial judge, counsel and the accused"". And it may be necessary to remind the jury ""of countervailing evidence or considerations relied upon by accused"". His Honour concluded:

 

Seldom, if ever, will it be appropriate to allow the jury unsupervised access to the record of that evidence.

 

With respect, this approach now ought to be the practice adopted in New South Wales.

 

95This conclusion involves a decision that allowing the jury unsupervised access to the video of the complainant's evidence was an irregularity. I acknowledge that counsel for the applicant withdrew Ground 1 so far as it relied upon giving the jury unsupervised access to the DVD of the complainant's evidence. Notwithstanding what I regard as an irregularity, for the reasons expressed by Basten JA at [74] - [76], I am of the view that no miscarriage - let alone a substantial miscarriage - of justice has actually occurred.

 

96The second matter concerns the sentence appeal. With respect, I agree entirely with what Basten JA has written. However, notwithstanding the extempore nature of the learned judge's reasons for sentence, obviously it would have been better if the relevance of the mental health issues as perceived by his Honour had been spelt out even briefly in his reasons. In the end, the reasons expressed, and only those, are taken to disclose the whole of the reasoning process that led to the decision. However, for the reasons given Basten JA, I am not satisfied that a less severe sentence is warranted in law.

 

97I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.

2764447,R v MM [2014] NSWCCA 144,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  This appeal is brought by the Crown under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  Section 5F applies to, amongst other proceedings, proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the District Court.  Under s 5F(3A), the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to this Court against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case.  The present appeal concerns the admissibility of evidence sought to be tendered by the Crown in the prosecution of the respondent for offences under s 61D and s 78A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), as they existed at the relevant time.  The Crown sought to rely on the evidence as tendency evidence and as context evidence as well as constituting general admissions.  
2It is common ground that the rejection of the evidence would substantially weaken the prosecution case against the respondent. 
Background
3On 10 August 2011, the respondent was charged with one count of carnal knowledge of a child in 1973 or 1974, in contravention of s 71 of the Crimes Act.  The child was the respondent's sister.  She was aged between 10 and 11 at the time of that offence.  The respondent was aged 17 or 18.  The respondent pleaded guilty to that offence in the Local Court on 11 May 2012.  
4The respondent was also charged with one count of sexual intercourse without consent, in contravention of s 61D of the Crimes Act, and with an alternative count of incest, in contravention of s 78A of the Crimes Act.  At the time of that alleged offending (between September and December 1981), the complainant was aged either 18 or 19, her birthday being in October.  
5Section 61D of the Crimes Act provided that a person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to penal servitude, the maximum term of imprisonment varying according to whether the other person is under the age of 16 years.  Under s 78A of the Crimes Act, so far as this case is concerned, a male who has carnal knowledge of his sister was liable to penal servitude for seven years.  
6The respondent was arraigned on 7 April 2014 in the District Court in respect of both offences and entered pleas of not guilty.  
7On 2 April 2014, the Director of Public Prosecutions gave notice to the respondent's solicitors that the prosecution intended to adduce evidence of tendency pursuant to s 97(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) in proof of both charges (the Tendency Notice).  The Tendency Notice stated that the respondent was the person whose tendency was the subject of the evidence intended to be adduced and that the tendency sought to be proved was the respondent's tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely a sexual interest in the complainant, and to act in a particular way, namely to have sexual intercourse with her.  
8On 7 April 2014, the respondent was arraigned before Neilson DCJ and entered pleas of not guilty to both charges.  On the application of the Crown, his Honour was asked to determine the admissibility of the evidence identified in the Tendency Notice, and other evidence going to proof of the respondent's continued sexual interest in and sexual misconduct towards the complainant before the case was opened to the jury.  He rejected the tender of the evidence in its entirety.  
9The Crown appeals from that ruling, under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
10In the Crown's amended notice of appeal, which was filed in Court at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal without objection, the following grounds, as understood in the context of the submissions filed by the parties, are relied on:His Honour erred in finding that evidence of the respondent's sexual mistreatment of the complainant other than on the occasion charged on the indictment was not admissible as context evidence because it made no relevant contribution to the context of the events charged as Counts 1 and 2 on the indictment.His Honour erred in excluding the evidence as tendency evidence.His Honour erred in excluding evidence of the respondent's admissions to carnal knowledge of the complainant.His Honour erred in excluding the respondent's general admissions in a lawfully intercepted telephone communication and his ERISP.
11The Crown seeks orders vacating the rulings made on 8 April 2014 and orders that:The evidence of the complainant of any sexual acts that did not relate to a count on the indictment is admissible as context evidence.The tendency evidence sought to be led is admissible.The respondent's plea of guilty to the offence under s 71 is admissible as an admission that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was aged 10.The respondent's general admissions in a recorded telephone conversation with the complainant of 25 July 2011 and his interview of 9 August 2011 are admissible.
The Evidence Sought to be Tendered by the Crown
12The Tendency Notice identified the tendency evidence intended to be adduced by the Crown as consisting of the following:Parts of four statements made by the complainant to police in early January 2011, detailing sexual activity between the respondent and the complainant during the period from 1973 to 1976.Transcript of a lawfully intercepted telephone conversation between the complainant and the respondent on 25 July 2011, during which the respondent admitted to having had unwanted sexual contact with her when she was ""a kid"", to ""get his rocks off"".A statement dated 25 November 2011 by a woman who had at relevant times been living with the respondent as his partner in which she reports that he had told her that there had been ""incest between him and [the complainant]"" but that he did not rape her.Transcript of an electronically recorded interview of the respondent on 9 August 2011, in which he made various admissions when the police informed him that the complainant alleged that he had sexually assaulted her from 1973 through to 1980.  The respondent said that he was exposed to magazines with a sexual content and that ""everything was about sex at the time.  It was the 60s and 70s"".  The respondent said that he regretted having made ""sexual advances"" to the complainant.  The respondent agreed that he had had penile vaginal intercourse with the complainant and digitally penetrated her.  He said that he did not know when that had occurred or how many times it had occurred.  He agreed that the complainant was somewhere between 11 and 13 at the time.Evidence that the respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offence under s 71.
13In the event that the evidence was not admitted as tendency evidence, the Crown sought its admission as context evidence.  The Crown also submitted that certain aspects of the evidence constituted general admissions, not of the offences charged, but in respect of earlier sexual activity between the complainant and the respondent.  That was not pressed by the Crown on the hearing of the appeal and it is therefore unnecessary to deal with the admission of the evidence on that basis. 
14We are satisfied that the evidence was admissible as both tendency evidence and context evidence.  In order to make clear the reasons for so finding, it is necessary to describe in a summary way the evidence that it was anticipated the complainant would give as outlined in her four statements.  
The Complainant's Evidence in Summary
15During 1971, the complainant moved with her family to a house on the outskirts of Sydney, where she lived until 1983.  When she was aged 8 or 9 and the respondent was aged 15, he would pinch her nipple through her clothes while they were swimming in the family swimming pool.  When the complainant was aged 10 or 11 in 1973 or 1974, the respondent, who was then aged 17 or 18, would drive her to dance classes at which time he began putting his hand on her crotch, which later progressed to digital penetration of her vagina.  On occasions the respondent would stop the car and rub his penis on the complainant's vagina.  The complainant cried and asked him to stop.  She said that that occurred five or six times and on those occasions the respondent would ejaculate into a tissue.
16The respondent also penetrated the complainant's vagina with his penis in the car for one to three minutes and the respondent would ejaculate into a tissue.  The complainant told the respondent to stop.  One of those occasions was the subject of the charge under s 71 to which the respondent pleaded guilty.
17In March 1975, the older brother of the complainant and the respondent was killed in a car accident.  The complainant commenced high school at the beginning of 1975.  On occasions when the respondent would drive her to school, he would pull over and attempt to have intercourse with her.  The complainant took to wearing jeans under her school uniform and would tell the respondent that she had her period to deter him from assaulting her.  On those occasions, the respondent would try to make the complainant masturbate him or touch him by grabbing her by the wrist and moving her hand towards his crotch.  
18Towards the middle of 1975, the complainant told the respondent that she was going to tell their parents what he had been doing to her.  He persuaded her not to because it would mean that their parents would lose another son.  The complainant said that she loved her parents deeply and did not want them to suffer, so she did not tell them about the respondent's conduct towards her.
19In 1976, after she had turned 14, the complainant began a relationship and convinced her parents to let her boyfriend move in with the family.  She said that she did so as an ""effective way"" of keeping the respondent away from her.  The sexual and indecent assaults ceased for a time.
20Also in 1976, the respondent moved out of the family home to live with his girlfriend.  However, they moved back to the family home in 1977, where they lived until 1978, when they separated.  At about that time the complainant's then boyfriend also moved out, with the result that the complainant and the respondent again shared the family home with their parents. 
21In about 1979, the respondent began driving the complainant to her TAFE course, which she attended two evenings a week.  The respondent took her on his motorcycle and would put his hand on her knee while they drove.  The complainant would then ""smack or punch his hand hard"".  The respondent would also drive the complainant to the city on weekends.  On those occasions, he would also try to sexually touch the complainant but she resisted.  
22At some time in 1979, the respondent moved away from the family home with a woman with whom he had a child the following year.  (It was to this woman that the respondent later admitted ""incest"" with the complainant.)  Also in 1979, the complainant started a relationship with another man who moved into the family home.  In December 1980, the complainant gave birth to her first child.  In mid-1981, that relationship broke up and the father of the child moved out.  At about that time, the respondent and his partner built a house on a vacant block of land adjacent to the family home, in which they resided.  
23At that time, the respondent was working as a carpenter.  Between September and December 1981, he would regularly come into the complainant's bedroom at about 5.00 am before he started work.  The complainant would often wake to find the respondent in bed with her.  She objected and told him to get out.  However, she did not scream or shout, because she did not want to upset her parents and did not want them to separate.  The complainant says that penile vaginal intercourse occurred four or five times and on these occasions the respondent would ejaculate into a tissue.  
24The complainant said that she began locking the doors and windows of the house to prevent the respondent coming in, but her mother left the laundry door unlocked at night so that the respondent could come in to have his breakfast without waking his partner and his children.  The complainant then put a lock on her bedroom door to prevent the respondent from getting into her bedroom.
25In 1981, the complainant's parents left the family home and moved to northern New South Wales, leaving the complainant in the family home with her child.  At night she would lock the windows and doors and have her child sleep with her to deter the respondent.  When the respondent would knock on her window, she would shout at him to go away.  There was no other episode of sexual offending alleged after that time. 
The Evidence as Context Evidence
26For reasons that are not clear, his Honour first considered the admissibility of the evidence as context evidence.  He referred to the authorities dealing with the admission of relationship or context evidence, including, in particular, DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 106 where this Court emphasised that in order to determine the probative value of evidence tendered for that purpose, it is necessary to consider whether other evidence in the trial, and the issues to which that evidence gives rise, makes it relevant to prove the ""true context"" in which the alleged offending occurred including, where a sexual assault is alleged, a lack of immediate complaint or resistance.  
27After noting that the complainant in this case could explain her lack of complaint when the respondent sexually assaulted her in 1981 and her lack of resistance on those occasions by her fear of family breakdown, the primary judge concluded that the evidence made ""no relevant contribution to the context of the event charged in the indictment"".  No other reasoning was given for rejecting the evidence as context evidence.  That approach both failed to address the interrelated bases upon which the Crown contended that the evidence was relevant and failed entirely to appreciate its significance to the issues likely to be raised at trial, including the complainant's credibility.
28Evidence of the relationship between a complainant and an accused, including evidence of other uncharged sexual acts, may be admitted to place charged offences in context and, in that way, to assist jurors to understand a complainant's evidence where it might otherwise seem difficult to comprehend.  It also may be admitted to explain what might otherwise seem to a jury to be an inexplicable, or fanciful, or single isolated incident.  The probative value of context evidence may be substantial if, without it, the jury would be left with an unrealistic and entirely misleading picture of an apparently isolated assault (KJS v R [2014] NSWCCA 27 at [38]).
29If a complainant is not permitted to place in a meaningful context the incidents about which complaint is made, and where s/he expresses no surprise or protest, or makes no immediate complaint when sexually or indecently assaulted, that conduct may be more understandable if the assaults are a common occurrence or the continuation and culmination of a consistent course of conduct over a period of years (see, eg, HML v R [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334 at [2]-[11]; KJS at [32]-[41]).
30In addition, the evidence might provide some explanation for the failure of a complainant to make immediate complaint.  Without evidence of what in some cases is a slow process of habituating a complainant to unwanted sexual activity, the jury might well find it incredible that after an assault constituted by non-consensual sexual intercourse, no complaint is made (KJS at [32]-[34]).  
31Where evidence is not tendered as tendency evidence but is limited to providing the context in which the offending is said to have occurred (not, as it happens, in this case where the same evidence is tendered as tendency evidence), it is necessary to consider whether any issue has been raised, or is likely to be raised in the trial that makes the evidence relevant.  This is necessary both to determine its admissibility and to enable an informed assessment of its probative value and any potential unfair prejudice under s 137 of the Evidence Act (DJV at [36]).  Where there is a grave risk of the jury reasoning from context evidence to guilt of the accused in relation to the offences charged despite judicial direction that such reasoning is impermissible, s 137 of the Evidence Act may be invoked and the tender of the evidence rejected (DJV at [37]).
32In this case, the evidence, when tendered as context evidence, was said to be relevant to the following issues that were likely to be raised in the respondent's trial:Lack of surprise on the part of the complainant when she found the respondent in her bedroom in 1981.Lack of resistance to the sexual intercourse that followed.The reasons for the complainant's lack of immediate complaint.The possibility that the jury might gain the false impression that the sexual assault occurred ""out of the blue"".The complainant's evidence about her lack of consent and the respondent's knowledge of her lack of consent.
33His Honour either did not consider these issues at all or gave inadequate consideration to them.  On that basis alone, the error contended for by the Crown in his Honour's rejection of the evidence as context evidence is made out.   
The Evidence as Tendency Evidence
34His Honour then considered the admissibility of the evidence as tendency evidence.  He noted that the tendency alleged was a tendency of the respondent to have a sexual interest in the complainant and to behave in a particular way with her, namely, to have sexual intercourse with her.  His Honour accepted that the complainant's evidence of the penetrative sexual assaults she had been subjected to as a child and young adolescent established that tendency and that the respondent had the state of mind attributed to him.  He was also satisfied that the evidence had significant probative value.  Thus, the primary judge was purporting to apply s 97(1)(b) of the Evidence Act.  That section provides that evidence of a tendency that a person has or had is not admissible to prove that the person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, unless the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
35His Honour then considered s 101(2) of the Evidence Act, which operates as a further precondition to admissibility by providing, in this case, that tendency evidence about the respondent cannot be used against him unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on him.  
36His Honour expressed the view that if the evidence were admitted, the jury would be led to concentrate on the respondent's past sexual misconduct towards the complainant, rather than the facts in issue in the trial, which we take to mean, so far as concerned the s 61D offence, whether sexual intercourse occurred and, if it did, whether it was consensual and, so far as concerns the s 78 offence, whether the respondent had sexual intercourse with the complainant, consent being no defence to that charge. 
37His Honour then observed that this trial was:
""...one of those cases where no matter how carefully or strongly one crafted directions there is always a possibility that at least one juror would not adhere to those directions and would be mesmerised by the extent of the accused's past offending conduct"".  
38His Honour appears to have considered that the prejudice attaching to the admission of the evidence existed because of the possibility that a juror may disregard the directions on the limited use to which the tendency evidence could be put in considering whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the respondent.  His Honour provided no explanation as to what cases he was referring to and why it was that this case was one such case and why, in his view, sufficiently clear and emphatic directions would not address the risk of a juror refusing to abide by judicial direction.
39His Honour then identified certain facts that he considered attenuated the significance of the probative value of the evidence:In the period from 1975/76 to 1981, the complainant went from being 13 or 14 years old to being 19 years old.During that period, the complainant had two sexual relationships with young men and had a child.The complainant and the respondent were becoming increasingly mature.What his Honour described as a ""vast difference"" between conduct when the respondent was aged between 17 and 20, and conduct when he was aged 26.  
40His Honour gave no reasoned explanation, or any proper analysis, as to why these facts, either in isolation or combination, diminished the probative value of the evidence that he had earlier held to be significant under s 97.  
41He also said that the gap between 1975/1976 and 1981 and the fact that there was little sexual activity, and no sexual intercourse, between the respondent and the complainant during that period, ""must be borne in mind"".  He provided no explanation as to why this was relevant to an assessment of the probative value of the evidence or why, in the circumstances of this case, the temporal gap was not adequately explained by the fact that the complainant was at that time in a relationship and a young mother and that the respondent had his own sexual partners.  
42His Honour concluded that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by its probative value under s 101(2), and rejected the tender of the evidence as tendency evidence. 
43The prejudicial effect to which s 101(2) is directed must be understood as substantially the same as that to be considered under s 137 (Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [47]).  It is not sufficient that the evidence is harmful to the interests of a defendant because it tends to establish the Crown case.  That will be inevitable.  Rather, the prejudice must be the risk of harm to the interests of the accused in a way that is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way, such as provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves (R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451 at [56]; R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182 at [116]).    
44In our view, the tendency evidence was highly probative, being critical to a jury's understanding of the events in 1981 of which the charges on the indictment are representative.  Without evidence that the respondent had sexually assaulted the complainant since she was a young child, interrupted only in her late adolescence when they had other sexual partners living in the same house, it would inevitably appear surprising to a jury that the respondent would, in effect ""out of the blue"", enter his sister's bedroom and attempt to have intercourse with her while she was asleep.  In the same way, the complainant's apparent lack of surprise at his conduct would likely be a significant issue in the jury's assessment of the complainant's evidence which, without evidence of his persistent sexual mistreatment of her over many years, would invite an uninformed assessment of her credibility.   
45The complainant's consistent attempts to resist the respondent's sexual mistreatment of her since she was a child and continuing into her adolescence was clearly relevant to the jury's assessment of her lack of consent to sexual intercourse as an adult and the respondent's full appreciation of her lack of consent. 
46Without the Crown being permitted to lead evidence of the earlier assaults, the complainant's evidence that instead of telling her parents in 1981 that her brother had intercourse with her, she tried to handle the situation by locking the doors and windows of the family home and later installing a lock on her bedroom door and having her small son sleep with her, in effect that she attempted to handle the situation on her own as she had done since she was 10 or 11 years old, could not be readily appreciated.  Finally, were the complainant not permitted to give evidence that when she told the respondent in 1975 that she would tell her parents about his sexual mistreatment of her he used the fact of their brother's death and the terrible effect that that disclosure would have on the family in order to pressure her into silence, her failure to complain in 1981, namely, her fear of causing a family breakdown at that time, would not be able to be properly assessed.
47Other aspects of the evidence, being the telephone conversation between the respondent and the complainant, the statement by the respondent's partner, the record of interview and the guilty plea, contain admissions by the respondent that would make it clear to a jury that the 1981 conduct was not an isolated incident that came out of the blue but was the culmination of years of unwanted sexual conduct by the respondent towards the complainant.  Without the evidence of the relationship between the complainant and the respondent over a number of years, the jury would have an entirely distorted and artificial understanding of the events of 1981.  
48The balancing task required by s 101(2) and s 137 involves the judge identifying the type of prejudicial effect to which the evidence might give rise and explaining why the probative value does or does not substantially outweigh that prejudicial effect (R v Ford at [64]).  That balancing exercise requires the judge to consider the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be available and necessary to reduce any prejudicial effect (DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 at [104]).  There is a fundamental assumption underpinning jury trials that jurors will act in accordance with directions, and directions against propensity reasoning are regarded as effective to ameliorate the potentially prejudicial effect of evidence of other misconduct (Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at [31]-[32]; R v Ford at [139]-[140]).
49While the respondent accepts that the primary judge correctly concluded that the evidence had significant probative value, he contends that the issue on this appeal is whether his Honour erred in determining that the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect.  The respondent contends that his Honour understood the nature of the exercise and took into account matters that were relevant to its determination.
50The respondent contends that the fact that he admitted certain aspects of the respondent's prior conduct relied upon as tendency evidence was not determinative.  He submits that the probative value of the evidence depended upon its capacity to affect the determination of the facts in issue, rather than questions of credibility and reliability or weight.  Further, he says, the fact that aspects of the respondent's conduct were admitted by him did not necessarily deprive the evidence of its prejudicial effect (citing Sokolowskyj v R).
51The respondent contends that the evidence that he had sexual intercourse with his sister would inevitably have a prejudicial effect.  In particular, he says, evidence that he did so when she was a child may have a prejudicial effect of a differing nature and degree and was patently liable to provoke an emotional response on the part of the jury.  He contends that the prejudicial effect of such evidence was capable of diverting the jury from a proper analysis of the evidence relating to the counts on the indictment, thereby potentially denying him the benefit of any reasonable doubt.  He contends that the primary judge sufficiently identified that possible prejudicial effect of the evidence for the purposes of the necessary determination.  
52Clearly enough, the evidence, including admissions on the part of the respondent, reveal the tendency asserted in the Tendency Notice and found by his Honour to be established, which is, in turn, highly probative of the question whether the respondent had sexual intercourse with the complainant in 1981 as alleged in the indictment.  It is particularly cogent in circumstances where the only time when the respondent was not regularly assaulting the complainant was when he was not living at the home, or when she had a boyfriend living there.
53We are satisfied that the evidence has significant probative value in relation to the charges in the indictment and that there is nothing about the evidence that renders its potential for unfair prejudice incapable of amelioration by judicial direction.  We do not consider that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent.
54The respondent submitted, and the Crown accepted, that the basis for appellate review of a determination pursuant to s 101(2) of the Evidence Act must be an error of one the kinds identified in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 (see R v Ford at [108]-[110]; DAO at [24], [104], [170]).  It is evident from the above discussion that we are satisfied that the primary judge failed to have regard to two relevant considerations, namely, the directions that may have been available to reduce any potential prejudice to the respondent and the reasons for the gap in the respondent's offending between 1975/1976 and 1981 and that he applied no reasoned analysis to the other aspects of the evidence (set out in [39] above) which attenuated the significance of the evidence.  For those reasons, we are satisfied that his discretion miscarried.
Conclusion
55It follows from the above that appeal should be upheld.  The primary judge was clearly in error in rejecting the evidence as context evidence and as tendency evidence.  We consider that: The evidence of the complainant of any sexual acts that did not relate to a count on the indictment is admissible as context evidence;The tendency evidence sought to be led is admissible;The respondent's plea of guilty to the offence under s 71 is admissible as an admission that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was aged 10; andThe respondent's general admissions in the recorded telephone conversation with the complainant of 25 July 2011 and his interview of 9 August 2011 are admissible.
The orders of the Court should therefore be as follows:
(1)The appeal be allowed.
(2)The decision of Neilson DCJ on 8 April 2014 to reject the evidence sought to be admitted be set aside.
(3)The matter of admissibility of evidence be remitted to the District Court for determination in accordance with these reasons.
56During oral argument and in his judgment, his Honour made additional remarks that have recently been the subject of complaint by the Attorney-General to the Judicial Commission.  In those circumstances, we consider it appropriate that a different judge preside at the trial.

		30 July 2014",2014-07-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764453,Farkas v R [2014] NSWCCA 141,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal with respect to a sentence imposed on him in the District Court for an offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis, contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Arnott DCJ imposed a sentence of four years six months imprisonment, commencing on 29 March 2013, with a non-parole period of two years and six months.
2In my view, the Court should grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed by the District Court and resentence the applicant. An appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for three years and seven months, comprising a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of one year seven months. The non-parole period having commenced on 29 March 2013 will expire on 28 March 2015.
3The notice of application for leave to appeal contained five grounds. Ground 5 alleged that the sentence was manifestly excessive: because the specific complaints in grounds 1-4 should be upheld, it is not necessary to address ground 5.
4Grounds 1 and 2 may be taken together. Ground 1 stated that the sentencing judge was in error in identifying as an aggravating feature of the offence the fact that it was committed for financial gain. The applicant submitted that unless the profit were extraordinary, financial gain was an element of the offence and therefore should not have been identified as an aggravating feature. Further, there was no factual basis for the finding. Ground 2 challenged the factual finding, namely that the purpose of the supply was to reduce or satisfy an existing debt of $22,000. The applicant said that he owed his supplier an amount of $2,350, being the amount he owed for the drugs on-sold, but which was a ""debt"" because his arrest resulted in the confiscation of both the drugs and the money.
5For the reasons comprehensively set out by Campbell J, both of these grounds should be upheld. As Campbell J further demonstrates, each error was material to the sentence imposed. The multiple references to the ""drug debt"" demonstrate that this was a significant circumstance underpinning the assessment of an appropriate sentence. The applicant's evidence was that he was paid with drugs for his own consumption. It is not necessary to identify how the confusion arose: the fact that in respect of both grounds the judge, in his reasons, placed reliance on the impugned factors is sufficient to infer that, absent those factors, he would have imposed a lower sentence. They could not have been considered circumstances of mitigation and nothing in the reasons suggests that the sentencing judge treated them as neutral.
6The third and fourth grounds relate to the inference drawn by the sentencing judge that the drug, known to the applicant as ""speed"", having a purity ranging between 9% and 12.5%, represented a more serious level of offending than had the same quantity been of ""normal street purity"", which the judge said was between 3% and 5%. Apart from the complaint that he should not have relied upon such a comparison, absent evidence (ground 3), the applicant also said he was denied procedural fairness because he was not given an opportunity to be heard to dispute that finding (ground 4).
7Both these grounds, the background to which are fully set out by Campbell J, should be upheld. They provided a further basis for intervention. Again it is not possible to infer that the finding as to comparative purity was other than an aggravating circumstance.
8As Campbell J is not satisfied that ground 3 was made out, it is necessary to explain why I take a contrary view.
9The trial judge proceeded to identify the ""normal street purity"" of methylamphetamine without evidence. Indeed, the only evidence before him of normal street purity was the analysis of the drug supplied. Further, the very concept of ""normal street purity"" should have led to caution in giving it any weight as a relevant consideration. Rather, the judge referred to two decisions of this Court, namely R v Parkinson [2001] NSWCCA 244; 125 A Crim R 1 and Shaaban v R [2007] NSWCCA 115. This approach was not supportable. First, a judgment of a court with respect to a finding of fact is not authority for the ""fact"". The facts found are relevant to the precedent value of the case, either as a statement of legal principle, or as an indicator of a range of sentencing for a particular offence, but the facts in the later case must generally be based on the evidence before the later court. 
10Secondly, the cases did not, in their terms, purport to make relevant factual findings. In Parkinson, Howie J noted the quantity of amphetamine the subject of the offence which was ""said to be valued at $2,000"": at [10]. He continued:
""Although the normal street purity of amphetamine is said to be 3-4 per cent, the purity of the drug the subject of this charge was 7 per cent and, therefore, the drug could be cut down by some other substance to produce 118g of amphetamine which could be resold at street level.""
11What information Howie J was relying upon is not stated: however, the language, ""is said to be"", indicates that there was some material before the Court, possibly by consent, indicating ""normal street purity"". Shaaban provided even weaker support. In an ex tempore judgment, Rothman J noted that the supply involved ""methylamphetamine with a purity of approximately 19% (the normal street purity being between 3 and 5%)."" No source was given for any of the information set out as fact. 
12If these cases provided no basis for the assessment or comparison undertaken, it is possible that the judge was entitled to undertake the comparison on the basis of judicial notice. Chapter 4 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) is headed ""Proof""; Part 4.2 is headed ""Judicial notice"". Section 144 is in the following terms:
144 Matters of common knowledge
(1) Proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and is:
(a) common knowledge in the locality in which the proceeding is being held or generally, or(b) capable of verification by reference to a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned.
(2) The judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any way the judge thinks fit.
(3) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is to take knowledge of that kind into account.
(4) The judge is to give a party such opportunity to make submissions, and to refer to relevant information, relating to the acquiring or taking into account of knowledge of that kind as is necessary to ensure that the party is not unfairly prejudiced.
13The meaning of the phrase ""common knowledge"" is assumed to be common knowledge - it is not defined. It is doubtful that the normal street purity of methylamphetamine is a generally known fact, or even common knowledge in Campbelltown, where the Court sat. The very nature of the information makes it something which is inherently open to question. If it were relevant, the better view is that it is not a matter falling within the scope of s 144; it is therefore a matter needing to be proved.
14No final view is necessary in relation to that issue because the Evidence Act does not apply in relation to a sentencing proceeding unless the court directs ""that the law of evidence applies in the proceeding"": s 4(2)(a). No such direction was given in the present case. However, it has been held by this Court that the curious effect of the absence of such a direction is that the law of evidence does apply, but not the Evidence Act: R v Bourchas [2002] NSWCCA 373; 133 A Crim R 413 at [43]ff (Giles JA; Levine and Sperling JJ agreeing). (Although it has been held that ""there would appear to be no room for the operation of the common law doctrine of judicial notice, strictly so called, since the enactment of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 144"", that statement did not have regard to the operation of s 4 of the Act: Gattellaro v Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] HCA 6; 78 ALJR 394 at [17] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Hayne and Heydon JJ).)
15The circumstances in which it is appropriate for a court to rely upon ""facts"" which are not the subject of evidence cannot be determined by any simple statement of principle. References to ""common knowledge"", ""notorious facts"" and facts ""which cannot reasonably be questioned"" cover a multitude of circumstances and situations. The common understanding of human nature, on which juries are sometimes exhorted to rely in assessing the credibility of witnesses or the likelihood of events, may be no more than an appeal to popular prejudices. Even within that area, the rules of evidence assume that jurors will not readily appreciate the risks associated with something as commonplace as evidence of identification. The reasoning process by which judges reach findings of fact is often replete with assumptions and inferences based on what may be described as common experience. Findings as to a defendant's intention or purpose will often require a process far removed from scientific assessment. Numerous examples of ""notorious facts judicially noticed without inquiry"" are to be found in J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence (Australian edition, loose leaf) at [3020]. A somewhat different category of ""notorious facts judicially noticed after inquiry"" is largely restricted to ascertainment of matters which are believed to be uncontestable or at least generally accepted: see Cross at [3025].
16To the extent that there is a known range of methylamphetamine of ""normal street purity"", it must fall into the latter category. That being so, it is necessary to identify an appropriate source of information: that did not happen in the present case. Further, unless the fact that the information is uncontestable is itself a fact of which judicial notice can be taken, it is necessary in accordance with the basic principles of procedural fairness underlying the adversary system that notice of the intention to rely upon such information is given to the parties: see, eg, Cavanett v Chambers [1968] SASR 97 at 101 (Bray CJ); Gordon M Jenkins & Associates Pty Ltd v Coleman (1989) 23 FCR 38 at 46-48 (Sheppard, Beaumont and Hill JJ). That did not happen here.
17The applicant tendered before this Court extracts from two documents: the first chronologically, was a publication of the National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund, prepared by R Nicholas, An environmental scan on alcohol and other drug issues facing law enforcement in Australia 2010 (Commonwealth of Australia, March 2010) (""the 2010 paper""). The second was a publication of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, prepared by J van Buskirk and L Burns, New South Wales Drug Trends 2012 - Findings from the Illicit Drug Reporting System (NDARC, 2013) (""the 2013 paper""). The 2010 paper identified several different forms of methamphetamine available in Australia with markedly different median purities, the purities apparently being based on analysis undertaken of drugs seized by police. At 7.4.2, the paper stated:
""McKetin, McLaren and Kelly (2005) described three predominate forms of methamphetamine that are available in Australia. The first of these is powder methamphetamine which has a median purity of approximately 10% and is usually white, or off white in colour. The authors reported that this is commonly known as 'speed' although sometimes this term is used more generically to refer to other forms of the drug.""
18Unhelpfully, this Court was not supplied with a copy of the references used in the 2010 paper. Nevertheless, it may be inferred that the figure of 10% derived from the paper of McKetin et al published in 2005 relied on analyses undertaken no later than 2005. Whether the analyses were limited to drugs seized in New South Wales or covered the whole of Australia is not known. It is certainly sufficient to cast doubt on the figures used in Shaaban in relation to offending which occurred in 2005. 
19The 2013 paper included figures for the ""median purity of methylamphetamine seizures analysed in NSW for the period 1999/00 to 2010/11"": par 5.2.3. The figures referred to did not provide any precise readings, although those in the period from the second half of 1999 to mid-2001 appear to be in the range of 5-7%. From mid-2002, the figures appear to vary between about 5% and a peak of a little less than 30%. As a rough approximation, the figures in 2010-2011 appear to indicate a median purity of around 10%. The drugs supplied by the applicant would fall squarely within that range. Whether these figures might provide a possible measure of ""normal street purity"" is difficult to know because of the uncertain meaning of that phrase.
20This material is adequate to demonstrate that ground 3, as well as ground 4, was made good. The reference by the judge to Parkinson is a sufficient indication that he took an indication of higher than normal purity as warranting a more severe sentence. To the extent that this was a fact which had not been agreed, it was adverse to the interests of the applicant and could only be taken into account if proved beyond reasonable doubt. The applicant has established in this Court that, quite apart from the procedural complaints, the fact had not been established beyond reasonable doubt and should have been disregarded.
21In these circumstances, each of the four grounds having been made good, it is necessary for the Court to consider resentencing the applicant.
Resentencing22Because the impugned facts had the potential to support a more severe sentence than would otherwise have been given, it should be accepted that absent these considerations, the sentencing judge would have imposed a less severe sentence. It does not follow that a different sentence should now be imposed. However, the question for the Court is not (as sometimes suggested) whether the sentence imposed was one which was ""warranted in law"", but whether the Court is of opinion that some other sentence, in this case less severe, is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). The fact that the sentencing judge himself would have passed a less severe sentence, absent identified error, is a matter which supports this Court imposing a less severe sentence. 
23The circumstances of the offending and the matters personal to the offender have been fully articulated by Campbell J and need not be repeated. The matters which warrant a reduction of the sentence imposed are as follows:
(a) the activity of the offender in retailing drugs was undertaken to obtain drugs for his own use;(b) his need for drugs was related to persistent psychotic symptoms, although their use with prescribed medication may have accentuated the mental health problems from which he suffered;(c) the applicant has not been in prison on any prior occasion;(d) the purity of the drugs supplied, being 38.09g of methylamphetamine, was within the median range of purity for street deals in New South Wales, and(e) his prior criminal record did not include convictions for dealing in drugs.
24The nature of the offence, the matters on a form 1 and the apparent willingness of the applicant to supply drugs on request demonstrate that a significant custodial sentence is required. The appropriate sentence to be imposed is that set out at the beginning of these reasons, namely a non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of one year and seven months, giving a sentence of three years seven months.
25The Court is required to specify the earliest date on which the applicant is eligible for release on parole: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 48. That date is either the day before the anniversary of the commencement of his sentence, or the anniversary. The answer must depend upon the proper construction of the sentence, but that is affected by the statutory scheme. Three provisions are relevant. First, s 47(1)-(5) deals with the commencement of sentences, including consecutive sentences. Recognising that the court may direct that a sentence commence on completion of another sentence, it provides that such a direction, specifying a commencement date after the date on which the sentence is imposed must specify a date ""not ... later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears ... that the offender ... will become eligible to be released on parole"": s 47(4)(b). 
26It has been the practice to commence consecutive statements on the anniversary of the commencement date of the first sentence. Thus a person sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years, to date from 1 January 2000, with a consecutive sentence to date from ""the day following the earliest day"" on which the offender is eligible for parole will be fixed to commence on 1 January 2003. An example of the conventional approach may be seen in the recent judgment of this Court in Ingham v R [2014] NSWCCA 123.
27Secondly, there is s 47(6) which provides:
47 Commencement of sentence...
(6) A sentence of imprisonment ... starts at the beginning of the day on which it commences or is taken to have commenced and ends at the end of the day on which it expires.
There may be a question as to whether the practice noted above with respect consecutive sentences is consistent with s 47(6).
28Thirdly, there is s 48 which requires that when sentencing an offender to imprisonment the court must specify ""the earliest day on which it appears ... that the offender will become entitled to be released from custody, or eligible to be released on parole"": s 48(1)(b). There follows a ""Note"" containing three examples, each of which assumes that the person becomes eligible to be released on parole (or released from a fixed term) on the day before the anniversary of the commencement of the sentence. Thus, example number 3 refers to a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 22 September 2000, stating that the earliest date on which the offender will become eligible to be released on parole is 21 March 2002.
29The conventional approach is consistent with the examples given in the note to s 48: cf R v Nilsson [2005] NSWCCA 34; 42 MVR 348 at [24], referring to R v Kay [2000] NSWSC 716 at [128] (R S Hulme J). To the extent that there is inconsistency between the examples contained in the note to s 48 and the language of s 47(6), there are four reasons to follow the approach adopted in the note to s 48.
30First, s 48 is the provision in the Sentencing Procedure Act which imposes the obligation to identify the actual or potential earliest release date. Secondly, although the note in the text of the Act does not form part of the Act (see s 3(3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act) the note may be taken into account in interpreting a provision of the Act pursuant to s 34(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). In this respect, it is significant that the note being part of the ""text"" of the Act was subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. In that respect it differs in its significance from that commonly accorded to marginal notes, footnotes and endnotes (referred to in s 35(2)(c) of the Interpretation Act) which, historically, were not the subject of consideration by Parliament: see the historical explanation in the Ombudsman v Moroney [1983] 1 NSWLR 317 at 323-325 (Street CJ); One.Tel Ltd (In liq) v Rich [2005] NSWSC 226; 190 FLR 443 at [52]-[54] (Bergin J). See also Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51; 204 ALR 722 at [98] (Lindgren J); Re application of The News Corp Ltd (1987) 15 FCR 227 at 240 (Bowen CJ). The notes in the Sentencing Procedure Act should not be equated with the ""side notes"" referred to by Stephen J in Dugan v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1978] HCA 54; 142 CLR 583, which he described as ""at most only a quite minor aid, 'a most unsure guide', in statutory interpretation"": at 594.
31Thirdly, there being doubt as to the proper construction of legislation giving effect to sentences of imprisonment, the doubt should be resolved against an interpretation which deprives an offender of his or her liberty, albeit for a very brief period: Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427 at 437.
32Fourthly, there is the practical consideration that the Court should prefer the conventional approach to sentencing referred to above, in the absence of any argument by the Director of Public Prosecutions that a more restrictive approach should be adopted. Given that the matter has not, however, been the subject of argument, these views should not preclude the issue being raised at some future time if a different construction is sought to be placed on the legislative scheme. For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that the order of sentence should contain a statement that the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 28 March 2015.
33RA HULME J: I agree that grounds 1, 2 and 4 should be upheld for the reasons given in the judgment of Campbell J. 
34I agree with Basten JA that ground 3 should be upheld as well. That should be so, in my view, because ascertainment of ""normal street purity"" of the substance supplied by the applicant is attended by a sufficient degree of uncertainty. 
35As Basten JA has pointed out (at [10]-[11]), the sources of information upon which the statements in R v Parkinson and Shaaban v R are not disclosed; in contrast to the present case there may well have been evidence on the subject. 
36The materials provided to this Court on the hearing of the application do not assist in determining what ""normal street purity"" might be at any particular point in time. 
37The foundation for the 2005 assertion of McKetin, McLaren and Kelly assertion that ""powder methamphetamine ... has a median purity of approximately 10%"" reported in ""An Environmental Scan on Alcohol and Other Drug Issues Facing Law Enforcement in Australia 2010"", as Basten JA has pointed out, is not known. It is not said to relate only to what could be termed ""street deals to end users of the drug"". It may well relate to all seizures made by law enforcement in a certain (but unstated) period of time.
38The purity figures provided in ""New South Wales Drug Trends 2012 - Findings from the Illicit Drug Reporting System"" tend to confirm the uncertainty as to what ""normal street purity"" might be. It is said that in 2010/11 the median purity was 9 percent. That is based upon seizures made by NSW Police in that period. The proportion of those seizures that related to street deals to end users of the drug, as opposed to wholesale and quasi-wholesale transactions, is unknown. It is significant that the range of purity revealed by the seizures in that period is as wide as 0.5% to 84.5%. It is also significant that Figure 39 on p 53 of the report discloses a substantial fluctuation in median purity levels over the 10 years or so to the end of 2010 as Basten JA has pointed out (from about 5% up to almost 30%). The fluctuations may be explicable because of varying proportions of seizures from retail/wholesale drug activity; but they also might be explicable because of fluctuations in sources (locally manufactured or imported) or for other reasons. The point is that the data is not available. On the face of it, if the median purity levels of police seizures fluctuate so much, what is to say that there is not a fluctuation in ""normal street purity"" as well?
39I agree with Campbell J, however, that the learned sentencing judge's reference to purity probably did not have much bearing upon his assessment of the seriousness of the offence. In contrast to his (erroneous) references to the pre-existing drug debt, he only referred to this in a single sentence. 
40I agree with the terms of re-sentencing proposed by Basten JA and formulated by Campbell J.
41CAMPBELL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 12th June 2013. The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) with further offences being taken into account on a Form 1. These matters consisted of three other supply charges contrary to s 25(1) of the last-mentioned Act and a charge pursuant to s 11C(1) Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW) involving a knife.
42The applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. This included a 10% discount for the utility of his late guilty plea. The ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence (55%) reflected his Honour's finding of special circumstances (see [21] below). The maximum penalty for the s 25A offence is imprisonment for 20 years. It is worth noting in passing that the s 25(1) offences, if dealt with on indictment, carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment; 2 years if disposed of summarily.
Summary of the Facts
43The facts of the offence were not in dispute below and a statement of agreed facts was tendered as part of Exhibit A. I will summarise them briefly for present purposes.
44The applicant met with a person who turned out to be an undercover police officer on four occasions between 26th October and 22nd November 2011. During these meetings he sold various quantities of methylamphetamine to the officer. The total amount of drugs was 38.09 grams for which an aggregate of $4350 was paid.
45The Form 1 matters also arose in the course of these dealings. On their third encounter the applicant sold the officer 6.9g of cannabis for $100 (offence 1 on the Form 1). At their fourth meeting the applicant offered to sell ""1 or 2 pounds"" of cannabis leaf for $3600-$3800 (offence 3). The applicant was arrested soon after his fourth sale to the officer when a 28cm knife (offence 2) was found in a pocket of the driver's door of his vehicle, as well as 6.14 grams of amphetamine, contained in a cigarette packet (offence 4).
Subjective Features
46The applicant was 44 years of age at the time of the offences. He has had an unfortunate childhood, his family having been abandoned by his father when he was only 8 years of age. This led to him becoming a ward of the State due to the inability of his mother, who was mentally ill, to care for him. His work record seems to have been poor, perhaps in part due to the prodromal phase of his mental illness referred to below.
47The applicant also has a mental illness which seems to be of comparatively late onset. He told Dr Furst, a consultant psychiatrist who examined him for the provision of a medico-legal report, that he first started hearing controlling voices in 2000 when he was in his early 30s. He was admitted to Campbelltown hospital in 2004 suffering from auditory hallucinations and depressive symptoms. He told Dr Furst that in the years leading up to the offending his symptoms had been at a low level allowing him to function, except when his symptoms were aggravated by his use of illicit drugs. Dr Furst diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which was chronic and symptomatic.
48Over the years he has been treated with various anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications prescribed by the Campbelltown Community Health team.
49The applicant's history of illicit drug use, according to the account he gave to Dr Furst, started around the time of the onset of his illness. The applicant affirmed this history in unchallenged testimony. He reported to Dr Furst that at the time of the offending, and his subsequent arrest, he was using about 0.2 to 0.3 grams of ""ice"" per day. He also told Dr Furst that he would take this in addition to his prescription medications. He was under the influence of both at the time of this offending.
50Dr Furst said that the applicant's prognosis depends upon ""dual diagnosis drug and alcohol rehabilitation"" while in custody.
Criminal Antecedents
51The applicant has a criminal history dating back to 1981 when he was a juvenile. Importantly he was subject to a s 9 bond imposed by the Campbelltown Local Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm during the period of his offending. This, of course, is a significant factor of aggravation.
52His adult record, however, contains no offence for which a custodial sentence has been imposed. He has not committed a previous offence of supplying drugs. 
The Sentencing Judge's Reasons
53The sentencing judge found that the offender was a retailer of drugs, rather than a mere courier. His Honour formed the view that the offending was motivated by a combination of his desire to repay a drug debt and to support his own drug habit. The quantity of methylamphetamine supplied was found to be ""comparatively small"" but his Honour observed that the objective seriousness of offending of this type was determined by ""concepts of repetition, system and organisation"": R v Hoon [2000] NSWCCA 137 per Dunford J. As assessed, the purity of the drugs was greater than ""normal street purity"". His Honour referred to R v Parkinson [2001] NSWCCA 244 and R v Shaaban [2007] NSWCCA 115. Importantly for present purposes, the sentencing judge found that the offence was aggravated by the profit derived from the reduction of a drug debt amounting to $22,000. In his Honour's judgment the objective seriousness of the offending fell ""a little under the middle of the range for offences of this type"".
54The finding about financial gain by reduction of a drug debt was central to his Honour's approach to the sentencing task, for he mentioned it no less than six times both as an aggravating factor and as a matter that reduced the significance of factors which otherwise suggested leniency.
55The sentencing judge acknowledged that the offender had never been to prison prior to this offending but properly considered that the offence was aggravated by the fact that the offender was subject to a s 9 bond when he offended.
56When assessing the subjective circumstances of the offender the sentencing judge recognised that the offender had a history of drug abuse related to his mental illness of paranoid schizophrenia. But the mitigating effect of the mental illness was reduced to an extent by his motivation to repay his drug debt and the ""premeditated business-like"" nature of the offending. This demonstrated that the offender was aware of the illegality, immorality and impact of his offending. For these reasons his mental illness did not reduce his moral culpability, but it did provide mitigation to the extent to which it accounted for his drug addiction through his impairment of brain function. It also reduced the relevance of general deterrence.
57The offender's prospects of rehabilitation and his likelihood of re-offending were described as ""guarded"". This was due to his chronic mental illness and his long-term substance abuse, which included an ineffective attempt at rehabilitation at a drug and alcohol facility. Even when medicated for his illness the applicant suffered a degree of thought disorder.
58While the sentencing judge was satisfied that some degree of remorse was present its significance was lessened by the applicant's focus on explaining how he became involved in this offending.
59The offender was afforded a 10% discount for the utility of his late plea. The sentencing judge, as I have said, found special circumstances attributable to his need on release into the community for assistance with his mental health, drug addiction, and employment in combination together with the hardship of the sentence being his first time in custody.
Grounds of AppealGrounds 1 and 2
60Grounds 1 and 2 are linked and I will deal with them together. The grounds are as follows:
1. The sentencing judge erred by taking into account, as an aggravating feature of the offence, that the offence was committed for financial gain.
2. The sentencing judge erred by finding facts adverse to the applicant upon a misconstruction of the evidence and/or which were not open to him to find, namely that the applicant:
a. had a pre-existing drug debt of $22,000;
b. was motivated by the need to pay a pre-existing drug debt;
c. was making a monetary profit from the sale of drugs.
61The applicant contends that the sentencing judge misapprehended the facts by finding that the applicant's offending was motivated by his desire to repay a pre-existing drug. By so finding, it is submitted, the sentencing judge erroneously aggravated the offending by concluding that ""Profit, including one to reduce a debt, as was the case here, is an aggravating circumstance."" (ROS p5). The Crown concedes that the Sentencing Judge erred here but submits that the error was not significant. 
62This Court held in Prculovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 274 at [43] (by Howie AJ; McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) that financial gain and a level of planning are elements of the offence. It is only when these factors are ""significant"" and above that expected in the ""lowest level of offending"" that a sentencing judge would not be in error to take this into account as a matter of aggravation.
63The Crown accepts that the appellant in this case did not fall into this ""significant"" category. Neither the level of planning involved nor the ""profit"" gained were so significant as to take the offence beyond the level inherently contemplated by the elements of the offence. It is difficult to accept his Honour's error was not material in the result given the centrality of this idea in his thinking as summarised at [16] above. 
64Moreover the sentencing judge, with respect, misapprehended the facts about this so-called drug debt. In his reasons his Honour said, ""[The applicant] gave evidence that he sold drugs to pay back a drug debt of over $22,000, as well as being supplied with the ""speed"" he needed at the end of the week."" The Crown concedes that taken at its highest the evidence of the applicant conceding a debt revealed a far lesser sum of $2350. And the figure of $22,000 is not mentioned anywhere in the agreed facts or other evidence. 
65There is no obvious correlation between $2350 and $22,000 which might explain his Honour's finding as a mere slip or mis-transcription. In chief the applicant said he received ""a percentage, you know, a third for me through the week"" (Tcpt p 6(40)). This was clarified in cross-examination. When asked about the word ""percentage"" he said, ""I get a Speed in return, yeah"" (Tcpt p 8(20)). This was the only evidence of material reward, or ""profit"". 
66The natural inference is that his Honour simply misheard what the applicant said. This impression is reinforced by the consideration that the applicant's legal representative below made a similar mistake and accepted in submissions that the applicant's motivation was a drug debt (Tcpt p 10(20)). A transcript of the proceedings on sentence would not have been available to the sentencing judge at the time he prepared his reasons for sentence.
67The applicant further submits that the impression of misapprehension is increased by the finding that the appellant was motivated by ""a pre-existing drug debt"" (my emphasis; ground 2b). The $2350 referred to was not pre-existing but rather a debt that fell due to his supplier by dint of his arrest following the fourth instance of supply. The figure of $2350 is the amount the applicant received from the undercover officer which he was meant to hand over to his supplier. 
68Thus the ""debt"" the applicant referred to in evidence was not pre-existing but money lost by the supplier because the applicant was arrested. To put it another way the debt of $2350 is money seized by the authorities which was intended by the applicant for his supplier. The Crown accepted this submission as being ""most probably"" the case after a careful reading of the transcript (CWS 5(g)). 
69Reading the evidence as a whole I am satisfied that the Crown concessions are properly made. The applicant's evidence was to the effect that he received no money for his misconduct by way of commission or otherwise, and that his only drug debt was the result of his arrest which precluded him from passing on the $2350 to his supplier. His only recompense was drugs for his personal use. These matters were not contested in cross-examination.
70I therefore accept that his Honour erred in stating the sum of the ""debt"" as $22,000, and by finding that the applicant's offending was motivated by his desire to repay a pre-existing drug debt. The debt in question arose upon his arrest and on the evidence it appears that at no stage did the applicant receive any financial gain over and above drugs for his personal use, doubtless a ""material reward"" within s 25A. The applicant was paid in kind receiving some ""speed"" at the end of each week.
71I accept that grounds 1 and 2 are made out. The sentencing judge erred by aggravating the offending by finding that the applicant profited by way of a reduction in pre-existing drug debts. He profited by receiving drugs but that did not take the case out of the ordinary. The error was one of principle, coupled with a material misapprehension of the facts.
Grounds 3 and 4
72Grounds 3 and 4 are also best dealt with together. These grounds are in the following terms:
3. The sentencing judge erred by finding, without evidence, that the normal street purity of methylamphetamine is between 3 and 5 per cent.
4. The applicant was denied procedural fairness in that, contrary to the indication given to the parties during submissions and without providing the parties with an opportunity to be further heard in relation to the question, the sentencing Judge found that the purity of the drug supplied was greater than normal street purity.
73The substance of the argument comes down to two propositions: first, it was simply impermissible for the sentencing judge to take judicial notice of the ""normal street purity"" of the drugs involved and, secondly, his Honour ought not to have acted on his own inquiries about this topic unless he first gave the parties an opportunity to further address him about it. 
74The finding that the purity of the drug was greater than ""normal street purity"" was made by reference to previous decisions of this Court in R v Parkinson and Shaaban v R. During addresses below the applicant's legal representative (not Mr. Wilson who appeared on the appeal) submitted the drugs supplied were ""of pretty poor purity"" (Tcpt p 10(45)). This drew a question from his Honour ""purity is about street value purity?"" To which the advocate answered ""yes, yes, thank you, your Honour those are my submissions"" (Tcpt p 10(50)). His Honour's question cannot be properly understood as indicating acceptance of the submission about purity. Quite the contrary.
75On the hearing of the appeal the Court permitted the tender of An environmental scan on alcohol and other drug issues facing law enforcement in Australia 2010, a paper by Roger Nicholas of the National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund, and New South Wales Drug Trends 2012: findings from the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) (2013) by J Van Buskirk and Lucy Byrnes of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales. The purpose of the tender was to demonstrate that the question of ""normal street purity"" is a question of contestable fact, or to put it another way, a question of ""adjudicative fact"".
76Writing in Cross on Evidence, 9th Australian Edition, Butterworths 2004, (Cross) J D Heydon (at p 145 [3005]) stated:
In the case of adjudicative facts, the doctrine of judicial notice has restricted scope, for in the common law system, the facts are appropriately determined on the evidence presented by the parties, unless the fact is of such notoriety that to call for evidence would be a waste of time.
As to whether ""the doctrine of precedent applies to a judicially noticed fact"" so that a judge may inform herself or himself by reference to a previous decision where judicial notice was taken, Cross states (at p 146):
...where the fact so found is an adjudicative fact, its impact on subsequent trials stems not from its judicial authority but from its notoriety which is presumably evident to all courts.
77A judge is entitled to take judicial notice of a notorious fact after inquiry, notwithstanding that this proposition contains an obvious contradiction: Cross p. 156 [3025]. It is clearly established, however, that a court is not entitled to act upon judicial memory refreshed by inquiry without giving the parties notice of its intention ""and an opportunity to be heard on the results of its researches"": Cavanett v Chambers [1968] SASR 97 at 101 per Bray CJ. In International Finance Trust Company Limited & Anor v NSW Crime Commission & Ors [2009] HCA 49; 240 CLR 319 at 382 [146] Heydon J said:
The court is not entitled to take judicial notice of particular matters of fact after inquiry without notifying the parties of the inquiry and giving them the opportunity to controvert or comment on the source on which the inquiry is made. 
78This Court has taken judicial notice of ""the normal street purity"" of drugs. The cases are those referred to by the sentencing Judge. In R v Parkinson (2001) 125 A Crim R 1 at [10] Howie J (Barr J agreeing) said:
Although the normal street purity of amphetamine is said to be 3-4%, the purity of the drug the subject of this charge was 7% and, therefore, the drug could be cut down by some other substance to produce 118 grams of amphetamine which could be resold at street level.
Shaaban v R [2007] NSWCCA 115 at [10] is to the same effect, although Parkinson is not referred to. In the passage I have quoted, Howie J refers to amphetamine, but the drug involved was ""methylamphetamine"", the same drug as in the present case.
79The basis upon which judicial notice of drug matters is taken was explained by RS Hulme J in two cases. In R v Stanbouli (2003) 141 A Crim R 531; [2003] NSWCCA 355 at [106]-[107] his Honour (Spigelman CJ and Carruthers AJ agreeing on this issue) said:
[T]he topic of heroin usage, price and purity comes often before the Courts and has been dealt with sufficiently often in published research material for judicial notice to be taken of it - cf R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR346 at 360-366, 399-403.... The figures I have used, other than those in the immediately preceding paragraph where I have stated the source, are more than supported by data contained in the 1998-99 Australian Illicit Drug Report published by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. Support for various of them is also to be found in ""Australian Drug Trends, 1999"", published by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, a Research Report by Darke, Topp, Kay and Hall entitled ""Heroin use in New South Wales, Australia, 1996-2000"" published by that Centre, and an Article ""Heroin Purity and composition in Sydney, Australia"" by Maher, Swift and Dawson in the 2001 Drug and Alcohol Review (though it should be said that the survey the subject of that article was performed on drugs seized in 1996 and 1997).)
In this area precision is neither possible nor required. The Respondent is not being sentenced for the harm the heroin he helped import did.
80Stanbouli should be read with Ma and Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240 where RS Hulme J (with McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreeing) expressed the following view at [51]-[52]; [54]: 
However, regrettably, the experience of courts with drug offences is vastly greater now than it was then. So, I suspect, is the published material. That presently available includes: ""NSW Drug Trends 2006; Findings From the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS)"" by E. Black et al, NDARC Technical Report No 270 (University of New South Wales); ""The Effect of a Reduction in Heroin Supply on Fatal and Non-Fatal Drug Overdoses in New South Wales, Australia"", by Degenhardt L. et al, (2005) 182 The Medical Journal of Australia; ""Heroin Markets in Australia: Current Understandings and Future Possibilities"", by T J Moore et al, Drug Policy Modelling Project, Monograph 09, (Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre Inc).
Judge Morgan was thus entitled to take judicial notice of the purity of drugs commonly to be found in cases coming before the courts and to make a judgment of where, relative to the levels of purity commonly seen, the purity of the drugs in the case before her fell. ...
Furthermore, if judicial notice is to be taken of matters such as purity commonly experienced in the Courts, the particular matters must be such as to be, or be virtually - and for present purposes it is unnecessary to explore the difference - beyond argument.
81From his Honour's reference to ""judicial notice""; to the experience of Courts with drug offences; and the literature that is available to judges about illegal drugs, RS Hulme J should not be taken as suggesting in any way that the District Court is a ""specialist tribunal"" when it comes to dealing with drug offences: cf Strinic v Singh [2009] NSWCA 15; 74 NSWLR 419. Rather judicial notice may be taken of facts which are notorious, whether or not the notoriety is established after inquiry. The point his Honour was making is simply that with the far greater experience of the courts with drug offences and with the advances in knowledge due to literature of the category his Honour mentioned, matters like ""normal street purity"" have acquired sufficient notoriety for judicial notice to be taken whether or not inquiry is first made. By definition, if judicial notice may be taken of a fact, it is unnecessary to receive evidence about it.
82As I have already pointed out, a decision based on judicial notice about ""normal street purity"" of a particular drug ""cannot provide a precedent in the legal sense, as in the case of a decision upon a matter of law, [but] other courts can be expected more readily to accept judicial knowledge of the basic facts leading to the conclusion and hence the conclusion itself"": Saul v Menon [1980] 2 NSWLR 314 at 326 (by Moffitt ACJ); see also National Trustee Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Ltd v The Attorney General (Victoria) [1973] VR 610 at 612. 
83In my judgment, his Honour was entitled to take judicial notice of the ""normal street purity"" of methylamphetamine, and was entitled to refresh his judicial memory by reference to Parkinson and Shaaban. 
84As Cross points out (page 173-4 [3125]), strictly, evidence in rebuttal of a fact judicially noticed is inadmissible. The learned author continued:
Similarly, evidence that a particular practice was not followed on a particular occasion would not rebut the existence of the practice of which judicial notice is taken; nor, strictly speaking, would evidence of a change of practice, for judicial notice is simply taken of the current practice at the particular time.
The sentencing Judge was entitled to draw upon ""the store of judicial knowledge"" of which the previous decisions of Parkinson and Shaaban form part. From them his Honour was entitled to take notice that ""normal street purity"" of methylamphetamine is in the range of 3 to 5 percent. But this did not prevent the applicant leading evidence to demonstrate, if he could, that things had changed since those decisions were made by reference, say, to the 2012 publication. And this consideration gives rise to the difficulty in the present case.
85By his question, his Honour properly indicated that purity in absolute terms is not the issue; the issue was ""normal street purity"". But, as the extract from International Finance Trust demonstrates, his Honour was not entitled to refresh his memory in chambers by reference to those cases ""without notifying the parties of the enquiry and giving them the opportunity to controvert, or comment, on the source in which the enquiry is made"". As Bray CJ pointed out in Cavanett even where the information is ""of an uncontroversial nature"" the Court should give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the result of its researches.
86In ST v R [2013] VSCA 133 Ashley, Redlich and Priest JJA said:
It is axiomatic that a judge may not search for, or take account of, information that is not in evidence, save where a fact is of such notoriety that a judge may take judicial notice of it. 
At [40] their Honours explained:
One must distinguish the process of modern litigation where a judge is frequently provided with material which does not end up in evidence or where a judge is required to rule upon evidence which it is concluded is inadmissible. It is assumed that a judge then has the capacity to put from his or her mind evidence which has been seen or heard but which is not relevant or admissible to the determination of the questions before the court. One may also put to one side those instances where a judge may take judicial notice of a particular fact, even if it is not put into evidence, which is of such notoriety that it could not be the subject of serious dispute. So also, a judge may have recourse to learned works for the purpose of refreshing his or her memory. But even in such cases where evidence may not required to prove a fact, the requirements of natural justice will ordinarily have to be observed. Judges should not so inform themselves on any contentious matter, and then act upon it, without first giving the parties an opportunity to controvert or comment upon it. (Citations omitted; my emphasis)
87His Honour should not have taken judicial notice of the ""normal street purity"" of methylamphetamine without notice to the parties especially where his Honour appreciated that this consideration was relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending, and he intended to use it in assessing that matter. I will return to the question of whether any practical injustice flowed from this. 
88The legal position I have described drawn from the common law is materially the same as that established by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995, s 144 which is in the following terms:
144 Matters of common knowledge(1) Proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and is:(a) common knowledge in the locality in which the proceeding is being held or generally, or
(b) capable of verification by reference to a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned.
(2) The judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any way the judge thinks fit.
(3) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is to take knowledge of that kind into account.
(4) The judge is to give a party such opportunity to make submissions, and to refer to relevant information, relating to the acquiring or taking into account of knowledge of that kind as is necessary to ensure that the party is not unfairly prejudiced.
Importantly, s 144(4) requires the judge to give the parties a fair opportunity to make submissions.
89I am conscious that by dint of s 4, the Evidence Act applies to sentencing proceedings only to the extent that the Court directs that the Act apply. No party asked for such a direction in the present case, and none was made. In R v Bourchas [2002] NSWCCA 373; 133 A Crim R 413, Giles JA noticed it was not customary for a direction that the Act applied to be made. After a detailed and insightful review of the case law and the writings of commentators, his Honour, with the agreement of Levine and Sperling JJ, expressed the following conclusion at [61]: 
What I have said is not to deny that the sentencing judge should be fully informed, or that desirable practices as they have developed should not continue. In practice sentencing proceedings are conducted with a degree of informality. Unnecessary insistence on the strict rules of evidence is in no-one's interests in sentencing proceedings, and the customary co-operation between the Crown and the offender and making of admissions by the offender should so far as possible be insisted upon. But if there is good reason for objection to evidence in sentencing proceedings the objection when taken must be resolved and, apart from statute, must be resolved by application of the rules of evidence. In the absence of a direction pursuant to s4 of the Evidence Act, the law of evidence unaffected by that Act applies.
90Accordingly, in the absence of a direction, the law of evidence unaffected by the Act applied in this case. And that common law, in my judgment, required the parties to be given a fair opportunity to address or comment upon whether 3-5% represented normal street purity when the applicant offended. The denial of that opportunity amounted to practical injustice: Re Minister for Immigration; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 at 13-14 [37] by Gleeson CJ. The reports tendered in this Court suggest that the street purity of methamphetamine in Australia is higher now than when Parkinson was decided, if not Shaaban. At page 109 (7.4.2) of the 2010 paper, of the various forms of methylamphetamine, ""speed"" is said to have a median purity of approximately 10 percent; ""base"", 21 percent; and ""ice"", a median purity of 19 percent. In the 2012 report (p72 [5.2.3]) the median purity of all methylamphetamine seizures analysed by police was said to be 9%, from a range of all seizures of 0.5-84.5%. 
91I would reject Ground 3, but uphold Ground 4. Having said that, I do not regard his Honour's finding as to purity as having had much effect upon his finding as to the objective seriousness of the offending. It was a factor that he said he was taking into account. However, it is implicit in his Honour's finding that the offender was a retailer that the drugs were not to ""be cut down by other some substance"" to produce a greater quantity for the purpose of on-selling. 
92In expressing these conclusions, I have not overlooked the significance of the decision of this Court in R v Attallah [2005] NSWCCA 277 where (at [221]) James J (Buddin and Rothman JJ agreeing) said:
I do not consider that it was open to her Honour to find that the heroin or cocaine supplied was ""of a high degree of purity"". There was no evidence which would have permitted a determination of whether these degrees of purity should be regarded as high degrees of purity. Her Honour did not refer to any evidence at all about the degree of purity of the heroin the appellants had supplied.
This statement should not be taken as requiring direct evidence in any case in which purity of a drug is in issue. The question of the ""high degree of purity"" in Attallah was raised in the context of s 61(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That section imposes a mandatory life sentence for certain serious drug offences. In those circumstances where there is a requirement for a court to be satisfied as to the purity of a drug before imposing the most severe punishment known to our criminal law it follows that evidence is required to discharge the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. An offender should not be sentenced to life imprisonment on a finding ""of a high degree of purity"" without evidence. 
93Obviously, in every case, a sentencing Judge may not take into account as an aggravating factor any matter unless satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt and in a case of appropriate notoriety, judicial notice will suffice. What was required in Attallah was not proof of ""normal street purity"" but that the actual drugs in question were of a high degree of purity. Judicial notice could not supply that fact.
Ground 5: Is the sentence manifestly excessive
94As there are identifiable appellable errors in his Honour's approach, it is unnecessary to consider whether the sentence passed is manifestly excessive. However, I will bear in mind the arguments addressed to this ground when considering the next question which is whether some other sentence is warranted in law.
Is a less severe sentence warranted in law?
95Error in the sentencing process does not trigger the quashing of a sentence automatically. The establishment of error in the House v King (1956) 55 CLR 499 sense is a condition of the exercise of the power conferred by s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [21] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. But before a sentence may be quashed and the offender re-sentenced ""this Court must form a positive opinion that 'some other sentence is warranted at law and should have been passed'"": R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79].
96I accept that Grounds 1, 2 and 4 have been made out. As I said at [53], it is difficult to gauge how significant his Honour's assessment of ""normal street purity"" was in his thinking as he found the offender was a retailer. But his Honour's misapprehension of the facts about the ""drug debt"" was mentioned six times during his reasons and taken into account, erroneously, as conceded by the Crown, as an aggravating factor, but more generally as a factor materially affecting his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, and reducing the mitigating effect of the offender's mental illness (see [16] above).
97The offender emphasised that his mental illness called for a greater measure of leniency than that allowed by the sentencing Judge. Judicial Commission statistics and a table of 27 cases involving breaches of s.25A(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act demonstrate that the sentence imposed was a relatively stern one when compared with ""what sentences have been imposed (in other more or less) comparable cases"": Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [26]. The applicant argued that if the sentence imposed on him is examined against this historical ""yardstick"" the Court should conclude that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed, mainly because of the issue of the applicant's mental illness.
98The Crown relies upon Prculovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 274 at [32] and [42] to advance the following propositions:
(a)Given the wide variety of offending covered by s 25A, the statistics provide at best an unreliable yardstick. This is more significant in this case because the applicant's plea was late and the statistics reflected pleas of guilty in the Local Court;
(b)Prculovski was a similar case with a similar sentence of which Howie AJ (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL) said the sentence ""barely reflected the objective seriousness of the conduct that gave rise to [the] offence"". In fact, the present case involved supply on 4 occasions and an aggregate amount more than twice that involved in Prculovski. 
99The Form 1 offences were serious. The drug matters carried a maximum penalty of 15 years and 10 years respectively. The applicant was on conditional liberty for an assault and at the time of his arrest had a long bladed knife hidden in his car. The latter offence was also on the Form 1. The Crown argued that his Honour had due regard to the applicant's mental illness which, as his Honour found, ""did not preclude the applicant from engaging in serious premeditated business-like criminality"" (CWS [37]). A high degree of leniency was reflected in the finding of special circumstances resulting in the fixing of a non-parole period which was 55.5% of the total sentence.
100I do not find Prculovski comparable to the instant case. The offending there consisted of four offences. Of the three drug offences, one was contrary to s 25A and two others were contrary to s 25 carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years. The fourth offence was a serious firearm offence carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years. There were eleven offences on the Form 1, including one supply of a prohibited drug, three instances of possession of a prohibited drug and seven firearm or weapon offences including the possession of a number of prohibited weapons. The offender suffered from a pathological grief reaction and major depressive illness caused by the death of his father, but mental illness of this type, in my judgment, hardly falls into the same category as the illness of paranoid schizophrenia suffered by the applicant. Prculovski provides no real guidance in the present case.
101The relevance of mental illness to the sentencing of offenders is summarised by Basten JA in R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [41] - [42] (see also R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36] per Sperling J). It is unnecessary for me to re-state these principles. The sentencing Judge referred to them and bore them in mind when sentencing the applicant. He made express reference to Hemsley. At [18] above I have summarised this part of his Honour's reasoning, but I think it worthwhile setting out now the passage in full:
For the reasons already expressed, I do not think that [the offender's] culpability is reduced due to his inability to appreciate the gravity of his actions and its consequences. His motive was to repay his drug debt and fund his drug habit. However, I consider a measure of leniency is warranted by reason of his debt and drug habit being partly caused in the first place by impairment of his brain function in turn caused by his chronic schizophrenic illness. I also consider that the full measure of general deterrence is not appropriate in view of his longstanding mental condition. I also consider he will do his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. Even when medicated he appears to have some level of though disorder. As Dr. Furst notes at the end of his report, ""he had residual signs of paranoia and thought disorder and reported auditory hallucinations on a regular basis"".
102It is clear from this that his Honour found that the mental illness: reduced the applicant's culpability, albeit to a limited degree; rendered him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence; and that his custodial sentence will weigh more heavily on him. He also put to one side the possibility that the applicant's mental illness made him a danger to the community. I acknowledge that his Honour did not refer to the question whether the need for specific deterrence was reduced in the circumstances of the present case. I would infer that the sentencing judge decided that it was not.
103I confess that I initially seriously questioned whether all of the facts, matters and circumstances relevant to fixing the appropriate sentence in this case warranted a less severe sentence. However, I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft. What his Honour has written, especially at [22] - [25], has assuaged my concern. Notwithstanding our difference of views about Ground 3, which I did not regard as very material to the sentencing judge's thinking, I have formed the positive opinion that a less severe sentence is warranted in law. I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA at [2], which I suggest be formalised as follows:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.

		06 August 2014",2014-07-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764459,Soong v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2014] NSWSC 1030,"Judgment

1On 20 March 2013, the plaintiff was convicted of five offences under s 255-110 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) in the Local Court for failing to provide security for tax liabilities as required by the Commissioner for taxation and was fined $1,000. The plaintiff appeals to this Court under s 55 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), seeking that the conviction and orders made by the Local Court be set aside. Where an appeal involves a question of fact or mixed law and fact, leave of the Court is required: s 53(1). The defendant does not oppose leave being granted in this case. 

2Section 255-110 provides - 

You commit an offence if:

(a) the Commissioner requires you to give security under section 255-100; and

(b) you fail to give that security as required.

Penalty: 100 penalty units.

3It is worth observing that whether it is, in any case, reasonable or unreasonable for the Commissioner to require security is immaterial. Furthermore, as the offence is a ""prescribed taxation offence"" for the purposes of s 8ZL of the Act, ""a statement or averment [of a matter of fact] in the information ... is prima facie evidence of the matter so stated or averred"", although this does not apply to any ""fault element of an offence"". 

4The plaintiff contends that the learned Magistrate erred in concluding that the plaintiff ""failed"", within the meaning of s 255-110, to provide the required security or, in the alternative, that such failure was not voluntary.

The first four notices

5The plaintiff was a director of Panlirn Pty Ltd. On 12 January 2011 four notices to give security for the due payment of future tax-related liabilities were issued to the plaintiff. The first required security for $2,000, to be given by 11 February 2011, by way of cheque or by way of registered mortgage over property with a net value of at least $20,000 or an unconditional bank guarantee for $2,000; the second notice required security by 25 February 2011 for $10,000 by way of cheque, mortgage over property with a net value of at least $20,000 or bank guarantee for $10,000; the third notice required security for $30,000 by 11 March 2011 by cheque, mortgage over property with a net value of $40,000 or bank guarantee for $30,000; and the fourth notice required security for a further $30,000 by 11 March 2011 by the same modes as specified in the third notice. On 18 February 2011 the first notice was complied with by the plaintiff furnishing a cheque for $2,000. Absent payment by cheque or provision of bank guarantees, the plaintiff was required to provide a mortgage over property worth at least $100,000 to cover the remaining three notices.

6On 23 February 2011 Mr Nath (the plaintiff's solicitor) wrote to the Commissioner offering to give mortgage security in respect of the outstanding three notices over a property in St Ives said to be worth $650,000 which was subject to a mortgage for $550,000, thus yielding an unencumbered value of $100,000. Mr Nath sought an extension of the time limit of 25 February (specified in the second notice) to allow for preparation and execution of the relevant security documents. On the same day, the ATO responded, extending the time for compliance with the three outstanding notices to 23 March 2011, seeking the title details and a letter for the mortgagee as to the outstanding debt, consenting to the proposed second mortgage and production of the certificate of title to enable its registration and whether fluctuating priority would be required.

7On 23 March 2011 Mr Burns from the ATO spoke to Mr Nath. They discussed a caveat on the title in favour of Mr Nath's firm, which was to be withdrawn. Mr Burns also informed Mr Nath that the plaintiff would be required to pay $5,000 towards the Commissioner's costs of preparing the mortgage documents, with any excess to be refunded, and confirming an extension of time to 31 March. In a follow-up conversation, Mr Tully of the ATO informed Mr Nath that the upfront payment of $5,000 was not negotiable and the ATO would only permit solicitors on its panel (which did not include the plaintiff's solicitors) to prepare the mortgage documents. Mr Nath wrote to the ATO on 29 March, inter alia protesting about the amount of the fee and requesting verification that it was reasonable by production of the costs agreements or quotes. It was clearly implied that, until this was done, the plaintiff would not pay the $5,000 sought. Mr Nath said his client consented to the ATO lodging a caveat ""to protect its interest ... based upon our client's agreement to give security"" and asserted that this amounted to compliance with the notices. A further extension of the notices of four weeks was sought to ""finalise and register the second mortgage"".

8On 31 March Mr Burns responded by briefly summarising the communications to date and denying that the notices had been complied with. He agreed to obtain quotes from the ATO's panel of solicitors but pointed out that this could not be done before expiration of the time limited for compliance. He agreed that, if $5,000 were paid that day, time would be extended to 7 April to allow completion of the documents and registration. The other modes of compliance with the notices were also brought to Mr Nath's attention. Later that day Mr Nath responded. He contended that there was no proper basis for the ATO's insistence on an upfront payment or, even (on one reading) any payment at all for preparation of the security documents and sought an extension of time for compliance ""to allow for the issues to be resolved ... and execution and registration of the mortgage"". Mr Burns replied several hours later, repeating the offer to supply quotes and reimburse any excess. He asked if Mr Nath's client had decided to decline to comply with the notices by utilising any of the three options offered. On 5 April Mr Nath replied that the plaintiff was always ready to execute the mortgage and simply required the Commissioner to identify a proper basis for payment of the $5,000 which was described as an ""arbitrary"" precondition. The letter concluded - 

""Accordingly, we are instructed that should the Commissioner bring any action against our client as a result of our client's failure to comply with the Notices to Give Security, our client will rely upon the above as its defence.""

No security was provided.

Further notices requiring security

9On 12 April 2011 three further notices requiring security were issued, one requiring compliance by 18 May 2011 and the two others each by 6 June 2011. The first required security for $5,000 by cheque or bank guarantee; the second required security for $25,000 by cheque, mortgage over property worth at least $30,000 or a bank guarantee for $25,000; and the third required security for $28,000 by cheque, mortgage over property worth at least $30,000 or a bank guarantee for $25,000 (sic).

10On 2 May 2011 Mr Nath wrote to Mr Burns requesting particulars of the matters relied on by the Commissioner in making the allegations in the notices which formed the basis for the requirements in each notice. On 18 May the first of these notices was complied with when the plaintiff paid $5,000 to the ATO. On 20 May the plaintiff offered to comply with the notices by way of granting a mortgage over another St Ives property which was already mortgaged but had a remaining equity of $109,000. On 24 May a solicitor in the ATO, Mr Le, informed Mr Nath that an external firm would prepare the security documents and the costs were typically between $1,500 and $5,000 and he would let him know a few days what the costs were. Mr Nath said he would get instructions. On 27 May, Mr Le wrote to Mr Nath to indicate that the ATO accepted the plaintiff's offer on condition that the mortgage was registered by 6 June 2011, that the owner (a third party) give a written assurance that he had received independent legal advice and the plaintiff agreed to pay the Commissioner's reasonable costs of preparing and registering the security and provided by 6 June 2011 a bank cheque for $1,500, which would not be refunded if the mortgage did not proceed but, if it did, would be deducted from the final amount of costs. Mr Le indicated that an external firm would prepare the documents and that he expected the final bill to be about $2,000. 

11On 30 May Mr Le was informed that two caveats were noted on the title and, on 31 May, telephoned Mr Nath to ask if they would be withdrawn before settlement. Mr Nath said that he would respond when Mr Le told him whether withdrawal was a condition of acceptance of the offer. Later that day Mr Le wrote to tell Mr Nath that withdrawal was a requirement, together with provision of the mortgagee's consent and the certificate of title at settlement; evidence of the outstanding debt secured by the first mortgage and of valuation was also required. On 31 May Mr Nath telephoned Mr Le to tell him that he had not yet obtained instructions. There was no explanation as to why this was so. On 1 June Mr Le told Mr Nath that the documentation of receipt of independent legal advice was not then required, but should be provided prior to completion. On 3 June at 4.40pm (a Friday and the last business day before expiry of the period for compliance at 4pm on the ensuing Monday) Mr Nath telephoned Mr Le and said that the plaintiff required the costs to be fixed at $2,000 and wanted an extension of the compliance date because his client was negotiating with the caveators and at that stage it was unlikely settlement could take place in time. Mr Le said he would seek instructions and respond. On 6 June at 1.21 pm Mr Le confirmed in writing to Mr Nath, in substance, that the estimated cost of preparation of the security documents was $2,000 and should be paid as agreed, with any excess being refunded by the ATO and also that failing to provide the security required by any of the three means stipulated by 4 pm on that day would be regarded as a default by the plaintiff. At 3.50pm Mr Nath called Mr Le confirming his instructions to fix costs at $2,000 and renewing the request for an extension of time. Mr Le, in effect, refused this extension. 

12Neither on 6 June or thereafter did the plaintiff comply with the remaining two April notices.

13On 7 June 2011, Mr Burns sent Mr Nath his reasons for the decision to issue the April notices as requested on 2 May 2011.

Proceedings in the Local Court

14A separate Court Attendance Notice was issued in respect of each of the notices which the Commissioner alleged had not been complied with. The learned Magistrate commenced with the conclusion, which was not disputed, that security was not provided. The plaintiff's contention was that this did not result from a deliberate act or was involuntary because the plaintiff was impecunious and unable to comply with the alternatives to giving security by way of mortgage because of various of the conditions imposed by the Commissioner. The question his Honour considered and concluded adversely to the plaintiff was whether the failure was voluntary. The plaintiff's submission was - 

""The defendant [ie, the plaintiff here] was ready, willing and able to provide security by way of a mortgage, as required by the notices, but she was unable to register the mortgage on the property due to the additional requirements imposed by the commissioner which were not identified in the notices. To the extent that the matters were within the defendant's control, the defendant did all that she could to comply with the notices.""

Although it was submitted by the plaintiff before me that the Magistrate erred in not considering the question of whether the plaintiff had ""failed"" to comply with the notices, the only arguments in this respect were those summarised in the above quotation, which he set out in his judgment. 

15In substance, the Magistrate rejected the contention that the material relied on raised a doubt about the plaintiff's ability to comply with at least the other alternative modes of satisfying the notices. So far as the mortgage proposal was concerned, his Honour referred to Mr Nath's evidence that he did not have any instructions that the plaintiff could not, at least, pay the $5,000 upfront amount for costs and, in substance, (rightly) rejected the submission that compliance with the requirement as to this payment was impossible by virtue of impecuniosity. However, it appears that his Honour did not think it necessary to pursue the mortgage issue to conclusion, given his conclusion about the availability of the alternatives as to which he concluded there was no suggestion put to the Commissioner that the plaintiff could not comply with the notice by way of the other remaining methods of payment. There was no evidence that raised the issue of involuntariness; at all events his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the failure to provide security was voluntary and deliberate.

Consideration

16The plaintiff submits that, in each case, the reason for the security not being provided was that it was impossible for her to do so, an impossibility for which she was not responsible. It is argued that the prosecution bore the onus of proving that the plaintiff ""failed"" to comply with the notices and that the Magistrate should not have been so satisfied. It is submitted that she could not do so because of an impossibility for which she was not responsible, which arose in two respects: firstly, the Commissioner stipulated an unreasonable time for compliance with each Notice; and, secondly, the Commissioner unreasonably withheld his cooperation in respect of each Notice by making compliance conditional on the plaintiff making a down payment of an arbitrary sum towards the Commissioner's costs of preparing the mortgage documentation.

17It is submitted on the plaintiff's behalf that the Commissioner was required to prove that the times specified in the notices and subsequently extended were reasonable. The Magistrate, in substance, held that there was nothing to suggest that the time limits in respect of the two stipulated modes other than the mortgage were in any way unreasonable and, as they remained available to the plaintiff at all times, there was no reason to doubt that they could have been complied with. So far as the mortgage option was concerned, the plaintiff draws attention to the fact that, although the notices referred to the possibility of complying with the requirement by giving a mortgage, they did not explain that the documentation would have to be prepared by solicitors on the ATO's panel, that it was a prerequisite that an amount on account of costs would need to be paid and, in respect of the mortgagor being a third party, it would be necessary to provide evidence that he or she had obtained independent legal advice. However, it should be noted that, although the date for compliance was initially set at 25 February 2011 in respect of what I have called the second notice, the first communication by the plaintiff with the ATO in respect of it was on 23 February, when Mr Nath wrote to offer security by way of mortgage. There was no explanation for this delay which, on the face of it, appears to be entirely within the plaintiff's control and as a result of her decision. There was no evidence that, had the plaintiff acted promptly on receipt of the notices on 12 January, it would have been difficult to provide the required security by way of mortgage (had that been the plaintiff's choice) well before the compliance date for that notice, a fortiori for the notices requiring compliance by 11 March. The incidents of executing and registering a mortgage are notoriously the commonplace of a solicitor's work. Mr Nath never suggested the slightest difficulty in this respect. Furthermore, it is self evident that, although this was not expressly stated, the provision of security would necessarily have been at the expense of the taxpayer, otherwise the security would not have covered the amount specified. 

18The plaintiff notes that, on 23 March, Mr Burns for the first time imposed the condition that the caveats be withdrawn and the legal costs of $5,000 be paid as a precondition. As to these matters, the plaintiff obtained a significant extension of time. There is no evidence that the requirement as to the caveats could not be complied with within the new timeframe or, for that matter, that the amount in respect of costs could not be paid by then. It is true that the Commissioner did not seek to justify the costs except in a general way. However, Mr Nath did not propose any lesser sum as appropriate and there was no evidence that, in light of the ATO's experience in this regard, the amount was unreasonable especially given the undertaking to repay any excess. (During argument I expressed the view that the sum seemed excessive but this was not the case actually sought to be made before the Magistrate.) The case sought to be made before me was that the requirement should not have been imposed without giving a proper basis by way of quote or costs agreement in respect of the amount. Even if this were so, I am unable to see how the refusal to pay it - accepting this was the reason for not entering into security, as to which there is really no evidence - was rendered impossible in any relevant sense. The need for a reasonable time to be allowed is obvious: it must be actually possible, by reasonable diligence, to comply with the requirement. However, the plaintiff also submits that it is necessary that the conditions for compliance, such as the requirement of prepayment of legal costs, be reasonable. I do not agree that this is necessary in the same sense. It is obviously possible to comply with a requirement (otherwise within the person's capacity), even if that requirement is unreasonable. The argument about this matter is rather unreal in light of the failure by the plaintiff to lead any evidence at all on the amount of costs usually applicable to the preparation of a mortgage. I do not consider that the Commissioner bore any onus of proving that the requirement of an upfront payment for legal costs in the sum of $5,000 with an undertaking to refund any excess was reasonable. At all events, the requirement strikes me as completely reasonable. 

19The plaintiff complains that the extension of time granted on 23 March to 28 March gave her only five clear working days to ""raise $5,000 and forward it to the Commissioner; ... wait for the Commissioner to arrange for the preparation of the security documentation; ... obtain legal advice in respect of the documentation; ... execute the mortgage documents; ... and wait for the Commissioner to register the mortgage documents"". It is significant, to my mind, that Mr Nath did not complain about this extension. It was only on 30 March that Mr Nath raised a problem about the prepayment. He did not suggest that it was difficult, let alone impossible, to pay this sum and there was no evidence before the Magistrate that suggested this was the case. It is enough to say that I do not accept this contention. There is no reason to think that the time frame was not adequate, even if it might have been difficult to comply with.

20So far as the April notices were concerned, it is submitted that the time for compliance with the requirements notified on 31 May 2011 was unreasonable. The first point to be made is that Mr Nath, when he received the letter, did not suggest this was so and the only problems he raised were on 1 June about the letter of independent advice and on 3 June related to negotiations with the caveators. There was no disclosure, let alone evidence, as to the nature of these negotiations and it is impossible to evaluate their significance. The other conditions were patently able to be quickly satisfied. Furthermore, they were obvious requirements which any reasonably competent solicitor would have foreseen. It is fair to observe that Mr Nath did not suggest he did not have the information, let alone that he was surprised by the request for it.

21The plaintiff described the Commissioner's insistence on prepayment of the legal costs as an unreasonable withdrawal of cooperation. It is firstly argued (but not before the Magistrate) that there was no power to require such a down payment. Section 255-100 empowers the Commissioner to require a person ""to give security for due payment of an existing or future tax-related liability"" but not, it is argued, to require payment of the costs. Thus, it is said, the plaintiff was entitled to dispute it. In my view, the clear import of the power is that the costs of compliance lay with the taxpayer and it is necessarily incidental to permitting a taxpayer to provide security otherwise than by deposit or bank guarantee (necessarily to be obtained at the taxpayer's expense) that the costs of so doing be paid by the taxpayer. That the Commissioner required the work to be performed by one of the solicitors on its panel whose bill would be paid by the taxpayer is, to my mind, plainly within the power of the Commissioner as ancillary to the compliance regime. Not only was it lawful, it is for the reasons I have mentioned reasonable. At all events, the fact that a taxpayer disputes the reasonableness of a requirement does not make it impossible to comply with: the simple fact is that the plaintiff (for reasons which may have seemed justifiable to her) decided she would not comply.

22The prosecution accepted that it bore the onus of establishing the failure of the plaintiff in the relevant sense to provide the required security. It was necessary that it prove beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff's failure was intentional. A refinement of this element was the argument raised by the plaintiff that the omission to provide the security was not a failure in the relevant sense if it was impossible for the plaintiff to comply with the requirement. 

23The only evidence that the plaintiff was, as was contended in the Local Court and here, ""ready willing and able to provide security by way of mortgage"" was contained in the communications of Mr Nath. This was not an adequate basis for concluding this was in fact the position. Nor did they provide a sound evidentiary basis for the assertion that, in fact, the plaintiff did all that she could to comply with the notices. There was no evidence at all as to what she could or did do, except as asserted by Mr Nath. Quite apart from the delays to which I have already referred, there was no evidence, let alone explanation as to why the plaintiff could not - as distinct from would not - comply with the notices by adopting the alternative courses. The contention advanced on the plaintiff's behalf was her impecuniosity prevented it. The evidence said to support this contention was the imposition of a direct penalty of about $5 million, the service in March 2011 of a bankruptcy notice by the Commissioner, and the total sum of security sought, including in a previous notice relating to other companies of which she was a director. Quite apart from the fact that Mr Nath never suggested the plaintiff was impecunious or otherwise unable to adopt the alternatives, it is self evident that the mere existence of substantial debts or even of a creditor having taken the step of issuing a Bankruptcy Notice does not imply the impecuniosity of the debtor: many very wealthy persons have very substantial liabilities. Nor can it raise a doubt about the ability to pay. 

24Although I accept that the Commissioner bore the onus of establishing that the security was not provided as required and that this was due to the intentional act or omission of the taxpayer, the issue of impossibility because of impecuniosity was not raised by the evidence such as to require the Commissioner to prove that the taxpayer had the means to comply with any of the stipulated alternatives. 

25It is also contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the conduct was involuntary or, more precisely, that the Commissioner failed to prove it was voluntary. This argument also depends upon the alleged impecuniosity of the plaintiff, the unreasonableness of the timeframes imposed for compliance and the submission that the Commissioner withheld cooperation by making compliance by way of mortgage conditional upon down payment of the legal costs. For the reasons already given, this submission is without merit. The new argument is raised under this head that, by the time it became clear that ""the parties could not reach agreement in the preparation of the mortgage documents it was impractical to obtain the necessary cheques or bank guarantees"" (emphasis added). This submission cannot be accepted. That the parties did not reach agreement is plain, but this is by no means the same as agreement not being possible. Patently, it was possible for the plaintiff to have agreed with the Commissioner's requirements. Nor is there any evidence which suggests the impracticability, let alone the impossibility of the plaintiff complying by using the alternative methods. 

26The involuntariness argument was also put by way of contending that the Magistrate erred in concluding that the Plaintiff's failure to provide security was intentional. It is not improved by being recast in this way. In my respectful view the conclusion of his Honour about this matter was not only correct: it was inevitable.

Conclusion

27The summons is dismissed with costs.

		31 July 2014",2014-07-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764467,R v McKnight (No. 4) [2014] NSWSC 1029,"Judgment
1By majority verdict delivered on 8th May 2014, the Jury found the offender not guilty of the murder of Stafford David Ray, but guilty of manslaughter.  
2The principles of law governing the sentencing of an offender who has been found guilty by the verdict of a jury are well known and require no exposition by me (See for example Chung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1).  It is my responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence.  And it is for me to make a decision as to the degree of culpability, and about all other facts relevant to sentencing.  Determining the question of culpability requires me to identify why the offender is guilty.
3There were two real issues in the case.  The first was whether when he assaulted Mr Ray, the offender intended to seriously injure him. If not he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter because of his plea.  The second was whether the offender was entitled to have any criminal liability for murder reduced to manslaughter by reason of the defence of substantial impairment by an abnormality of the mind.  The Crown, of course, bore the burden of proving the requisite intent beyond reasonable doubt.  But the offender carried the burden of making good the defence if it arose on the balance of probabilities.
4I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when he assaulted Mr Ray the offender intended to inflict really serious personal injury.  I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused has made good his defence of substantial impairment.
Circumstances of the assault
5The offender's assault upon Mr Ray happened in the very early hours of the 25th of March 2012 near the corner of George and Goulburn Streets in the City of Sydney.  The assault was captured on public CCTV cameras.  A compilation of the various recordings, depicting what happened more or less continuously, was tendered at the Trial and in my judgment represents the best, most reliable evidence of what happened.
6Mr Ray was sitting on the footpath of George Street with his back leaning against the wall of a shop.  He was with a friend named Sarah Mathieson.  When first depicted, the offender is seen standing near the corner, perhaps speaking to Mr Ray.  While I cannot be definitive, he appears intoxicated. There is no issue that he had been drinking heavily earlier that night at the greyhound races, and later at licensed premises in the city, a total period of about 5 hours.  He had also smoked ""several cones of cannabis"" earlier in the day before going out.  
7According to Ms Mathieson's evidence, not all of which I found reliable because much of it was inconsistent with what is depicted on the CCTV footage, the offender sat down beside her and Mr Ray.
8The CCTV footage then shows the offender getting to his feet quickly and kicking Mr Ray a number of times very forcibly about the head and chest area.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were at least three kicks, as depicted on the CCTV footage.  There may have been more, but I am unable to so find.  The precise number does not matter a great deal.  The CCTV footage clearly shows Mr Ray's head moving back fast against the wall in response to the kicking.
9The offender then left the scene of the attack, going towards another bar closer to central station, where he was refused admission.  The doorman who gave evidence said he was behaving strangely and appeared affected by alcohol.  One of Mr. Ray's associate's told the security guard what had happened and the latter chased the offender and apprehended him.  Police officers patrolling George Street spotted the security guard holding the offender on the ground and stopped.  They received a report of the assault upon Mr Ray and arrested the offender. When asked for an explanation he said that Mr Ray had stolen $250 from him.  This was not correct.  But the question of the offender's belief in that matter assumes some significance in the evidence because of his psychotic mental illness.  Whilst the police were talking to the offender ambulance officers called by them arrived and attended to Mr Ray.
Mr Ray's condition
10Mr Ray did not lose consciousness in the assault.  He was able to tell the ambulance officer ""I've been assaulted and kicked in the head"".  The ambulance officer noticed, however, that his speech was slurred, but was unsure whether that was because of the alcohol he smelt or a head injury.  On examination, he noticed a large haematoma on the right side of Mr Ray's head towards the back.  The ambulance officer became concerned about the possibility of a head injury and asked Mr Ray to come to the ambulance where the light was better.  Mr Ray was able to stand up on his own and walk to the ambulance.  The ambulance officer's paramedical observations were within normal limits.  The ambulance officer suggested that Mr Ray accompany him to the hospital to undergo more detailed examination and he agreed.
11Before Mr Ray left for the hospital he spoke with one of the police officers, and complained of being kicked.  Mr Ray was unsure whether he wanted charges brought against the offender.  He wanted time to think about it.  In these circumstances, the police officers released the offender.  When spoken to again by the police officers at the hospital, Mr Ray was still unsure of what he wanted to do.
12I am providing seemingly peripheral detail because the series of events which led to Mr Ray's death were in a sense quite unexpected.  I hasten to point out, however, that the accused, quite properly, accepts that his acts were the legal cause of Mr Ray's death.
13Dr Issabella Brouwer, a specialist forensic pathologist, gave evidence relating to the autopsy conducted by her.  She described external injuries to Mr Ray's face, head and upper right arm, which were consistent with the consequences of being kicked.  But most significantly, she found a subdural haemorrhage to the left side of the brain, a significant traumatic brain injury.  She said the usual mechanism of injury was an acceleration/ deceleration injury to the head and the brain within the skull cavity.  She had viewed the CCTV footage and described two kicks to the left side of Mr Ray's head resulting in his head moving uncontrollably backwards and forwards and impacting against the brick wall.  She said those events had all of the elements that are ideal for the development of a subdural haemorrhage (118.15T). It does not matter that the external injury was to the right side of the head.   Mr Ray also had evidence of brain atrophy probably due to alcohol abuse which would have provided more space for movement of the brain within the skull making it easier for the haemorrhage to occur.  
14What caused Mr Ray's death was the accumulation of blood from the haemorrhage occupying the space within the skull raising pressure on the brain.  That pressure on the brain, untreated, eventually causes death.  But a person who suffers such an injury may appear fine over a period of time before developing symptoms of raised intracranial pressure leading to loss of consciousness and death (119.30T).  Dr. Brouwer also said that a subdural haemorrhage is readily diagnosable on a CT Scan.  Death is not inevitable, but a patient's survival depends upon how soon a diagnosis is made to allow for prompt medical intervention.  Absent a CT scan the clinical signs of this type of brain injury may be confused with severe intoxication.  An intoxicated person may be unaware of having suffered a head injury, go to sleep and ""literally"" die in his sleep. There is no doubt that Mr Ray was heavily intoxicated.  At the time of his death, his blood alcohol reading was 0.248, and he did not die until some hours after the assault. 
What happened at the hospital
15 When they arrived at the hospital there was a long backlog of waiting ambulances and the ambulance officers had to stay with Mr Ray for about an hour.  He remained conscious at all times.  He was allocated a bed at about 2:50 am before the ambulance officers departed.
16Mr Ray was triaged by a qualified nursing sister who recognised the possibility of traumatic brain injury.  Of course, not everyone can be seen at once and Mr Ray was not assessed as in the most urgent group.  As I understand the evidence, he was placed in the second order of priority.  It was a very busy night but once examined by a doctor, doubtless, a CT scan would have been arranged.  
17He was also examined by an experienced registered nurse at 2:30 a.m. and again at 3:30 a.m.  She was aware that he might have suffered a head injury because she administered the Glasgow Coma Scale on each occasion.  On the second occasion, Mr Ray was combative and non-compliant.  This may have been due in part to his head injury.  He refused to remain in the bed and was allowed to sit in the emergency department waiting room which he apparently preferred.  At that time he was still on the waiting list for a CT scan.  
18Some time after 3:30 am, Mr Ray decided to leave the hospital.  He was still wearing his hospital ID bracelet and the hospital's ""sats probe"" was still in situ.  He must have layed down in Green Park near the hospital under a tree where he was found at about 2:30 p.m. that day.  I have no doubt that he died in his sleep some hours earlier in accordance with the mechanism described by Dr. Brouwer.
19Mr Ray died from effects of the head injury inflicted by the offender.  The treatment he received at the hospital is not in issue in this case.  It simply forms part of the narrative of fact surrounding Mr Ray's death.  There is no evidence from which I could adjudge its adequacy and it is not relevant to any issue in the case for me to attempt to do so.
Finding about intention
20There can be no doubt that the traumatic brain injury by way of subdural haematoma suffered by Mr Ray was a really serious injury.  But that is not the point; the question is, did the offender mean to really seriously injure Mr Ray.  I bear in mind that a person's intention can only really be proved by circumstantial evidence.  And that to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, I must conclude that an intention to inflict really serious personal injury is the only rational inference I can draw from all the circumstances established by the evidence.  Moreover, the offender's obvious level of intoxication is relevant.  It is necessary for the Crown to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that despite his intoxication, the offender intended to inflict really serious injury on Mr Ray.
21In his own mind, the offender had a reason to harm Mr Ray.  He thought he had stolen from him.  His attack on Mr Ray was in retaliation for that perceived wrong.  As depicted on the CCTV the attack is one of some ferocity involving a series of forceful kicks during which Mr Ray's head was forced back into the wall.
22It is not necessary to find that the offender intended to inflict the traumatic brain injury from which Mr Ray would die.  But I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had the specific intent of inflicting really serious personally injury of some kind when he kicked Mr Ray. I am satisfied that is the only rational inference available from the nature of the assault, the offender's intent to retaliate for a perceived wrong, and the evidence that he heard a voice say ""Get him, get him.""
Substantial impairment
23I turn then to the second issue, whether the offender has made out the partial defence of substantial impairment.
24My finding that the offender kicked Mr Ray intending to really seriously injure him is in substance a finding that the offender was guilty of murdering Mr Ray subject only to this partial defence reducing his criminal liability from murder to manslaughter.  As intent and substantial impairment were the only issues put before the jury for determination, it follows if I am to find facts consistent only with their verdict, that the defence of substantial impairment succeeds.  For no other matter reducing murder to manslaughter arises on the evidence lead in this case.
25Even so, it is appropriate that I set out my findings about substantial impairment. The same facts are also relevant to other aspects of sentencing.
26The partial defence of substantial impairment is established if the accused proves on the balance of probabilities the following matters:
(a)At the time he kicked Mr Ray, his capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental or physiological condition; and 
(b)The impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
27The first element is simply a question of fact.  I am comfortably satisfied on the evidence that it has been made out.  I have had the benefit of evidence from two experienced forensic psychiatrists, Dr. Olav Nielssen, qualified on behalf of the offender, and Dr. Stephen Allnutt, qualified on behalf of the Crown.  Both doctors diagnosed the offender as suffering from schizophrenia.  Dr. Nielssen referred to it as a chronic schizophrenia.  As I understand Dr. Allnutt's evidence, although there are possible differential diagnoses, on balance he would describe the offender's disease as a paranoid schizophrenia or a schizo-effective disorder.
28These diagnoses are not based upon a single medico-legal examination.  From the other evidence consisting of what was referred to as the longitudinal history, and his subsequent treatment by Justice Health whilst in custody, it is, with the benefit of hindsight, clear that the offender has suffered from this disease for many years.  
29The documented history starts when he was 17 and he attempted suicide with an overdose of Temazepam tablets he had been prescribed for depression.  At the time, along with depression, he felt like he did not fit in, and that he had lost his personality.  There is no history of delusions or perceptual disturbance then, but his affect was incongruent to his mood.  He gave a history of smoking cannabis.  He was transferred to Rozelle Hospital from Canterbury and the differential diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood and drug-induced psychosis with schizophrenic form was made.  
30He was readmitted to Rozelle Hospital in February 2007.  He had been threatening to kill people by stabbing them and was threatening self-harm.  On mental state examination, he was found to have grandiose, delusional thinking.  His mood was elevated but he was guarded and paranoid.  He believed he was special and could communicate with God who sent him messages.  At that time the diagnosis of a drug induced manic episode was made and he was treated with anti-psychotic medication.
31He received treatment for some months during the first half of 2007.  He was non-compliant with medication and he continued to use cannabis.  Further treatment occurred during 2010.
32He gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence that at the time of this offending he was not compliant with his antipsychotic medication.  He told Dr. Nielssen that  when he was not taking it he was hearing voices telling him what to do including to kill himself.
33Dr Allnutt's history was somewhat more detailed.  The voices had commenced at the age of 17, initially as a mumbling sound which became clearer over the time.  The voices instructed him to self-harm and told him to do other things.
34He told both doctors that when he was sitting talking to Mr Ray he formed the belief that Mr Ray had taken $200 from his pocket.  He heard the voice saying ""Get him, get him"" just before the assault.  
35I am satisfied that the offender's belief that Mr Ray had stolen from him was entirely erroneous.  There was no evidence of Mr Ray having a sum as large as $200 on him when his body was recovered, and he had no opportunity either to spend it or bank it. 
36Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt differ about whether that erroneous belief is a delusion.  Put simply, Dr. Allnutt thought it was insufficiently bizarre to qualify. One may wrongly believe something without irrationality. Objective irrationality forms part of his definition of delusion.  Dr Nielssen thought it was a delusion.  He proffered the definition of false belief in which the patient persists notwithstanding that it is shown to be clearly wrong.  I accept Dr Nielssen's evidence about this.  Largely because his is a workable, understandable definition of delusion.  Dr Allnutt's approach, with great respect, is too subjective to be workable.
37I accept the evidence of Dr Allnutt that persons who suffer from schizophrenic pychosis, who go off their medication will become acutely unwell again.
38Dr Allnutt expressed the view (at 247.40T) that if the offender was paranoid and experiencing auditory hallucinations urging him to ""get"" Mr Ray, then it is reasonable to conclude that the underlying condition of schizophrenia was an abnormality of mind that impaired his capacity to understand events at the time of the offending.  
39Since his arrest the offender has been receiving treatment from Justice Health in prison who also diagnosed schizophrenia and have treated him with antipsychotic medication.  He has been compliant with the medication and his condition has improved since about July 2012.  By the end of 2012 he was not experiencing visual or auditory hallucinations, although he stated he was having poor sleep.  By February 2014, the diagnosis was schizophrenia with symptoms controlled with medication.
40I accept the evidence that the offender has suffered from schizophrenia for many years and that during the years leading up to his offending and arrest, he was non-compliant with his medication and was subject to acute symptoms, including delusions and auditory hallucinations.  I accept that he formed an irrational belief that Mr Ray had stolen from him on 25th March 2012 and that he kicked him in response to voices he heard telling him to ""get him"".
41From this evidence, I find on the balance of probabilities that at the time he kicked Mr Ray the accused's capacity: to understand the events; for moral judgment; and for self control, were substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind arising from his pre-existing disease of schizophrenia.
42The next question is whether the offender's impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  Again, I observe that the Jury's verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter admits of only one answer to this question.  But, I bear in mind that at the time of his offending, the offender was in a state of self-induced intoxication and that I am to disregard its effects for the purpose of answering this question.  
43Answering this question involves the making of a value judgment.  The question is whether legal responsibility for the most serious crime of murder should be attributed to the offender.  Central, but not necessarily decisive, is whether the impairment is substantial enough to justify the reduction in criminal liability. All the circumstances of the case need to be considered.  Part of the rationale underlying the defence, is that frequently, but not always, the criminal acts of the mentally ill justify less severe punishment than the criminal acts of persons of ordinary capacity.  
44Given that I accept that his disease was actually symptomatic at the time he assaulted Mr Ray and because of my acceptance of the opinions of the psychiatrists, that those symptoms impaired his mental capacity, disregarding the effects of his self-induced intoxication, I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that his impairment based upon his schizophrenia was so substantial at that time of the offending that a reduction in his liability from murder to manslaughter was warranted.
45For the purposes of sentencing then, I am satisfied that the offender kicked Mr Ray intending to really seriously injure him, but that the impairment of his capacity to understand events, to make moral judgments, and for self control was so substantially impaired as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter and I will sentence him on that basis.
Impact of the offending on family victims
46Before dealing with the other matters relevant to the sentence I must pass upon the offender, I wish to say that I have had the great benefit of hearing Victim Impact Statements from three of Mr Ray's close relatives: his father, his sister and his daughter.  As the learned Crown Prosecutor opened the case to the Jury, Mr Ray's status as a homeless man did not define him.  Homeless he may have been at the time of his death, but he was certainly not unloved.  
47From his father's statement I understand that Mr Ray was a beautiful child, witty, intelligent and well behaved.  He was also a prodigy in music. I understood him to be a talented jazz player, playing professionally in his teens.  Unfortunately, older musicians introduced him to heroin and he became a drug addict in his late teens.  He made many attempts at rehabilitation, was able to work, marry and become the father of two daughters.  His drug addiction and the two years he spent in prison following his conviction for the manslaughter of his mother seem to have derailed his life and prospects of rehabilitation. His conviction was overturned and a re-trial ordered (see R v Ray [2003] NSWCCA 227; 57 NSWLR 616).  I infer from what Mr Ray said that the prosecution did not proceed to retrial.  (See Ray at 634 [121]).  Mr Ray kept in touch with his son and met with him once every two months.  He was hoping to help his son return to the family and to broader civil society.  Now that hope has gone.  He feels the loss of his son very keenly.
48Mr Ray's daughter has suffered greatly since her father died. As she put it herself, she has twice suffered a nervous breakdown because of the aggravation of a pre-existing anxiety disorder brought about by her father's death.  Mr Ray's sister has been very anxious since his death and cannot be as happy, or content, as she was formerly.
49I fully accept that the family will labour permanently under their sense of loss.
50I cannot leave this section of my reasons without saying that I received as evidence a letter from Mr Robert McKnight, the offender's father (Exhibit 7). In part he wrote:
Both the Ray family and our family have been through an extremely traumatic and difficult time for more than 2 years now.  The Ray family and our family will always be tied together due to what happened on that tragic night in 2012.
During the Trial, I gave a handwritten note of apology to Mr Ray's family and received a generous heartfelt and humble response that I passed on to Michael and that we are grateful for.
51In his Victim Impact Statement Mr. Ray said:
However, my heart goes out to Michael McKnight's family.  My sadness will be with me until I die.  But their's has a longer time to run.  I wish them the strength to face what lies ahead.  I know they love him and will continue to love him unconditionally, as parents do, and I do hope Michael comes out the other end with the wisdom to earn their pride and bring them peace.
52I wish to say that I have been touched and impressed by the spirit of reconciliation between the Ray and McKnight families.  Their spirit is a fine example to all of us.
53However, I am bound to acknowledge that this spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness ""cannot be allowed to interfere with a proper exercise of sentencing discretion"" (Efthimiadis v R [2013] NSWCCA 276 at [67] per Johnson J).  Serious crime is a wrong against the community at large and the community is entitled to exact punishment.
The offender's circumstances
54The offender was aged 27 in March 2012 and 29 now.  He was raised by a supportive family and is the youngest of three children.  He was educated to year 12 and worked with his father as an electrician except when incapacitated by his psychiatric disease.  His electrician father has now retired, as has his primary school teacher mother.  He has been able to maintain relationships.
55He committed a ""car-jacking"" offence as an older juvenile in 2002.  I record that this was shortly after the first manifestation of his mental illness.  As an adult he has one conviction for the offence of ""goods in custody"" for which he was serving a good behaviour bond at the time of this offending, a circumstances which aggravates it.  Nonetheless considered overall, his prior record does not suggest that he is a person who habitually disregards the law, or is otherwise of bad character, especially when viewed through the prism of his mental illness.
56I have set out the history of his mental illness above and will not recite it here.  It represents a most significant factor to be borne in mind as I will explain.  
57An updated report of Dr Nielssen of 5th June 2014 was tendered (Exhibit 6).  This expert expressed the view that because of the offender's compliance with the antipsychotic treatment he has received in gaol, his chronic schizophrenia is in remission and he remains free of the acute symptoms of his illness.
58As I have said, while in custody he has fully complied with his medication regime and he has been of good conduct.  There is one exception to this.  He failed a prescribed urine test on 5th June 2014 for which he was punished.  He gave evidence explaining that the drug he had taken was a prescription sleeping tablet which he had obtained from another inmate.  He has complained to doctors who have treated him in prison of a difficulty sleeping.  He apologised for the breach and, whilst it should be borne in mind, a solitary failure does not detract much from the impression of good conduct otherwise created. 
59During the course of his evidence, he expressed remorse for his offending.  This expression of remorse was not challenged in cross-examination.  Moreover, in a letter by his own hand, (Exhibit 8) he expressed his sorrow and remorse for the death of Mr Ray.  He also stated his determination to remain on treatment for his illness ""for the rest of [his] life"".  
60I appreciate that it sometimes behoves judges to be slow to accept expressions of remorse made for the purpose of sentencing.  However, the offender has given, as I have said, unchallenged sworn testimony, has expressed himself in writing, and his father, who seems to be a thoroughly decent and respectable person, states that his son has accepted responsibility for his offending.  Mr McKnight's impression is that his son's remorse and sadness is genuine.  I accept all of this evidence.
61The offender has expressed to his parents his determination to live a good life upon his eventual release from prison.  He told Dr Nielssen that once classified, he hopes to be able to undertake the necessary trade training to equip him to qualify as a licensed electrician.  It may be that his prospects for rehabilitation depend in some measure upon him continuing to be compliant with his medication and avoiding substance abuse.  But he has done well so far.  His past record, given his mental illness, is also encouraging in this regard.  On the evidence available to me, I would regard his prospects of rehabilitation as being better than reasonable. 
62As further evidence of the acceptance of responsibility, it is common ground that the offender offered to plead guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court before he was committed for trial and this offer was rejected by the Crown.  It is also common ground that the utilitarian value of the offer, given the Jury's verdict, ought to be recognised by a conventional discount on the maximum sentence that would otherwise be imposed (R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15 at [17] - [21]; R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 [41] - [44]).
Consideration
63The nature of the sentencing task is to fix the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender, having regard to all relevant facts, matters and circumstances.  A sentence must fit the offending having regard to its objective seriousness; that is the offender must be adequately punished for his offending.  At the same time, a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the crime.
64I bear in mind that the maximum penalty for manslaughter under s 24 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is imprisonment for 25 years. This not a case to which s 25A of that Act applies as the offending precedes its enactment. It would not apply anyway because of the offender's mental illness which is a significant cognitive impairment for the purpose of that provision.  
65It goes without saying, I think, that no penalty other than a period of imprisonment is appropriate in this case.  
66The starting point of assessing the objective seriousness of any case of manslaughter is the consideration that the offender by his violent conduct took a human life (Mundo v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 87 ALJR 1035 ([53] - [55]).  The general rule is that it is necessary that violent offending be justly punished to vindicate the human dignity of the victim, to protect the community and to deter the offender and others.  Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence.
67The Court must eschew any attempt to put cases of manslaughter into preconceived categories.  Such categories do not exist.  Each offending must be assessed by reference to all of its circumstances.
68Moreover as the Crown submissions point out, at least on one level, this offending ""called for the express and demonstrable application of the element of general deterrence as a powerful factor on sentence"" (R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120).  This followed because, as is clear from the facts as I have stated them, the offending in this case consisted of an unprovoked attack upon an unsuspecting and vulnerable member of the public, lawfully present on a public street by an offender intoxicated by too much alcohol and some cannabis.  These considerations bespeak significant objective seriousness.
69In Loveridge (at [216] - [217]) the Court of Criminal Appeal said:
... the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place is of great concern to the community, and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence.....

General deterrence and retribution are elements that must assume greater importance when the crime in question is a serious one, has been committed in a particularly grave form and its contemporary prevalence is the cause of considerable community disquiet: R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 299.
70In R v MD [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A CrimR 372 at 387 [65], the Court of Criminal Appeal said:
In many cases where an offender is convicted of manslaughter there will be exculpatory matters and personal circumstances that can lead the court to significantly ameliorate the sentence which might otherwise be imposed. However, as this Court pointed out in R v Troja (unreported, CCA 16 July 1991) it is important for the court to ensure that the subjective circumstances of an individual offender do not divert the court from imposing a sentence which adequately reflects the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and in punishing those who take it.
71However, the difficulty in this particular case, as the Crown submissions also recognised, is the part played by the offender's undoubted psychiatric illness. This consideration distinguishes this case considerably from cases involving manslaughter by dangerous and unlawful act where an offender has set out to either wreak havoc, engage in affray or give vent to a violent self-gratification.
72The purposes of sentencing, and the principles which inform them, ""overlap"".  And as ""guideposts"" they ""sometimes ... point in different directions"" (Veen v the Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476).
73The need for emphatic justice in the present case must be ameliorated to a degree by the offender's undoubted psychiatric illness, which in large measure, but not solely, accounts for his offending.  I accept his intoxication and his non-compliance with his medication also played a, somewhat lesser, part. His experience of his illness would have made him aware of the effect of cannabis on his symptoms and that his symptoms would be worse if he was non compliant with medication. But one cannot expect a person with schizophrenia to be completely rational.
74There are certain well recognised principles that come into play when sentencing a person suffering from mental illness, especially where as here, the mental illness was a significant cause of the commission of the offence.  In such cases, the impairments arising from the mental illness substantially reduce the offender's moral culpability for the offence.  
75I am conscious that this offender's criminal liability has been reduced by his reason of his substantial impairment, but his condition continues to have relevance for sentencing purposes.  Moral culpability, as distinct from legal liability, is an issue of particular relevance in sentencing (see Chung).  Moreover, ""the retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of [a mentally ill] offender and to the needs of the community.""  Muldrock v the Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 139 [54].  Additionally, it is well recognised that general deterrence should ""often be given very little weight"" in the case of the mentally ill ""because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others"" (R v Mooney (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (Vic), 21 June 1978). 
76The relevance of specific deterrence may also be diminished (R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [41] - 42]).
77I recognise that the application of these principles relating to mental illness does not always lead to a lesser sentence than that which would be imposed upon an offender of ordinary capacity.   (Veen No. 2 at 476 - 477; R v Engbert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at [71]).  Sometimes an offender's mental illness will make him a particular danger to the community. This factor which may require a heavier sentence, proportionate to the offending, than that appropriate in the case of an offender of ordinary capacity.  Moreover, in a given case, a need for specific deterrence of the offender may have a similar effect.  
78It is the interplay of the principles discussed in Loveridge with these principles relating to the effect of mental illness which is most significant in determining the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the present case.
79There is no suggestion in the present case that the offender presents a particular danger to the public.  True this offending occurred whilst he was at liberty conditionally.  And that suggests a degree of disregard of the law.  However, despite some aggression in his presentation when florid as disclosed by the past medical history, there is no history of actual violence and his criminal record as an adult does not suggest it.  The bond was not imposed for a crime of violence.  He has good insight and conducts himself well when he is compliant with medication.
80On the other hand, I accept that his mental illness does not eliminate the need for considerations of specific deterrence in the present case.  That need is engaged by him breaching his bond and by his long history prior to this offending of non-compliance with his medication and the abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, which contributed to his offending.  From his knowledge and experience he should know that cannabis aggravates his symptoms.
81I accept his remorse is genuine and rehabilitation prospects are better than reasonable if he remains abstinent and compliant.  I accept that his mental illness reduces his moral culpability, diminishes to a degree the emphasis on retribution for and denunciation of drunken violent offences in public streets, and greatly diminishes the utility of general deterrence in this case.  
82Even so, it is necessary to impose a sentence ""which adequately reflects the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and punishing those who take it"" (R v MD at [65]).   The offender's mental illness plays a central part in significantly ameliorating the sentence which might otherwise be imposed.  However, this amelioration only goes so far.  It remains necessary to impose a sentence which reflects the serious objective circumstances of this offending.  
83I think it appropriate to allow a 25 per cent discount on the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed to reflect the utilitarian value of the offender's offer to plead guilty to manslaughter at an early stage.  But for this I would have imposed a term of imprisonment just shy of 11 years.  This discount reduces the sentence to one of 8 years.  
84I am required to fix a non-parole period reflecting the minimum term that justice requires the offender to serve before release into the community.  It should not be thought that release at the expiration of the minimum term is a foregone conclusion.  It will depend upon many things, including the offender's continued good conduct whilst in prison.  The question of whether the offender will be released is not for this Court.  It's a decision that will be made according to law by the appropriate branch of the executive government in due course.
85There is a statutory relationship between the head sentence and non-parole period which may only be varied by a finding of special circumstances.  To establish special circumstances, the offender relies upon the opinion of Dr Nielssen that a longer period of parole in the offender's case may be protective against relapse to substance abuse and non-compliance with treatment.  On the other hand, Dr Nielssen assesses the offender's prospects of adhering to treatment and abstinence favourably.  Moreover, as the Crown argue, the statutory ratio is likely to provide a long period of supervision in the circumstances of this case in any event.  I accept this submission.  In all the circumstances of the present case, I am not persuaded that a longer period is necessary and accordingly special circumstances have not been made out.  The non-parole period will be 6 years and I will backdate the sentence to 3rd April 2012 to take account of fulltime custody served whilst awaiting trial.
86Michael McKnight, by its verdict the Jury convicted you of the manslaughter of Stafford David Ray on 25th March 2012.   I sentence you to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 3rd April 2012 and expiring on 2nd April 2018 with an additional term of 2 years commencing on 3rd April 2018 and expiring on 2nd April 2020.  The first date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 3rd April 2018.**********

		31 July 2014",2014-07-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764470,R v Hill [2014] NSWSC 1010,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1On 11 November 2013 Gregory Wayne Hill (""the offender"") pleaded guilty to the murder of Jakob Owen Brown (""Jakob"") on 3 March 2008 at The Oakes in the State of New South Wales.    The matter had been listed before me on that day for the purposes of determining a number of issues in advance of the offender's trial which had been due to commence on 18 November 2013.  At the time of his death, Jakob was 2 years and 7 months of age.
2The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment (Crimes Act 1900 s. 19A).  In light of the fact that Jakob was under the age of 18 at the time of his death, a standard non-parole period of 25 years is prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"").  The decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 sets out the approach to be taken when sentencing an offender for an offence in respect of which a standard non-parole period is prescribed.
3Victim impact statements were read to the court on behalf of: 
(i)Darren Gibson, Jakob's father; and  (ii)Bethanie Gibson, Jakob's sister.  
4Once again, I take this opportunity of expressing my sympathy to the members of Jakob's family.  As I remarked at the time at which the statements were read to the Court, it is to be hoped that the opportunity that Mr Gibson and Bethanie have each been given to provide a statement will assist their process of grieving.  
5On 1 July 2014, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Family Member Victim Impact Statement) Act 2014 (""the amending Act"") commenced.  The amending Act inserts a new s. 28(4) into the Sentencing Act in the following terms:
""A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community"".  
6The effect of that amendment is that it abolishes the principle expressed in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 regarding the relevance, on sentence, of a victim impact statement by a member of the family of the deceased, dealing with the effect of the death of the victim upon the family.    
7Clause [5] of Schedule 1 of the amending Act provides that the amendments made to the Sentencing Act shall apply to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed unless, before the commencement of the amendments:
(a)the court has convicted the person being sentenced of the offence; or 
(b)a court has accepted a plea of guilty and the plea has not been withdrawn.
8I have already noted that in the present case the offender entered a plea of guilty on 11 November 2013.  The provisions of the amending Act therefore have no application to the present case.  The principles set out in Previtera (supra) and Bollen (supra) continue to apply.
THE FACTS9An agreed statement of facts was tendered on sentence which was in the following terms:
""1. Jakob Owen Brown was born on 8th August 2005. His mother, Tracey Brown commenced a domestic relationship with the offender in March or April 2006.
2. After this relationship began Jakob began to show signs of having been physically abused after occasions when he had been in the sole care of the offender.
3. On 25th September 2006, after Jakob had been left in the care of the offender, he was found with a bruise and swelling to the occipital region of his head and a petechial rash on the face, neck and shoulders.  Such a rash is caused by increased venal pressure. No organic or biological cause could be identified.
4. On 17th October 2006, Jakob presented with further petechial and subconjunctival haemorrhages. Dr Dunstan referred Jakob to a Paediatric Haemotologist for further investigation.
5. On 26th April 2007, again after Jakob had been left in the offender's sole care, his mother returned home to find Jakob with bruising and swelling to the head and face and petechial rashes around the head, neck and shoulders and blood in his nappy. No organic cause could be found by treating doctors and specialists.
6. Soon after this, the offender admitted himself to a facility for treatment of his ""depression and inability to cope"". The offender was so confined from 10th May until his discharge on 6th June 2007. During the period of the offender's confinement, Jakob did not suffer any unexplained injury or rash.
7. Following his discharge from voluntary hospitalisation, the offender did not return to reside with Ms Brown and her children. He lived elsewhere but was a frequent visitor to her home. Ms Brown generally made other arrangements for the care of her children, including Jakob.
8. In February 2008 Ms Brown commenced a TAFE course. On 11th February 2008 the offender had the care of Jakob and Lachlan (the child of the offender and Ms Brown - born 22nd December 2006). Ms Brown had arranged for the offender to care of the children each Monday whilst she attended the TAFE course. 11th February  2008 was the first such occasion. The offender had not had the sole care of Jakob for some time prior to this. When Ms Brown returned home from TAFE in the afternoon, Jakob had injuries to his face and other areas.  No medical attention was sought, however Jakob did not attend pre-school on Thursday and Friday of that week. The offender told staff that Jakob had fallen from his bunk bed and hit his head.
9. On or about 29th February 2008 Jakob was taken to pre-school by the offender. This was the first time Jakob had been taken to pre-school since around 8th February 2008. Without prompting from the staff, the offender volunteered that Jakob had ""..another fall in the shower last night, so he has lots of bruises and a scratch on his arm."" The offender also told the member of staff, Amanda Miller, that Jakob had been biting himself on the arms. After the offender left, Ms Miller and her supervisor, Anne Psegianakis, noted a number of injuries when they removed Jakob's jumper, observing a large bite mark on his elbow which was swollen and bruised. When changing Jakob's nappy later that morning Ms Miller noted an irregular (curved) shaped bruise in Jakob's pelvic area. The staff member and supervisor then checked Jakob more thoroughly and saw what they thought to be a large 'fresh' cut on his shoulder.
3rd March 200810. On 3rd March 2008 Jakob was left in the sole care of the offender.  Although Ms Brown suggests the offender was not then living with her, Ms Brown left the home around 5.30am to attend TAFE. She left Jakob (and her other children) in the offender's care at this time. Jakob had two older siblings (Bethanie, then aged 8) and (Thomas, then aged 6).
11.The offender took the older children to school before returning to Ms Brown's home with Jakob and Lachlan (aged 15 months). The offender later told police that he spent some time in the backyard with Jakob whilst Lachlan slept.
12. Around midday, the offender told police that Jakob fell forwards onto a gravel path. The offender said that Jakob picked himself up and then continued to follow the offender inside. The offender said that he then heard Jakob cry and turned to see that Jakob had fallen again, onto his back this time on a concrete landing. At about this time, a neighbour heard a very distressed child's cry coming from the direction of the Brown household.
13. The offender said that he monitored Jakob for a while before putting Jakob to bed around 2pm. At that time, the offender suggested that Jakob was ""fine"".
14.Around 3.45pm the two older children returned home from school.  Bethanie found the offender was asleep and went to check on Jakob in his cot. She saw that Jakob appeared sick and he did not seem to be breathing. With some little difficulty she describes, she managed to wake the offender. The offender said that he went into Jakob's room and wiped some blood and vomit away from Jakob's mouth with a face washer. The offender claimed that he then called Ms Brown's mother. Phone records show that this call was not made in fact until 4.37pm. Mrs Brown told the offender to contact the emergency line.
15. Several ambulance personnel responded to the call. Attempts were made to resuscitate Jakob at the scene and en route to hospital.  Jakob could not be revived and he was pronounced dead soon after arrival at Campbelltown Hospital.  
16. The offender was interviewed by the police. He told police that Jakob had a pre-existing medical condition.
Cause of death17.Dr Dianne Little, Forensic Pathologist, conducted a post mortem examination upon Jakob's remains on 4th March 2008. She found the cause of Jakob's death to be a massive fracture to the right occipital bone and resultant swelling of the brain. A secondary cause of death identified by Dr Little was a gastric tear which had caused peritonitis.  The gastric tear had occurred several hours before death and was not caused by attempts to revive the child.
18.lt is Dr Little's opinion, supported by paediatrician Dr Paul Tait, that Jakob's injuries were not accounted for by the falls described by the offender. The gastric rupture would have required significant force and could not have occurred naturally. This injury would have caused Jakob to be demonstrably unwell and in pain for a significant period prior to his death. This is inconsistent with the offender's assertion that Jakob was 'fine' a few hours before death was confirmed.
19. Jakob also had bruising to his head, bleeding from his penis and an injury to his anus which had been caused very close to the time of his death and which were unconnected to the incidents which caused his significant skull fracture and gastric tear.
20. The medical expert evidence refutes the offender's account of the severity of the injuries which led to Jakob's death. The infliction of blows of sufficient force to cause such injuries to an infant child aged 2 years can only be consistent with an intention to inflict at least grievous bodily harm.
21. The offender inflicted the two major injuries causing death and all of the other unexplained injuries leading up to death.
22. He inflicted the injury to the stomach some time (perhaps hours) before the injury to the head. During this time Jakob would have been in obvious pain which required urgent medical attention. The offender witnessed this suffering and then finally struck him to the head which resulted in his death.
23. The offender then lied to the investigating police about how the injuries were caused"".
10The Crown also tendered a report of Dr Jane Edwards, Paediatric Forensic Physician, dated 1 October 2013.  Dr Edwards' report was obtained at a time when the Crown sought to rely upon the contents of a tendency notice which set out ten prior incidents of injury being occasioned to Jakob between 19 July 2006 and 29 February 2008 for which, on the Crown case, the offender was said to have been responsible.  Ultimately however, the Crown's reliance on prior incidents was reduced to the matters referred to in paragraphs (3), (5), (8) and (9) of the agreed facts. Counsel for the offender did not take issue with the proposition that it was open to me to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the injuries sustained by Jakob on those four occasions were inflicted by the offender.
11The Crown relied upon Dr Edwards' report for two purposes.  The first, was to support the conclusion that in those previous four incidents Jakob sustained the injuries referred to in paragraphs (3), (5), (8) and (9) of the agreed facts.  Those passages of Dr Edwards' report at pp. (4), (6)-(7), (11) and (11)-(12) respectively provide such support.  
12Although the Crown initially submitted that those four previous incidents aggravated the offending, it was subsequently conceded that to use the evidence in that way would be tantamount to punishing the offender for uncharged acts.  It was ultimately agreed between the parties that those previous instances in which Jakob was found to have sustained injury at the hands of the offender did not aggravate the present offending, but operated to deny the offender the leniency to which he might have been entitled had his offending been isolated: see generally R v JCW (2000) 112 A Crim R 466; [2000] NSWCCA 209.  I accept that this is the proper approach and have proceeded accordingly.
13The second purpose for which the Crown relied upon Dr Edwards' report was to provide further evidence of the cause of Jakob's death.  In this regard, the summary of Dr Edwards' opinion at p. 3 of her report included the following:
""At the time of his death Jakob had multiple concerning cutaneous injuries, which were sustained several days prior to his death, some of them were described by the preschool he attended three days before he died.  He had other injuries which likely occurred in the perimortem period including widespread facial abrasions and perianal abrasions which remain unexplained.  Jakob was found by his seven year old sister, with copious ornasal bleeding and a foreign body in his mouth, around the time of his death.  Jakob was also found to have significant recent head injuries (an impact to the right parietal area, an occipital skull fracture and intracranial bleeding) and stomach injury (full thickness tear of the stomach wall with extrusion of stomach contents into the abdominal cavity).  Diffuse hypoxic ischemic brain damage was considered to have been the pathological process which ultimately led to his death.
It would seem likely that the head injury occurred after the gastric injury based on the well established inflammatory reaction of peritonitis seen with the gastric injury but not within the skull fracture or subdural haematoma.  The nature of his head and stomach injuries indicate Jakob had experienced at least two separate incidents of high impact force, one to the back of his head (and) another to his upper abdomen, in the hours prior to his death.  The only incidents which reportedly occurred on the day of his death were two un-witnessed but apparently low force falls, occurring a few seconds apart, described by Mr Hill.  Jakob reportedly immediately returned to his feet unassisted and continued to walk after these falls, which is further evidence of their minor nature.  Mr Hill reported no concerning symptoms in the two to three hours he reportedly closely observed Jakob following these falls.  Therefore, no adequate explanation has been provided to account for the forces required to cause either his head injury or his gastric injury not the expected clinical symptoms which would follow.  It is therefore concluded that these injuries were highly likely to have resulted from an inflicted mechanism"".  
14Subsequently, at p. 30 of her report, Dr Edwards said the following:
""Whilst some abdominal injuries can have delayed onset of symptoms and difficulties in diagnosis, the clinical manifestations of gastric rupture are usually quite dramatic.  The majority of patients described in the literature presented soon after the injury either in shock (low blood pressure, high heart rate) or with signs of an acute abdomen (severe pain and signs of peritoneal irritation on examination) mainly as a result of the chemical peritonitis induced by the spillage of gastric acid into the peritoneal cavity.  Delays in presentation increased the period of peritoneal contamination with undigested food, which led to an increase in morbidity and mortality.  Haematemesis (blood stained vomiting) was described.  With prompt surgery, prognosis for a full recovery is good.
At the time this injury occurred to Jakob he would have been ""winded"" and in considerable pain.  The extrusion of gastric acid and stomach contents would have occurred over the ensuing few minutes.  As mentioned the peritoneal cavity is particularly irritated by the acidic gastric contents.  It is unlikely that Jakob would have wanted or tolerated any oral intake after this injury was sustained.  The peritoneal irritation would have led to ongoing abdominal pain, worse with movement and it would seem very unlikely that he would have been able to walk around and appear perfectly normal.  Jakob reportedly was of a developmental level whereby he could have let his carer know that he had a sore tummy or felt sick.  In other words, a caregiver should have been aware that something was wrong with Jakob in the hours after this injury was sustained"".  
THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCEThe submissions of the Crown15The Crown submitted that I should find that the objective seriousness of the offence fell above the mid range, and relied upon a number of factors in support of that submission.
16Firstly, the Crown relied upon the acts which led to Jakob's death.  It was submitted that Jakob died as the result of the infliction of significant blows to two separate areas of his body which Dr Edwards had described as being of ""high impact force"".  
17Secondly, the Crown submitted that on the evidence, the abdominal injury was the first in time and that the infliction of that injury must have resulted in Jakob being in significant and obvious distress to the knowledge of the offender.  It was submitted that in these circumstances, rather than arrange for medical treatment to be administered to Jakob, the offender chose to inflict a further injury which ultimately led to Jakob's death.
18Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the offender must have been aware that Jakob was vulnerable to injury by an adult, and that he committed the offence with that awareness.
The submissions of the offender19In response to the Crown's submission concerning the ferocity of the blows to Jakob's body, and whilst he did not seek to downplay the matter in any way, counsel for the offender submitted that it was not uncommon for an offence of murder to involve the infliction of significant blows upon a victim.  The essence of his submission was that at least in this respect, the present case was not markedly at variance with other matters of this nature that regularly come before the Court. 
20As I understood it, counsel accepted the essence of the Crown's submission that after the infliction of the first blow to Jakob's abdomen the offender would have realised that Jakob was in distress and in need of attention.  However, he submitted that it was not open to me to make a particular finding about the degree of the offender's realisation in that respect.  
21Ultimately, counsel for the offender submitted that the offending fell slightly below the mid range of objective seriousness and advanced two principal matters in support of that submission.     
22Firstly, it was submitted that the Crown was unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender acted with an intention to kill Jakob, and that I should find in those circumstances that he had acted with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  Secondly, it was submitted that notwithstanding the evidence of earlier instances of the offender's violence towards Jakob, the offending was nevertheless unplanned, and that the whole of the evidence was consistent with sudden anger, and loss of self control, on the part of the offender.  
Conclusion23Before considering the submissions of the parties, three matters must be noted.
24Firstly, the fact that Jakob was a child is inherent in the offence.  However, that circumstance applies to any person under the age of 18 years.  At the age of 2 years and 7 months, Jakob was extremely young and substantially less than 18 years of age.  Accordingly, his age remains an aggravating factor: R v Pfitzner [2009] NSWSC 1267 at [88].  
25Secondly, because of his age Jakob was obviously vulnerable.  Whilst vulnerability is an aggravating factor pursuant to s. 21A(2)(l) of the Sentencing Act, it is also necessarily a factor which is reflected in the standard non-parole period of 25 years which is prescribed for the offence.  Accordingly, it must not be double counted: R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952 at [63].  
26Thirdly, although the offender's actions necessarily involved a gross breach of trust, the offender was placed in that position of trust by virtue of Jakob's age.  In this respect I am again mindful of the necessity to ensure that there is no double (or perhaps even triple) counting:  R v Ross [2014] NSWSC 707 at [52].
27I am satisfied that the first injury in time was that occasioned to Jakob's stomach.  The blow struck by the offender was of sufficient severity to cause a full thickness tear to Jakob's stomach wall.  That, in turn, led to the extrusion, or in other words the forced eruption, of the contents of Jakob's stomach into his abdominal cavity.  As Dr Little reported, the infliction of that injury would have required the application of significant force.
28Dr Little said that as a consequence of sustaining that injury, Jakob would have been ""demonstrably unwell and in pain for a significant period"".  I am satisfied that this was the case, and that Jakob would have been in obvious distress, and in equally obvious need of some form of medical attention, after he had sustained the first injury.  In reaching those conclusions, I am fortified by the reference in para. 12 of the agreed facts to a neighbour hearing the cry of a distressed child at the relevant time.  I am satisfied that the offender was aware of the fact that he had caused Jakob significant injury.
29On the agreed facts, Jakob remained in the condition described by Dr Little for several hours before his ultimate death.  As an infant of only 2 years and 7 months of age, Jakob was obviously incapable of obtaining the medical attention he so obviously required without the assistance of an adult.  I am satisfied that such circumstances were known to the offender.  
30The only appropriate response, by any carer, to those circumstances was to ensure that Jakob received help.  There is nothing to suggest that the offender was not in a position to obtain medical attention for Jakob.  I am satisfied that he could have done so.  
31For reasons which remain completely unexplained, the offender's response was not to ensure that care was administered.  Rather, his response was to cause even more pain to Jakob by inflicting a second blow of sufficient force to cause what Dr Little described as a ""massive"" fracture to his skull, which ultimately led to his death.      
32I am satisfied that in acting as he did, the offender did not intend to kill Jakob, but that he acted with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.  I accept that the offending was not planned or pre-meditated.  Whilst the period of time over which the offending occurred might, in relative terms, be regarded as short, it was nevertheless some hours.  For the reasons already expressed I am satisfied Jakob would have been in obvious pain during that time.     
33Moreover, whatever the precise period might have been, two separate and distinct acts of wanton violence were perpetrated by the offender upon a helpless and defenceless infant. Following the first, Jakob was left in pain.  Following the second, he was left to die.  In acting as he did, the offender showed a callous disregard for Jakob's life.
34Balancing all of these considerations, I conclude that the offending falls slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness.  In my view, general deterrence is an important consideration in determining the appropriate sentence.  
THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE35The offender was born on 15 July 1974.  He is presently aged 40 and was aged 33 at the time of the offending.  He was married to his first wife in 1997.  There are three children of that marriage, which was dissolved in 2005.  
36A report from Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 10 July 2014 was tendered in the offender's case on sentence.  Dr Allnutt diagnosed the offender as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  I have made further reference to Dr Allnutt's report below.     
37It has been expressly conceded by counsel for the offender that there is no evidence of contrition or remorse.  However, the following matters are relevant to the offender's subjective case.  
The plea of guilty38I have already noted the time at which the offender's plea of guilty was entered.  He is entitled to a discount within a range of 10% to 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea.  The timing of the plea is the primary consideration which determines where, within that range, a particular case might fall:  R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 at 418, 419; [152], [154] and [168](iii) per Spigelman CJ.  In the present circumstances I allow a discount of 10%.  
The offender's criminal history39The offender has no criminal history.  That is a mitigating factor pursuant to s. 21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act.
The offender's prospects of rehabilitation40Elizabeth Sheather was called to give evidence in the offender's case.  Ms Sheather first met the offender at High School.  She remained in casual contact with him after they both left school.  In about June 2011 they formed a relationship and from October 2011 until the time of the offender's arrest in May 2012 they lived together, along with Ms Sheather's 13 year old son from a previous relationship.  Ms Sheather explained that her son has a number of special needs and that, as a result, he can be ""difficult to manage"".  She gave evidence that in her observations, the offender was caring towards her son, as well as being understanding of, and responsive to, his needs.  The essence of her evidence was that at the time of his apprehension, the offender was in the process of developing a good relationship with her son.  I accept that to be the case.
41Following the offender's arrest Ms Sheather learned of the allegations surrounding Jakob's death.  The offender initially told her that Jakob had fallen over.  He did not tell her, at least initially, that he was responsible for Jakob's death.    
42Ms Sheather explained that she and the offender are now engaged.  She said that despite being aware of the inevitability of the offender having to serve a lengthy term of imprisonment, she was (to use her words) ""not going anywhere"".   She also gave evidence that her own family was fully supportive of the offender.
43Also tendered on the offender's behalf was a letter from Wayne Cook, a Prison Chaplain.  That letter included the following:
"".... The officers who have seen him from the beginning say of Greg that his attitude has changed (for the positive) and this is very encouraging for his future.  I believe that Greg will once again become a productive and positive member of society"".    
44Finally, there is evidence that the offender has undertaken various courses in custody to enhance his literary skills.  His efforts in that regard have been variously described by those administering the courses as ""enthusiastic"", ""determined"" and ""thorough"".  
45The offender has no criminal history.  He has chosen, as is his right, not to give evidence before me on sentence.  There is no evidence at all which would enable me to determine why it was that he acted in the way in which he did.  All of these matters render an assessment of prospects of rehabilitation difficult.  
46On the evidence, the most that can be said is that the matters referred to in [40], [41] and [43]-[44] point tentatively in favour of the offender's ultimate rehabilitation.  However, the evidence does not permit me to arrive at a more definitive conclusion.  
The offender's state of health 47A large volume of material was tendered on sentence relating to the offender's physical and mental health.  That material may be summarised as follows.
48On 24 August 2000, in the course of his then employment as a tree surgeon, the offender injured his back, suffering a small central lesion at the L5/S1 level which resulted in a diagnosis of discal damage to the spine.  He was referred to a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Subhas, on 2 March 2001.  Dr Subhas expressed the view that the offender was displaying symptoms of mixed anxiety and depression, along with chronic pain, secondary to the back injury.  Dr Subhas noted that the offender was taking 100 Panadeine Forte tablets each week for the control of pain arising from his back injury.  He recommended that the offender be prescribed Efexor, an antidepressant.  
49The offender continued to undergo treatment for his back injury.  Throughout 2002 he underwent pain management treatment which had, as its focus, adjusting to life with chronic pain.  After a period of approximately two years, and despite reservations which had originally been expressed, the offender returned to work as truck driver.  However, his pain did not abate.  In November 2004 he consulted Dr Salmond, a pain medicine consultant, who reported (inter alia) that MRI examination demonstrated a further back injury at L1/2.  Doctor Salmon noted that the offender was controlling his pain with Oxycontin and Panadeine Forte and he recommended that this continue.  
50On 7 July 2005 the offender was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident.  As a consequence of that accident, and in addition to his earlier back injuries being rendered more symptomatic,  the offender suffered:
(i)an undisplaced fracture at C2;(ii)fractures of the bodies of T1 and T2;(iii)pulmonary contusions;(iv)lacerations to the scalp;(v)an injury to the left AC joint;(vi)an injury to the left knee;(vii)a near full avulsion of the left ear; and(viii)a depressed fracture of the left orbit.
51As a consequence of the injury to his AC joint, the offender underwent a reconstruction of the left shoulder in or about December 2006.  A plate which was inserted in the course of that surgery was later removed.
52As part of his rehabilitation the offender consulted with Matthew Evans, Psychologist, on 8 March 2007.  Mr Evans diagnosed depression, anxiety and stress, each of which he described as being ""extremely severe"". 
53Dr Preston, a Consultant Rheumatologist, examined the offender on 12 February 2010.  He noted that at that time the offender took a variety of medications including Oxycontin, Effexor, Neurontin, Endep, Temaze, Mersyndol Forte and Imigran.  He also reported that the offender presented as being ""significantly disabled by persisting pain"" before stating:
""In summary, (the offender) was involved in a significant motor vehicle accident from which he sustained multiple trauma. He has had extensive orthopaedic intervention. In addition he has been diagnosed with PTSD and describes ongoing symptoms related to this condition.""
54When the offender was first taken into custody in May 2012, his then treating General Practitioner, Dr Higginbotham, wrote to Justice Health in the following terms:
""With respect to treatment, the last time I saw this man was 15/2/11 when he was being treated with Efexorrx (sic) 150mg.,  Physeptone 20mg twice daily and Mogadon for sleep"".   
55The history provided by the offender to Dr Allnutt is generally consistent with that outlined above.  However, in addition, the offender told Dr Allnutt that he was diagnosed with depression in 2007 and was admitted to hospital for some weeks.  That is consistent with para. 6 of the agreed facts.  The offender also told Dr Allnutt that he had self medicated with alcohol in the past in order to cope with his pain levels.
56Extracts from the records of Justice Health which were produced on subpoena were also tendered on behalf of the offender.  They record what appear to be consistent complaints, by the offender, of significant pain.  Further, and although the entirety of the offender's medical records have not been tendered, there is some evidence that the offender has experienced difficulty in obtaining appropriate medical treatment since being taken into custody.  For example, on 22 September 2012 he completed a request for medical treatment and stated:
""Have been trying to see the Dr. for four months about pain medication for injuries I have.  Have been in constant pain in my neck, back, shoulder knee and also nerve problems in feet, legs, hands and arms"".  
57The material tendered on the offender's behalf also included a clinical note dated as recently as 31 January 2014, which records the following history provided by the offender:
""Pain unchanged, and remains in same spot.  Hx #neck, L4/5 disc, presses on nerves, affecting legs, mainly (L) side"".
58In his report, Dr Allnutt set out what he understood, on the basis of the history provided to him, to be the offender's current regime of medication and pain management.  In terms of the offender's psychological condition (that being Dr Allnutt's area of specialty) it was noted that the offender had seen a psychiatrist once since being taken into custody and had been prescribed Avanza. The dosage was not known.  In terms of pain medication, Dr Allnutt reported (at p. 6) that the offender was currently taking Tramadol, with little effect.  
59Dr Allnutt concluded by observing (inter alia) the following (at p. 7):
""Of concern, he said he had made inquiries for ongoing psychiatric follow-up in the correctional environment and had not yet seen a psychiatrist on a regular basis in this regard.  Avanza had been prescribed but probably at an inadequate dose.  He had seen psychologists on very few occasions.  Thus it is my view that he has not yet been engaged in any significant ongoing psychiatric care or treatment or psychological treatment in order to address his anxiety and depression.  It would be reasonable to consider that a lack of psychiatric and psychological follow up would compound hardship within custody, relative to other inmates"".  
60Dr Allnutt was not in a position to comment upon the offender's pain levels arising from his physical injuries, or the management of that aspect of his condition.  Ms Sheather gave evidence that the offender's pain levels were worse now than what they were when he was first taken into custody.  Obviously, her evidence in that regard was based largely, if not solely, upon what the offender had told her.  That said, there can be no doubt that the offender has previously suffered a number of serious physical injuries of a kind likely to produce significant pain.    
61The offender's psychological complaints are of long standing.  On the evidence before me, he was first diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depression in 2001.  On the basis of Dr Allnutt's report, his psychological condition is ongoing.  The fact that he has apparently been prescribed Avanza (an anti-depressant) whilst in custody would tend to reflect an acknowledgment of the part of Justice Health that he has a diagnosed condition which requires treatment.  There is medical evidence before me, in the form of Dr Allnutt's report, which raises the question of whether that treatment is adequate.  .      
62The sequelae from the offender's physical injuries are also of long standing.  I am satisfied that his pain from those injuries remains significant.  As is the case with his psychological condition, the evidence raises a question of whether his current pain management is adequate.   
63I am also satisfied that since being taken into custody, the offender's access to consultations with medical practitioners, for the treatment and management of both of his conditions, has been limited.    
64It was not submitted on behalf of the offender that his psychological condition would render him in an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  However, subjective matters relating to an offender's state of health may render a custodial sentence more onerous than would otherwise be the case.  That is a consideration which is relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence:  R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 per Street CJ, Nagle CJ at CL and Lee J agreeing; R v Miranda [2002] NSWCCA 89 at [37] per Dowd J, Sheller JA and Kirby J agreeing; Anesbury v R [2009] NSWCCA 445 at [14] per Grove J, Spigelman CJ and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing.  I am satisfied that as matters presently stand, the offender's physical and psychological issues aggravate the hardship of his custody and that this has been the case since he was first taken into custody in 2012.  
65However counsel for the offender expressly conceded that if, as might reasonably be expected, these issues are properly addressed by Justice Health, any hardship upon the offender will be lessened in the future, and in all probability, substantially so.  I accept that to be the case and have taken all of these matters into account.    
66I am in no position to determine the adequacy or otherwise of the treatment which has been administered to the offender since being taken into custody.  However, in circumstances where there is no evidence that the pain levels from his physical injuries have reduced, his present regime of pain medication appears to be substantially less than what it was when he was examined by Dr Preston in 2010.  In addition, Dr Allnutt has commented upon the offender's need for psychological treatment, and has questioned the adequacy of the current level of anti depressant medication which is being administered.  All of these matters warrant the issue of the offender's ongoing treatment being brought to the attention of those who are responsible for administering it.   
67In these circumstances, I recommend that the offender's treatment regime, in terms of anti-depressant medication, pain management and psychological intervention, be reviewed by Justice Health as a matter of urgency for the purposes of assessing its adequacy.  In the event that the regime which is presently in place is determined to be inadequate in some respect(s), I recommend that a new regime which properly addresses the offender's needs be put in place immediately.  
Pre-sentence custody68The offender has been in custody since 12 May 2012 solely in respect of the present matter.  In these circumstances any sentence should be expressed to commence on that date.   
ORDERS69The offender is convicted of the murder of Jakob Owen Brown.
70The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 12 May 2012 and expiring on 11 November 2032, with a balance of term of 7 years imprisonment, commencing on 12 November 2032 and expiring on 11 November 2039.  
71The total sentence is one of 27 years and 6 months imprisonment.  
72The offender will be eligible for parole on 12 November 2032 and his sentence will expire on 11 November 2039.

2764483,New South Wales Crime Commission v Williams [2014] NSWSC 1046,"Judgment

Introduction

1By notice of motion filed in court on 4 August 2012 the plaintiff seeks various orders including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) that upon the setting aside of a freezing notice made on 7 December 2012 and confirmed on 17 April 2013 in proceedings 391745 of 2012 no person is to deal with the defendant's property. The order sought is to restrain dealings with any interest in the defendant's property set out in the Schedule to the notice of motion, which included shares held in a particular broking account and cash held in a Macquarie Bank Limited bank account.

Evidence

2In support of its application the plaintiff relied on an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 25 July 2014.

3Section 10A of the Act makes provision for these orders and imposes certain requirements before they may be granted. The plaintiff made its application today for an order under s 10A ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). 

4Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant had been engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being the supply of a prohibited drug (heroin, in an amount greater than or equal to a commercial quantity) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the drug offence). The drug offence falls within the definition of serious criminal offence pursuant to s 6(2)(b) of the Act, because s 6(3) provides that offences under s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act are drug trafficking offences. 

5On 11 February 2014 at Parramatta District Court the defendant was convicted of the drug offence. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years and six months that commenced on 5 December 2012 and is due to expire on 4 June 2019.

6Section 10A(5) of the Act provides in substance that I am obliged to make the orders sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects the defendant has engaged in a crime-related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion. 

7Documents provided by Macquarie Equities Limited to the plaintiff on 13 May 2013 indicate that the defendant holds shares in a Macquarie Equities Limited portfolio account (the broking account) that are itemised in the Schedule to the notice of motion.

8On 21 July 2014 Macquarie Group provided the following information to the plaintiff pursuant to s 51 of the Act that:

(1)As at 18 July 2014 the holdings balance of the broking account was $302,061.94.

(2)The defendant holds the account specified in Item 2 of the Schedule (the Macquarie bank account) and, as at 18 July 2014 the balance of the Macquarie bank account was $40,136.95.

9I consider that having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit there are reasonable grounds for such suspicion. In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark's affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects. I am also satisfied, having regard to the material in Mr Spark's affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 

10I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) of the Act. I accept Mr Spark's evidence as to the speed at which people can attempt to dispose of funds held in bank accounts or dispose of shares, thereby attempting to defeat the operation of the Act. 

11The defendant's assets that are listed in the Schedule to the notice of motion are currently the subject of the freezing notice referred to above. By email dated 22 July 2014 Mr Rees of the Director of Public Prosecutions has informed the plaintiff that the Director intends to set aside the freezing notice ""in the near future"". 

Conclusion

12In all the circumstances I consider it is appropriate to make the orders sought by the plaintiff in that matter. I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages. On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.

Orders

13I make the following orders:

(1)Order that upon the setting aside of the Freezing Notice made on 7 December 2012 and confirmed on 17 April 2013 in Local Court of New South Wales proceedings 2012/391745, pursuant to section 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of ""interest in property"" as defined in section 7 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990) of Guy Bevan Williams (also known as Guye Beven Williams), including the interest in property in the property specified in the Schedule hereto.

(2)Order that the costs of this Notice of Motion be costs in the cause.

(3)Order pursuant to Rule 36.4(3) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) that these orders are to take effect as of the date hereof.

		04 August 2014",2014-08-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764484,Biles v R [2014] NSWCCA 170,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  Douglas Biles (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal against a sentence that was imposed upon him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Toner SC on 9 October 2013 for an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely larceny.
2The offence is contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years and there is a standard non-parole period prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) of 5 years.
3The sentence imposed was one of 5 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.  It was back-dated to the day of the applicant's arrest, 2 January 2013.  It was reduced from what it otherwise would have been (7 years) by 25 percent to give credit for the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea of guilty. 
Facts
4The victims of the offence, Mr and Mrs Pike, were a couple aged 85 and 70 who lived in Taree.  At around 11.40am on 2 January 2013 they were resting in the bedroom of their home.  The front security screen door was locked by the main lock in the middle and two bolt locks at the top and bottom.  The main timber door was also locked and closed. 
5Mr Pike heard a noise and when he opened his eyes he saw two males barge into the bedroom towards him and his wife.  One of the males was the applicant.  Mr Pike asked what they were doing but there was no reply.  The applicant came around the foot of the bed, close to Mr Pike, and grabbed a bag from a chest of drawers.  The bag contained books borrowed from the local library.  The co-offender took Mrs Pike's handbag containing $350 in cash, a mobile phone and sundry personal items from a chest of drawers on her side of the bed.  She woke and started screaming.  She chased the males to the front door.  Together with a third offender they fled.
6The police were contacted and, with the benefit of witness observations and descriptions, the offenders were eventually found.  They fled into a supermarket but were there arrested. The cash from Mrs Pike's handbag was found in their possession; the handbag had been discarded in the grounds of a school.
7Tendered without objection was a statement by Mr Pike in which in quite emphatic terms he described the distress the offence had caused his wife and himself.  For example:  ""we can never feel safe in our own home ... my wife is traumatised and terrified they will come back again"". 
Personal circumstances of the applicant
8The applicant was aged 21 at the time of the offence.  He was born in Brewarrina, the third eldest of his parents' ten children.  A Pre-Sentence Report recorded that he was primarily brought up by his maternal aunt and uncle and had minimal contact with his parents and siblings.  A report by Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, said that he was raised by his father separate from his siblings.
9He was educated to Year 10 level but had limited literacy and numeracy skills.  Dr Furst recorded that he appeared to have been emotionally and behaviourally troubled throughout his childhood; he struggled at school and was suspended on numerous occasions.  He was influenced by older pro-criminal peers and became involved with the criminal justice system at age 13.  
10The applicant's criminal history includes seven offences of a similar nature to the present one as well as sundry others.  He was given bonds and probation in his early teenage years but was sentenced to terms of detention at age 16 and 17 on three separate occasions.  He moved to live in the Taree area when he was about 17 but continued to offend.  He was sentenced to imprisonment in 2010 at age 18 and was returned to gaol upon his parole being revoked the following year because of further offending that brought another term of imprisonment.
11The applicant has been in a relationship for some 5 or 6 years.  He and his partner have had five children, two of whom died at birth in 2011.  He has no employment history and they have survived on welfare benefits.
12Aside from his association with antisocial peers, abuse of alcohol and drugs seems to have been a major factor underlying his offending behaviour.  He drank heavily from the age of 16 and has used heroin, crystal methylamphetamine and OxyContin pills.   He has not engaged in any drug or alcohol rehabilitation but told Dr Furst and the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that he was motivated to do so.
13Dr Furst found that the applicant met the criteria for childhood conduct disorder as well as for a substance use disorder (alcohol and opiate dependence).   He considered that he is ""a man who is immature, copes poorly under stress, is largely estranged from his family of origin, and probably has unresolved grief issues"".  The latter related to the death of his twin daughters.  There was no indication of any major mental illness.
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in his application of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
14The basis of this ground was made clear in the written submissions of counsel for the applicant.  It is that whilst his Honour had made it plain during the proceedings on sentence that he accepted that the applicant was remorseful, he failed to mention it and therefore overlooked it in his remarks on sentence. There is no merit in this.
15The proceedings on sentence were fairly brief.  In the course of hearing submissions on the applicant's behalf his Honour said, ""I accept he's remorseful. I accept that he accepts responsibility for his crime"".  
16At the conclusion of submissions by the Crown's representative the judge announced the sentence he intended to impose, namely 5 years 3 months.  The applicant's solicitor declined an invitation to be heard further.  The judge proceeded immediately to give ex tempore reasons and imposed the sentence he had indicated.
17Considerable caution is usually necessary in having regard to remarks made by a judge during the course of submissions and prior to sentencing as such remarks do not necessarily represent a final and considered view:  see, for example, Geddes v R [2012] NSWCCA 94 at [42].  But here the judge made an unequivocal statement accepting in the applicant's favour that he was remorseful and shortly afterwards announced what the sentence would be.  The fact that he did not mention remorse again did not mean that remorse was overlooked in the assessment of sentence.
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in that he failed to make a finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900
18The complaint underlying this ground is that while his Honour referred to matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, he did not announce a conclusion as to the level of that seriousness.  Authority for the proposition that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence remains an essential element of the sentencing process was referred to:  R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Ehrlich v R [2012] NSWCCA 38; 219 A Crim R 415 at [86] (Johnson J); Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183 at [31], [41] (Button J).  To those may be added the more recent case of R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27]-[29] (Simpson J, Hall J agreeing).
19The written submissions for the applicant listed a number of factors to which the judge had not made reference and asserted that when regard was had to them a finding of ""lower end of the scale of seriousness"" was called for.
20This ground does not have merit for two reasons.  First, as was the case in Stewart v R (see the judgment of Button J at [42]), one may infer from the judge's recitation of the facts and various aggravating factors together with the sentence ultimately imposed that his Honour regarded this an offence of greater seriousness than the applicant now contends. 21Secondly, the experienced criminal practitioner who appeared for the applicant in the District Court made no submission about the level of objective seriousness of the offence aside from a concession that it was ""a terrible crime"".  There was no attempt to identify matters that were relevant to an assessment of seriousness such as the factors listed in the written submissions to this Court.  Some relevant matters were referred to in the submissions of the Crown but the solicitor for the applicant did not seek to engage on that topic.  Indeed, as has been previously observed, he made no submissions in reply at all after his Honour indicated the sentence he was minded to impose.  
22In these circumstances, the factors relevant to an assessment of seriousness relied upon by the applicant in relation to this ground are best left for consideration of the next ground.
Ground 3 - The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive
23It was submitted that the sentence is manifestly excessive having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective case of the applicant.
24As to the objective seriousness of the offence, the factors identified under the previous ground in support of the proposition that it was at the ""lower end of the scale of seriousness"" were as follows:
The offence committed was larceny.
The items stolen were not of particularly great significance.
The offence was of brief duration.
There was no evidence the applicant or his co-offenders were aware that the victims were elderly or that they were present or in bed asleep, particularly given the time of day (late morning.) 
The offence appeared to be relatively spontaneous and unplanned.  (There was in fact no evidence on this topic.)
The applicant was not on any form of conditional liberty.  (This is merely the absence of an aggravating factor which does not serve as a mitigating feature.)
The applicant and his co-offenders were unarmed.  (There was no evidence either way on this topic and, in any event, if they were unarmed, this also was merely the absence of an aggravating factor.)
25Against those matters, however, the objective seriousness of the offence was significantly enhanced by the fact that the victims were elderly and were obviously traumatised by the experience.  The safety and security that they should have enjoyed in their own home was breached by offenders who broke through a locked and bolted security screen door and locked front door. It would have been well apparent when the applicant entered the bedroom that it was occupied by an elderly couple but he and his co-offender proceeded regardless to steal property from their close proximity.
26The sentencing judge rightly took into account that the victims were vulnerable because of their age; they were in their own home where they were entitled to feel secure.  One can well understand the effect the offence had upon them as indicated in Mr Pike's statement, particularly when they had taken steps to install a security screen door and to lock both it and the front door; as the judge observed, ""still that was not enough to protect them"". His Honour also took into account that whilst there was no physical violence the presence of the two offenders in their bedroom must have been highly intimidating.
27Offences in s 112 involve breaking entering and committing a serious indictable offence (defined as an offence with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years or more: s 4(1) Crimes Act). In this case the offence was larceny which is at that threshold.  Such an offence can be committed in circumstances of aggravation (i.e. the offence in s 112(2)) where the offender is armed, in company, knows there is someone in the premises entered, or where the offender uses corporal violence, inflicts actual bodily harm or deprives a person of their liberty (s 105A(1) Crimes Act). 
28Accordingly, the seriousness of the ""serious indictable offence"" and the circumstance of aggravation are matters pointing to the offence being less serious, in a general sense, than others that may fall within s 112(2).  The words ""in a general sense"" must be emphasised because it all depends upon the circumstances of the particular case:  R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at [29] (Simpson J).  The features referred to above (at [25]-[26]) point to the applicant's offence as being more towards the middle of the range of objective seriousness than the ""lower end"".  The sentencing judge seems to have considered it as such as is indicated by his statement at the end of his sentencing remarks: ""In some ways it was an act of terrorism on two vulnerable old people in their home"".
29The applicant sought to demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive by reference to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics and to a printout from the sentencing tables provided on the Public Defenders' website showing the outcomes in a multitude of cases involving the offence of aggravated break enter and steal. 
30The statistics demonstrate that the sentence imposed in the present case is towards the upper end of the range of sentences that have been imposed for offences against s 112(2) but that does not compel a finding that it is manifestly excessive.  It may be assumed that the circumstances of the many cases in the database vary widely and no attempt was made in the applicant's submissions to identify them. 
31The printout of s 112(2) cases considered by this Court is similarly unhelpful in establishing manifest excess.  There are almost 50 cases in the printout dating back to 1998.  They include cases decided before standard non-parole periods were introduced in 2003 and cases decided during the currency of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 before it was overturned by Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. The cases vary in the nature of the ""serious indictable offence"" and in the ""circumstance of aggravation"".  No attempt was made in the written submissions to identify any purpose in providing the printout beyond saying that sentences which exceed that which was imposed upon the applicant had additional aggravating features.  In oral address, counsel for the applicant referred to a selection of the cases but they each had factors which differed from the present case.
32Pertinently, the Crown referred to the following statement in the joint judgment in Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 606 [59], endorsed by the majority in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 537 [55]:
""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""
33The applicant's subjective case contained factors which pointed in different directions.  He was a young man with a partner and three very young children.  He had experienced the grief of losing twin daughters at their birth in 2011.  But he had a significant substance abuse disorder and offended because of his apparent disinterest in dealing with that issue and his need to fund the acquisition of more drugs.  On the other hand he had expressed to both the Probation and Parole Officer and Dr Furst some apparent insight and motivation to seek treatment.  It was accepted by the sentencing judge that he was remorseful.  His Honour was persuaded to reduce the length of the non-parole period in order to allow for an extended period of parole supervision.
34The sentence was clearly a stern one but not excessively so.  The purposes of sentencing (s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) to which the judge specifically referred - punishment and deterrence, both general and specific - were of significance.  The applicant's history of similar offending detracted from his claim for leniency and although he was found to be remorseful, his rehabilitation prospects were, at best, guarded.  
35We are not persuaded that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
Orders 36We make the following order: 
Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

2764499,Director of Public Prosecutions v AB (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1038,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 8 October 2013 the defendant was arraigned upon a charge that he, on 10 July 2010 at Wingham in the State of New South Wales murdered the deceased. He was not fit to be tried because of his mental condition and, accordingly, it was necessary to conduct a special hearing under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), pursuant to s 21(3)(a) of which he was taken to have pleaded not guilty to the indictment. The special hearing was conducted without a jury. On 26 November 2013 the Court found that, on the limited evidence available, the defendant was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 

2The maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter is 25 years: s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 requires the Court to nominate a term which is - 

""... the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.""

3The purpose of this law is to ensure that a person who is not fit to be tried is not punished more harshly than would have been the case had he or she been convicted in the ordinary way. Previously, a person in this situation would often be held in prison for a much longer period than would have been the case had they been fit and tried in the ordinary way. Accordingly, many persons who were not fit for trial would not raise the matter for fear of suffering what would have been in effect a far harsher penalty than if they simply went to trial, even though because of their mental condition they were not really able to properly defend themselves. The Court is now required to nominate a ""limiting term"", to obviate this injustice, although this is only a partial amelioration since there is no power to specify a non-parole period, which will usually (if not invariably) permit release after 75 per cent, sometimes much less, of a conventional sentence is served. 

Facts 

4The facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the Court's previous judgment (Director of Public Prosecutions v AB [2013] NSWSC 1739) and, aside from some matters, need not be repeated here. In brief, the defendant armed himself with a rifle and went to the deceased's home where he shot her five times, with one round penetrating the heart. The killing occurred at about 3.30pm on the veranda. He made no effort to conceal his actions, which were seen as it happened by several neighbours. After briefly waiting, he left the premises in his car to return home (about 25 kilometres away), at which time he telephoned ""000"" several times, telling the operator what he had done and why it was justified. In substance, he was upset and angered by the fact that the deceased had formed a relationship with a neighbour, had left him together with their daughter and was making a claim for maintenance and a share of the home. (In fairness, I should point out, in looking at the conduct of the deceased from the defendant's point of view, I do not suggest in any way that, in fact, she had acted wrongly, improperly or, for that matter unfairly towards him.) 

5The defendant returned to the scene about two hours after the shooting and made a half-hearted attempt to flee when he saw police there. His vehicle was stopped shortly after and he was arrested. Although he had been drinking - indeed at least one officer thought he was at least moderately affected by alcohol - I was satisfied from the medical evidence that the slurring of his words (still evident many hours later, when he was undoubtedly sober) was in fact a symptom of a minor stroke, and that he was not significantly intoxicated. He made full and frank admissions to the police. Although he said, in effect, that he had no choice but to kill the deceased because of her conduct towards him, he also expressed guilt and remorse. 

6The principal issues in the trial were whether the defendant had acted under provocation within the meaning of s 23 of the Crimes Act or, if this were not so, whether he was suffering from a substantial impairment within the meaning of s 23A of the Crimes Act which warranted his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. I found that, although it was likely that the defendant's shooting of the deceased was a reaction to her conduct, he had not lost his self-control. Accordingly, the provocation defence was not available. I concluded, however, that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter because, although he intended to kill the deceased, the medical evidence persuaded me that his powers of reason and judgment and the capacity to control himself were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, in substance, dementia, brain damage and depression, which warranted the finding of manslaughter rather than murder.

The defendant's mental state 

7Were it not for the defendant's mental condition at the time of the offence, this would have been a very serious case of murder. Although I discussed the medical evidence extensively in my judgment on the special hearing, I should repeat some of the salient matters here, given its relevance to setting the limiting term.

8The medical history commences with the defendant's admission to the Emergency department of Wilcannia Hospital in May 2004 following his involvement in a motor vehicle accident. He was observed to have a bruise on his right temporal lobe and a scratch in his right parietal region with various symptoms suggestive of some brain injury, although a brain scan showed no abnormalities. He was transferred to Broken Hill Base Hospital for observation but discharged himself two days later despite some continuing symptoms of confusion and memory loss. Apart from any possible brain injury, his doctor reported his history as including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic anxiety and alcohol excess.

9The next information comes from the defendant's consulting general practitioner in Taree who saw him in August 2007 and referred him to a psychologist in November 2008, essentially because of depression possibly caused by chronic back pain from an old work injury. The defendant did not go to the psychologist until mid 2010 following a second referral. A mental health assessment showed he was significantly depressed although he had been taking anti-depressant medication for five months or so. The medication was increased with some improvement. In June 2010 the psychologist thought he was suffering from anxiety and depression and was ""in a very poor state"". 

10After the defendant went into custody, he underwent an MRI brain scan on 9 November 2011, which demonstrated a history of minor strokes and resulting frontal lobe damage. Psychometric testing was made difficult because of the defendant's varying levels of co-operation, although it was being done at the request of his own lawyers. This meant that the results, though suggestive of significant problems, were of questionable validity and inconclusive. 

11Four psychiatrists were called at the special hearing. I have discussed their evidence in detail in the principal judgment and do not intend to repeat it here. Their opinions did not substantially differ. Dr Reutens diagnosed an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and cognitive impairments in a number of domains such as memory, language and executive functioning which are consistent with a diagnosis of dementia. The cause of the dementia was likely to have been contributed to by long term hazardous alcohol intake, cerebrovascular disease as demonstrated on his brain MRI, and possible Alzheimer's dementia. 

12Professor Greenberg concluded that, at the time of the offence, the defendant likely had small vessel disease of his brain in the frontal area with resultant old infarct areas of his brain, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, chronic alcoholism, possible cannabis usage and long term effects of Valium medication and early or emerging dementia.

13Dr Neilssen reported on the defendant's problems with attention, concentration and the orderly retrieval of information, as well as his becoming irritated, venting his anger, and becoming upset in response to obvious difficulties he had in performing screening tests of memory and concentration. He expressed the opinion that the defendant had depression and intellectual function impairment at the time of the offence arising from his underlying conditions including changes in brain structure and function associated with emerging dementia. He thought the defendant's combination of disorders were likely to have had a significant effect on his perception of events, his ability to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and on his ability to control his actions. (Although the doctor added the possible effects of intoxication, I am satisfied - as mentioned above - that the defendant was not intoxicated at the time).

14Dr Allnutt concluded that the defendant suffered from Vascular Dementia with Alzheimer's subtype as a differential diagnosis. Given his present symptoms, Dr Allnutt thought it reasonable to conclude that, at the time of the offence, the defendant was manifesting early signs of Mild (as distinct from moderate or severe, not ""normal"") Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder and that the erosion of his cognitive facilities was already occurring, although he accepted that this was a difficult determination to make in retrospect. Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder can manifest in the form of executive dysfunction and poor social judgment characterised by disinhibition, a reduced capacity for personal restraint and inappropriate social behaviour, making it difficult to organise and plan, and so increasing his reliance on the victim and adding to feelings of loss and anger when she left him, together with the multiple losses he experienced leading up to the offence including the belief that the deceased was having an affair. All this contributed to severe depressive symptoms which appeared to have been active at the material time. Depression tends to aggravate the negative perception of one's self, others and one's environment and can compound underlying feelings of irritability and anger and generate aggression. 

15The defendant's mental condition has been the subject of continuing examination, since he is under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. He was reviewed on 4 February 2014 by Dr Reutens who noted signs of continuing irreversible and increasing dementia and predicted an ongoing decline in cognitive function. His depression had worsened, with antidepressant medication unlikely to bring about significant improvement. He was physically frail and in a wheelchair. Dr Welkee Sim, a consultant physician and geriatrician has been treating the defendant since January 2014. He had been admitted as an inpatient in the Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit of the Long Bay Hospital, which is a unit to assess cognitive and physical health of elderly inmates. He was still there as at the end of April, when Dr Sim prepared his report. Amongst his other physical problems, the defendant fell in November 2013 while attending a medical appointment at the Prince of Wales hospital and sustained a right hip fracture which required surgery. He suffers from continuing severe pain from this injury and may require further surgery. The defendant could walk with the aid of a 4 wheel walker. He needs strong analgesic medication. 

16The defendant has little insight into his illness symptomatology, although he is aware that his memory ""isn't good"". At present, he can self care (shower, shave and dress) but cannot manage his financial affairs and needs supervision with his medication. In short, the defendant has increasing dementia with severe physical problems which will not improve. He cannot live independently.

Objective seriousness

17The most serious feature of the defendant's actions, of course, is his killing of the deceased in circumstances which, but for his mental state at the time, would have constituted the crime of murder. There can be no doubt that, despite the damage to his powers of reason, self control and judgment he was well aware of the criminality of his actions. Accordingly, there is a significant degree of moral turpitude and criminal culpability involved for which it would have been just that, had he been convicted after trial, a substantial term of imprisonment should have been imposed.

Subjective features

18The defendant has a relatively slight and irrelevant criminal record. He was nearly 65 years old at the date of the offence and is now almost 69 years of age. It hardly needs stating that his understanding of what he has done and the nature of these proceedings is significantly impaired and will continue to worsen. Some letters dating from 2011 and 2012 to a member of the deceased's family were tendered on sentence. They show a degree of indifference to the seriousness of what he did and express a continuing sense of bitterness and justification. Since the nature of his relationship with the recipient is unknown, it is difficult to assess their true significance. Certainly they do not express any remorse, but his lack of insight is not surprising and has certainly worsened in the ensuing years.

19It is relevant to consider that the defendant will find the prison environment considerably more difficult to cope with than the ordinary prisoner. I note also Dr Reutens' evidence that the average life expectancy from first diagnosis of dementia is of the order of 10 years but less where hypertension is present (as here). In one study of 477 persons, 70 per cent had died after 5 years.

20It is clear that the defendant's mental condition, both as it contributed to the offence, and at present, makes him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. I am satisfied that he will not again commit an act of dangerous violence.

21I should mention that the defendant's niece has offered to accommodate the defendant in the event of his release.

Conclusion

22A limiting term that is likely to end after an offender's understanding of where he or she is and why serves no useful public purpose and is, therefore, pointless. 

23In my view the appropriate limiting term is 7 years, commencing on 10 July 2010. Pursuant to s 24 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, the defendant is referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

		07 August 2014",2014-08-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764502,Gomez v Olsen [2014] NSWDC 220,"Judgment

1The plaintiff, a medical practitioner, brought proceedings for defamation by way of statement of claim filed on 25 March 2014 for publication of ""the words set out in Schedule ""A"" to this Statement of Claim"". The imputations pleaded were:

(a)That Dr Gomez is a thief;

(b)That Dr Gomez is an untrustworthy person who rips off tradesmen;

(c)That Dr Gomez refused to pay invoices issued by tradesmen when he was obliged to do so;

(d)That Dr Gomez dishonestly claims that the work performed by tradesmen he had hired was not carried out according to instructions to avoid paying those tradesmen's invoices.

2The publications in question were stated to have been put in local letterboxes and ""posted in public places"" (paragraph 3 of the statement of claim). A claim for special damages is foreshadowed in paragraph 7, as well as claims for compelled publication in paragraph 5. The damages sought by the plaintiff, in light of the ambit of publication and the damage allegedly caused, are clearly likely to be substantial. Mrs Barnett foreshadowed a claim for total loss of business by the plaintiff, who had intended to set up a surgery practice in his home.

3On the first return date, 2 May 2014, Bozic SC DCJ made the following orders:

""Defendant only recently served.

Matter is stood over to 16.5.14.

Plaintiff to notify the defendant of the above dated.""

4The statement of claim was not personally served on the defendant, and counsel for the plaintiff wisely took the course of advising her instructing solicitor to serve it again. The affidavit of service of Geoffrey Conlon sworn 20 June 2014 attaches a copy of the statement of claim which was served on the defendant on 18 June 2014. It is clear that this document, as well as the statement of claim served on or about 2 May 2014, do not attach the matter complained of. The statement of claim in the court file similarly does not attach the matter complained of. This omission does not seem to have been appreciated when the matter was before the court. 

5On 7 May 2014, a Defence was filed by the defendant. That defence is couched in somewhat elliptical language and states:

""I have no knowledge of the allegations contained herein or of the distribution of the public notice"". 

6This notice contains the handwritten notation from the registry ""Defamation 16/5"", from which I infer that the document was not only received in the registry on the date of filing but placed in the file and noted with the return date for the benefit of the court.

7Although the defence had been filed, the plaintiff was unaware of this. This is most likely because the defendant filed the defence (this being the step set out as being necessary in the section ""How to respond"" at the end of the statement of claim) but did not serve it. 

8The fact that a defence was not only in the file, but recorded on JusticeLink, was also not picked up when the matter was next in court on 16 May 2014, when Bozic SC DCJ made the following orders:

""1. The defendant is to file and serve his defence on or before 6.6.14.

2. In the event that no defence is filed, the plaintiff is to file and serve a notice of motion seeking default judgment, together with evidence in support of the application on or before 20.6.14.

3. The proceedings be listed for hearing of the plaintiff's notice of motion on 27.6.14.

4. The plaintiff is to notify the defendant of these orders.

5. Liberty to apply on 3 days notice.""

9The affidavit of service of 20 June 2014 recited that the plaintiff had been personally served with the statement of claim on 18 June 2014. The statement of claim would have been stale at this time, and the matter complained of was still not attached, as the affidavit of service of 20 June 2014 demonstrates. In addition, the defendant had in fact filed a defence. These issues were not appreciated when the matter was next in court on 27 June 2014. Elkaim SC DCJ made the following orders:

""1. The defendant is to file and serve his Defence on or before 18 July 2014.

2. In the event that no Defence is filed, the plaintiff is to file and serve any Notice of Motion seeking default judgment, together with evidence in support of the application, on or before 1 August 2014.

3. The proceedings be listed for hearing of the plaintiff's Notice of Motion on 8 August 2014.

4. The plaintiff is to notify the defendant of these orders.

5. Liberty to apply on 3 days notice.""

10On 4 August 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking default judgment against the defendant. This is the application which is before me today.

11Mrs Barnett very properly conceded that, in circumstances where the defendant had not been served with the matter complained of, and had in fact filed a defence, she could not move for summary judgment. The defendant is, however, put on notice, that such an application (or an application for an early hearing date on the issue of publication) will be made on the next occasion, after a statement of claim attaching the matter complained of is served on the defendant, and that if he continues to remain away from the court and not to participate in these proceedings, he does so at risk of the very substantial claim for damages that Mrs Barnett warned will be made on behalf of the plaintiff.

12While I have dismissed the Notice of Motion for default judgment, by reason of the defence filed, I have made timetable orders for further service of the statement of claim, this time attaching the matter complained of. These orders, which have been emailed to the defendant today, include a return date of 12 September 2014. 

13On 12 September, a hearing date in the defamation list may be allocated for a suitable time later this year, or the parties may be sent to mediation, or other orders for the future speedy conduct of these proceedings will be made. If the defendant continues to fail to attend, he does so at his peril, as orders, including orders of a summary nature, may be made in his absence.

Case management issues

14There are two case management issues relevantly arising from these events. Firstly, this is one of several matters (all defamation proceedings) where I have observed a litigant in person has filed, but failed to serve, a defence. While no explanation is forthcoming in these proceedings, an explanation I have previously heard is that the section ""How to respond"" at the end of the statement of claim stated that a defendant who intends to dispute the claim should do so ""by filing a defence and making a cross-claim"", which suggests that all the defendant has to do is to file the document and the court will attend to the rest. Some consideration should be given to a clearer explanation for the benefit of litigants in person, who make up a substantial proportion of the defendants in defamation proceedings.

15Secondly, while I have no concerns about the propriety of these proceedings, the high percentage of defamation actions where default or summary judgment is sought on the first or second return date seems surprising, particularly given the traditional reluctance of courts to enter default judgments in defamation proceedings at all: French v Triple M Melbourne Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 36, citing Altarama Ltd v Forsyth [1981] 1 NSWLR 188. In Graham v Powell (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 185 at [6], Beech-Jones J warned of the ""risk of oppression"" in entering default (and presumably also summary) judgment against a litigant in person unfamiliar with the complexities of defamation law. It is not a practice commonly found in other claims for damages such as misleading or deceptive conduct, or personal injury. Defamation insurance is rare, the cost of defending a defamation action is substantial, and more than one judge has noted the devastating impact of such proceedings on defendants, even where the cost of defending the case is not an issue: Hanrahan v Ainsworth (1985) 1 NSWLR 370 at 377 - 378 per Hunt J; Cumberland v Clark (1996) 39 NSWLR 514 at 529 per Levine J. 

Orders

(1)Defendant called threes time outside Court 13D at 2:05pm, no appearance.

(2)Notice of Motion for default judgment dismissed with no order as to costs.

(3)Pursuant to r 1.12 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), extend time for service upon the defendant of the statement of claim, which document must attach the matter complained of (Exhibit D) in this application. Such document to be personally served on the defendant by 5 September 2014.

(4)Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Friday 12 September 2014 for further orders, including a referral to mediation.

(5)A copy of these orders is to be sent to [defendant's email address] and [defendant's home address].

		11 December 2014",2014-08-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764513,R v Smith (No.4) [2014] NSWSC 1069,"Judgment
1On 20 January 2013, Graham Smith shot and killed Joshua George in Gidley Crescent at Claymore, New South Wales.
2He did so by firing a .22 calibre rifle directly at Mr George.  The single bullet entered Mr George's body, slightly above the sternal notch, travelled through his body, causing major damage to his principal organs and extensive bleeding.  He died almost immediately.
3Mr Smith fled the scene of the shooting, and was not arrested until the evening of 24 January 2013.  He has been in custody ever since.  He was charged with murder.  
4On 2 October 2013, Mr Smith was committed by the Local Court at Blacktown to the Supreme Court for trial on a charge of murder.  On 1 November 2013, when arraigned in the Supreme Court, Mr Smith pleaded not guilty.  On 12 May 2013, when arraigned in front of the jury, Mr Smith pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, and the trial proceeded.
5On 4 June 2014, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. A conviction for that offence was entered on that day by the Court.
6It is now time for Mr Smith to be sentenced for his crime.  
7The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter of 25 years.  There is no standard non-parole period fixed by the legislation.
Judicial Task on Sentencing
8In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing.  That is, how a judge, in each individual case, must go about the task of fixing a sentence which accords with the legislation, the principles of the common law and is appropriate in the particular factual circumstances of this case.
9In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Smith by applying well-identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at [1]-[2]:
10The principles of law are well established and can be conveniently summarised in the following way:
""1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rests with the judge, and not with the jury...;
2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing.  Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings ...;
3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making ... is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. This may produce the result that, in a particular case, the view of the facts which the judge is obliged to take is different from the view which the judge would have taken if unconstrained by the verdict ...;
4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt ...;
5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender....  However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender ..."".
R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1.
11It is no part of the sentencing function for me to attempt to discern the basis upon which the jury reached their verdict.  But rather, in sentencing Mr Smith, I am obliged to do so, upon findings of fact which I alone make, but with the constraint that those facts must be consistent with the jury's verdict.
12Sentencing is not an exercise of mathematical precision leading to a single correct answer. Rather, having determined the appropriate facts which relate to the offence, the proper approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing in this case, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26].
13I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.
The Facts
14In order to make findings of fact which are consistent with the jury's verdict, those findings will reflect my view that Mr Smith is guilty of manslaughter because, even though he deliberately shot Mr George intending to cause him grievous bodily harm, there was a reasonable possibility that Mr Smith believed that shooting Mr George was necessary to defend himself.  I am also satisfied that the force that Mr Smith used to defend himself, namely shooting Mr George, was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as Mr Smith perceived them to be.  That force was obviously excessive.
15In the process of finding the relevant facts, it is necessary for me to specifically record that I am quite unable to accept the truth of the offender's evidence.
16In fact, I am satisfied that Mr Smith gave little, if any, truthful evidence, and I am unable to accept his evidence unless it constituted an admission against his interest, or else if it is independently corroborated.  
17He was a thoroughly unconvincing witness.  He was argumentative, he swore at the cross-examiner, he made statements that were patently untrue about the way in which he had been dealt with by the police after his arrest, and when he gave that evidence he must have known the statements to be untrue.  He pretended a failure of memory when it suited him, most particularly with respect to evidence he gave about the wearing of blue disposable gloves at the time of the shooting, and he deliberately exaggerated (as he later admitted) his evidence in a way which was, he thought, favourable to his case.  
18Accordingly, finding these facts to the requisite degree of satisfaction involved findings largely based on evidence other than that of the offender.  
19I find the facts of the matter, which are consistent with the verdict of the jury, to be as follows.
20Mr Smith (the offender) was born in June 1991, and so, was 21 years old at the time he shot Joshua George.
21Joshua George (the deceased) was born in May 1988 and was, accordingly, 24 years old when he died.  He was about three years older than the offender.  Mr George was about 1.77 metres tall and about 92 kilograms at the time he died.  Mr Smith said that he weighed about 110 kilograms and his physique was described as stocky.
22Mr Smith and Mr George had known each for most of their lives.  Mr Smith said that he regarded Mr George as his cousin, although they were not in fact related by blood.  They had been particularly close for a period of nine months or so prior to the shooting, when they shared a common interest in smoking methylamphetamine (ice), and consuming other illicit drugs.  
23The offender and the deceased formed part of an informal group of young male friends which included at various times some or all of the accused, the deceased, Jarrod Perkins, Noel Nicholson and Matty Finn.  Various members of this group were together during the course of 19 January 2013, the day before the shooting.  Initially they were at the house of the offender at 25 Salvana Way, Claymore, and then later at the house of Nicole Smith at St Helen's Park.  
24Various members of the group were sparring together against each other with boxing gloves.  It appears that the offender may have hit Jarrod Perkins with one or more ""cheap shots"", the evidence is unclear, which caused a degree of tension.  On any view that tension seems, by the late evening of 19 January 2013, to have subsided.
25During the late evening of 19 January 2013, and early on 20 January 2013, some of this group of young men were consuming illicit drugs to a varying extent, whilst at Ms Nicole Smith's house.
26Apparently through boredom, the group left Nicole Smith's house some time around 3.00am or so.  The offender and the deceased were dropped off at Airds and made their way to the home of Ms Carly Miller, in that suburb.  Whilst at Ms Miller's house, there was evidence of varying quality, but sufficient to satisfy me, that both the Mr Smith and Mr George smoked ice.  The quantity smoked is not established.
27At about 8.00am or thereabouts, the deceased and his friend, Alan Phillips, who was commonly referred to as Fester, went to the BP Service Station at Airds.  After purchasing a supply of cigarettes, they returned to Ms Miller's house. 
28Upon their return, the offender confronted the deceased.  He alleged in a verbal argument, that Fester was a ""writing statement dog"".  This was an expression used to identify a person who provided a written statement to police.  I am well satisfied that the offender got very angry with the deceased, whom he perceived to be wrongly sticking up for Fester.  
29A verbal argument continued and moved outside Ms Miller's house.  It continued up the street towards Airds High School.  During that time, I am satisfied that the offender, who was the principal aggressor and who had collected a pair of metal bicycle forks from the carport at Ms Miller's house, swung them at the deceased in an attempt to hit him.  Although the offender swung the bicycle forks on a number of occasions, he connected only once with the deceased in the region of the upper arm.
30By that stage, the deceased had armed himself with a piece of timber in an attempt to defend himself against this assault.  During the course of this assault, the offender called out to the deceased ""You are a dog, you are a dog, I'm going to smash your head in"".  The deceased yelled at him that he should ""drop the forks and fight like a man"".  There was a further verbal interchange.  It seemingly broke apart.  As the two men separated, the offender called out the deceased ""you're a dead man Joshie George"".  
31The deceased left the scene, and went to his mother's house.  He told her what had happened that morning.  Whilst at the house, the deceased was heard to say that he wanted to go and smash Winfield.  Winfield was the name by which the offender, Mr Smith, was generally known.  The deceased collected a black backpack from his mother's house.  
32The deceased then made his way to the home of Mr Grant Perkins and Ms Jamaine Ronayne at Claymore.  He also visited the house of his close friend, Mr Daniel Shaw, and collected a set of knuckledusters from him.  The deceased told Mr Shaw 
""We're going to sort it out today.  We are going to have a one-on-one later today.""
The term ""one-on-one"", as used in that conversation, was taken to be, and was so I am satisfied, a reference to a fist-fight.  It was for that reason that the deceased collected the knuckledusters.
33During the course of that morning, there was considerable telephone discussion either verbally or by text message, between the deceased on the one hand and Mr Jarrod Perkins on the other, and Mr Jarrod Perkins and the offender, Mr Smith.  I am well satisfied that Mr Jarrod Perkins was attempting to put in place the arrangements for the one-on-one fist-fight between the accused and the deceased, which was designed to sort out the differences which had arisen between them as a result of the offender having hit the deceased with the metal bicycle forks during the course of the earlier incident outside Airds High School.
34There had been a number of fist-fights between the deceased and the offender prior to this day.  The offender had generally come off second-best in those fist-fights.  That was why he had picked up the bicycle forks just before his fight with the deceased at Airds earlier that morning.  
35The offender seems to have spent the morning driving around whilst the various phone calls were being made.  The unsatisfactory nature of the evidence means that the Court is not really in a position to be satisfied as to precisely where and with whom the offender went and if the offender did consume drugs, what type they were and how much he consumed.  
36Shortly after 1pm, the deceased, Mr Grant Perkins and Ms Ronayne visited the Claymore shops to obtain refreshments.  Whilst they were at the Claymore shops, I am satisfied that final arrangements were made to meet for the fist-fight.
37It seems clear that the offender must have anticipated the presence of, at least, Mr Jarrod Perkins, who was the go-between in arranging the fist-fight.  In advance of the arranged meeting for the fist-fight between himself and the deceased, the offender decided that he would arm himself with a loaded rifle.  He says that he did so because he thought that he was being ""set up"" by Jarrod Perkins and the deceased.  I am unable to accept this proffered reason.  Rather, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender chose to arm himself with a rifle, which he knew to be loaded, because in earlier fist-fights with the deceased the offender had generally come off second best.  In advance of the first fight that morning, he had armed himself with an available weapon, namely the bicycle forks.  Again, he armed himself with a readily available weapon for the arranged fist-fight that afternoon.  That weapon was the loaded rifle.
38I am satisfied that by this stage of the day, the deceased had, over the last 12 hours or so, consumed a quantity of methylamphetamine by smoking it.  However, the evidence does not permit a finding, even on the balance of probabilities, about the quantity that the offender may have smoked.  
39Nevertheless, it is clear that by 1.27pm the offender was in possession of the rifle.  At that time he was seen by an independent witness to be walking along a pathway heading towards Gidley Crescent and his home at 25 Salvana Way, Claymore, with the rifle wrapped in a blue tarpaulin.  He was wearing blue plastic disposable gloves.  He did this to avoid being identified as the user of the rifle by leaving his fingerprints on it.  
40Regardless of precisely where the one-on-one fist-fight was arranged to occur, I am satisfied that shortly prior to the shooting at about 1.30pm, the deceased, in the company of Mr Grant Perkins and Ms Ronayne, was walking along Gidley Crescent, to the meeting, in a generally southerly direction.  They were walking on the tarred road surface, and generally in a single file with Ms Ronayne in front.
41The offender, armed with the loaded rifle, had by that stage made his way into the backyard of his house.  The back fence of that house was a wooden paling fence of about chest height.  The offender was standing behind that paling fence with his loaded rifle, waiting for the deceased.  
42The objective evidence as to where the deceased was seen to be lying on the road after the shooting, together with the investigations made at the scene by police investigators, the results of which are contained in various sketches and photographs, satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt, that at the time the deceased was shot, he was standing on the road surface, about 10 metres or so away from where the offender was waiting behind the paling fence.
43Whilst standing in those respective positions, there was a verbal dispute between the deceased and the offender.  Mr Grant Perkins, and perhaps Ms Ronayne, seems also to have contributed verbally.  By this time, I am satisfied that Mr Jarrod Perkins had also arrived on the scene.  
44In these circumstances, there was no doubt that the accused was confronted by three males.  The evidence satisfies me that Mr Jarrod Perkins was in possession of the black backpack that the deceased had earlier collected from his mother's house.  I am so satisfied, because the CCTV footage of the deceased at the Claymore shops which was taken shortly before the shooting, showed that the deceased was not in possession of the black backpack.  It also showed that neither Mr Grant Perkins nor Ms Ronayne were in possession of the backpack.  As it was found at the scene of the shooting, I am satisfied that it must have been brought there by Mr Jarrod Perkins.
45Notwithstanding the claims of the offender, I am not satisfied that any of Mr Grant Perkins, Mr Jarrod Perkins, Ms Ronayne or the deceased were carrying any weapons which were on display, or in any way visible to the offender.  Whilst the deceased was in possession of a set of knuckledusters, they were concealed from view in a pocket of his jeans.  The black backpack which contained weapons was not open, and the contents of it were not visible to the offender.  
46In the course of the verbal confrontation, I am satisfied that the offender, whose ability to perceive what was happening was, to some extent, affected by his deliberate consumption of drugs, probably a combination of methylamphetamine and Xanax tablets, formed the view that he was going to be physically attacked by the three males present, although all that in fact occurred was an exchange of verbal insults.  No doubt this exchange heightened his pre-existing sense of fear.  Accordingly, the offender formed the view that it was necessary to defend himself.  Having formed that view, he promptly fired a shot from the loaded .22 calibre rifle, which was aimed directly at the deceased.  As I have earlier indicated, the bullet penetrated the deceased's body, slightly above the sternal notch and caused injuries from which he died almost instantly.
47I do not accept the evidence of Mr Smith that he also feared that his family was at risk of serious harm. They were not present anywhere in or near the house at the time. The arrangement that lead to the verbal confrontation only concerned the offender and the deceased, and was the means by which they were settling their differences.  It had nothing to do with his family.
48Whilst I accept that the offender had formed a belief that it was necessary to defend himself, I am equally satisfied that the force which he used, namely, firing the rifle at the deceased, was quite unreasonable.  It was manifestly excessive.  
49As I have said, the deceased did not in fact, have any weapons upon him, other than the concealed knuckledusters.  His intention, and the arrangement, was that a fist-fight would occur.  The presence of Mr Grant Perkins and Mr Jarrod Perkins, I accept, increased the fear which the offender felt.  But, I am satisfied they were present as the ""go betweens"" who wished to ensure a reasonably fair fist-fight, at least in accordance with the rules of the young men of Claymore.  In those circumstances, the presence of the loaded rifle as a weapon could not be justified.
50Further, firing the rifle directly at the deceased was a grossly excessive response.  There is no reason why the offender could not have fired the rifle in the air or towards the ground or in some way used it in an attempt to scare off the three men who were, after all, on the other side of the paling fence from the offender, yelling insults and inviting the offender to come out from behind the fence and ""fight like a man"".  
51As well, there is no reason to think that the offender could not have run away from the scene, as he did just moments later after he had shot and killed the deceased.  He also could have put the gun down and not used it at all to defend himself.  
52I am in no doubt that when he fired the rifle, the offender intended to cause injury to the deceased.  As is recorded in the Pre-Sentence Report dated 11 June 2014, the offender's state of mind with respect to the deceased on that day was that ""... it was either him or me that day"".  
53Accordingly, for those reasons, I am satisfied that the force used by Mr Smith was manifestly excessive.  Those findings are consistent with the jury's verdict that the offender is guilty of manslaughter, and not murder.
54Accordingly, to summarise, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that against a background of a long friendship and temporary disharmony, early on the day in question there had been a physical assault perpetrated upon Mr George by Mr Smith.  This assault escalated the tension that was felt between them.  An arrangement was made to resolve that tension by having a supervised one-on-one fist-fight.  The supervisors were to be Mr Grant Perkins and Mr Jarrod Perkins.  Mr Jarrod Perkins was the go-between who arranged the fist-fight.  In preparation for the fist-fight, the offender armed himself with a loaded .22 calibre rifle and waited behind his back fence for the deceased.
55In the course of a verbal confrontation which followed when the deceased, Mr Grant Perkins and Mr Jarrod Perkins arrived in the general vicinity of the back of the offender's house, the offender formed the belief that it was necessary to defend himself and, as a consequence, shot and killed the deceased.  No doubt Mr Smith was to some extent affected by drugs, which partly explains, but does not mitigate, his conduct
56The shooting and killing of the deceased was not a reasonable response to the belief that the offender had that it was necessary to defend himself.  There were many other things that the offender could have done to defend himself quite adequately, but he chose not do so.
57The offender, Graham Smith, comes to be sentenced for the manslaughter of his friend, the deceased, Joshua George, upon the basis of a manifestly excessive response to the circumstances in which he was placed.  
Police Investigation
58After the shooting, the police secured the crime scene, but not very well, because Mr Jarrod Perkins managed to remove the knuckledusters that were lying on the roadway near where the deceased had fallen.  The difficulties which the Police had in that task were exacerbated by the general antagonism and lack of co-operation by the large crowd which quickly gathered at the scene.  Such was the mood of the crowd, and the potential danger to the ambulance officers who attended, that they felt unsafe and unable to complete their treatment of Mr George at the scene. He was quickly placed into the ambulance and taken to Campbelltown Hospital.  Behaviour of that kind, at the scene of a crime and in those circumstances, is unfathomable and is to be deprecated. 
59The offender fled the scene, disposed of the weapon, and showered and changed his clothes.  The weapon and the offender's clothes have never been recovered.  
60The offender visited the home of his father late that evening, where his de facto partner was.  His family urged him to hand himself in and told him that the police were looking for him.  The offender disregarded this advice and continued his flight from the police.
61Eventually, the offender was arrested at Blacktown Railway Station on 24 January 2013.  At the time he was arrested, he was clearly seriously affected by drugs that he had taken during his time fleeing from the police.  Although the police purported to conduct an electronically recorded interview, and recorded a procedure in which forensic sampling and photographs were taken, it must be said that the accused was not in a fit state to give his voluntary and free consent.  Although he said various things on the video interview, I cannot place any reliance upon anything that he said.  
Specific Statutory Considerations
62Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, identifies a number of matters which the Parliament has provided as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  As well, there are matters that mitigate any sentence to which regard must also be had.  It is appropriate to commence with those aggravating factors, which I regard as relevant and applicable in these circumstances.  
63In having regard to the aggravating factors where such a factor may be regarded as being an integral part of the offence, it is not to be considered separately.
64It is an aggravating factor if the offender has a record of previous convictions, which is the case here, particularly if he has a record of previous convictions for a serious personal violence offence and, as is the case here, he is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence: s 21A(2)(d).  
65The offender's criminal history commenced in November 2007.  He was then 16.  His offending as a juvenile ought be disregarded as it was relatively minor and he was young.  But since becoming an adult, besides some minor offences that are not presently relevant, the offender committed two offences of serious personal violence before he killed Mr George.
66The first of these offences occurred in September 2009. It resulted in a conviction for an offence against s 59(1) of the Crimes Act of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  The circumstances of that offence are not before this Court, but I note that the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for his crime.
67On 10 December 2010, the offender was convicted in the District Court of NSW of an offence against s 35(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm whilst in company.  That was his second serious personal violence offence.  The offender was sentenced to a not insignificant period of imprisonment which reflected the seriousness of this offence.
68I will take these previous offences into account as an aggravating factor in accordance with decided authority: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.
69Another aggravating factor that is to be taken into account is the fact that the offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence: s 21A(2)(j).  The offender was on parole at the time of this offence.  On 10 December 2010, the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years for the offence against s 35(1) of the Crimes Act.  That term of imprisonment of 3 years was ordered to commence on 10 February 2010 and conclude on 9 February 2013.  The offender was released to supervised parole on 9 August 2011.  A non-parole period of 18 months was specified.  It follows that on 20 January 2013, the offender was on parole for the offence against s 35(1) of the Crimes Act.  I will take this into account as an aggravating factor.
70Here, it means that greater weight needs to be placed on the need for personal deterrence of the offender in considering this sentence.
71There are some mitigating factors listed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to which it is relevant to refer.
72The first matter to which it is necessary to refer is that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b).  The manslaughter occurred because of an excessive response to a belief that it was necessary for the offender to defend himself.  It was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.  However, in the particular circumstances, where the offender took a loaded weapon to the arranged fist-fight, this factor carries little weight.  
73It is a mitigating factor if an offender is provoked by a victim: s 21A(3)(c).  I do not take provocation in this provision to simply reflect the defence of provocation legislated for under the Crimes Act.  Here, I will have regard to the fact that the reaction of the offender was provoked by the presence of the deceased and the others, and the conduct of the deceased in reaching for what the offender thought was a weapon.  However, having regard to the fact that the verdict was one of manslaughter, and that is the offence which I am sentencing for, little weight can be accorded separately to this factor.  
74It is a mitigating factor if an offender does not have any record, or significant record, of previous convictions: s 21A(3)(e).  Here the offender has a poor record.  Whilst this of itself, and except in the way which I have described above, does not operate as an aggravating factor, it does mean that there is no mitigation of the sentence by reason of the offender's past.
75There is a difficult question as to Mr Smith's prospects of rehabilitation, and his likelihood of re-offending: s 21A(3)(g) and s 21A(3)(h).  These are matters which, if established, are mitigating factors.  Shortly put, I am not satisfied that I can make a finding that the offender is a person who is unlikely to re-offend, nor am I satisfied that I can make a finding that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.  The report of Dr Richard Furst, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, was tendered on behalf of the offender.  It concludes that Mr Smith meets the criteria for a number of mental disorders, including a substance abuse disorder and an anxiety disorder.  He thinks it likely that Mr Smith has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Dr Furst also concludes that it is possible that there is an emerging serious mental illness such as bipolar disorder.  Dr Furst recommends that Mr Smith remain under the care of a psychiatrist and mental health staff whilst in custody.  He expresses the view that Mr Smith has a moderate risk of re-offending over the longer term which may be reduced by abstention from illicit drugs, undertaking programs and accepting rehabilitation.
76I accept Dr Furst's opinion, which means that I cannot make findings about a risk of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation that would mitigate the sentence to be imposed. The absence of these findings does not aggravate the sentence, it only means that, in these respects, there is no mitigation. 
77Where an offender shows remorse for his offence, that can be regarded by the Court as a mitigating factor: see s 21A(3)(i).  In order to have this taken into account in his favour, the offender must provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions, and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his actions.
78At the conclusion of his examination-in-chief, the offender was asked this question and gave this answer:
""Q. Is there anything you want to say to his family?A. Yeh, I don't know what to say.  Like, there is nothing I can - I just - if there was something else I could have done believe me I would have done that.  I would never do that to Josh. Yeh.  I'm so sorry. Yeh.""
79This was a thoroughly unconvincing expression of any remorse for his actions, and a thoroughly unconvincing statement of acceptance of any responsibility for the death of the deceased.  I simply did not believe it, and it was delivered in a way which did not persuade me, at that time, that the offender had any remorse whatsoever for what he had done.  
80However, since then in interviews with the Senior Community Corrections Officer and with Dr Furst, and as well, in a letter which he has written to the Court, there does seem to have been some expressions of remorse, particularly it seems that he acknowledges the injury and loss which his crime has caused to Mr George's family.  I will take these matters into account.  
Plea of Guilty
81It is agreed between the Crown and the offender, that the offender offered to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter upon the basis that he acted in self-defence, although the force that he used was excessive.  That offer was made on 2 September 2013, which was one month prior to the offender being committed for trial by the Local Court.  The Crown did not accept the offer. 
82An offer of a plea that is rejected by the Crown but is consistent with a jury verdict after trial can result in a discount even though there is no utilitarian value: R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310; R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129.
83Here, the offender is entitled to a full discount for this early offer to plead guilty.  It is appropriate that I allow a discount of 25% upon any sentence that would otherwise be imposed.  
The Offender's Criminality
84It is appropriate to make an assessment of the objective criminality involved in the offender's offence.  This is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to the offender, and is to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature and circumstance of the offence: Muldrock at [27].
85In my assessment the criminality is very serious.  The offender has shot and killed his friend of many years in a manifestly excessive response to the circumstances in which he was placed.  He has gone to an arranged fist-fight with a loaded weapon.  The shooting of his friend was not an accident, but was done with the intention of causing him serious harm.  Whilst he felt the need to defend himself, it was not lawful for him to do so in this excessive manner.
86It was because his shooting was an excessive response to the circumstances in which he found himself that he has been convicted of manslaughter.
87Manslaughter is an offence that can be constituted by a wide variety of factual circumstances.  However, each circumstance has a constant that a human life has been feloniously taken, which is a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the circumstances of each offence.
88As I have earlier said, I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case, the response in which Mr Smith engaged by way of self-defence was manifestly excessive.  I regard this case as showing why the offence of manslaughter is properly regarded as a major crime, and this case is a most serious example of it.  
Victim Impact Statements
89The Court has heard statements read on behalf of Ms Nicole Smith, who was the partner of Mr George, and the mother of their three year old daughter. 
90Clearly this crime has touched Ms Smith and her daughter, and no doubt all of the members of the Mr George's family.  Mr George's daughter, who is only three years old, has been left without a father and is to be cared for by her mother alone.  She will grow up without ever really knowing her father and enjoying his love and affection.
91I will have such regard to this evidence as the law permits: R v Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76; s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  I note that the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Family Member Victim Impact Statement) Act 2014 does not apply here because Mr Smith was convicted before 1 July 2014.
Subjective Circumstances of the Offender
92The offender is now 23 years old.  He was 21 when he killed the deceased.  He is still a young man.
93He grew up in difficult circumstances.  His parents separated when he was young.  He has lived most of his life with, and grew up in the care of, his father and stepmother.  The family in which he grew up has a total of nine children, four half-brothers and four half-sisters.  He has a reasonable relationship now with his mother and the rest of his family.
94The offender attended school until Year 8 when, at about the minimum age possible, he left school.  His literacy skills are limited.  He had some period of employment as an apprentice butcher and seems to have worked intermittently since that time.  At the time of the shooting he was undertaking some casual work as a scaffolder.  
95He has been in a relationship with his partner for seven years and is the father of 2 young children.  That relationship has continued whilst he has been in custody.
96As the reports show, he has a history of alcohol and drug abuse from a relatively young age.  This abuse has seemingly led him into criminal behaviour.  His criminal history reflects this.  It has escalated over time. 
97I have earlier referred to the conclusions of Dr Furst about Mr Smith's mental health, and there is no need to repeat them.  I have taken them carefully into account.  Dr Furst suggests that Mr Smith's underlying tendency towards anxiety and paranoid thinking was probably exacerbated by his drug taking in the hours leading up to the shooting.  To the extent that his opinion offers an explanation for what happened, I will have regard to it.  
Sentence
98In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Smith, I commence with a reminder that manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life.  It is a violation of the sanctity of human life, which is the concept at the heart of a civilised community.  
99Ordinarily, a conviction for manslaughter of the seriousness here found, warrants a substantial sentence because the demands of punishment and the deterrence of the broader community against similar conduct are of great importance.  Here, there is a need to ensure that any sentence imposed will deter Mr Smith from committing further criminal offences.
100I have discussed all of the facts that are relevant to this decision, and it is now necessary to make a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentence is.  
101This is a very serious offence involving the killing of a young man.  Without regard to any discount for his plea of guilty, but taking into account all of the objective and subjective factors to which I have referred, the appropriate sentence is one of a total of 16 years imprisonment.
102However, that sentence is reduced because of his plea of guilty to a total of 12 years imprisonment.
103It is necessary to determine an appropriate period for the offender to serve as a non-parole period.  This requires attention to be paid to the question of special circumstances.  I am not satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstance as the law permits: s 44(2) Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Whilst the offender has a need for rehabilitation to continue upon release back into the community, I do not see that the period provided in the statute would be inadequate for that purpose.  
104The non-parole period ought be 9 years.
105I am well satisfied that the nature and seriousness of the crime means that any lesser penalty, notwithstanding the subjective factors which weigh in favour of Mr Smith, would not be adequate to punish him, to deter him, and others, from committing similar offences and to denounce the crime.
Offence of Serious Personal Violence
106I am required to warn Mr Smith, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which he has been convicted, and for which he is being sentenced.  At some future point in time, an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of his sentence, he nevertheless ought be detained in ongoing custody or else ought be the subject of an extended supervision order impacting upon his liberty.
Date for commencement of Sentence
107Mr Smith was arrested, and taken into custody on 24 January 2013. His parole was revoked, and he served the balance of his earlier sentence.  This means that he has been in custody solely with respect to this offence since 12 February 2013.  It is appropriate for this sentence to commence on that date.
Sentence
108Mr Smith, I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment:
(1)A non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 12 February 2013 and concluding on 11 February 2022;
(2)A balance of term of 3 years expiring on 11 February 2025;
(3)The first day upon which you will be eligible to be released from custody is 11 February 2022.

2764515,North Coast Children's Home Inc. trading as Child & Adolescent Specialist Programs & Accommodation (CASPA) v Martin [2014] NSWDC 125,"Judgment

Introduction

1The plaintiffs, by statement of claim filed on 4 December 2013, bring proceedings for defamation arising from twelve publications made by the plaintiff. Seven were published on a Facebook account known as ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"". The remaining five are emails.

2These publications were made between 19 August 2013 and 11 September 2013. Some of the Internet publications remained accessible as late as 5 December 2013, when they were taken down by the operator of the ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"" account holder, Mr Tommy Campion.

The parties

3The first plaintiff is an incorporated not for profit organisation providing services for disadvantaged children in the form of foster care services and an accommodation facility at Lismore, known as the North Coast Children's Home. The second plaintiff was employed by the first plaintiff as the Manager of Foster Care Services and the third plaintiff is the Chief Executive Officer of the first plaintiff.

4The defendant is a 71-year-old retired former foster carer who applied to the first plaintiff seeking approval (together with his wife) as foster carers. Following approval of the defendant and his wife as registered carers in September 2012, a child was placed with them but, following the defendant becoming dissatisfied with the first plaintiff's conduct of the foster care services, the defendant and his wife discontinued the care of the child in December 2012. The defendant's services were engaged intermittently by the plaintiff for several months thereafter, but their work association had broken down by May 2013. Following this, the defendant commenced publishing the matters complained of.

The background to this litigation

5The North Coast Children's Home has a long history, although the involvement of the plaintiffs in carrying out their present roles is, as is set out in more detail below, very recent. 

6The North Coast Children's Home was first set up in 1919, when two young orphaned and neglected children were given into the care of the Vicar of St Andrews, the Reverend A. R. Ebbs. Those children were given temporary shelter until a local resident, a Mr George Barnard, offered the children the use of a house which he owned in Lismore, free of rent. There was public interest in the establishment of an orphanage in the town of Lismore. The placement of children at the Home continued, but its structure was not formalised until 1951, when a constitution for the home was prepared (Exhibit F to the affidavit of Mr Todd Yourell, 3 July 2014). The Management Committee was not incorporated, until 16 May 1989, when the relevant documents were lodged at the Corporate Affairs Commission registry in accordance with the Associations Incorporations Act 1984 (NSW).

7Mr Yourell's affidavit sets out that the Church of England's role in relation to the Home continued, but on a restricted basis. Since 1989, the Bishop of the Diocese of Grafton has held powers enabling him to appoint up to four members of the Board of Governance, which is responsible for the affairs of the first plaintiff (hereafter referred to as ""CASPA""). The Board of Governance is responsible for the affairs of CASPA and acts in the interests of CASPA. Prior to incorporation in 1989 the Anglican Diocese of Grafton was responsible for the affairs of North Coast Children's Home.

8It was while the Anglican Diocese of Grafton was responsible for the affairs of North Coast Children's Home, prior to 1989, that substantial and serious abuse of children at the home occurred. Orphaned and neglected children in the care of the home were victims of sexual, physical and psychological abuse. As is common in relation to victims of institution-based abuse, there were few complaints at the time, and those which were made were ignored, disbelieved and/or discouraged. 

9The Anglican Diocese of Grafton received a number of complaints in 2006 about historical acts of physical, sexual and psychological abuse at the North Coast Children's Home in Lismore, all of which occurred between the 1940s and 1980s. Thirty-nine of those claims were settled through negotiated payments. Two of those persons did not participate in the settlement, and instead brought proceedings. Seven others later came forward with similar claims. The Right Reverend Keith Slater, who acknowledged that he did not pass on all the complaints to the Church's Professional Standards Director as was required, resigned as Bishop in May 2013.

10While the nature and extent of the abuses which occurred are the subject of current inquiry and evidence, the nature and extent of the inquiry currently being undertaken by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse (""the Royal Commission"") relates to periods well before the employment of the second and third plaintiff, and well before the first plaintiff, which is no longer a part of the Anglican Church but a separate organisation. It is neither controlled by, nor answerable to, the Anglican Church. As Mr Yourell points out in paragraphs 20-24 of his affidavit (Exhibit F), the Royal Commission is considering a case study of the home during its operation by the Anglican Church in the 1960s and 1970s, more than 40 years ago, but not into its present operation.

The publications

11The publications fall into the following categories:

(a)The Facebook publications;

(b)The complaint to the Director of Professional Standards;

(c)The emails to foster carers;

(d)The email to the second and third plaintiffs;

(e)The email to Fostering New South Wales on the Fostering New South Wales website.

12I shall deal with each in turn.

(a) The Facebook Publications

13The Facebook publications were seven posts on a site headed ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"". The site was hosted by Mr Tommy Campion, who wrote about the abuse he suffered while an occupant of the home, 30 to 40 years ago, his claims for compensation and recognition of that abuse, and the impending inquiry into those events by the Royal Commission, at which Mr Campion gave evidence. The site had a large and active following. Although counsel for the plaintiffs' written submissions state that the Facebook page had a ""membership of over 280 individuals"" this is in fact the number of ""likes"" recorded on the page at a particular time. Nevertheless, this was a site that was of significant interest for anyone interested in the evidence being heard before the Royal Commission in relation to the historic abuse claims in the 1960s and 1970s.

14Each of the matters complained of published on the Facebook website page made allegations, not about an identified connection to the historic abuse claims such as Mr Campion's, but of incompetence, dishonesty and neglect. Generalised claims of ""abuse"" were also made. The relevant imputations are as follows:

16The imputations are:

(a)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 1-4, 6-7, 16-23);

(b)The first plaintiff engages in child abuse (Lines 6-7, 14, 38);

(c)The first plaintiff neglects the children in its care (Lines 9-13, 40-44);

(d)The first plaintiff abuses foster carers engaged by the first plaintiff (Lines 19-20).

(d)The third plaintiff is not qualified to manage the first plaintiff (Lines 17-19).

The sixth matter complained of - 17 October 2013

18The imputations are:

(a)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 15-18, 20-21);

(b)the third plaintiff does not care about the children in the care of the first plaintiff (Lines 2-14);

(c)the first plaintiff does not care about the children in its (Lines 2-14).

The tenth matter complained of - 19 November 2013

20The imputations are:

(a)the first plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 6-9);

(b)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 6-9);

(c)the first plaintiff does not care about the children in its care (Lines 6-9);

(d)the third plaintiff does not care about the children in the care of the first plaintiff (Lines 6-9); 

(e)the third plaintiff is a child abuser (Lines 6-9).

The eleventh matter complained of - 19 November 2013

21The imputations are:

(a)the first plaintiff neglects the children in its care (Lines 1-4);

(b)the first plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 1-6);

(c)the first plaintiff lies to the foster carers it engages (Lines 4-6);

(d)the first plaintiff abuses the children in its care (Lines 5-6).

22Although the allegation made by the defendant were principally of dishonesty and neglect, imputations of abuse of children occur in imputations arising from the first, second, tenth and eleventh publications. These are the most serious imputations.

(b) The complaint to the Director of Professional Standards

23The third matter complained of is a complaint to Mr Michael Elliott, Director of Professional Standards, Anglican Diocese of Newcastle/Armidale/Grafton. The imputations conveyed are as follows:

(a)the third plaintiff is a bully (Lines 12-14);

(b)the third plaintiff does not care about complaints made about the first plaintiff's foster care services (Lines 12-14);

(c)the second plaintiff deserves to be dismissed from her employment with the first plaintiff (Lines 15, 55, 83);

(d)the third plaintiff deserves to be dismissed from his employment with the first plaintiff (Lines 15, 55, 83);

(e)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 35-36, 37-40);

(f)The first plaintiff neglects the children under its care (Lines 43-48, 53-54, 66, 69-71).

24I note that Mr Elliott responded on the same day, stating that CASPA, the first plaintiff, was an organisation independent of the Anglican Diocese of Grafton, the complaint did not fall within his jurisdiction, and that the historical complaints of abuse regarding the North Coast Children's Home were unrelated to the activities of CASPA. The significance of these remarks appears to have been lost upon the defendant.

(c) The emails to foster carers

25The defendant sent two emails to other foster carers dated 27 September and 29 October 2013, respectively. The first of these conveyed the following imputations:

(a)the first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 6-7, 12-14, 21-22, 50-53);

(b)the second plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 40-46);

(c)the second plaintiff does not care about the children under the care of the first plaintiff (Lines 76-78);

(d)the first plaintiff is managed by persons who are not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 87-91);

(e)the second plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 87-91);

(f)the third plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 87-91).

The eighth matter complained of 

26The eighth matter complained of contained the following imputations:

(a)the first plaintiff has engaged in child abuse (Lines 10-11);

(b)the first plaintiff engages in intimidatory behaviour (Lines 24-25);

(c)the first plaintiff has a bad reputation (Lines 28-32);

(d)the first plaintiff runs a children's home which is cruel to children (Lines 28-32);

(e)the first plaintiff runs a children's home which engages in sexual abuse of children (Lines 28-32);

(f)the second plaintiff treats foster carers badly (Lines 33-35);

(g)the first plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 36-42);

(h)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 36-42);

(i)the second plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 51-56);

(j)the third plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 51-55);

(k)the first plaintiff does not look after children in its care (Lines 92-94);

(l)the first plaintiff is engaged in a scam (Lines 60-88, 106-115, 119-123);

(m)the second plaintiff is engaged in a scam (Lines 60-88, 106-115);

(n)the third plaintiff is engaged in a scam (Lines 60-88, 106-115, 119-123);

(o)the first plaintiff will not be allocated any more children for its care (Lines 115-118).

27The exact number of emails which were circulated on each occasion is unknown to the plaintiffs. The first email is addressed to Robyn Dwyer, a foster carer for the first plaintiff and according to the affidavit of Naarah Rodwell sworn on 24 April 2014 this email was also received by Alan and Sue Bugeja, who were foster carers for the first plaintiff, and by Mr and Mrs Crosby, who were foster carers for another organisation described as ""UPA"". Ms Dwyer read the email on the telephone to the second plaintiff, which she found very distressing, and the following day she received a telephone call from Angela Reid of UPA who informed her that carers at UPA had also received this email.

28The eighth matter complained of is addressed to an Internet address for Mr Alan Bugeja, and the affidavit evidence of the plaintiffs is that this email was sent to other carers as well.

(d) The defendant's email to the second and third plaintiffs

29The defendant sent an email to the second and third plaintiffs conveying the following imputations:

(a)the second plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 11-30, 40-42, 43-52, 54, 75-77);

(b)the second plaintiff is incompetent to provide foster care services (Lines11-25, 49-50);

(c)the third plaintiff is incompetent to provide foster care services (Lines 53-54);

(d)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 70-72, 75-77).

30The question of whether there is publication to a third party where an email is sent to one plaintiff, who then shows it to another plaintiff, rests upon uncertain ground. There may be exceptional cases where an email addressed to all the plaintiffs may amount to publication to third parties, as occurred in Zarth v Williamson [2006] NSWCA 246. Although counsel for the plaintiff says that this email was copied to the second plaintiff, that is not apparent from the email letterhead. The second plaintiff may be entitled to complain about this publication concerning her capabilities made to the third plaintiff, but I cannot see that the third plaintiff has any cause of action at all. In practical terms, given the number of publications, this publication adds little and I propose to err on the side of caution and to disregard it.

(e) Email to Fostering New South Wales on the Fostering New South Wales website

31On 11 September 2013 the defendant forwarded an email to Fostering New South Wales which the plaintiffs plead conveyed the following imputations:

(a)the first plaintiff had no staff qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 11-15); 

(b)the first plaintiff is associated with child abuse (Lines 11-13);

(c)the second plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 11-15).

The defendant's role in these proceedings

32As the plaintiffs were unable to serve the defendant at his home address, they applied to this Court, ex parte, during the court vacation (on 24 January 2014). An order for substituted service was made retrospectively for service on the defendant at the email address from which he had forwarded the emails. Substituted service was also effected in accordance with this order on the defendant's post office box.

33The defendant had no notice of this ex parte application, and scant notice of the first return date of these proceedings before Bozic SC DCJ on 28 February 2014. 

34On 28 February 2014, the plaintiffs, according to Exhibit B, asked the Court to enter default judgment against the defendant, on the basis that no defence had been filed, relying upon the affidavit of Mr Ware, the solicitor for the plaintiffs, sworn 27 February 2014. Bozic SC DCJ considered it was appropriate for a notice of motion to be filed seeking orders for judgment. The solicitor appearing for the plaintiffs asked the Court, if the Court was not prepared to enter judgment, to make an order for the defendant to file a defence within 14 days but his Honour was not prepared to do so. His Honour made the following orders:

(1)Notice of motion seeking orders for judgment to be served on the defendant by email.

(2)Notice of motion listed for hearing on 14 March 2014.

35Although not ordered to do so by Levy SC DCJ on 24 January 2014, the plaintiffs had notified the defendant of that return date on 31 January 2014. They also notified him of the subsequent hearing date for the application for default (or summary) judgment, namely 14 March 2014.

36On 26 February 2014, a copy of what has been described by the defendant as a ""defence"" was provided to the solicitors for the plaintiffs by hand delivery to their office. This document, which is annexure D to the affidavit of Mr Ware of 27 February 2014 is a discursive narrative; it first asserts that the first plaintiff is ""disqualified"" from commencing proceedings as it was incorporated and a ""for profit organisation"", being part of the ""billion dollar organisation"" of the Church of England. The defendant states that the emails only went to a few people, that he did not give permission for them to be distributed beyond the recipients, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to any damages, and that he proposed to plead justification, contextual truth, privilege and ""fair comment"", although no such pleadings were appended.

37The defendant's response to the proposed listing of the application for default judgment on 14 March 2014 was to say that he was in poor health, did not have sufficient funds to retain a lawyer and was not able to come to Sydney. He requested a re-scheduling of the hearing.

38When the matter came before Bozic SC DCJ on 14 March 2014, his Honour made the following orders:

(1)Judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant.

(2)Damages to be assessed.

(3)Costs.

(4)That the proceedings proceed to trial for damages to be assessed.

(5)Matter stood over to 28 March 2014 for allocation of a hearing date.

(6)Defendant to be notified by plaintiffs of orders made today.

39There is a note on the court file that ""short oral reasons"" were given, but these are not available. A letter from the plaintiff's solicitors' city agents (Exhibit C) noted the contents of those reasons. This letter, which was tendered, sets out that his Honour viewed the defendant's comments about future legal representation and ill health (and presumably his request for an adjournment) as evidencing that there was no likelihood the defendant would in the near future take any part in the legal proceedings. His Honour also stated that the defendant should not conduct his case through email correspondence, as opposed to filing documents in Court. As no defence (including the ""defence"" sent to the plaintiff's solicitors, but not the court) had been filed, judgment was entered.

40On 28 March 2014, Bozic SC DCJ made the following orders, and gave a hearing date for the assessment of damages in the defamation list and not in the general list:

(1)Parties to file and serve any affidavit material as to the issue of damages by 28 April 2014.

(2)Parties to file and serve submissions by 19 May 2014.

(3)Matter is listed for hearing (in relation to the default judgment) on 25 July 2014.

(4)Plaintiffs are to notify the defendant of these orders.

41On 1 April 2014 the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant, notifying him of the hearing on 25 July 2014 and on 28 April 2014 served their affidavits on damages. The plaintiff's written submissions on damages were served on 24 June 2014. A reply from the defendant dated 24 June 2014 contained statements of an abusive nature, threats to go to the media, and repetitions of the libel (Exhibit D).

42A further affidavit was sent on 2 July, resulting in an email response from the defendant, saying: ""I hope your client understands what they are unleashing, it may well end as a media frenzy"" (affidavit of Mr Ware, Exhibit D).

43The defendant has provided written submissions as to damages to the Court by post, email and fax. As to damages, the defendant submitted that none of the plaintiffs should be awarded any damages, for reasons set out in more detail below.

The remaining issues in this litigation

44Issues such as the capacity of imputations, and the entitlement of the first plaintiff to bring an action for defamation at all, are relevant to liability and not to quantum. This is one of the reasons why default judgment is, as a rule, not entered in defamation proceedings: French v Triple M Melbourne Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 36, citing Altarama Ltd v Forsyth [1981] 1 NSWLR 188. Applications for default judgment in defamation have on occasions been adverted to as possible: see Northumbrian Ice Cream Co Ltd v Breakaway Vending Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1216 at [1], [11]-[12] (application refused on other grounds); Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion (Supreme Court of New South Wales, McCallum J, 2 December 2013, unreported). 

45Such applications are increasingly common in defamation proceedings; for example, in Petrov v Do [2013] NSWSC 1382, where the defendants were a Macedonian newspaper and a person resident in Macedonia, default judgment was entered after no defence was filed, and the damages awarded (totalling $350,000) are the highest amount of general damages awarded under the Act. Other recent examples of default judgment applications resulting in an assessment of damages include Ritson v Burns [2014] NSWSC 272; Stevens v Mayberry [2012] SASC 220; Leech v Green & Gold Energy Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 999. The short gaps between the default judgment application and the listing for hearing suggests these hearings bypass case management or list judge lists. Attempts to set aside default or summary judgments of this kind been unsuccessful: Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244; Dossis v Andreadis [2012] SADC 104. 

46More recently, perhaps in response to the increasing number of applications for default judgment, the courts have sounded a warning note. Beech-Jones J expressed concern, in Graham v Powell (No 3) 2014 NSWSC 185 at [6] of the ""risk of oppression"" in entering a default judgment against a litigant in person who cannot file a defence in proper form. Beech-Jones J warned of the need for caution before striking out a defence of this kind (at [6]), although his Honour went on to do so after satisfying himself that publication was not in dispute and the imputations clearly arose (at [7] - [9]). His Honour did not consider it necessary to consider the issue of whether there was any defence to the claim. 

47In Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales v Davies [2011] NSWSC 1445, the more cautious course was taken, where no defence had been filed, of listing the matter for hearing on all issues, recording attempts to locate the defendant, putting forward the allegations of fact made by the plaintiff as having been taken to be admitted (Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") r 14.16) and setting out each part of the plaintiff's claim, in the same manner which would be used for an unrepresented litigant (see also Higgins v Sinclair [2011] NSWSC 163 at [66]). In Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales v Davies, supra, Latham J considered the standing of the plaintiff (which, like the first plaintiff in these proceedings, needed to establish that it was an excluded corporation by reason of s 9(2)(b) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)), imputations (including both capacity and defamatory meaning) and whether publication and identification had been established. 

48That is not the case here. Effectively, none of those tasks may be performed by me, as this is an assessment hearing for damages only, by reason of the entry of default judgment by Bozic SC DCJ.

49The defendant effectively had two months' notice that proceedings had been commenced before judgment was entered. In practical terms, he may have had less, as it would appear that he did not consult his email or mailbox until 31 January 2014, which would explain the circumstances in which he was surprised to find these documents when they were sent to him on 31 January 2014. As January is generally a holiday period, and the defendant said he did not regularly consult his email, I am prepared to assume that while he was served on 10 January 2014, he did not receive any practical or actual notice of these proceedings until the email of 31 January 2014.

50The defendant did not attend Court on 28 February, when the application for default judgment was made. Nor did he attend Court on 14 March 2014 when judgment was entered against him. He was aware, in my view, of both these hearings. I take into account that he told the Court of his ill health and asked for an adjournment of the 14 March hearing, but these were matters which were clearly put before Bozic SC DCJ and rejected by his Honour, who on the day had the benefit of oral submissions from the city agent for the plaintiff's solicitors as to the history of these proceedings: Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd, supra.

51There has been no application to set aside or appeal (see Coren, supra) the orders made by Bozic SC DCJ. I have carefully examined the affidavits sworn by Mr Ware, including his affidavits of 27 February and 4 March, the affidavit of Ms Cripps Clark of 12 March and the correspondence from the solicitors for the plaintiffs to the defendant prior to the commencement of proceedings. I am satisfied the defendant knew what those orders were, and have been guided by the principles of law and case management set out in Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd, supra, at [16] et passim.

52I am further satisfied, from the evidence set out in these affidavits, that the defendant was well aware that proceedings were likely if he continued to publish. On 30 September 2013, the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to him, demanding that all defamatory communications should cease, that he should retract all statements and that he should retract the imputations conveyed in the publications he was making. On 2 October 2013 the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant providing a list of defamatory imputations and seeking an undertaking from him that he cease making them, including foreshadowing proceedings for injunctive relief, damages and costs.

53The defendant replied on 3 October 2013, arguing his case and refusing to give any such undertakings. Despite receiving this correspondence, he went on to publish the sixth to twelfth matters complained of, over the next two months. This included further postings on the ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"" page, which Mr Tommy Campion agreed, on 5 December 2013, to remove, adding:

""I thought I had blocked him. I'll have another look. Sorry about that. Todd [the defendant] is a nuisance."" (Exhibit M)

54The intemperate response of the defendant to the requests to cease making these posts has been repeated in his correspondence following the commencement of these proceedings. The submissions he has provided to the Court are, like his ""defence"" (which was in fact never lodged with the Court), a generalised smear of the plaintiffs, interspersed with threats of contacting the media.

55It is generally the case with proceedings in this Court that parties are encouraged to attend mediation or otherwise endeavour to resolve their differences without the cost and expense of a hearing. In the present case, Mr McCall submits, and I agree, that any prospect of mediation is hopeless.

56While I am concerned at the rapidity with which the proceedings moved from commencement to final judgment, I can understand the response of Bozic SC DCJ to the defendant's intemperate correspondence. Finally, and most tellingly, no application has been made to me to adjourn the hearing date, nor has the defendant sought to set aside the judgment and file a defence, which he could have done at any time prior to the hearing. 

57Accordingly, I have proceeded with the assessment of damages on the basis of the evidence before me. That evidence has included the defendant's written submissions, which I have marked Exhibit 1, which I have taken into account both in relation to the circumstances in which this case has proceeded to assessment as well as on the issue of damages.

58The defendant does not answer the claim for damages by the second and third defendants beyond repeating the defamatory allegations, in terms which must (in relation to the second and third defendants, who seek aggravated compensatory damages) substantially aggravate the damage caused.

Damages

59Section 34 of the Act provides that the amount of damages awarded must bear an approximate and rational relationship with the harm done. The amount currently gazetted as at 1 July 2014 is $366,000 (s 35). No apology or correction by the defendant in mitigation of the award of damages has been provided (s 38).

60The purpose of an award of damages in defamation is threefold. First there is the consolation for personal distress and hurt caused to each plaintiff. Secondly, there is reparation for damage to the plaintiff's reputation and thirdly, there is the issue of vindication. In practical terms, these purposes overlap: Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [60].

61The first plaintiff is a corporation and the plaintiff acknowledges it cannot recover damages for hurt to feelings: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Comalco Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 510, or for aggravated damages: NRMA Insurance Ltd v Flanagan [1982] 1 NSWLR 585.

Extent of publication 

62Publication of matter on social media forms part of publication of material of a highly attractive nature, available over the Internet, which is ""publication to the world at large"" (Higgins v Sinclair, supra, at [16]).

63Seven of the publications were made on the Internet, to an audience which would have been quick to think the worst when reading material of such a sensational nature. The timing of the entries, in circumstances where Mr Campion was about to give evidence at the Royal Commission in November 2013, was critical.

64Out of the remaining publications, all but the seventh matter complained of (which I propose to disregard for the purposes of damages, since it was effectively a publication to the second and third plaintiffs themselves) were made to persons with whom each of the plaintiffs had a professional relationship. Such publications are often described as hitting a plaintiff ""where he/she/it lives"", in the sense that such publications, although limited, are the more hurtful for being sent to persons with whom the plaintiff has a close relationship.

65All of the matters complained of convey imputations of dishonesty, incompetency and neglect. Of particular seriousness are the following imputations:

(a)Imputation (c) in the first matter complained of.

(b)Imputation (d) in the second matter complained of.

(c)Imputations (d) and (e) in the eighth matter complained of.

(d)Imputation (e) of the eleventh matter complained of.

(e)Imputation (b) of the twelfth matter complained of.

66While imputations of dishonesty, incompetence and neglect are serious issues, imputations of involvement in child abuse of any kind must be viewed as the most serious imputations capable of being made.

67Mr McCall referred to a number of recent decisions where defamation damages where awarded. In Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals New South Wales v Davies, supra, Latham J referred at [56] to the statement by Hayne J in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, supra, that there was a limited utility in comparing awards for defamation. Her Honour went on to note awards in Higgins v Sinclair, supra, of $100,000 to each plaintiff for material published on a website and sent to an email involving allegations of negligence, dishonesty and theft. 

68I acknowledge what her Honour says about the comparative value of other damages awards, but more recently, in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2014] QCA 33, Applegarth J carefully reviews the relevant principles in relation to damages and (at [46]-[49]) carefully explains the proper use of comparable awards. That includes (at [83]) the position of the defamation of a corporation. I have found his Honour's comments a helpful guide in the correct approach to take to damages generally.

The defendant's submissions

69Although it is unusual to do so, I propose to consider the defendant's submissions first, before turning to the evidence of the plaintiffs.

70The defendant's principal submission, in relation to the first defendant, is that it is not an exempt corporation and cannot bring defamation proceedings. I reject that submission, as the plaintiff has demonstrated, by tender of the Memorandum of Association and the affidavit of its Chief Executive Officer, that it is a not for profit corporation falling within the provisions of s 9(2)(b) of the Act: see Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales v Davies, supra, at [2]-[5].

71His second submission is that the first plaintiff, if not a corporation, would be ""a convicted paedophile for all the sex and other abuse it has committed, admitted to, apologised for and paid some victims compensation for"" (Exhibit 1). He goes on to refer to current child abuse inquiries in the United Kingdom, and to claim that the first defendant is a ""thoroughly despicable organisation which should have been closed down in disgrace like the News of the World was closed when it was caught behaving badly"" (Exhibit 1).

72The circumstances of the closure of News of the World (shut down at its owner's behest, not by process of law) are irrelevant. The News of the World (surprisingly, perhaps) played no part, ""despicable"" or otherwise, in any of the historic child abuse claims, in children's homes or hospitals, or by clergy or other persons (such as celebrities), currently under investigation in the United Kingdom.

73The defendant employs the ""no smoke without fire"" approach to the issues in this case (to use Eady J's phrase in Lillie v Newcastle City Council [2002] EWHC 1600 at [361] - [366]). In the course of this judgment, when commenting on somewhat similar general allegations that child sex abuse must have occurred, Eady J rejected what he called a ""job lot"" of allegations of child abuse could be brought on the basis that it was possible some abuse had occurred at some stage. 

74In the present case, there is even less evidence, in that there is no link whatever between the corporate first plaintiff or the individual plaintiffs and the historic allegations forty or more years ago. The NSW Court of Appeal, in Westbus Pty Ltd (Receivers Appointed) v Ishak [2006] NSWCA 198 at [20], similarly warned about the use of ""conjecture"" to draw conclusions of this kind.

75Contrary to the defendant's claims that such allegations should be protected by ""freedom of speech"", generalised and unproved allegations are a nuisance to the current ongoing inquiries into historic abuse claims of the kind discussed in Mr Campion's Facebook account. In his Facebook comment of 5 December 2013 (Exhibit M), Mr Campion says that the defendant is just that - ""a nuisance"". The defendant's claims (paragraph 3 of his submissions) that he had sent ""many more"" messages to Mr Campion that were not published are a confirmation of Mr Campion's ultimate rejection (after having initially encouraged the defendant until deciding his contributions were not worth publishing) of the defendant's allegations. As for the defendant's (completely irrelevant) references to the importance of revelations such as his to the child abuse inquiries currently being held in the United Kingdom, similar concerns to those referred to by the plaintiffs, about the dangers of exaggerated and unresearched allegations of this nature, have no doubt concerned these investigating bodies and respected child research abuse sites (such as Spotlight). The defendant's submissions only reinforce the danger of the false allegation - so easy to make, and so difficult to refute.

76The defendant not only denies that he consented to publication of the Facebook entries he made but, as to the extent of publication in relation to damages, claims that he was not responsible for the circulation of emails to carers beyond the persons to whom they were addressed. I do not accept these submissions, in light of the evidence to the contrary set out above.

77Having set out the defendant's submissions, and my reasons for not accepting them, I now consider the evidence of the plaintiffs on issues of damages. This evidence was in the form of affidavits which have all been served on the defendant.

The first plaintiff

78In relation to an organisation working in the area of caring of disadvantaged children, imputations that the first plaintiff is dishonest, does not care for the children placed in its care, abuses those children and mistreats foster carers are imputations of great seriousness. The most serious are, as I have already indicated, allegations of abuse of children. Few crimes are more detested than the abuse (particularly sexual abuse) of young and vulnerable children, especially coming from the persons into whose care they have been put.

79Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that vindication can only be achieved by a significant award of damages, which he puts at $50,000. The submissions of the plaintiffs were served upon the defendant. He is therefore familiar with the figure of $50,000 and has responded to it in his submissions. 

80As is set out above, the defendant states that none of the plaintiffs should be entitled to any damages. This is an unrealistic submission and I am unimpressed by the defendant's claim that the plaintiff is a ""paedophile company"". I accept Mr McCall's submission that a substantial award is necessary for vindication purposes and accordingly I propose to award the sum of $50,000. As a corporation, the first plaintiff is not entitled to aggravated compensatory damages.

The second and third plaintiffs

81The second plaintiff holds qualifications in social sciences and foster caring. She commenced employment with the first plaintiff in 2012 after a career in the field of foster care. The imputations raised against her include that she was dishonest, involved in a scam, incompetent, unqualified, treats foster care providers badly and does not care about children under her care.

82The second plaintiff has suffered injury to health as a result of these publications and reacted badly to the twelfth matter complained of, locking herself away in distress and crying. I have read the affidavit of her mother, confirming this incident (affidavit of Ms Rodwell, Exhibit H, at paragraphs 10-13). She was distressed by the fourth to sixth and eighth matters complained of, because she was pregnant at the time, caring for her young daughter and doing so in circumstances where her husband was working away from home. She suffered anxiety and panic attacks and sought treatment from a psychologist. I have read the affidavit of her husband, her mother and Ms Teece setting out their observations of her deep distress, upset, sleeplessness and hurt to feelings generally.

83I am satisfied that the effect upon the second plaintiff was significant and that she suffered greatly as a result of the defendant's actions. The sum necessary to address the three elements of compensation must be significant.

84The second plaintiff also claims aggravated compensatory damages. In Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [37]-[40], Applegarth J explains:

""[37] Damages may be increased if there is ""a lack of bona fides in the defendant's conduct or it is improper or unjustifiable"". The aggravating conduct may have occurred in making the publication or at any time up to the assessment of damages. Aggravated damages are compensatory in nature:

""The concept of 'aggravated damages' is not, whether calculated separately or not, a different 'head' of damage. It focuses on the circumstances of the wrongdoing which have made the impact of it worse for the plaintiff. It is not to go beyond compensation for the aggravation of the harm to repute or feelings. It is not a means of punishing a defendant."" 

Section 37 of the Act states that a plaintiff cannot be awarded exemplary or punitive damages for defamation.

[38] Conduct which is improper, unjustifiable or lacks bona fides may affect reputation. In such a case the damage ""continues until it is caused to cease"" by an avowal by the defendant that the defamation is untrue or a judgment in the plaintiff's favour. Accordingly, damages may be increased by an unjustifiable failure to apologise or retract, by unjustifiable persistence in making untrue allegations or by the conduct of the defence of proceedings in a manner which is unjustifiable, improper or lacking in bona fides. The robust but reasonable pursuit of a bona fide defence where there is evidence to support it does not permit an award of aggravated damages. Pleading and persisting in a defence of truth without a proper basis does.

[39] Conduct which is improper, unjustifiable or lacks bona fides may increase injury to feelings by causing the plaintiff greater indignity. Bad conduct by the defendant may outrage the plaintiff's feelings. In Carson McHugh J stated, ""the anger of the plaintiff is placated only when he or she knows that the defendant has been punished for the wrong"". However, care is required that an award to compensate the plaintiff for injured feelings has ""an appropriate and rational relationship"" with the harm sustained and does not contain an impermissible punitive element which exceeds what is necessary to ""assuage the hurt, indignation and desire for retribution which the plaintiff feels"". 

[40] Section 36 of the Act requires the court in awarding damages to ""disregard the malice or other state of mind of the defendant at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter...or at any other time except to the extent that the malice or other state of mind affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff."" Thus malice or a reckless indifference to the truth or falsity of the publication does not warrant, of itself, an award of aggravated damages. However, if the plaintiff is aware of the defendant's state of mind and this aggravates the plaintiff's hurt feelings, then damages may be increased in order to appropriately compensate. If the defendant's conduct is improper or unjustifiable, this aggravation may be reflected in a separate award of aggravated damages.""

85Applegarth J goes on to explain the interaction of aggravated damages and general compensatory damages:

""[41] An award of damages in excess of the statutory cap is permitted if the circumstances of publication are such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages. But this does not compel a judge to separately assess aggravated damages. In 1997 this court remarked in the context of a jury's assessment of damages that there was no reason why the jury should have been obliged to answer a distinct question about aggravated damages. Circumstances of aggravation may justify ""the court in assessing compensatory damages at a figure higher than that which would have been appropriate without those circumstances; but this does not mean that the increase is a separate category of damages"". The court observed:

""The jury is not to be invited to perform the difficult intellectual task of first considering the defamation in an abstract way, disregarding the circumstances in which it was published and the extent of publication, and then separately considering how much should be awarded for those matters"".""

86The question remains whether aggravated damages should be awarded as a separate assessment or the damages award should be adjusted. I note Applegarth J's statement at [42] that a judge may assess a single amount which is appropriate to compensate for harm caused by the publication and the additional harm resulting from the conduct warranting the award of aggravated compensatory damages.

87Damages may be mitigated in a number of ways, some of which are set out at s 38(1) of the Act. There are no mitigating circumstances in these proceedings.

88Mr McCall submits, and I agree, that an appropriate sum, taking into account these principles, is $100,000. Again, that is a figure with which the defendant is familiar, and I have read his submissions in this regard. I propose to award this sum as the total of general and aggravated damages, in accordance with s 39 of the Act.

The third plaintiff

89The third plaintiff has been employed by the first plaintiff as its General Manager and Chief Executive Officer since August 2010. He is also a member of Anglicare Australia's Council, which is the governing body for Anglicare Australia.

90The imputations made against the third plaintiff are also extremely serious. They are essentially the same as those set out above for the second plaintiff.

91The impact upon the third plaintiff's health has been severe because he has a prior history of depression. As a result of the publication of the matters complained of he sought medical treatment (affidavit of Mr Yourell, paragraph 29). His wife has deposed that his response to the publication has included not only anxiety and depression but insomnia (at paragraphs 3-7).

92In particular, the defendant has expressly charged the third plaintiff with engaging in child abuse. For a man, that is a particularly serious imputation. The written submissions of the defendant inflame the situation by sneering at the third plaintiff's prior history of depression.

93Mr McCall submits, and I agree, that an appropriate award of damages, having regard to the relevant principles set out above, is $100,000. This would reflect the need for a substantial award and the factors warranting an award of aggravated compensatory damages. Again, it is the figure identified in the plaintiffs' submissions served on the defendant, and therefore an amount to which the defendant has had the opportunity to reply.

94I am aware of the dangers of awarding similar sums for plaintiffs in defamation proceedings (see Maxwell-Smith v Warren [2007] NSWCA 270). However, each of the plaintiffs has been careful to plead only imputations in which they are named, and the objections of the Court of Appeal to the awarding of similar sums in Maxwell-Smith v Warren, which appears to have been bound up in the issues of identification discussed in those proceedings as the plaintiffs were not named, would not apply here.

95As requested by counsel for the plaintiffs I have reserved the issues of interest and costs with liberty to apply.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the first plaintiff for $50,000.

(2)Judgment for the second plaintiff for $100,000.

(3)Judgment for the third plaintiff for $100,000.

(4)Costs and interest reserved with liberty to apply on 7 days' notice.

(5)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		08 August 2014",2014-08-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764517,Matthews v R [2014] NSWCCA 151,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:BackgroundOn 2 April 2013 the applicant was indicted for the murder of Scott Miller before Acting Justice Mathews.  He entered a plea of not guilty.  Thereafter, the trial proceeded until 11 April 2013 when the jury retired to consider its verdict.  On 16 April 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.  On 27 May 2013 Mathews AJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and a balance of term of 5 years (Regina v Matthews [2013] NSWSC 659).
2The applicant appeals against conviction only.  The sole ground of the appeal is that ""the verdict of the jury that the applicant was guilty of murder is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence"".  This ground of appeal raises issues of fact and as a result, the appeal requires the leave of the Court.  Because there are real factual issues to be considered by the Court, I would grant that leave.
3The indictment asserted that on 22 February 2011 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales, the applicant did murder Scott Miller.  The Crown case was that early in the evening of Saturday 19 February 2011 a fight took place between the applicant and the deceased in the vicinity of Taylor Square, which culminated in the applicant punching the deceased heavily in the face or head.  The deceased fell back and probably hit his head on the iron railing of a pedestrian fence before falling to the ground.   Unknown to anyone, including the deceased, he had an aneurysm in his brain which burst upon one of these impacts, probably as the result of a punch.  This caused an immediate and severe brain haemorrhage.  He was taken to St Vincents Hospital where he was placed on life support.  The support was withdrawn on 22 February 2011 and the deceased died shortly afterwards.
4Most of the evidence at the trial came from witnesses who had observed at least part of the conflict between the applicant and the deceased.  Because this confrontation took place in a well frequented public area, there was no shortage of eye-witnesses.  Thirteen people described their observations of relevant events and the applicant also gave evidence.  Not surprisingly, in relation to events which happened quickly and unexpectedly, there were significant discrepancies between these accounts.
5Both the deceased and the applicant were much the same age - about 37 years old at the time.  Both were very fit, having made a point of maintaining their physical fitness.  In that regard, the deceased was 1.85 cm in height (approximately 6 foot 3 inches), weighed 85.5 kilograms (13 stone 5 pounds).  The applicant was approximately 178 cm tall (5 foot 10 inches) and weighed 78 kilograms (12 stone 4 pounds).  The deceased had a completely shaven head.
6The following matters appear to be uncontroversial.  The applicant and the deceased were acquainted with each other as they had a number of mutual friends.  There seems to have been underlying tension between them.  The evening before the killing, an incident took place at the Courthouse Hotel at Taylor Square.  The deceased apparently had ""issues with money"", having previously been a problem gambler.  On this occasion, the applicant was openly displaying a large amount of cash.  The deceased said to him ""Stop throwing it around.  I don't need to see it"".  The applicant responded ""Mind your own business, I can do what I want"".  The incident ended there but it seems to have left an impression on both of them.
7On 19 February the applicant went to the Courthouse Hotel at about 8.30 or 9am.  He was joined an hour later by Jayson Bell.  He then left the hotel in order to organise himself and take his son for lunch at Chinatown.  He estimated that he would have drunk three or four schooners of beer during the course of the morning.  He returned to the hotel at about 2pm and remained there until 6.30pm.  During that time he was again talking to and drinking with Jayson Bell.  He described himself as ""drunk, but not overly drunk"".  At 6.30pm Mr Bell told him that he was going home for a meal and the applicant also decided to leave and go to his own home.
8The deceased came to the Courthouse Hotel earlier that afternoon.  He was sitting in the courtyard area at the front of the hotel when Mr Bell and the applicant passed him on their way out.  The deceased and Mr Bell were close friends and lived in the same apartment block in Surry Hills.  Mr Bell told the deceased that he was going home and suggested that he come too.  Mr Bell and the applicant then continued to walk south along the pedestrian extension of Bourke Street until they were near the front of Kinselas Hotel.   At about that point, the deceased came up to the applicant and according to Mr Bell said words to the effect ""What is your problem?  What have I done?  I've done nothing to you"".  He then moved a short distance away.  The applicant said to Mr Bell ""I don't like this bloke"".  
9Thereafter, there is a considerable difference in the evidence given by the witnesses.  The predominance of the evidence, however, is to the effect that shortly after the verbal confrontation, a physical fight started between the two men with punches being thrown on both sides.  During the course of the fight, they moved from their initial location near the front of Kinselas Hotel east towards Flinders Street, then south along the side of a building known as ""T2"".  It was here that the fatal blow was struck by the applicant.
10After the deceased was lying on the ground, there are accounts of the applicant stomping on his head or on the upper part of his body.
11The Crown case largely depended upon the first eyewitness to give evidence, Anthony Whiting, who had been a close friend of the deceased for many years.  His evidence was to the effect that the applicant was the aggressor at all times, had attacked the deceased from behind, had said during the course of the fight ""I will kill you"" and after the deceased fell back against the pedestrian railing, had stomped on his head on about six occasions.
The competing cases at trial
12It was the Crown case that the applicant was guilty of murder since the aneurysm ruptured when the applicant punched the deceased in the head with the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him and the punching was not done in self defence or as a consequence of any substantial impairment from which the applicant suffered.  Alternatively, it was the Crown case that the applicant was guilty of manslaughter by reason that the punch to the head of the deceased was an unlawful and dangerous act, was not done in self defence or as a consequence of any substantial impairment which the applicant suffered.
13It was the defence case that the applicant was not guilty of murder since when he punched the deceased to the head and the aneurysm ruptured, he did not intend to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.  Alternatively, the applicant was not guilty of murder because the rupture of the aneurysm occurred when the applicant was acting in self-defence and his actions were not excessive.  Alternatively, the applicant was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter because although he was acting in self defence, his actions were excessive.  Alternatively, the applicant was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter because at the time of his actions, the applicant's capacity to understand the events and provide an appropriate response thereto were substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind from an underlying condition, namely post traumatic stress disorder and the impairment was so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
14All of those issues were not argued in the appeal.  Their existence, however, is relevant to the ultimate disposition of the appeal.  As indicated, the appeal focused on the evidence as to intention and as to whether the evidence was capable of establishing that the applicant had an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.  The issue was whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to either kill or inflict really serious injury on the deceased.  It was the applicant's submission that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt and so should this Court.
The evidence as to intention
15At trial, three pieces of evidence were relied upon as evidence that the applicant had the requisite intention:
(i) That the applicant punched the deceased from behind.
(ii) That the applicant said ""I will kill you"" during the course of his attack on the deceased.
(iii) That the applicant stomped on the head of the deceased approximately six times from a height of approximately two feet.
This evidence came from Mr Whiting.  
16In the appeal, the Crown relied upon the same evidence but submitted that even if the evidence of Mr Whiting that there were six stomps to the head of the deceased ought to be substantially discounted, it was still open to the jury to find the applicant guilty of murder because other evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that he had the requisite intent:
(a) The evidence of other witnesses concerning stomps/kicks.
(b) The concession by the applicant that he had stomped once on the upper chest/arm of the deceased to prevent him getting back to his feet.
(c) The evidence that prior to the first fight, the applicant had told Mr Bell that he did not like the deceased.
(d) The evidence that the applicant initiated the first fight with the deceased.
(e) The evidence that the applicant got back to his feet and pursued the deceased.
(f) The evidence that adjacent to the T2 building, the applicant initiated the second fight by punching the deceased from behind.
(g) The evidence that in the course of the altercation adjacent to the T2 building, the applicant, who maintained a fighting position as the deceased backed away from him, put his hands down by his side and turned away from the applicant and towards Oxford Street.
(h) The evidence that Messrs Doughty and Fanning had to restrain and remove the applicant as the deceased lay upon the ground.
Mr Anthony Whiting
17He had been friends with the deceased for about 8 years.  On Saturday, 19 February he was walking through Taylor Square when he saw the deceased near the old T2 building.  He then observed the applicant, who was slightly behind the deceased, to punch the deceased several times in the side or back of the head with a closed fist.  The deceased then struck the applicant with his right fist and knocked him to the ground.  The deceased then walked away.  The applicant lay on the ground near T2 for about 10 - 15 seconds.  The applicant got to his feet and threw three or four punches to the side and back of the deceased's head.  The deceased fell to the ground and as he lay there, the applicant stomped on his head.  He raised his foot and stomped down from a height of approximately two feet.  The applicant did not stomp on any other part of the deceased, just the head.  He estimated that the applicant stomped on the deceased's head six times.
18Mr Whiting said that when the applicant got to his feet, he said ""I'll kill you"".  He appeared to be in a rage about being knocked down and ran at the deceased from behind.  After the deceased fell down, he was just lying on the ground unconscious and the applicant ""just stomped and stomped and stomped"".  When somebody in the crowd said ""Run the police are coming"", the applicant ran off with an associate.  Mr Whiting said that the applicant was stomping using one leg and that he was wearing shoes, but he could not tell the type, brand or make.  Mr Whiting said that he also heard the applicant say ""I'm going to kill you"" right at the beginning as the initial punches were thrown.  The deceased did not say anything in response.  The deceased was lying unconscious on his side facing T2 and the applicant was stomping on the left side of his head.  Before witnessing these events, Mr Whiting had not been drinking or using any substances that might have affected his observation.
19In cross-examination Mr Whiting said that it was the applicant who threw the first punch and he disagreed that the applicant and the deceased were facing each other at the time.  Mr Whiting agreed that this evidence was different to the evidence which he gave at the committal proceedings on 13 June 2012 when he agreed that the two men were facing each other when the first punch was thrown.  Mr Whiting said he must have been mistaken when he gave that evidence.  Mr Whiting agreed that he gave the following evidence at the committal:
(a) The two men were side by side, or the applicant may have been half a foot ahead of the deceased.
(b) Something verbal was said between the two men before punches were thrown but Mr Whiting was too far away to hear what it was.
(c) The applicant only said ""I'll kill you"" once after he was knocked to the ground.
20Mr Whiting said that at the time of the committal he was under emotional stress due to the nature of the crime and that this had unnerved him.  He now felt that he had not given enough details at the committal.  The applicant in fact had said ""I'll kill you"" once during the initial blows and again when he got back up and was punching the deceased the second time.  Mr Whiting agreed that in his police statement of 27 February 2011 he only indicated that the applicant said ""I'll kill you"" before the applicant was knocked to the ground.  Mr Whiting agreed that he was now saying that what he said in his police statement and at the committal was wrong and that the applicant said ""I'll kill you"" twice.
21Mr Whiting disagreed with what he said in his police statement and now denied that the applicant was in front of the deceased when the applicant threw the second lot of punches.  Mr Whiting said ""I may have said that he was in front but he was never in front it was from behind, it came from behind the second attack"" (T.75).  Mr Whiting said that the evidence he was giving at the trial was more accurate and that when he made his police statement he was still in shock and emotionally distraught.  He said that when the applicant was stomping on the deceased, he was using all his force (T.78).
22Mr Whiting denied that he was embellishing and exaggerating his account of the incident because the deceased was a friend.  He denied that the deceased threw any punches after the applicant punched him the second time.  He denied that they were exchanging punches.  He denied that the applicant only delivered one stomp and that this was to the deceased's upper body.  He disagreed that he had exaggerated the number of stomps administered by the applicant to the deceased.  
Mr Ian Eyers
23At 6.35pm Mr Eyers and his wife had parked their car and were walking towards Taylor Square when he saw a tall, bald man in his early thirties walk around the corner towards them with a girl.  He did not take a great deal of notice because he was talking to his wife at the time.  The first couple were followed by two men.  He thought the first two were a couple because he was pretty sure they were arm in arm.  In relation to one of the two men behind:
""Q. Did you see either one or the other men doing anything with respect to him?A. I think I did, but that is a bit hazy, I am not one hundred percent sure. 
Q. Tell us what you remember?A. I think I saw him swing with his right hand, come across the face of the other guy from behind but, like I said that is a bit hazy I am not one hundred percent because I was actually looking at the police car on the right. 
Q. When you say the other guy do you mean the bald man or one of the two men?A. One of the two men because the bald guy was in front. ... (T.84)
24Mr Eyers' evidence continued:
""Q. And you told us a moment ago that you seemed to recall one of the two men swung a punch, towards him from behind?
A. Yes. Q. What effect did that have on the bald man, what happened next, in other words?A. He just went down straight away.
Q. What did he fall near, or against?A. Right, just before a tree, right next to the railing and I'm pretty sure there was some sort of metal grate under him.Q. Once he was on the ground what happened next?
A. I looked towards the police car and - because I was thinking of getting my wife away in case they come towards us, when I looked back one of the guys was in the position of jumping.
Q. Tell us about this jumping, what was the man doing and what was he jumping on, in other words?A. He was jumping on the guy on the ground and when I say in the position, I think that he had a hold of the railing because the position he was in would be to jump in, just stood up and jump.
Q. What part of the man on the ground was this person jumping on?A. The upper part of his body.
Q. How many times, did you see him jump?A. Once."" (T.85)
25In cross-examination Mr Eyers agreed that he did not actually see the person jump.  He saw him ""coming down"" (T.87).  He agreed that what he saw occurred very quickly.  Mr Eyers made his statement to the police on 17 March 2011 and he agreed that his memory would have been better then than it was at trial.  It was put to Mr Eyers that he had  made no mention of a punch from behind in his statement.  In that regard, the following evidence was given:
""Q. Is that because you couldn't remember at that time?A. I honestly didn't think about it at that time I just - since then I have mulled over it in my mind a thousand times and every time you do it changes, so you know I was just trying to remember as best I can and from the statement I did.
Q. I understand. Obviously it is very important what you say now. Do you accept that because you thought things through in your mind you might be mistaken about that aspect of seeing the arm?A. It is possible.""  (T.90)
Mr Jayson Bell
26Mr Bell had known the deceased for 17 years and they were good friends.  He had known the applicant as an acquaintance for 6 to 8 months.  Mr Bell met the applicant at the Courthouse Hotel at about 10am or 10.30am.  He also saw the deceased at the hotel later that day at about 2pm.  Mr Bell was drinking schooners of full strength beer and had drunk about 5 or 6 schooners that day.  At about 3pm or 4pm when he stopped drinking, he rated his sobriety at about 5 out of 10.  He said that the applicant was also drinking schooners of full strength beer.  He rated the applicant's level of intoxication at about 6 or 7 out of 10 when he left the hotel.
27At about 6.30pm Mr Bell walked from the front of the hotel with the applicant, with the intention of going home.  Because he and the deceased lived in the same block of flats in Surry Hills, Mr Bell told the deceased that he was going home and for him to come with him.  The following evidence was then given:
""Q. What happened next? A. Scott went up and was walking. I was walking with Adam. Scott turned the corner near with Kinsela's as Adam and I were walking. I told him, Adam said he was going, said Scott and I were going home to have a feed. All I remember is Scott coming over saying to Adam, ""What is your problem? What have I done? I have done nothing to you."" And Adam saying to me, ""I don't like him"".  And I was pushing Adam just saying, ""Look, just go away, don't worry about it."" Next thing I know they're fighting.
Q. Tell us what you saw happen when you say they were fighting?A. Just basically punches were thrown to each other.
Q. Where did this happen?A. Started just beside Kinselas, just near the tree. There was punches thrown there, and then I think it went for a minute or two and then the fight stopped.""  (T.99)
28Mr Bell thought it was the applicant who threw the first punch and that when he did so the deceased retaliated straight away.  He did not see either man knocked to the ground.  He was not taking much notice at that stage.  All he remembered was that the fight restarted.  They looked at each other and came back and just started again.  He saw the police over by the chemist and shouted for them to come over.  When he turned back, the fight was continuing but people were in front of him and he did not see what else was happening.  He could not say who threw the first punch when the fight started again.  When the fight restarted, the two men were facing each other.  Mr Bell heard yelling from one of the girls.  She was screaming ""Call the police, call the police"" (T.101-102).  Under cross-examination Mr Bell confirmed that evidence and said that before the two men became involved in the fight, they were both standing opposite each other with their hands raised and that there was some shouting between them.  During the course of the fight, the two men were moving.  They moved towards Flinders Street and ended up around T2.  Mr Bell agreed that the fight seemed to stop for a while but by then he was a little distance away and was not in the best position to see what was going on as other people were blocking his view.  He was not able to say much more about what happened.
Ms Carly Austin
29Ms Austin had known the deceased for a couple of years as an acquaintance.  On Saturday 19 February 2011 she had the day off but had been drinking since lunchtime and by the end of the day she was intoxicated.  At about 6.30pm she was standing near the open door at Kinselas with a group of friends when she saw the applicant and the deceased walking away from the Courthouse Hotel and then a couple of minutes later, an altercation began.  There was yelling and it escalated into a bit of a fist fight.  She could not hear what they were saying to each other, she remembered seeing them fighting and moving around and saw the deceased fall near the fence by Flinders Street (T.141-142).
30She said that after Scott Miller fell, the applicant kicked him.  She could not remember whether this was as the deceased was falling or was on the floor.  She said that she observed the deceased to be holding his hands up, palms forward, as though indicating he did not want to fight.
31In cross-examination she agreed that she had been drinking all that day.  She said that she did not see the applicant knocked to the ground at any stage.  She thought she saw the deceased fall and hit the railing.  She agreed that she thought she saw a kick by the applicant, but it was difficult for her to say with certainty with what part of the deceased's body contact was made.  She accepted that the kick may well have been to the upper torso area or the upper arm.  She said:
""Q. So seeing what you later indicated on that page, or what you used to refresh your memory, you had seen Scott swing a punch, is that right? Just for the record can you say yes?A. Yes.
Q. Do you accept that from the distance that you were, and your intoxication, it's hard for you to say with certainty that he was putting up his hands, do you accept that?A. He may have.
Q. So you are saying he may have put up his hands, like stop, but you might be mistaken about that, is that right?A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. A. I'm saying, not really a lot of memory and everything, and on the day, as I said, it all happened so quickly.
Q. That is quite important that aspect, you do accept that maybe you are mistaken about that, is that right? A. I thought, I could see them fighting and everything like that, and yeah, I am pretty sure.
Q. Things are happening fairly quickly?A. Yes. 
Q. And you were quite intoxicated?A. Yes.
Q. And you were a long way away? A. (No verbal reply)
Q. And you accept in those circumstances that you can't be sure about that, is that right?A. Yes."" T.154)
Mr Daniel Doughty
32Mr Doughty had known the deceased as an acquaintance for 5 years.  He also knew the applicant as an acquaintance for about 6 or 8 months.  He said that by 6.30pm that day he had drunk about 10 schooners of VB beer and considered himself intoxicated.  He remembered that a fight broke out, but he could not remember anything else.  He was then cross-examined by the Crown pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act 1995 and taken to various parts of his interview with the police.  The following questions and answers were given in that interview, which took place on 19 February 2011.
""Q64 Fight's started here or here?A.   No, it's the fight started here.
Q65 Yeah.A.   Out the front of Kinselas.
Q66 Yeah.A.   Like verbal.
Q67 Verbal yeah?A.   Yeah.  Do you know what I mean, then verbal, verbals.  They've gone around the corner, they've both shaped up and then started fighting each other.
Q68 Do you know who initiated the fight?A.  Adam yeah.
Q69 Adam, do you know how he initiated it?A. By chasing Scott down.
Q78 Yeah.A. Yeah.
Q71 And did he, how did he physically hurt him like did he punch him what happened?A. Well they were having a fight and Adam's hit him with a right hand, Scott's fell down, and when Scott's fell down, Adams' jumped on his head three times.
Q72 Okay, before earlier on you said when Adam hit Scott he fell on the railing?A. Yes.
Q73 Yes, where's this railing?A. Railing is on Flinders Street next to T2.
Q 74 So from what you could tell, it was the punch that made him fall and hit on the railing?A.  Yes and no, yeah. I think it was when he jumped on his head was the main, yeah, the main cause of it.
Q 75  No, no, no, as in I am just trying to get how Scott hit his, hit his, hit himself on the railing?A.  When Adam's hit him he's sort of in a daze, he sort of fell back on to the railing. I am not exactly sure if he's hit his head or whatever.
Q 76 Yeah,A.  But yes and no, do you know what I mean?
Q 77  Yeah.A.  And then Adam's jumped on his head when he's on the ground, so--
Q 78  When he was jumping on Scotts head, where were you?A.  I pulled Adam off him.
Q 79 So you were pretty much--A I grabbed him.
Q 80 Right there?A.  Yeah, I grabbed him yeah and said, what the fuck are you doing, do you know what I mean?
Q 81 Okay, how many?A. Like, the bloke's out cold.
Q 82  How many, how many times did Adam jump on Scott?A.  Three times.
Q 83 And whereabouts?A.  What do you mean 'whereabouts'?
Q 84  Whereabouts on Scott's body?A.  On his head.
Q 85  And what feet did he use? A.  Fuck, you're getting into some details now.
Q 86 Would it be his--A.  Right foot, I suppose, yeah.
Q 87 What was Adam wearing at the time shoes-wise?A.  Thongs. 
Q 88 And when he was jumping on him, what was Scott, what was he saying anything, did he?A.  Out cold.
Q 89  Yes, so at what point did you--A.  He was limp, he was out cold, yeah. 
Q 90 Yeah, so at what point do you think you saw Scott unconscious?A.  When Adam was jumping on his head.
Q 91 Okay, so after the three jumps, you've stopped Adam?A.  Yeah. He's kicked him and he's jumped on him, kicked him, then jumped on his head twice, and I, then I've pulled Adam back up and grabbed him, pushed him away, and that's when a police officer, a police officer had come because there was an incident at the chemist or something. There was a hold up there or something.""  (T.165 - 167)
33When those questions and answers were put to him, Mr Doughty agreed that they had been read out correctly and that they were the answers which he had given to the police on 19 February 2011.  He agreed that he had seen some of the fight happening and that what he had told the police was the truth.
34In cross-examination the following evidence was given:
""Q. Were all those things that were read to you, were they things you actually saw yourself, or were you telling the police things that you had been told by other people?A. I've been told. I was the last person to make a statement.
Q. Okay. So do you know whether the people who told you had actually observed the fight themselves?A. Yes and no.
Q. You spoke to more than one person, is that right?A. Yes.
Q. And did you believe it to be the truth that Adam Matthews had jumped or stomped on the male's head?A. No, that's what I heard.
Q. That's what you heard?A. Yeah."" (T.168)
35Mr Doughty agreed that he had been drinking that day and at the committal he had given evidence that he may have consumed as many as 20 beers.  He said that when he was being interviewed by the police, he was still feeling the effects of the alcohol and some illegal substances which he had taken that day.  He agreed that at the committal hearing on 13 June 2012 he had answered that he could remember the applicant kicking the deceased but he could not recall the applicant jumping on him.  The following evidence was given on that issue:
""Q. And you were asked whether you saw whether he jumped on him, and you couldn't recollect that either?A. Mm.
Q. You were asked then whether you thought that you may have said those things because you were affected by alcohol or another substance, and you agreed with that?A. Mm.
Q. You agree you said that at the committal?A. Yes.
Q. And they weren't things that you actually saw?A. No. 
Q. And I asked you whether you were being truthful at that time when you said that?A. Mm.
Q. And you said you were, you said yes, you agree with that?A. Yes.
HER HONOUR: Can I just ask one question here because it troubles me.Q. You say you were telling the police what other people told you?A. What I heard.
Q. But you told the police that you yourself pulled Mr Matthews back?A. Yeah, grabbed him, that was at the end of it.
Q. Now, did that happen or didn't it?A. Yeah that happened.
Q. You weren't told that then?A. No.""  (T.170)
Mr Doughty said it was all so quick and fast.  He just grabbed and pushed the applicant out of the way and ""that was it"".
Dominic O'Keefe
36Mr O'Keefe gave evidence that he was having a drink outside Kinselas at about 6pm.  He saw the deceased having a confrontation with another person whom he did not know.  He said to the deceased ""just walk away"".  Mr O'Keefe did not move from where he was sitting and the fight moved around the corner.  
37Under cross-examination he said that he was on medication which affected his memory.  He could not remember what he had said in his statement and he could not remember other details of what had occurred.  It was put to Mr O'Keefe that in his statement of 22 March 2011 he had said that the following events occurred:
(a) He told Scott to ""just walk away"".  Scott looked over but did not respond.
(b) Scott and the other guy shaped up to each other and began to fight.
(c) The fight moved towards Flinders Street.
(d) At some stage both of them fell or slipped to the ground.
Brendan Fanning
38This witness was unavailable to give evidence.  The police interview with Mr Fanning on the evening of 19 February 2011 was played and a transcript was provided to the jury (exhibit G - DVD and transcript).  Mr Fanning was at the Courthouse Hotel that afternoon.  He left about half an hour before the incident and went to Kinselas Hotel with a friend Dan and Dan's girlfriend, Carly.  He heard Carly screaming for somebody to call an ambulance and walked over from Kinselas towards the railing and saw the end of a fight between the deceased and the applicant.  He did not actually see any hits, he just noticed the applicant in front of the deceased and then the deceased go down.
""I've um seen ah Scott sort of get hit and I think the hit might have knocked him out 'cos he fell backwards and hit his head on the like, on the railing of on Flinders Street at the corner of Taylor Square there.  Um and I also seen the other bloke Adam I think his name is, kick or kick him in the head or do something to that nature."" (Q and A 22)
Mr Fanning was standing very close when he saw this.
39Mr Fanning did not see the deceased get hit.  What he saw were his legs give way, like he was dizzy.  His legs buckled and he crumpled down towards the ground and hit his head on the railing and then hit his head again pretty hard on the concrete (Q and A 47 - 48, 52 - 59).  After he fell to the ground, Carly was beside him and the applicant was over the top of him and ""I'm sure he kicked him but I'm not a 100 percent sure, but I'm pretty, you know, he was standing right over the top of him."" (Q and A 62).  When the applicant was standing over the deceased, Mr Fanning heard people say ""Don't kick him"", ""Don't stomp on him"" (Q and A 63).  As far as he knew there was one kick and that was what he remembered (Q and A 64 - 65).
40Mr Fanning ran over and tried to intervene.  He placed his foot over his head ""and I got in between like pretty much in between them.  But I sort of tried to protect his head a bit, just in case he was kicking his head because I wasn't quite sure if he did kick his head or not but I remember pulling him away.  I also remember a couple of other people doing the same thing.  Like there was a couple of other people on the other side of me, on the right hand side of me as well, and 'cos I remember pushing him away and then somebody else stopping him and saying ""Go the coppers have been called"" (Q and A 483 - 484).
""Q489 Like could you demonstrate how that ...?A.  I didn't see like a, like a kick, like that or like a stomp I just, it was a sort of like, I just seen like the back of his leg like lift up, do you know what I mean, like I didn't see like a full boot, it was more probably more a, more of a stomp sort of thing.""
Mr Fanning saw his back leg lift up but he did not see his leg connect with the deceased's head (Q490-493).
Mr Wayne Farmer
41Mr Farmer was not able to give evidence.  His statement of 22 February 2011 was read to the jury.  Mr Farmer was having a beer at Kinselas Hotel when Daniel and Carly walked in and said hello.  Mr Farmer had met the deceased for the first time the previous evening.  He saw the deceased walk out of the Courthouse Hotel with the applicant and Jayson.  His evidence was:
""I saw the three of them walking in the middle of Taylor Square towards Kinselas.  I looked away after they left the Courthouse Hotel.  About two minutes later I looked towards Campbell Street and saw Adam standing next to Scott.  I saw Adam swing a punch towards Scott.  I saw Jayson put his arm around Adam.  It appeared that Scott and Adam spoke words to each other.  I couldn't hear what was said.  I looked away again for a few minutes.  I looked back towards the direction of Campbell Street and saw Daniel run from Kinselas towards Flinders Street.  I saw a group of about three people follow him.  I couldn't see what was happening but because there were people running, I thought something was happening so I stood up to walk over and have a look.""  (T.294)
""I walked to the left side of the grassed area near Oxford Street. I walked around the grassed area and walked along the footpath that runs parallel with Flinders Street. I walked towards the group of people.  When I got to the end of the grassed area about 20 metres away from the group of people, I saw Adam and Scott shaping up to each other as if they were about to fight because they both had their fists closed and raised in front of their shoulders and face area.   Adam was facing towards Oxford Street.  Scott was facing parallel with Flinders Street. They stood about 2 to 3 metres away from each other. I could see over the top of Scott's right shoulder.
I saw Adam and Scott step towards each other at the same time. I  saw Scott throw a punch with his right closed fist. I saw his fist connect with Adam's face. Adam fell straight to the ground. He fell backwards to his left. Scott was standing about 4 metres away from Adam at this point. Adam stood up and raised both of his hands again with closed fists. Again, as if he was about to fight Scott.   Adam lunged towards Scott.   I saw Scott moving backwards away from Adam.  I saw Adam look like he threw a punch at Scott with his left fist.  I saw his left arm in a swinging motion, consistent with a punch.  As he did this, a person moved in front of me. I couldn't see if he actually punched Scott.
Straight after I saw this swinging motion, I saw Scott fall backwards.  He fell to the ground landing on his left-hand side.  His face was looking towards the old Taylor Square Hotel and his feet were pointing towards Oxford Street.  Scott was lying on his back against the railing that divides the footpath and Flinders Street.   I saw Adam standing very close to Scott as Scott was lying on the ground.  Adam lifted one of his legs and bend at his knee. He forced it to the ground in a stomping motion. He did this about three times.  I could not see if he was connecting with Scott when he did this. I saw Daniel and another man that I do not know try to stop Adam by holding his arms down, and trying to push him backwards. Adam was facing Flinders Street when this was occurring.
Daniel was on Adam's right side trying to hold him back. I could hear Carly yelling, ""Someone grab the police, someone grab the police"".  I saw Adam start to run parallel with Flinders Street towards Albion Street. When Adam appeared to punch Scott and make a stomping motion, I was about 10 metres away and there were some people in front of me, so I didn't get a very good view."" (T.295)
Mr Farmer took his shirt off to put under the deceased's head and stood with the deceased until the police arrived.
42Mr Farmer gave evidence at the committal hearing on 13 June 2012.  The transcript was read out by the Crown (exhibit J: committal transcript and map marked by Mr Farmer).
43In cross-examination at the committal Mr Farmer said that he had about 3 to 6 full strength beers and had not taken any other substances that day.  He saw something happening over by the T2 building by Flinders Street and went over to see what it was.  As he went towards Flinders Street, he saw the deceased hit the applicant and the applicant went to the ground.  The applicant got back up off the ground and he and the deceased shaped up to each other.  When they confronted each other, a few more punches were thrown.  He was pretty sure it was both of them that went to go at it again, not just one of them (T.305-306).  Mr Farmer saw the deceased's head go backwards but there were a couple of people in the way.  From where he was standing, he could not say what the cause of him going back was.  The deceased ended up on the ground, on his side, next to the barricade.  
44Mr Farmer did not see the applicant doing anything to the deceased when he was on the ground.  The applicant was not there when the deceased was on the ground.  There was a woman kneeling down by the deceased, screaming out for help, and Mr Farmer went over and took off his shirt and put it under the deceased's head.  Mr Farmer went back to the hotel.  There was talk at the hotel about what had happened.  People were telling him about what they had seen or what they had thought happened.
45In the committal, during cross-examination, Mr Farmer gave the following evidence:
""Q.  Did you see Adam lifting his leg up and bringing it down in a stomping motion near to where Scott was or - is that something you saw or were able to see anything like that?A.  No, I all I seen I just seen Adam and Scott closer to the barricade and Scott - Adam probably had more power over Scott at that stage but that was it.  Like after - just after Adam come off the ground Scott was more or less over near the barricade, then after Adam's gotten up - they've come at each other pretty much together.
Q.  And after Scott's gone down have you seen Adam, to use a common expression, put the boot in on Scott when he's on the ground.  Is that something that you saw or did you not see?A.  I didn't, I didn't see any, any anyone do that sort of stuff like put the boot in at that stage.  But I have seen Adam trying to get at Scott and I wouldn't say he was putting the boot in because they were just both up together face to face, you know, because Scott went down just before they'd, before Scott went down."" (T.310-311 of committal)
46In re-examination at the committal, the following evidence was given by Mr Farmer: ""Q. Sir, can you please have a look at your statement that you've got folded up on the witness box? Can you have a look at paragraph 17?A. Yeah....
Q. The next sentence reads, 'Adam lifted one of his leg and bend at his knee'?A. Okay.
Q. Do you now recall whether that happened?A. Okay, yeah. From where I'm standing --
Q. Did you see that?A. All I seen was when they, like I was saying, when they were sort of together just before Scott went down so, I don't know how clear I am in saying anyway, sorry, that he bent his knee.
Q. Do you recall that, did you see that?A. When he's going for him when they were arguing, it just seemed like he was going at him, yeah, he could've been trying to get towards - because there was - there was just not Adam and Scott there, there was another bloke and someone else breaking it up.""  (T.312 - committal)
...
""Q. As you recall it, was Adam facing Scott and was Scott facing Adam?A. Yeah, yeah.
Q. The third sentence in that paragraph, 'he forced it to the ground in a stomping motion', do you see those words?A. (No verbal reply).
Q. Do you agree that the 'he' refers to Adam?A. You know, when I said this, I had a detective with me at the time putting it like in the motion how he was - I was saying and he was saying as it was happening and he was sort of describing the movements and I was showing him and I was saying how Adam was trying to move forward.
Q. It says 'he forced him to the ground in a stomping motion'?A. Okay
Q. I suggest that the 'he' is 'Adam' and 'forced it to the ground' is the leg that's referred to? A. Mmm, mmm."" (T.313 - committal)
""Q. But in the statement it indicates dealing perhaps with a different issue, lifted one leg and bent of his knee, do you recall seeing that? A. He lift the leg, yeah.
Q. Are you saying you do recall seeing that?A. Yeah yeah, I had seen him."" (T.314 - committal)
...
Q. He forced the leg to the ground in a stomping motion, do you recall seeing that?A. No, not in that - in - the way it's being said, no.  I seen him sort of progressing forward at him."" (T.314 - committal)
...
""Q. From your memory, the best you can do as at today, are you saw someone on the ground, is that right?A. Yep.
Q. Are you saying you don't know who it was on the ground?A. It was Scott.
Q. The stomping motion, did you see Adam make a stomping motion? A. Whether it was stomping or moving forward, I can't say.
Q. Did you see that motion, whatever that moving forward or stomping was, did you see that about three times?A. Yeah, I - yeah, yes, at least two, two times."" (T.315 - committal)
47There were some witnesses on a bus which was passing next to where the fight took place.  They gave evidence at the trial.  The presence of the bus was confirmed by the CCTV footage.  
Rebecca Cobb-Clark
48Ms Cobb-Clark made a statement to the police on 2 March 2011.  She was travelling with a number of university friends to a birthday party in Circular Quay.  She sat in the back seat of the bus on the side closest to the gutter on Flinders Street.  The bus stopped at the traffic lights on Flinders Street and she looked out the back window of the bus and saw guys start going at each other.  She saw one guy throw a punch at the other guy and they started fighting and then three other men came over and started trying to break up the fight (T.181-182).  She saw the shorter guy throw a punch at the taller guy and then they both started punching each other.  The taller man punched the other man in response, but she could not say for sure if it connected.
49In cross-examination she said that the shorter man threw the first punch and the other man ducked, so at first she thought they were mucking around.  She said that after the three men ran over and tried to break up the fight, the two men started fighting again.  She said that both the men were throwing punches at each other and that they were both aiming at each other's heads.  The fight started off in front of the building and then went down the side of the building near the bus.
Claire-Elise Green
50Ms Green was sitting on the back seat of the bus near the kerb side and Mr Cobb-Clark was to her right.  She saw two men sort of standing around with their arms up.  One man was significantly more muscular than the other man, who looked lean and scrawny in comparison.  She was not sure if they were fighting for real for just play fighting.  When she first saw the men, they were standing facing each other on the pavement out in front of the main doors.  She thought she saw the smaller man land a blow on the larger man's face, which caused the larger man's sunglasses to fall off.  At some point, another man came in between them and was holding his palms facing outwards to try and separate them.  She could not hear what the man was saying to them.  The man moved away from the centre and the fight continued.  The men continued circling around each and then the bus moved.
51In cross-examination Ms Green agreed that in her statement she had referred to the two men as ""man 1"" and ""man 2"".  She agreed that she described ""man 1"" as follows:
""One of the men was wearing a grey hat, kind of like a gold hat or beret.  The man was wearing sunglasses on his eyes, I think he had a triangle goatee.  He was in his thirties, white skin, I think he was wearing a white shirt with a V-neck.  I can't remember what he was wearing on his legs.  I think he or the other guy was wearing thongs.  The man was pretty muscly, his arms were bulging, he looked pretty strong.  I will call this man ""man 1""."" (T.190)
52Ms Green said that ""man 1"" was the man she had earlier described as more muscular.  The other man was not as muscular as the man with the beret.  She called the man that was not as muscular ""man 2"".  She was watching the man with the beret more closely because he was the one who was facing her.  Ms Green could not say he threw the first blow because she did not see the first blow.  She remembered ""man 2"" punching the man with the beret and the sunglasses in the face.  Ms Green agreed that when the bus drove away, they were still dancing around facing each other.
James McAtamney
53Mr McAtamney was sitting on the second backseat of the bus on the kerb side.  He saw two men walking from Oxford Street into Taylor Square towards the railing near them.  One of the men was more solid than the other.  They stopped between the building and the grassed area and went into a fighting stance and exchanged some punches.  He saw one punch thrown by the more solid man connect with the other man's head.  Some other men came and appeared to be trying to break up the fight.  He saw the more solid man take his shoes off and throw them onto the ground.  The lights went green and the bus drove off (T.194 - 195).
54In cross-examination Mr McAtamney said that when he first saw the men they were walking along looking at each other.  They seemed to be arguing and Mr McAtamney thought something was about to happen.  They stopped near the railing on Flinders Street and he saw them facing each other with their fists up in a fighting stance.  The bus was stopped at the lights around a minute.  During some of that time, a series of punches was exchanged.  As the bus drove off, both men were still in a fighting stance facing each other.  Mr McAtamney saw a number of punches which appeared to connect.  There was one at the very start from the larger man to the other person's head which he definitely saw connect.  That occurred during the initial exchange of punches (T.196 - 197).
Ms Vera Newman
55Ms Newman was sitting in the back of the bus with her friends when she saw two men standing outside the T2 building.  ""Man 1"" was wearing a brown coloured hat or beret and ""man 2"" was wearing a black shirt.  ""Man 2"" was walking away and had his back to ""man 1"".  ""Man 2"" was a bit taller than ""man 1"".  She could remember that punches were being thrown, one man got hit in the facial region and ""man 1"" lost his beret.  After that a few men intervened and pulled them apart.  One of the men started walking south on Oxford Street and she did not see any more.  In cross-examination, she agreed that the first thing she observed was that both men were walking in the same direction, but a few metres apart.  The taller man or ""man 2"" turned around.  The two men yelled at each other and then the fight happened (T.280 - 281).
Medical evidence
56Dr Stephen Wills, forensic pathologist, performed the autopsy on the deceased.  It was the opinion of Dr Wills that the direct cause of death was an acute subarachnoid haemorrhage with the antecedent cause being a ruptured vertebral artery aneurysm.  From the statements and the information with which he was provided, Dr Wills was of the opinion that this was one of a small number of cases where the rupture was known to be ""virtually coincidental"" with an episode of trauma, which appeared to have been a punch.  A blow to the face would have been sufficient to cause the aneurysm to rupture.  What Dr Wills was unable to determine was to what extent the rupture was due to blunt trauma and to what extent the rupture was due to changes in blood pressure which occurred during the fight (T.259 - 260).
57Dr Wills said the injuries to the deceased, consistent with blunt trauma, included:
(1) Faint superficial and more extensive deeper bruising around the right angle of the jaw.
(2) Bruising around the left eye.
(3) Bruising to the left temporal scalp.
(4) Bruising and abrasions to both upper limbs and hands.
Dr Wills was of the opinion that the injuries to the deceased were inconsistent with six full stomps on the deceased's head by a man wearing thongs or bare feet.  He could not say there was no stomping, but he did not think it was in keeping with a sustained assault with forceful kicks and stomps (T.264).
58The detail of that evidence was:
""A. Again, we have got several sites of blunt trauma to the head, again, there is nothing specific that we saw to say well that definitely is a stomp. It's possible that some of the injuries could have been caused by a kick or stomp, but the overall pattern of injuries, generally when we do post-mortems on people who have had stomps, as many as six, I would expect the injuries to be more extensive than we found here. There was bruising, but no underlying fracture or anything, so I don't think they were in keeping with 6 full force stomps. There could have been some, but in terms of that's what I was being asked, I don't think the injuries really point to that.
HER HONOUR:  Q. What about three?A. The fewer there are probably the more likely some of it is caused, obviously you get kicked in the same place, it would only cause one bruise. It is very difficult to put a number on it, in that he's got a number of areas of blunt contact in an assault that's involved both punches, potentially a fall on the railing, potential contact with a fall on the ground, and a number of potential stomps afterwards, it's very hard, it's hard to put a number on it.  I wouldn't exclude there was some of that in it, but in terms of large force kicks or stomps, I don't think the evidence points to that.
CROWN PRSOECUTORQ. Was your job made more difficult by the information that it was possible that the accused man was bare foot at the time?A. Again, you are probably less likely to get associated abrasions or possibly patterns that you sometimes see with footwear. But even so I think a kick from even a bare foot person, particularly a stomp where the force goes through the sole of the foot, are typically quite high force injuries, and so I can't say there wasn't any stomping, but as I say, I didn't think it was in keeping with a sustained assault with forceful kicks and stomps."" (T.264.15 - .46)
59In cross-examination Dr Wills agreed that all the punches to the deceased could have contributed to the haemorrhage.  He thought it was the trauma that immediately preceded the deceased losing consciousness that was the most important in drawing conclusions.  Dr Wills agreed that anything that happened after the deceased collapsed was unlikely to be the cause of the rupture because it almost certainly ruptured before that point.  Dr Wills agreed that he did not see any injuries to the deceased, post mortem, to indicate to him the deceased had been stomped on.  The specific evidence on this issue was:
""Q. Certainly the gentleman didn't have any fractures to his skull or any of his facial area?A. No.
Q. None of his teeth or anything was damaged?A. No.
Q. You didn't see any on the right side of his head, you didn't see any injuries consistent with stomping on the right side of his head, did you, there were no real injuries to the right side of his head, were there?A. No.
Q. If someone was raising their leg two feet and stomping down, and they are on concrete, you would expect to see fairly serious injuries, if they were full force, wouldn't you?
HER HONOUR: You mean to somebody's head?
STEEL:  Q. Yes, on somebody's head?A. It's very difficult to connect injuries with absolutes, how high the foot was and things like that. As I say, there was nothing I found that would say yes, definitely that was the full force stomp. When somebody is on the ground sometimes you can see a stomping attack where what is bruising or abrasions from where the stomp happened, and there's also injuries to the other side where the head hit the ground, also bruising and lacerations, and I didn't really see anything like that. Bruising is fairly non-specific, and what it means is you have got a site of blunt trauma. As I say, I didn't see anything that post mortem if I had no information before to say, actually I think this chap was being stomped upon.
Q. Just in terms of stomps to the body area, if they are not particularly hard they may not leave any bruising, is that right? A. It's possible. He did have some bruising to his body area, one on the back of his right arm, and one at the back of his shoulders, clearly the shoulder one could potentially have come from a fall to the ground, or if I he's looked away, and the one on the back arm I guess potentially could be from punching himself. ""  (T.271.22 - 272.10)
60At trial there was evidence from two psychiatrists and from Professor Christie as to the effect on the applicant of his alcohol consumption.  Their evidence does not relate to any issue which was raised in the appeal.
61The applicant gave evidence, which was largely consistent with that of Mr Bell, as to what had occurred before he left the Courthouse Hotel.  He said that as he and Jayson Bell walked past Kinselas, the deceased approached and said ""I don't know what your problem is"" or something along those lines and then the deceased walked away.  The applicant did not respond but said to Jayson ""I don't like this bloke, keep him away from me"".  The applicant heard the deceased say something off in the distance but he was not sure what it was.  The applicant said he felt intimidated and wanted to be left alone.  He approached the deceased and said ""Leave me the fuck alone"".  They started arguing and things escalated from there.  The deceased raised his fists as though he was ready to fight.  The applicant raised his fists in response and they just started to fight.  He was not sure who punched first.
62The applicant said that when he raised his fists to defend himself, he was feeling ""anxious, scared"".  The first contact between them occurred outside Kinselas, just on the Flinders Street side of the trees.  The applicant was knocked to the ground and as he got back up, the deceased was standing over him:
""Q. And was he facing you?A. Yes.
Q. How far away from you was he?A. One or two metres.
Q. And where were his hands?A. In front of me like during the fight.
Q. And what did you do?A. I got back up and started fighting as well.
Q. Why did you start fighting again? A. Because I thought he was going to hurt me. I was defending myself.""  (T.337)
63The applicant said that when he regained his feet, the punching started again.  In the second part of the fight, they were moving around and jostling.  The fight moved slightly around to the side of T2.  They were both throwing punches at each other.  He said that he punched the deceased in the face and the deceased fell backwards towards the ground, ending up on the railing in Flinders Street.  The applicant thought the deceased hit his head on the fence as he fell.
""Q. Were you aware of other people around at that time?A. Not really, no.
Q. When he was on the ground did you do anything? A. Yes, I stomped on his upper body.
Q. And why did you do that?A. I just wanted him to stay down. He wanted to get up and continue bashing me."" (T.338)
64The applicant said that he only stomped once and that was to the deceased's body, not his head.  The applicant ran away because he was ""freaked out"".  At no stage did he say ""I will kill you"" to the deceased, nor did he hit from behind.  The applicant denied intending to kill or inflict really serious harm to the deceased and he knew nothing of the aneurysm and thus not of the threat posed by any blow to the deceased's head or jaw.  The applicant did not see the deceased with his hands out as though it should stop.  He said ""No, never.  His fists were always closed"".  (T.340)
65On the following day, he became aware of the seriousness of the events and arranged to surrender to the police.
66In cross-examination, the applicant said that he knew the deceased as Jayson's boyfriend, with whom he had a nodding acquaintance.  He said he was surprised when the deceased approached him and told him that he did not know what his problem was.  The applicant denied that after they left the hotel, the deceased had not approached him at all but stood at some distance away towards the direction of his house.  The applicant was not sure what brought on the argument.  The applicant agreed that the deceased did not walk from 4 or 5 metres away with his fists up.  It was only after they had words that the deceased put his fists up and they started to fight.
67The applicant specifically denied that he had picked a fight and that the deceased had not asked him what his problem was and that he hit the deceased from behind the first time.  The evidence was:
""Q. Part of that is right, he certainly knocked you to the ground?A. He did knock me to the ground.
Q. Somewhere near the trees out the front of Kinselas?A. Yes.
Q. Scott then started to walk off towards Flinders Street to where he lived, isn't that what happened?A. No.
Q. What happened next?A. As I got up he was one or two metres off in the distance and he was still ready to fight.
Q. Oh I see, so he was between three feet and six feet away from you, still willing to fight?A. One to two metres, yes.
Q. He wasn't standing over you, was he?A. He was still standing one or two metres there, like that. I am on the ground looking up and all I see is Scott."" (T.346)
68The applicant denied losing his temper, wanting to teach the deceased a lesson or wanting to take revenge on him.  The applicant agreed that he was knocked to the ground in the first encounter, but not that he had come off second best.  The applicant denied that the deceased was walking away towards the direction of his flat when he approached the deceased from behind and hit him on the side of the head.  The applicant said that there was never any occasion when the deceased had his hands down by his sides (T.350).
69The applicant said that he was not concerned when the deceased hit his head on the iron railing in Flinders Street, he was concerned about his own safety.  He was not sure if the deceased moved after he hit the ground ""No I don't think so"".  He only stomped on him so he would not get back up.  The applicant ""wasn't sure"" how stomping on the left hand side of the deceased's chest was going to stop him getting up.  ""Maybe the pressure, he might not be able to get up from the pressure"".  The applicant denied that it was his intention to inflict further injury to stop the deceased from getting up.  It was just enough force to let him know to stay down.  His intention by stomping on him was that that would be enough to keep him down.
70The applicant agreed that when the deceased was on the ground he was not aware of other people around him.  It was put to the applicant that the evidence from witnesses was that people were standing around him screaming, shouting for the police, trying to remove him and pull him off.  The applicant agreed that he had heard that evidence but did not agree that the reaction of the crowd was because he was stomping more than once.  The applicant disagreed that there were people standing around him screaming or that people were pulling at him trying to remove him from the deceased.  He disagreed that he ran off because he heard people shouting for the police.  He said that he just panicked and ran away.  He did not run away because he knew that he had done something very wrong, ""No.  I just freaked out"".
71In re-examination the applicant agreed that he became aware that the deceased had hit his head on the railing but:
""Q.  Were you ever aware that he was unconscious?A.  No.
Q.  And were you ever aware that he was seriously injured when he was on the ground?A.  No.
Q.  Did you think he still had the capacity to get up, did you?A.  Yes.""  (T.358 - 359)
72Not surprisingly, given the location of the events leading up to the deceased's death, there was CCTV footage available which showed the applicant and the deceased at various times, both before and during their confrontation.  It was collected and collated by one of the investigating police officers so as to show events as they occurred chronologically.  There is nothing in that CCTV footage which supports the evidence of Mr Whiting.  In fact, given the detail and precision of Mr Whiting's evidence, it is somewhat surprising that he is not depicted in any of the CCTV footage.  At one point in time the CCTV footage showed the deceased and the applicant apparently shaping up, facing each other and perhaps exchanging punches.  It showed Jayson Bell walking with the applicant.  It also showed the deceased before the confrontation walking in the vicinity of the two hotels.  Mr and Mrs Eyers are shown, as is Mr Farmer and Ms Austin.  A man identified as ""Lee"" in the evidence of Mr Fanning is also shown.  What seems to be clear from the CCTV footage is that the confrontation did not occur immediately after the applicant and the deceased left the Courthouse Hotel but some minutes later.  Otherwise that CCTV footage does not take the evidence further.
Consideration
73The task of this Court was restated by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]:
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""...
14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""
74Further clarification was provided by the plurality in SKA at [20]:
""20 The reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal exposes a fundamental problem with its approach to its task. The Court concerned itself with whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence.  ... 
21 To determine satisfactorily the applicant's appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged. ... ""
75More recently, Simpson J (with whom Davies and Adamson JJ agreed) said in Griffiths v R [2014] NSWCCA 60 said at [2]:
""2 The task of this Court where such a ground is raised is well established and well known: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v the Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.

3 The Court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question, ultimately, is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, nevertheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: M at 492; or whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

4 In making that assessment, the court is obliged to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses.""
76It is accepted that the evidence of Mr Whiting was sufficient to establish the necessary intent for murder.  I have concluded, however, that his evidence is inherently so unreliable that a jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had the necessary intent to establish that he was guilty of murder.  I am also satisfied that the evidence of the other witnesses taken with that of Mr Whiting was insufficient to establish that intent beyond reasonable doubt.  The necessary intent which the Crown sought to infer from the evidence was not an intent to kill, but rather an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.
77There was no evidence that the applicant ever admitted to having the necessary intent after the event.  In his evidence he denied having any such intention.  Accordingly, the Crown could only establish the applicant's intention by the evidence of what he did and said at the time of the confrontation.  As already indicated, the crucial Crown witness on that issue was Mr Whiting.
78The first part of Mr Whiting's evidence from which the Crown sought to infer intent was that on two occasions the applicant attacked the deceased from behind and punched him to the side of the head.  That evidence was inconsistent with the evidence given by Mr Whiting in the committal proceedings to the effect that the two men were facing each other when the first punch was thrown.  It was inconsistent with his police statement in which he said that the applicant was in front of the deceased when the second set of punches was thrown.  His explanation for these discrepancies was not persuasive.
79The only witness to provide some support for this part of Mr Whiting's evidence was Mr Eyers.  His evidence was consistent with that part of Mr Whiting's evidence to the effect that the applicant struck the deceased from behind on at least one occasion.  There are a number of difficulties with the evidence of Mr Eyers.  In his statement to the police, there is no mention of a punch from behind and under cross-examination he agreed that he might have made an assumption to that effect.  His evidence of a punch from behind is not supported by that of any other witness, in particular those persons watching from the bus.  The evidence is significantly qualified in that his recollection was ""a bit hazy"".  His initial observation that the deceased and Ms Austin were arm in arm when he first saw them is clearly wrong.  His observation of the deceased having received one punch from behind and immediately collapsing is also not supported by the evidence of any witness except Mr Whiting.  A pervading problem in his evidence is the concession that:
""Since then I have mulled over it in my mind a thousand times and every time you do it changes ...""
80The evidence of Mr Bell was that initially the applicant and the deceased faced up to each other, began fighting, stopped for a brief period, faced each other and began fighting again.  Although Mr O'Keefe had little recollection at the time of trial, in his statement of 22 March 2011 he said that initially both men had ""shaped up to each other"" and began to fight.  The evidence of Mr Farmer in his statement and in the committal proceedings was to the effect that the two men shaped up to each other before they commenced fighting for the second time.  Finally, the evidence of the four persons on the bus is to the effect that they observed both men shaping up to each other and is therefore quite inconsistent with this evidence of Mr Whiting.  The CCTV footage does not support this part of his evidence.
81It is also not without significance that in her remarks on sentence (par [15]) the trial judge said in relation to this evidence of Mr Whiting:
""15 ...  However it is the events immediately preceding the inflicting of the fatal blow that are likely to be of greater importance in the sentencing process. In this regard, I do not accept the evidence of Mr Whiting that the offender came up from behind Mr Miller and struck him on the head. It is inconsistent with the majority of the evidence, which had the two men trading punches until at least very shortly before the fatal blow was struck.""
82The second part of Mr Whiting's evidence from which the Crown sought to infer intent was that on two occasions during the altercation, the applicant said to the deceased ""I'll kill you"".  Mr Whiting's evidence at trial was that the applicant said those words at the beginning of the fight and after he had got to his feet, having been knocked to the ground by the deceased.  This evidence was inconsistent with his police statement in which he said that the applicant had used those words only once, before he was knocked to the ground.  It was inconsistent with the evidence which he gave at the committal when he said that the applicant used those words once, after he was knocked to the ground.
83A surprising feature of this evidence is that not one of the other eye-witnesses gave evidence of having heard the applicant use those words.  Moreover, the trial judge in her remarks on sentence (par [17]) said:
""17 The jury's verdict means that the offender must have intended either to kill Mr Miller or to really seriously injure him. I do not consider that he intended to kill him. In this respect, I do not accept Mr Whiting's evidence that the offender said ""I'm going to kill you"" during the course of this confrontation.  No other witnesses gave evidence to similar effect. ...""  
Given that a death resulted from the incident, if such words were used by the applicant, it verges on the incredible that no other witness heard them.
84The third and perhaps most important part of Mr Whiting's evidence from which the Crown sought to infer intent was that after the deceased had fallen to the ground and was apparently unconscious, the applicant raised his foot and stomped down from a height of approximately two feet onto the deceased's head six times - ""He just stomped and stomped and stomped and stomped"" (T.57.8).  It was Mr Whiting's evidence that the applicant was wearing shoes at the time but he was not able to say what type.
85Mr Whiting's assertion that the applicant was wearing shoes has been shown to be incorrect.  Other witnesses said that the applicant was wearing thongs.  Decisively, however, the CCTV footage confirmed that the applicant was wearing thongs when the confrontation took place.
86There was support from some eye-witnesses for the proposition that the applicant's foot or feet came into contact with the deceased's body.  Mr Eyers said that he observed the applicant jump once onto the upper part of the deceased's body, but that it was possible that one of his legs remained on the ground.  Reference has already been made to qualifications associated with the evidence of Mr Eyers.  
87Ms Austin said that the applicant kicked the deceased as he was falling.  She thought in the head, but she was not sure.  She thought that she saw only one kick.  The difficulty with the evidence of Ms Austin is that she was heavily intoxicated at the time. 
88Mr Doughty said that the applicant kicked the deceased and then jumped on his head twice.  It is difficult to evaluate the evidence of Mr Doughty.  He had drunk a considerable amount of alcohol and in the committal proceedings said that when he was being interviewed by the police, he was still feeling the effects of the alcohol and some illegal substances which he had taken on that day.  At trial he said that he could remember that a fight broke out but could not remember anything else.  He was then cross-examined by the Crown, pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act 1995 and taken to various parts of his interview with the police on 19 February 2011.  
89At trial he initially agreed with what he said in his police statement, i.e., that the applicant had kicked the deceased and then jumped on his head twice and that he had pulled the applicant back and pushed him away.  Under cross-examination he said that he had not actually seen these things himself but he had been told about those matters by others.  In response to a question from the trial judge, he said that he did pull the applicant away from the deceased and that this was not something which he had been told about by others.  His evidence was further complicated because at the committal he said that he could remember the applicant kicking the deceased, but could not recall the applicant jumping on him.
90Mr Fanning did not give evidence but the transcript and the DVD of his record of interview was placed before the jury.  He was pretty sure that the applicant had kicked the deceased but he could only remember one kick and it was to the top half of his body.  He was not sure if the kick connected with the deceased's head or not.  Mr Farmer did not give evidence at trial but his statement was placed before the jury.  He did not actually see the applicant stomp on the deceased, but did see him raise his leg about three times.  His evidence at the committal proceedings significantly qualified his statement.  He denied that he saw the applicant ""putting the boot in"" and that what he saw was the applicant moving towards the deceased, rather than stomping on him:
""Q.  He forced the leg to the ground in a stomping motion do you recall seeing that?A.  No, not in that - in - the way it's being said, no.  I seen him sort of progressing forward at him.""  (T.314, committal)
91The applicant gave evidence that he had stomped on the deceased once but that had been to the upper part of his body not his head.  He said he did so to keep the deceased from getting up again.  The applicant did not think that the deceased was unconscious at that time.
92The evidence of Dr Wills was that the injuries to the deceased, as found by him, were not consistent with six full force stomps.  He did not think there was a sustained assault with forceful kicks and stomps.  In cross-examination he said that there was nothing he found which was consistent with a full force stomp.  The effect of his evidence was that there were no injuries suggesting forceful kicks or stomps.
93The preponderance of the evidence was that there was no more than one connection between the applicant's foot and the deceased and in that regard there was an issue as to whether that connection was with the deceased's head, or his upper torso.  It is clear from the CCTV footage that if there were some connection it was either with his bare foot or a rubber thong.  This is also consistent with the medical evidence.  None of that evidence supports the dramatic and emotive evidence of Mr Whiting.
94The Crown submitted that the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing Mr Whiting and the other witnesses and that they were in the best position to determine the weight to be given to that evidence, in particular, the evidence to the effect that the applicant had stomped six times on the head of the deceased or had stomped more than once on his head.
95While it is undoubtedly true that the jury was in a better position than this Court to assess the witnesses, the assessment of the trial judge on this issue is of assistance.  In her remarks on sentence at [13] - [14] her Honour said:
""13 Mr Whiting's evidence potentially provided very powerful support for the Crown case. However there were a number of respects in which his evidence was distinctly less than satisfactory. He had previously given accounts which were inconsistent with this version, sometimes on highly significant matters. He had, for example, said in his police statement, that the final punches were inflicted when the offender was in front of Mr Miller, rather than coming from behind, as was his evidence at the trial.  Moreover, he consistently denied that the two men were trading punches immediately before the fatal blow was inflicted, saying that the only blow struck by Mr. Miller was the punch which sent the offender to the ground.  In this respect, Mr. Miller's account was at odds with the great majority of other eye-witnesses, many of whom knew neither of the protagonists, and can therefore be assumed to have been entirely impartial in their descriptions of the events. These witnesses consistently described the two men as swapping punches not far from the place where the final blow was inflicted. Indeed this is also shown on a CCTV film which was tendered by the Crown. Finally, Mr Whiting's account of the offender stomping on Mr Miller's head six times was clearly inconsistent with the injuries which the post-mortem examination showed that Mr Miller had sustained during the course of this confrontation.

14 Mr Whiting had been a close friend of Mr Miller's, and in the circumstances I can only assume that he was colouring his evidence in order to paint his friend in the most favourable light, and the offender as the sole and unprovoked aggressor.""
96Even accepting that the applicant stomped or kicked the deceased on one occasion on the head, I am not satisfied that this is sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, particularly when such a kick or stomp was made with a bare foot or thong.  I have this doubt notwithstanding that there was other evidence, not dependent upon that of Mr Whiting, which could conceivably support that part of the Crown case, i.e. that the applicant had to be pulled away or restrained.  That latter evidence is equally consistent with those persons being aware that the deceased was unconscious which the applicant was not.
97As appears to have been appreciated by the Crown at trial (as set out in the final address to the jury) the inference of the necessary intent for murder depended mainly upon the jury accepting that the applicant had stomped on the head of the deceased in the way generally described by Mr Whiting.  The detail of that evidence was inconsistent with the medical evidence and almost certainly wrong, i.e. that six full force stomps to the head occurred.  Once the detail of that evidence is rejected, one has to look at the other evidence, the preponderance of which suggested a single kick or stomp which may or may not have been to the head.
98On that state of the evidence, I am not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant had the necessary intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.  In accordance with the guidance provided by the High Court in SKA v The Queen and M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 that is a doubt which the jury should also have had.
99It follows that the applicant's ground of appeal has been made out and that the verdict of the jury that the applicant was guilty of murder is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
100That does not end the matter.  There remains the question of what order should be made by this Court.  While the evidence is not sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant committed the offence of murder, there is sufficient evidence to justify a conviction for manslaughter.  Even then the evidence is not without its difficulties so as to enable this Court to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of manslaughter.  In those circumstances, the appropriate order is that the conviction be quashed and that there should be a further trial on the charge of manslaughter.
101The orders which I propose are as follows:
(i) Leave to appeal is granted.
(ii) The appeal is allowed and the applicant's conviction for the offence of murder is quashed.
(iii) A verdict of acquittal should be entered in favour of the applicant on the charge of murder.
(iv) There should be a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.
102ROTHMAN J:  I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and of Beech-Jones J. The Chief Judge has summarised the evidence, which I too have read, and with which summary I agree. 
103In examining the issues relevant to whether a verdict is unreasonable, the whole of the evidence must be considered; not a piecemeal examination of parts or in parts: R v Rasic [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [29]. While the Crown, on appeal, relies on some other evidence, fundamentally the verdict depends on inferences as to the applicant's state of mind drawn from the applicant's conduct described by Mr Whiting. 
104If the applicant's conduct was not substantially to the effect of that described by Mr Whiting, the inference of requisite intent could not be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. In those circumstances, the conduct from which the inference was to be drawn ought to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
105The difficulty with accepting Mr Whiting's account of the altercation is that it is, at least in part, inconsistent with the medical evidence and is an account which does not accord with the evidence of other eye witnesses. All of these issues are explained in detail in the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and Beech-Jones J. 
106While it is ordinarily for the jury to determine which of a number of witnesses is to be preferred, where, as here, an appellate court experiences a reasonable doubt, ordinarily that will be a doubt that the jury also ought to have experienced: M v Regina [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, 494-5, per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ. The focus of such an examination is not whether there is evidence from which it was open to convict, but whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt, paying due regard to the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence: R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 242 CLR 491 at [33]. 
107I agree with the analyses of the evidence of Hoeben CJ at CL and of Beech-Jones J. It is unnecessary, given my view of the evidence, to comment on whether the ""advantage"" of the jury can be discounted or qualified by a contrary view of the trial judge. 
108Further, it was unnecessary for the jury to ""reject"" the evidence of Mr Whiting. It was necessary for the jury to find the applicant's state of mind beyond reasonable doubt and in the absence of a rejection of the relevant medical evidence and of the other eye-witnesses that inference could not be drawn to the requisite standard. 
109I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL. 
110BEECH-JONES J:  I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL.  I have reviewed the record of the trial the relevant parts of which are comprehensively summarised in Hoeben CJ at CL's judgment.  Subject to the following I agree with his Honour's reasons.
111The start (and perhaps end) point for the Crown case in relation to whether the applicant had the requisite intent to be convicted of murder at the time he killed Mr Miller was the evidence of Mr Whiting.  A review of Mr Whiting's evidence in chief suggests that he sought to convey that he had a clear and precise recollection of events that was damning of the applicant.  His evidence in chief contains nothing to suggest any doubt or uncertainty.  Ordinarily any assessment of whether a witness to a relatively quick street brawl would have such a recall would be a matter that a jury would have a distinct advantage in undertaking.  The passage from the M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494, cited in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 indicates how this Court should treat that advantage in addressing the sole ground of appeal raised in this case (see [73] above).
112However there were a number of difficulties with Mr Whiting's evidence which do not fall to be resolved by considering the advantage enjoyed by a jury in seeing and hearing it be delivered.  First it was inconsistent with the medical evidence.  As noted by Hoeben CJ at CL (at [57]) Dr Wills' evidence was inconsistent with the applicant having stomped on the deceased's head six times.  Further Dr Wills did not find bruising on the back of the Mr Miller's head.  In his evidence in chief Mr Whiting said the applicant struck Mr Miller with a closed fist to the back of the head ""several times"".
113Second, Mr Whiting's evidence was inconsistent with the statement he made to the police on the evening the killing occurred and with his committal evidence (see [19] to [20]).
114Third, on certain crucial matters Mr Whiting's evidence was inconsistent with the bulk of the remaining witnesses.  None of the other witnesses recalled any threat to kill being uttered.  None of the other witnesses observed any similar form of stomping similar to that testified to by Mr Whiting.  It is true, as the Crown submits, that the quick and confronting nature of the confrontation was such as to be likely to produce differing recollections of the various witnesses, especially as they viewed the confrontation from different perspectives and at different times.  That said, a number of the witnesses were  in close proximity to the entire event and it seems highly likely that the making of such a threat and serial stomping to the face would be recalled by others if they had happened.  Otherwise the only evidence supporting Mr Whiting's assertion that the applicant struck the deceased from behind is that of Mr Eyers.  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL's assessment of that aspect of Mr Eyer's evidence (see [79]).
115In my view the combination of these matters is such as to lead to the conclusion that a jury acting reasonably would have had to reject Mr Whiting's evidence to the extent he suggested that the applicant initiated the confrontation by striking Mr Miller from behind, uttered threats to kill or stomped on Mr Miller's face six times.
116I note that Hoeben CJ at CL (at [95]) sets out the trial judge's findings in the sentencing judgment concerning Mr Whiting's evidence.  It is doubtful whether any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge in observing the demeanour of a Crown witness can be employed on an appeal of this kind at least in circumstances where it seems likely that the jury took a different view. For my part I agree with the trial judge's finding because of the objective difficulties with Mr Whiting's evidence which I have already summarised.
117There remains for consideration the balance of the points relied on by the Crown to establish intention which are set out by Hoeben CJ at CL (at [16]).
118The first point is the ""evidence of other witnesses concerning stomp/kicks"". This comprised the somewhat uncertain evidence of Mr Eyers that he saw the applicant ""coming down"" onto the ""upper part"" of Mr Miller's body (at [24] to [25]).  It also included Ms Austin's evidence that the applicant ""kicked"" Mr Miller but ""only once"".  She was ""not sure"" whether the kick made contact with Mr Miller's head.  She accepted the kick may well have been to the ""upper torso ... or the upper arm area"".  Mr Fanning's evidence that one kick to the head was administered was significantly qualified in the extract from his cross examination set out by Hoeben CJ at CL (at [40]).  Properly analysed Mr Farmer's evidence on this topic travelled no higher than observing the applicant to raise his leg and bend his knee.  None of the witnesses observing from the nearby bus testified to seeing a kick or a stomp.  The applicant testified that he had stomped on the chest of Mr Miller to make sure he did not get up.
119The most significant piece of evidence on this topic is that of Mr Daniel Doughy which is extracted by Hoeben CJ at CL at [32].  In his interview Mr Doughy stated that the applicant ""jumped"" on Mr Miller's head three times.  However, as noted by Hoeben CJ at CL, his evidence at the committal hearing was different and under cross examination at the trial he stated that he only told the police what others told him (at [34] to [35]). Although there are grounds for scepticism as to the latter assertion, the contention that the accused jumped on Mr Miller's head three times is very difficult if not impossible to reconcile with Dr Will's post mortem observations.
120I am satisfied that it was open to a jury to conclude that the applicant administered at least one kick to Mr Miller while he was on the ground and did so with an aggressive intent.  However I do not consider that it was open to a jury to conclude that any more such kicks were administered or that they were administered to Mr Miller's head.  Relevantly, I do not consider that it was open to such a jury to treat that act together with the other evidence as demonstrative of the applicant having an intention to inflict death or cause grievous bodily harm upon Mr Miller.
121The sixth point raised by the Crown and noted by Hoeben CJ at CL at [16] as demonstrating the requisite intent on the part of the applicant is that the applicant ""initiated the second fight by punching the deceased from behind"".  I have already addressed the factual basis for this contention. Otherwise the balance of the points raised can be accepted so far as they go.  However none of them individually or in combination with each other and the balance of the evidence justify a conclusion that it was open to the jury to conclude that the applicant had the relevant intention necessary to make him guilty of murder as opposed to manslaughter.
122Once Mr Whiting's evidence of threats and six stomps to the deceased is put aside, the evidence concerned a street fight where neither participant intended to either kill or inflict really serious physical injury upon the other.  Mr Miller's tragic death arose in circumstances that he had an undiagnosed brain aneurism.  Of course the applicant may have been legally responsible for the fight and Mr Miller's death, but that is not the issue raised by this appeal.  Instead the appeal is solely concerned with whether it was open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the applicant caused Mr Miller's death he intended to kill him or inflict grievous bodily harm.  In my view it was not.
123I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

		08 August 2014",2014-08-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764518,Vo v R [2014] NSWCCA 146,"Judgment
1EMMETT JA:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales following pleas of guilty to two counts of supplying heroin and one count of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.  The essence of the applicant's proposed grounds of appeal is that the sentencing judge did not afford an adequate discount for his pleas of guilty.  I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of Fullerton J for granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal.  I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour for the reasons proposed by her Honour.  
2PRICE J:  I agree with Fullerton J.
3FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Williams DCJ on 9 May 2013 following his pleas of guilty to two counts of supply of heroin contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and one count of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
4The pleas of guilty were entered on 21 February 2013 following the applicant's arraignment in the District Court at some unspecified time prior to trial.  
The offences and the sentences imposed
5The first supply count (charged as Count 1 on the indictment) involved an actual supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin between June and October 2010.  The statement of facts tendered on sentence identified a total of 1.9 kilograms as having been supplied on 71 separate instances between those two dates.  A large commercial quantity of heroin is specified in Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as not less than 1 kilogram.  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  The applicant invited the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 his possession of two small amounts of prohibited drugs when sentencing for that offence.
6The second supply count (charged as Count 2 on the indictment) involved a deemed supply of a commercial quantity of heroin, being 754 grams found in three separate locations in the applicant's home upon his arrest on 27 October 2010.  A commercial quantity of heroin is specified in Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as not less than 250 grams.  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
7The offence contrary to s 193B (1) of the Crimes Act (charged as Count 3 on the indictment) related to the applicant's possession of $217,109 which was also located at his home on his arrest.  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
8The sentencing judge reduced an undiscounted sentence of 14 years to 12 years on the first count in recognition of the utility of the plea of guilty and its timing.  This calculates to a discount of approximately 14 per cent.  His Honour made no express reference to discounting the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 by the same amount although it may be assumed he did.  Counsel does not submit to the contrary.  
9After taking into account the offences on the Form 1, a sentence of 12 years comprised of a non-parole period of 8 years and an additional term of 4 years was imposed on the first count.  That sentence was ordered to commence on 30 April 2013 to account for a brief period on remand.  The applicant was released to conditional bail on 4 November 2010.  
10Concurrent terms of imprisonment of 10 years and 6 years were imposed on Counts 2 and 3 which comprised, respectively, a non-parole period of 5 years and an additional term of 3 years and a non-parole period of 4 years and an additional term of 2 years.
The grounds of appeal
11The four grounds pressed on the application for leave to appeal articulate, in slightly different ways, what is said to be error in the assessment of the discount allowed for the pleas of guilty.  They are as follows:
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to allow sufficient discount to the plea of guilty.
Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in placing weight on the strength of the Crown case when assessing the applicable discount for the plea of guilty.
Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred when sentencing the applicant by failing to take into account that the applicant was entitled to be accurately informed of the particulars of the charge before he could reasonably be expected to plead to the charge. 
Ground 4 (in the alternative to Ground 3): The sentencing judge erred in penalising the applicant for not pleading guilty earlier to a charge that lacked an important particular relevant to the sentencing process.
12These grounds of appeal can conveniently be dealt with together. 
13Given the confined nature of the errors contended for by the applicant, it is sufficient to set out the facts upon which sentence was imposed in very short compass.  
The facts
14A police investigation into the supply of heroin in the Birrong area in Western Sydney identified two people who were supplying heroin to drug users, including street level suppliers of heroin, in amounts of between 3.5 and 10 grams.  Intercepted telephone conversations between these two persons and the applicant identified him as their supplier with the heroin being supplied from his home in Bankstown by pre-arrangement.  
15On 27 October 2010 police arrested one of the people as he drove from the applicant's premises after having discarded a package containing 28 grams of heroin with a purity of 30 per cent.  Assistance provided to police by the purchasers of the drugs confirmed that it was customary for them to purchase 1 ounce (28 grams) of heroin from the applicant on a regular basis at a cost of $5600 for their on-supply to end users. 
16Search warrants were executed at the applicant's premises where the heroin the subject of the second count and the money the subject of the third count were located.  The applicant admitted possession of the heroin at his home which he said he was holding for another person.  He was unable to provide any details to assist investigators to identify that person.  He maintained that he had been in possession of the heroin for a period of two to three weeks.  He claimed that he intended to return the heroin to the other person at some future date.  He admitted to possession of the cash found in a combination lock safe which he opened at the request of police.  He claimed that only $15,000 was the proceeds of drug supply and that the balance was from gambling. 
17A large quantity of material commonly mixed with high purity heroin to increase the bulk quantity of the drug as an admixture was located.  Electronic scales and small quantities of individually packed bags of heroin were located in the refrigerator.  The applicant then admitted supplying heroin that day and supplying heroin on previous occasions.
Consideration of the grounds of appeal
18On sentence the Crown submitted that a discount in the order of 10 to 12½ per cent for the pleas of guilty was in accordance with the principles in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1, in particular Howie J's observation at [31] that the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of a plea is reserved for cases where the guilty plea is entered at the earliest opportunity in accordance with the guideline judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104.  In Morton v R [2014] NSWCCA 8 at [32]-[33] Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Schmidt J and Barr AJ agreed) reaffirmed the principles to be applied by sentencing courts when assessing the utilitarian value of a plea as articulated by Howie J in Borkowski and his Honour's analysis to a similar effect in R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; 160 A Crim R 510.
19Experienced senior counsel who appeared for the applicant on sentence submitted that a discount in the order of 15 per cent was appropriate.  He accepted that the applicant had no entitlement to what counsel described as ""the full discount"".  That submission would appear to reflect what Howie J observed later in [31] in Borkowski that in the ""usual case"" a plea of guilty entered on arraignment could not justify a discount of more than ""about 15 per cent"".  
20In that same paragraph, his Honour went on to say:
... There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case...
21Counsel on the appeal submitted that this was an exceptional case. 
22In oral submissions in this Court the applicant's counsel submitted that senior counsel misunderstood the relevant law and that he should have urged the sentencing judge to apply a discount of 20 per cent for the pleas of guilty (that is, an increase of 6 per cent on the 14 per cent his Honour allowed) and that this Court should intervene to re-sentence the applicant to correct that error.  Counsel further submitted that despite the sentencing judge's finding that the totality of the applicant's criminality could be reflected in the imposition of wholly concurrent terms of imprisonment (a generous finding but not the subject of a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentence) the sentencing error was such that other sentences were warranted at law as provided for in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  
23The reason for the applicant's late plea was said to be delay in the Crown notifying him of the precise quantity of heroin the subject of Count 1.  This was also said to be a circumstance sufficiently exceptional to have attracted a discount in the order of 20 per cent despite the plea of guilty being entered after arraignment.  Counsel submitted that it was not for the applicant to press for the quantity of heroin he was alleged to have supplied to be calculated before he considered whether he would enter a plea of guilty to the first count.  That was a matter exclusively within the province of the prosecution in an accusatorial system of criminal justice and that he should not be penalised for failing to plead guilty earlier in those circumstances.  The applicant relied on what Kirby J observed in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339 at [77] as authority for that proposition as a corollary to the submission that the sentencing judge erred by not allowing a greater discount for the guilty plea.  He submitted that the applicant's senior counsel in the sentence proceedings should not have abandoned what he invited this Court to apply as a statement of principle articulated by Kirby J in Cameron by proposing a discount of 15 per cent.  Rather, he should have urged the sentencing judge to find that the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity and that a discount of at least 20 per cent should have been allowed to reflect that fact.  
24I am not persuaded that senior counsel's submissions revealed any misunderstanding of principle.  To the contrary.  They were properly made in accordance with established authority.  It follows that I am not persuaded that the circumstances in which the pleas were ultimately entered were exceptional such as might allow for the conclusion that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried in allowing no greater discount than 14 per cent for the plea of guilty or that there is any statement of principle in Cameron which dictates any different result.   
25In Cameron the original charge alleged that the appellant possessed a particular prohibited drug.  On further analysis, that substance proved to be a different prohibited drug and the charge was amended.  The plea of guilty was entered to the amended charge six months after the appellant's arrest but before he was committed for sentence to the District Court of Western Australia.  The sentencing judge reduced the discount for the guilty plea because of the timing of the plea.  The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the appellant's submission that it was not possible for a plea to be entered until the charge was amended to properly identify the prohibited drug in his possession.  In the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ at [23]-[25] in upholding the appeal the following was said:
[23]  Although the original charge specified the elements of the offence charged, it was not reasonable to expect the appellant to plead to an offence which wrongly particularised the substance to which the charge related. And that is so even if the identity of the substance would not have affected sentence. In this regard, it should not be assumed that the appellant knew that the sentence would be the same regardless of the nature of the substance. 
[24]  More importantly, the appellant should not have been expected to acquiesce in procedures which might result in error in the court record or, indeed, in his own criminal record. At the very least, a plea of guilty to a charge wrongly particularising the substance he had in his possession would not necessarily provide the basis for a plea of autrefois acquit to a subsequent charge specifying the correct substance. 
[25]  The Court of Criminal Appeal was in error in holding that the appellant could have pleaded guilty before the charge was amended to correctly specify the substance which he had in his possession. Moreover, it was in error in stating that there had been ""no saving in the Magistrates Court"" for the appellant's plea of guilty rendered a preliminary hearing unnecessary. 
26In R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; 54 NSWLR 300; 130 A Crim R 238 Spigelman CJ gave detailed consideration to whether the reasoning in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Cameron at [12]-[15] as to the relevance of the plea of guilty on sentence was binding authority in New South Wales.  His Honour resolved that it was not (Mason, Barr, Bell and McClellan JJ agreeing), principally because of the different statutory schemes for dealing with pleas of guilty in New South Wales and Western Australia.  His Honour confirmed that the decision in R v Thomson; R v Houlton represented the law in this State in that the focus for sentencing purposes is on the objective utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.  
27Neither counsel referred the Court to the decision in Sharma nor whether the passage which I have extracted from the joint judgment in Cameron above applies as a statement of guiding principle.  Even accepting that it does, I do not consider that it assists the applicant in this case. 
28The Court was not referred to any evidence to indicate as to when the particulars of the heroin supplied in Count 1 were ultimately notified to the applicant's legal representatives, and nothing produced by way of correspondence with the prosecuting authorities or notes of appearances either in the Local Court prior to the applicant's committal for trial, or following his appearance in the District Court after that date, to support the submission that dilatoriness by the prosecuting authorities was the reason he delayed his answer to the charges.  Additionally, there was nothing put by way of submission to this Court to explain the delay in the applicant entering pleas of guilty to Counts 2 and 3 on the indictment (as to which at least partial admissions were made on arrest) which may have attracted the ""usual discount"" for those offences if entered at the first reasonable opportunity.
29There is force in the Crown's submission that the delay in entering the pleas of guilty to all charges might be explained by the applicant's belief that there was some forensic advantage to him on sentence if the heroin supplied in Count 1 was only marginally greater than the large commercial quantity and that he could preserve his position as to whether he would enter a plea of guilty to that charge at all until the Crown nominated that amount.  Whatever else might be said about that approach, it diminished the utilitarian value of his plea when it was entered.  As Howie J observed in Borkowski generally the reason for the delay in the plea being entered is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, its utilitarian value is reduced.
30For my part, I am satisfied the applicant could have been in little doubt upon service of the brief that the weight of evidence was against any realistic expectation that the amount of heroin he supplied in excess of 1 kilogram was incalculable given that he knew that the people he was supplying were assisting police and that his telephones, as the means by which the arrangements for those ongoing supplies were made, were intercepted.  When his Honour observed that the only matter delaying the entry of the plea was the weight of the drug supplied on the first count and that ""... it is difficult to see how a plea of guilty could have been avoided except in a very unrealistic scenario"", it is clear his Honour was not referring to the strength of the Crown case as a factor relevant to the assessment of the discount of the plea, as the applicant contends in the third ground of appeal, but to the fact that the applicant had not entered a plea at an earlier stage in the proceedings when it was reasonably open to him to do so. 
31Accepting that the amount of heroin in excess of 1 kilogram was a matter relevant to sentence, the question remains whether the applicant was entitled to defer entering a plea for over two years until he was notified by the Crown as to the quantity they alleged he supplied whilst still claiming a discount for an early plea.  I am not persuaded he was.  What was alleged was a supply of a prohibited drug, namely heroin, in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity of that drug.  The particularised amount in excess of 1 kilogram was not an element of the offence.  This is not a case where there were ongoing negotiations with the prosecuting authorities as to the final form of the charges on the indictment, or to the number of charges to which pleas were sought, such as might explain pleas of guilty being entered in the District Court on or after arraignment.  In cases in that category, where the particular circumstances allow for it, it may be open to a sentencing judge to find that a plea of guilty was entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity and, in the exercise of discretion, to apply a discount for the plea to reflect that fact.  Neither was it a case where it was suggested to the sentencing judge or to this Court that the weight of the drug might convert the charge from one of supplying a large commercial quantity to supplying a commercial quantity where the maximum penalty reduces from life imprisonment to imprisonment for 25 years.  Although the weight of the drug is a factor relevant to sentence, it is not decisive and did not prove to be in this case.
32As I have noted, the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty as Count 1 on the indictment was, in any event, the same offence as that charged by police on his arrest.  Furthermore, even when pleas of guilty to all three counts were entered in February 2013 (two and a half years after his arrest), Count 1 did not particularise the amount of drug supplied as constituting a large commercial quantity.  It may be assumed that when the plea was entered it was accepted that the precise weight of the heroin would be either agreed before sentence, or if it remained in contest, that it would be the subject of a disputed issue of fact in the sentence proceedings.  This was the approach most recently endorsed as the correct approach by Bathurst CJ (with whom Hoeben J agreed) in R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [2]-[3].
33I am not persuaded that any of the grounds of appeal are made out.
34The orders I propose are:1.  Leave to appeal granted.2.  Appeal dismissed.

2764520,R v Blundell [2014] NSWDC 365,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Just stand up please, Mr Blundell. I always tell the prisoners in advance what sentence is to be imposed but I have to give my reasons which will take some little time. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period for a period of one year eight months imprisonment. That will date from 7 November 2013 and expire on 6 July 2015. The balance of the sentence will be one year eight months expiring on 6 March 2017. Just take a seat, thanks very much.
	
	
	So the total sentence imposed is three years four months imprisonment. I have discounted the starting point of four and a half years, four years six months by 25 per cent.
	
	
	Nathan John Blundell appears for sentence in relation to an offence committed by him on 20 August 2013 of robbery whilst armed contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested on 7 November 2013 and has been in custody since that date. The sentence I impose will be backdated to commence on that date. The offender pleaded guilty at the Local Court and continued his plea of guilty in this Court. He, thus, is entitled to a discount of 25 per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to represent the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Thomson and Houlton.
	
	
	The particulars of the offence are that the prisoner at Young did rob Phillip Weyers of certain property, to wit, numerous packets of cigarettes and $500 cash, the property of Southwest Fuels whilst being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a crowbar. In fact, the bar in question is more of a pinch bar, but it matters nought for the purposes of the assessment of the objective facts in this matter.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence on sentence and I found him a straightforward witness for a young man with little experience in giving evidence. He came to the Court presenting himself as a matter of fact person and I generally accepted the evidence he gave to this Court. He was pressed in cross-examination about matters particularly concerning the timing of the planning of the offence, but ultimately I accept the evidence he has given. I certainly cannot make an adverse finding beyond reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence in relation to the matters about which he spoke.
	
	
	The prisoner and a younger co-offender who, as I understand it, was three years younger, in company went to a service station in Young, the Caltex service station. The prisoner gave evidence, which I accept, that he met up with his co-offender about midday at a mutual acquaintance’s home and there he and the co-offender drank a quantity of alcohol until they ran out of money. They discussed doing a breaking and entering offence somewhere in the Young township and, as I understand the matter, left the premises where they had been drinking at about 8.30pm. The purpose of the crime was to obtain the means either to purchase more alcohol or to purchase prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The prisoner was armed with a tyre lever. The co-accused was armed with a knife although my understanding of the prisoner’s evidence is that he was not aware that his co-offender had a knife until some time later in the evening. They walked around the township of Young, looked at various places to break into including, as I understand it, the Big W store. Then just before 10 o’clock they came across the Caltex service station at Young with which they were apparently both familiar.
	
	
	The co-accused said to the prisoner words to the effect, “Why don’t we just rob the servo?” The prisoner said, “Why not”. They thus entered the service station, the prisoner armed with the pinch bar, the co-offender armed with the knife. I not only have a statement of agreed facts, but there is a video recording from closed circuit television tendered in disk form that I have viewed at least twice, so I have a very good idea of the way in which events unfolded.
	
	
	The co-accused was the first person into the premises but the prisoner can be clearly seen standing outside an open door which apparently led to a storeroom at the back of the service station. The public area of the service station, the service area, so to speak, was empty at the relevant time. The prisoner stood at the open doorway with the pinch bar over his shoulder in a threatening manner awaiting the arrival of the staff member who was closing up at the time. When he entered the service area from the storage area he was confronted by the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner and his co-offender were dressed in hooded jumpers with some distinctive markings on them. The prisoner and the co-offender wearing distinctive gloves as well which ultimately aided in their detection. They had their faces partially covered and thus could be described as disguised to the extent that their clothing permitted their faces to be covered and the rest of their body to be shielded from camera view.
	
	
	The prisoner waited for the victim to come out of the storage area whilst the co-offender, Fuller, walked behind into the console area of the store and attempted, apparently, to operate the cash register. It was a little hard to see what he was doing but he was unable to open the cash register.
	
	
	When the victim did walk into the shop area from the rear he was immediately confronted, as the facts state, by the prisoner. The prisoner threatened the victim with the tyre lever over his shoulder. Fuller also approached the victim and threatened the victim.
	
	
	The facts state that the co-offender said to the victim, “This is a hold‑up”, and the prisoner yelled out, “Open the till and give us the cash”. It is quite clear from both the film and the agreed facts that the prisoner and the co‑offender were enthusiastic participants in a joint criminal enterprise to commit an armed robbery and each played an equal role in the commission of the crime.
	
	
	The victim went behind the counter into the console area and opened the cash register and apparently from what I could see he handed over, largely by throwing, a number of $50 notes towards the prisoner. The prisoner continued to threaten the victim with the tyre lever and the prisoner took the $50 notes that were thrown on the counter area, placing them in his pockets.
	
	
	The prisoner also yelled out to the co-offender to get some cigarettes and it turns out that the co-offender picked up an empty cardboard box and put numerous packets of cigarettes into that box which ultimately was carried from the store.
	
	
	The victim took a bundle of $20 notes from the cash register and placed them on the counter area. The prisoner tried to pick up the notes, however dropped some on the floor. He leaned down to pick them up. The victim was still complying with the demands being made of him, however the prisoner in his evidence before me, particularly in cross-examination, conceded that ultimately just before he left the store smashed the display stand on the counter of the service console. He did so because he thought the victim had not given him all the money that he could.
	
	
	The smashing of the display stand was a totally unnecessary display of force and a very intimidatory act. Although I do accept the evidence of the prisoner that he did not intend to actually strike the victim. This is small consolation for the victim who I accept must have been quite terrified by the presence of two armed men, alone with them, threatening him in the way that the facts reveal.
	
	
	The prisoner and the co-offender finally left the premises with the property that has been particularised in the charge and the victim obviously throughout the commission of the offence had considerable fears for his safety.
	
	
	The prisoner attended premises nearby, as I understand it. After the robbery he was carrying a plastic bag full of cigarettes and he told the occupants of an address supplied in the facts that he and Mr Fuller had just “done the service station and got dollars and heaps of cigarettes”. The prisoner then commenced to sell packets of cigarettes to occupants in the house for ten dollars a packet. The prisoner told the occupants how the robbery was committed and the weapons that they had upon them.
	
	
	The prisoner and the co-offender over the days following continued disposing of the stolen cigarettes and made admissions about their involvement in the robbery and the way in which the facts reveal to a number of people.
	
	
	The prisoner was interviewed, assuming that this information had found its way back to the police, on 30 October 2013. At that point he denied any involvement in the armed robbery. Ultimately there was a search warrant executed, various property was found linking the prisoner and/or the co‑offender to the crime from what was displayed in the closed-circuit television footage.
	
	
	At 2.50pm on Thursday, 7 November 2013 the prisoner was arrested at Quandialla and taken into custody here he remained, as I said earlier, until the present time. Again, he was not entirely frank. In fact, whilst he claimed that he was aware the robbery offence had been committed by the co‑offender Fuller and that he had assisted in selling stolen cigarettes in the days following, he denied any involvement in the armed robbery.
	
	
	The co-offender Fuller, as I pointed out, was three years younger than the prisoner. The prisoner’s account, although they both had agreed to go out and commit some crime jointly approximately an hour and a half before, claimed that Fuller had suggested the robbery of the service station. Bearing in mind they both left other premises armed in their respective ways it was not much of a leap forward or backward as the case may be for them to decide upon a robbery with the weapons they used rather than a breaking, entering and stealing offence that the prisoner says they had initially ventured into the night to commit.
	
	
	I accept, however, the evidence of the prisoner that it was ultimately his co‑offender that suggested the ultimate crime they committed, although the prisoner immediately and enthusiastically on his own account embraced the suggestion.
	
	
	The reason I accept his account, albeit that Mr Fuller is not here to defend himself and has no chance to test the prisoner’s account, arises from the co‑accused’s criminal history by comparison to that of this prisoner and events that have occurred since the commission of the crime with which I am concerned.
	
	
	First of all I am informed that Mr Fuller is a suspect in a murder that was committed in the Young district, as I understand it, approximately eight or nine days after this crime. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. He, unfortunately, is not immediately amenable to justice because on 9 May 2014 he appeared in the Queensland District Court where he had pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery in company, one count of attempting to enter premises with intent to commit an indictable offence and one count of attempted armed robbery in company. He was sentenced to a total of three years imprisonment with a parole release date of 16 months in total for the three offences, although some of the sentences for specific offences were less than the sentence of three years which was imposed for the armed robbery in company offence.
	
	
	I have been provided with his criminal history and I doubt that I have seen a worse criminal history, at least a more extensive criminal history, of one so young. The number of pages of a criminal history sometimes do not mean very much but it merely needs to be said that his appearances in the Children’s Court amount to 50 pages of criminal history. True it is, many of the offences are for crimes of dishonesty such as breaking, entering and stealings, aggravated breaking, entering and stealings and the like. But there are a number of offences of violence and destruction of property or damaging of property.
	
	
	I note that on 16 April 2013 he was convicted in the Young Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four months. Those sentences backdated to December thus, as I would understand it, he was almost immediately released to parole. I would expect, from my assessment of that sentence, that he was on parole when he committed the crime with the prisoner before me today on 20 August 2013.
	
	
	In any event, he has a very, very extensive criminal history which shows that despite his tender years and his greater youth than the offender, he was a very experienced criminal which this prisoner is not. This prisoner has a relatively negligible criminal history. He appeared at Young Children’s Court in relation to a number of driving offence for which he was variously placed on good behaviour bonds and/or disqualified for a period of time or fined. Those appearances, I hasten to say, were in August 2010, three years before the current offending.
	
	
	He also has no convictions for dishonesty as such and he has certainly no convictions for violence. The background to his offending on this occasion and the circumstances in which he found himself in company with the very, very experienced young criminal were set out in his evidence, which I earlier said I accept. He had an apprenticeship after he left school but when he lost his licence in 2010 he lost that apprenticeship as one would expect.
	
	
	His father lived in Grenfell at the time caring for a younger brother who was severely disabled with cerebral palsy. The prisoner got a job concreting and worked in that line of occupation for approximately 15 months but apparently lost that work several months before his involvement in the armed robbery.
	
	
	He found himself living in Young some distance from his father, although Grenfell is within an hour’s drive away. He was moving from house to house ‘couch surfing’, as I would understand it, and using drugs and drinking alcohol with so much free time on his hands.
	
	
	After the commission of the robbery he stayed in Young for about a month and then he went back to Grenfell to his father’s home and came off his dependence to prohibited drugs, particularly amphetamines ‘cold turkey’, a fact confirmed by his father.
	
	
	He was in fact three or four weeks into abstinence from drugs when he was arrested in relation to the current matter. I note his father’s evidence that since he has been in custody, although the prisoner has told us that he has found that very difficult, everything has been what he described as a “struggle”, his father said his physical presentation has much improved.
	
	
	The Probation and Parole Service has prepared a helpful report setting out the background of some family dysfunction, separation of his parents when he was quite young and difficulties with his relationship with his mother leading to a somewhat unusual situation, where his father became his primary carer and the carer of this severely disabled young man that I have earlier referred to.
	
	
	The report confirms the employment history that I have identified. It notes that in the 12 months prior to his arrest he was drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and using cannabis and methylamphetamines and confirms his withdrawal from his dependence on these substances. It notes that when he was drinking and using amphetamines he had lost a considerable amount of weight and he also acknowledged the need for him to avoid use of prohibited drugs and alcohol excessively to progress his rehabilitation.
	
	
	He said that he was not wholly dependent upon Centrelink benefits because he became very unreliable in attending upon Centrelink to confirm payments that may have otherwise been due to him. He said in relation to the offending with which I am concerned that he was, “messed up because of the drugs”, and the Probation and Parole Service acknowledges that he is at medium risk of re‑offending with a need for issues such as alcohol and drug dependency, ‘relationships’ and his financial situation to be addressed on his release to parole. He also needs assistance in relation to creative ways and appropriate ways to use his leisure time and his recreation time as well as in the areas of education and employment.
	
	
	There are some references to community based sentencing but, for the reasons that are self-evident from the Crown’s very helpful written submissions, at the moment the prisoner is not entitled to be released back into parole.
	
	
	The assessment of the prisoner by the Probation and Parole Service noted that although Mr Blundell presented with no prior criminal history he was fully aware that unless he took steps to address his substance abuse he may well continue to proceed down the path of offending. The report said that his report of both alcohol and illicit drugs has resulted in his loss of employment, his estrangement from his father for a period of time, unstable accommodation and ultimately involvement in criminal activity. It noted his self-withdrawal from substance abuse prior to his remand in custody and it said that the prisoner appeared to have some insight into the factors that contributed to his offending and took responsibility for his behaviour. It recommended a period of supervision with a number of case management strategies such as I have already identified.
	
	
	In his evidence before me he apologised for his conduct towards the victim. He said that he understood the impact upon the victim or certainly said that he would understand how the victim would be terrified. He said in his evidence that he was anxious to return to Grenfell on his release from custody and wished to re-establish himself in that township away from the township of Young.
	
	
	He appreciated the matters that have led to his decline as summarised by the Probation and Parole Service. He gave evidence of having undertaken at least one course in custody which had assisted him and he indicated that being in custody had been a salutary experience.
	
	
	His father, as I said, had given evidence confirming a number of matters about which the prisoner spoke: the withdrawal from drugs; the improvement in his presentation whilst in custody. He also gave evidence about the circumstances of the prisoner’s brother, the care that he is required to provide that person and the support that the prisoner does provide for his brother when living at Grenfell.
	
	
	As I said, the prisoner in his evidence was a straightforward witness and I accept that he has taken responsibility for his conduct but, of course, he could have taken responsibility for his conduct at an earlier time by admitting his guilt when he was first interviewed by police.
	
	
	Counsel for the prisoner in his submissions noted the need for the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea and the connection of the offending to the prisoner’s drug usage. He conceded that the victim was a vulnerable person as both the authorities and the facts make clear. He noted the prisoner’s contrition and he also noted that the offence itself had been “suggested” by the co-offender, although I have already noted, by the prisoner’s own admission, his enthusiastic adoption of the plan.
	
	
	Counsel for the prisoner said that the crime was a ‘wakeup call’ and that the prisoner had taken some steps in his rehabilitation with his withdrawal from substance abuse before his arrest. He submitted that the prisoner’s short employment history showed that he was a hard worker but his loss of licence and drug usage had compounded his difficulties. He noted the absence of any prior convictions for offences of violence or dishonesty.
	
	
	He noted the support of the father and he said in this matter rehabilitation “loomed large”. The Court ought make a finding of ‘special circumstances’. He noted the criminal history of the co-accused and said that the criminal background of the co-accused supported the prisoner’s version of events so far as it reflected upon the co-accused’s role. He noted the prisoner’s relative youth and that the Court should accept his evidence.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions were largely in writing. There was no need really for the Crown to supplement anything that it had written apart from dealing with some of the matters that had arisen in the oral submissions of the defence. In the context of noting the maximum penalty and the character of the offending the Crown submitted in consideration of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that matters of deterrence, both personal and general, and retribution loom large in sentencing for this offence.
	
	
	The Crown noted the purposes of sentencing and the commentary that has existed in relation to the ‘purposes of sentencing’ going back before the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the decision of the High Court in Veen (No 2) as well as subsequent to the introduction of s 3A in the decision cited by the Crown, such as The Queen v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R 434. The only matter that I would add to the Crown’s very helpful submissions is the observation of the majority of the High Court in Veen (No 2) that the purposes of sentencing, only four in that judgment now expanded to seven or eight, were like ‘guideposts’ and sometimes in particular sentencing exercises they point in different directions.
	
	
	The other matter to be observed which I believe is at least implicit in the Crown’s written submissions is that all these matters really have been taken into account to a large extent in the guideline judgment of The Queen v Henry to which reference is made in the written submissions of the Crown which, of course, predates the legislation that now contains s 3A. In Henry ((1999) 45 NSWLR 346) the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted a guideline for the sentencing of offenders for the crime of armed robbery. It has been said subsequently, of course, that a guideline is not a ‘tramline’ and the Court itself in Henry acknowledged the existing discretion still prevail but regard must be had to the guideline in sentencing for offenders of this type.
	
	
	In fact, it is worth noting, at para [10] the learned Chief Justice adopted what had been said by Acting Chief Justice Mahoney in the decision of Lattouf, an unreported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. General principles of sentencing must, of their nature:
	


“be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. For this reason it is ... important in the public interest that the sentencing process recognise and maintain a residual discretion in the sentencing Judge. There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles which will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it but there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard. These are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case”.


	
	I might also refer just in passing to observations of Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice Wood, in decisions such as Blackman and Walters and a later decision of Tran where his Honour noted the public interest in the Courts adopting an approach to sentencing that permitted the protection of the public to be recognised not just by necessarily punitive sentences but by fashioning orders to assist in the rehabilitation of offenders. The promotion of the rehabilitation of offenders is, of course, one of the purposes of sentencing in s 3A.
	
	
	The Crown very properly went through those, if I may call them, criteria for a case that fell within the rubric of the guideline that the Court settled upon of four to five years imprisonment for a particular category of armed robbery in which this particular armed robbery does fit: young offender with little or no criminal history; a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm. In this case, of course, there is a joint criminal enterprise where one offender had a knife. This prisoner had a pinch bar but it certainly was capable of inflicting serious injury if it struck the victim; limited degree of planning which was present here; limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof which is self-evident from the facts I have outlined; the victim being in a vulnerable position such as the case here; a relatively small amount taken; $500 and a large quantity of cigarettes is not an altogether modest taking from an armed robbery. It is in the scheme of things to be seen at the lower end of property that may have been stolen. The plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.
	
	
	The Chief Justice said after setting out those matters at [162] that also aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range as the Courts’ decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point and his Honour went on to identify a number of aspects of the matter that might intensify the circumstances of the offending and set out those matters at [170].
	
	
	Here, to my mind, the most identifiable aggravating factor by reference to the Henry guideline is the intensity of the threat posed by the prisoner when he smashed the display case. As I said, it was a totally unnecessary act of intimidation, although I accept the prisoner was not trying to hit the victim otherwise I would have imposed a greater sentence. The reason the prisoner gave, simply that the victim he thought was not handing over all the money he could, does the prisoner no credit whatsoever. I am also mindful of the effect on the victim as well. I have already dealt with that matter.
	
	
	In this matter one also has to, in addition to the guideline judgment, consider the operation of s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As I have pointed out that legislation, which came into effect in 2001 but was initially passed in 1999, postdates the various criteria identified in Henry v The Queen. On reading Ponfield v The Queen, the 1999 guideline judgment on breaking, entering and stealing offences, one would see that many of the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in that judgment by Justice Grove were adopted by the legislature in the subsequent legislation that was enacted and is now in force.
	
	
	By reference to s 21A(2) I accept what the Crown has put in its submissions that there are two particular aggravating factors: firstly, the offence was committed in company as is self-evident from the facts I have outlined; and also the victim was vulnerable, but this is a matter also that is considered in the guideline judgment.
	
	
	The prisoner, whilst he was abusing prohibited drugs, was not affected by prohibited drug at the time of the commission of the offence. On his evidence he was “charged up”, if I could use that expression. That was an expression adopted by him in the questioning of him by myself from the use of alcohol but was not heavily intoxicated. That is clear enough from the vision that one has seen on the film. He also said that he was coming down from the use of drugs the day before. This was the equivalent of, in effect, having a hangover from too much alcohol. He was a person, however, on his own version, that had been abusing drugs for some period of time.
	
	
	The matters identified by Justice Wood at [273] of the guideline judgment need to be considered as the Crown has identified in its helpful written submissions. His Honour made clear, as the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal accepted in the guideline judgment, that the need to acquire drugs to support a drug habit, even a severe habit which is not the case here, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence and of itself is not a matter in mitigation.
	
	
	He pointed out, however, the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need - and I do accept for the time being that the prisoner did commit the crime in order to obtain money amongst other reasons to purchase drugs - that may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence insofar as it may throw light on matters such as the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of planning for it, the existence or non‑existence of an alternative reason that might operate in aggravation, which does not exist here, and the state of mind of the prisoner at the time of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	It is of particular relevance here because of the impulsivity of the offence and the limited planning that was involved. The Crown submitted that one could conclude that it was a planned offence. Certainly the prisoner and his co‑accused were planning to commit some crime but the commission of this particular crime was specifically unplanned in my view or had very, very limited planning indeed. I must point out the state of mind of the prisoner was not such as to suggest that he was unable to exercise judgment.
	
	
	Justice Wood also said that a person’s dependence upon prohibited drugs may be relevant to subjective circumstances such as the impact upon the prospects of recidivism and rehabilitation in which case it may prove to be what he described as a “two edged sword”. The circumstances in which dependency of drugs arose through no fault of the prisoner, which is not the case here, and justified consideration of a prisoner being judged to be at “the crossroads”.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that the prisoner’s capacity to avoid drugs for a period of weeks before he was arrested, in fact he tried to detoxify himself, represents some indication of rehabilitation on his part and I also accept to some extent the prisoner is “at the crossroads” largely because this serious offending with which I am concerned is the first such offending of its type for a person now aged 22 who, if he was disposed to antisocial acts, one would have thought would have displayed those acts sometime earlier than on this particular occasion.
	
	
	Thus, my reference to s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the mitigating factors I conclude are that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity, the prisoner did not have a significant record of previous convictions. I accept that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to some steps he took before his arrest and some improvement in his circumstances whilst in custody and the support he has of his father. I also accept that the prisoner has shown remorse for the offence by providing evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged particularly the harm that he would have caused to the victim by his conduct.
	
	
	He could not really fully explain the way in which he conducted himself in his evidence and I did not see that necessarily as a failing on his part. It is very difficult to explain why a person such as this prisoner should engage in this type of conduct. I can understand why his co-accused did given his subsequent conduct since, and I am putting aside the murder allegation for the moment. The subsequent proven conduct of his co-accused shows that he was well qualified to commit a crime of this type and this prisoner was not. His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor. On the other hand he gets a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Thus, having endeavoured to weigh up all the relevant matters I concluded that a term of imprisonment for this crime, given the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment, starting at four years six months ought be imposed subject to the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea.
	
	
	I have made a finding of special circumstances. The special circumstances are that the prisoner requires professional assistance to adjust to community living. He will need direction from the Parole Service in relation to his associations in relation to counselling and perhaps rehabilitation programs for drug dependence. He will also need assistance in finding employment and seeking to marshal his finances to avoid a situation where he is tempted to commit other crimes in order to obtain money for the purposes he identified in his evidence.
	
	
	Yes, stand up please, Mr Blundell. In relation to the offence for which you have been convicted you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of one year eight months. That term of imprisonment will start on 7 November 2013 and expire on 6 July 2015. The balance of sentence will be one year eight months imprisonment and that balance of sentence will expire, on my calculation, on 6 March 2017. I cannot direct that you be released to parole, that will be a matter for the Parole Authority. Thus, the matter will be determined by your cooperation with the Correctional Services staff during your time in custody.

		23 November 2015",2014-08-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764522,Huynh v R [2014] NSWCCA 147,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Hamill J.

2BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hamill J.

3HAMILL J: The appellant appeals against a sentence imposed by Judge Ainslie-Wallace (as her Honour then was) in the District Court on 27 March 2008. Following a trial by judge alone, the appellant was found guilty of one count of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin (about 700 grams). The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. A commercial quantity of heroin is defined in Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) as a quantity between 250 grams and 1 kilogram. 

4The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 13 years with a non-parole period of 10 years commencing 27 November 2007. The non-parole period is to expire on 26 November 2017.

5An appeal against the conviction and sentence was dismissed by this Court, differently constituted (Grove, Blanch and Kirby JJ), in 2009: Huynh v R [2009] NSWCCA 65 (""the 2009 appeal""). Since the decision dismissing her application for leave to appeal against sentence, the High Court decided the case of Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39. The appellant contends and the respondent concedes that Muldrock establishes that the sentence and the 2009 appeal are infected with legal error. 

6Pursuant to the provisions in s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), the appellant sought an inquiry into the sentence. Her application was successful and pursuant to s 79(1)(b) the matter was referred to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal: Application by Huynh under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (Supreme Court (NSW) Latham J, 19 December 2013, unrep). 

7In her notice of appeal the appellant raised one ground of appeal namely, ""the learned sentencing judge erred in giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance"". That is a ground of appeal clearly based around the decision in Muldrock v The Queen and was the basis upon which the Latham J referred the case to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal.

8Because the matter was subject of a referral under s 78, the appellant does not require leave: cf Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14 per RA Hulme J at [22]. 

9In additional written submissions filed on 25 July 2014 and in oral argument, counsel for the appellant sought to agitate an additional ground of appeal. That ground is based on principles of parity: cf Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610; Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 302

10The 2009 appeal included a ground based on parity. That ground was rejected. However, senior counsel for the appellant contends that the consideration of parity in the 2009 appeal was tainted by the prevailing approach to sentencing in cases where there was a standard non-parole period. That approach was overruled by the decision in Muldrock v The Queen. Accordingly, the appellant seeks to re-agitate the parity issue and during the course of the hearing sought to amend her grounds of appeal to include the following additional ground:
""The principle of parity was inhibited by sentencing practice which then applied resulting in an inappropriate sentence.""

11A preliminary issue concerns the question of whether the Court can (or should) entertain grounds of appeal which were not subject to the referral under s 79. That question is brought into particularly sharp focus in a case such as this one where the particular ground of appeal, albeit differently formulated, was considered in the 2009 appeal. 

12As to whether a referral under s 79 is limited to the ground (or grounds) upon which the referral is based, there are, as I perceive it, compelling arguments going both ways. On the one hand the case has previously been subject to an appeal and principles of finality would militate against allowing similar grounds again to be agitated in circumstances where the referral under s 78 was on a specific ground contending what might loosely be described as ""Muldrock error"". On the other hand the terms of s 79(1)(b) require or allow the Court to refer ""the whole case"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That language would suggest that it would be open to an appellant to raise additional grounds.

13It is unnecessary to resolve this issue in determining the present appeal. Further it would be inappropriate to do so.

14The reason that it is not necessary to resolve the question is because if it is accepted that Muldrock error exists, the Court will be called upon to re-sentence and to consider whether s 6 (3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is engaged in that a different, less severe, sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. In order to determine that question it will be necessary to consider and apply principles of parity and to consider in a principled way the sentences imposed on co-offenders. The question of disparity as a distinct ground of appeal would not arise. 

15There are two reasons that it is inappropriate for the Court as presently constituted to come to any conclusion as to the question raised on a referral under s 79 is twofold. First no arguments on the subject have been addressed to the Court by senior counsel for the appellant. 

16Second, and more importantly, the Court (differently constituted) is reserved in a case where full and extensive arguments have been made by the parties. That case is R v Luizos which was heard on 9 May 2014 and in which the judgment of the Court is reserved. Both Bellew J (with whom Gleeson JA agreed) and I, while coming to different views as to the disposition of the appeal, took a similar approach in Rajendran v R [2014] NSWCCA 113 at [22] and [103]-[104].

17Accordingly I propose to consider the case on the basis of the ground which was raised in the notice of appeal and assuming that ground is established (which in my opinion it is) to consider principles of parity in determining the appropriate sentence and the ultimate disposition of this appeal. 

18I turn to consider the facts of the case and the matters personal to the appellant raised in the sentencing proceedings before Judge Ainslie-Wallace. 

19As I have said the appellant was convicted after a judge alone trial. Judge Ainslie Wallace set out the facts that she found had been established in her remarks on sentence.

20Her Honour made findings as to the objective facts and those findings have not been challenged in this Court either in the 2009 appeal or in the appeal currently before the Court. Her Honour found as follows:
""On 16 May 2005 a co-offender Van Diep Pham (referred to as Sang in the intercepted telephone calls) was arrested in Sydney when he got off a bus which had arrived from Melbourne. He was searched and found to be in possession of two blocks of heroin, each weighing about three hundred and fifty grams and about $17,000 in cash.

The heroin weighed almost seven hundred grams and when analysed was found to be about seventy-five percent pure, in total, about five hundred grams of pure heroin. To put the amount in context, the amount of heroin which qualifies for a commercial quantity is two hundred and fifty grams and that for a large commercial quantity one kilogram.

The offender sourced, paid for and provided the heroin to Sang to bring back to Sydney to his superior for supply there.

The evidence against the offender was principally found within intercepted telephone calls between the offender and Sang.
Between 12 May and 16 May when Sang arrived in Sydney, the offender had been in telephone contact with him arranging to source and supply two blocks of heroin referred to as 'old men' and in the case of the offender 'grandpa'. She was able to obtain one block by about 12 May for which she paid. After that there seems to have been difficulties in obtaining the second block and, while Sang was anxious to get back to Sydney with the heroin, the offender told him that she could take care of it, eventually giving him the second block before he returned to Sydney by bus.

Based on the telephone calls I am satisfied that the offender had the ability to provide heroin from a number of sources and the capacity to pay for it. It is also clear from the conversations, although in code, that the offender had arranged to supply Sang with two blocks of heroin and each block would weigh about three hundred and fifty grams. The weight and her knowledge of it derives from her use of the word 'grandpa' and my acceptance of the evidence that a common term for such a three hundred and fifty gram block of heroin was 'old man' and that this, when considered in context, was a variation on that code.

It is clear from the telephone calls that Sang was operating as the agent for another man, referred to in the calls as Ahn Bah (whose actual name is John Tran). Sang's role was to get the heroin and take it back to Sydney where it would be cut with other material into greater amounts and then distributed. Throughout the period of the intercepted calls Ahn Bah became increasing frustrated at the delay in getting the two blocks of heroin and Sang urged him to wait to get the entire amount rather than settling for less

It is from the context of the telephone calls that one comes to assess the role of the offender.

I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was able to source and pay for considerable quantities of heroin. Examination of the calls shows that she very quickly arranged the first block of heroin but there was a delay while she made arrangements for a second. Apparently when the offender went to collect one block she found that she had to pay more than she had originally thought and $20,000 more had to be paid before she could get the heroin.

The offender had the capacity to pay for the heroin and to arrange for the funds. She was confident that she could supply the heroin to Sang because when he was concerned about the delay she assured him that she would be able to provide it. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this offence was not isolated. It is clear from the conversations that were recorded between her and Sang that she knew what to do to source the heroin. In making that finding I do not intend to punish the offender for crimes committed perhaps and not charged, that finding aids a determination of objective seriousness and is also relevant to a determination of whether the offence was committed as an isolated lapse of judgment. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not.""

21Her Honour went on to find that the appellant was acting at ""the middle level of a drug distribution hierarchy"" and that she was able to ""obtain large amounts of heroin at high purity to supply for transport and eventual use in Sydney"".

22The sentencing judge was of the opinion that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.

23As I have said, there is no challenge to these findings or to her Honour's categorization of the matter as falling within the mid range of objective seriousness. 

24Her Honour also set out the appellant's personal circumstances, including her age, family situation and previous criminal convictions. I will return to consider the appellant's personal circumstances later in this judgment.

25Before doing so I will deal with the sole ground of appeal advanced at the hearing of appeal namely that her Honour fell into error in giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance. As I have said, I am of the opinion that error is established. 

26As noted, the sentencing Judge held that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. It is implicit in the structure and substance of the remarks on sentence that the purpose of making this finding was to consider the application of the standard non-parole period. The finding followed upon her Honour setting out the provisions of s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and, having made that finding, her Honour set out some of the personal circumstances of the appellant as well as noting the sentences imposed on two co-offenders. Her Honour referred to the submission that the appellant should receive a lesser sentence than the co-offenders and rejected that submission coming to the view that her criminality was at least as high as one of them.

27Having gone through that process her Honour said:
""I can find no reason to depart from the stated [standard] non-parole period. In this case and I propose to sentence the offender to a non-parole period of 10 years.""

28The sentencing Judge and this Court applied the law relating to the standard non-parole period in s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) as it had been expressed and explained in the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, 60 NSWLR 168.

29In Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 391, 244 CLR 120, the High Court held (at [25]) that R v Way was wrongly decided and that ""it was an error to characterize s 54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms"". A sentencing judge is not required to commence by asking ""whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period"". The High Court held (at [26]) that the introduction of the standard non-parole period did not involve a departure from accepted sentencing principles whereby:
""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case.""

See, for example, Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, 228 CLR 357 at 378.

30Further, the High Court rejected (at [28]):
""[A] two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.""

31It is clear that the sentencing Judge proceeded on the basis that her task was to start by considering the standard non-parole period, by reference to the law as it had been declared by this court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, and by reference to her assessment of whether the case fell within the mid range of objective seriousness. Having concluded that the case did fall within the mid range, her Honour looked for and failed to find reasons to depart from the standard non-parole period. As a result she imposed the standard non-parole period of 10 years. There is no doubt that this approach was erroneous in the light of the subsequent decision by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen.

32In the 2009 appeal this Court reproduced the error of the sentencing judge. Of course it was applying what was then considered to be an orthodox approach to s 54A. The approach of the Court was even more starkly demonstrative of error:
""41. ... The first ground contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It was submitted 'that her Honour allowed herself to have too much regard to the standard non-parole period when assessing the appropriate term for imprisonment. It is submitted that her Honour considered it more a starting point than merely a reference or guide.' The submission misapprehended the statutory obligation which, in the case of an offence in the mid range of objective seriousness requires the imposition of a standard non-parole period unless the Court determines that there are reasons not to: s 54B (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The submission appears to confuse what was said by the Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 when observing that although the standard non-parole period may be directly applicable after conviction following trial, it remains a guidepost even if by reason of a plea of guilty or otherwise there is reason to depart from the standard non-parole period.

42 For reasons which she gave, her Honour determined that this offence fell within the mid range of seriousness for offences of this type. That finding has not been challenged. Within the tenor of the terms of the provision it was clearly the intention of Parliament to limit the discretions of sentencing judges and reference, as was made, to patterns of sentence developed in the absence of standard non-parole period prescriptions have to be gauged in that light.""

33The respondent concedes that error has been demonstrated in the sentencing process. That concession is properly and correctly made.

34Error having been demonstrated, it is necessary for this Court to consider afresh the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. In doing so it may take into account matters that were proved before the sentencing judge, findings made by the sentencing judge and, importantly in this case, any additional evidence adduced on the hearing of the appeal. It is open to the Court to take into account the post-sentence conduct of the appellant in making findings as to her prospects of rehabilitation: see, for example, R v Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455, 159 A Crim R 154 at [122]-[124].

35I do not need to recount in detail the personal circumstances proved before the sentencing judge. Her Honour noted the family circumstances of the appellant who was at the time of sentence 43 years of age and married with two adult children. She had escaped from Vietnam in 1981 and spent time in refugee camps before arriving in Australia in 1984. She lived in Melbourne as did her family. Her incarceration in New South Wales up to the time of her conviction resulted in both her and her children suffering from depression as a result of the distance, both geographic and psychological, caused by her incarceration. Testimonials satisfied the sentencing Judge that the appellant was a diligent and devoted mother. However, her Honour was not satisfied that the circumstances gave rise to additional hardship beyond that which is the inevitable result of incarceration. Her Honour was not satisfied that there had been any demonstrated remorse and held that she was unable to make any finding about the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation.

36The appellant has placed additional material before the court on the basis that it would only become admissible if error was established. That material came in the form of affidavits from the appellant herself and three of her friends as well as an Assistant Commissioner of Corrections Victoria (where the appellant is now serving her sentence). 

37The additional material does not establish remorse as that concept is defined in s 21A (3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). As far as I can tell the appellant has not acknowledged her guilt in relation to the offending let alone accepted responsibility for it. 

38Nor does the evidence provided by the appellant satisfy me that the finding of Judge Ainslie-Wallace in relation to the hardship arising from the appellant's family circumstances should be revisited. Considering that question afresh, I am not satisfied that there is exceptional hardship to family members of the kind that would result in a significant reduction in, or non-imposition of, a custodial sentence: see, for example, R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, R v Day (1998) 100 A Crim R 275, R v Toomalati [2000] NSWCCA 105.

39However, I have come to different conclusions to the sentencing Judge in relation to other mitigating circumstances. This is the result of the additional material concerning the appellant's progress in custody. Of most significance is the material now available that establishes the steps that the appellant has taken since 2009 to rehabilitate herself. Whereas the learned sentencing Judge in the immediate aftermath of the trial and with little evidence other than the appellant's personal history to guide her was unable to make a finding as to rehabilitation, I am satisfied that the appellant is unlikely to offend again and that she has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g)-(h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

40I am also satisfied that the appellant does not have a significant record of previous criminal convictions: s 21A(3)(e). She has a total of three appearances in Victoria. These relate to 6 offences although some of these appear to be part of the same incident and two were breaches of bail. None of the offences on her record are drug offences. Her last offence was in 1999. In 1995, she was sentenced for relatively serious offences (recklessly cause serious injury and aggravated burglary) but sentence was suspended. The other entries on her record resulted in fines and a community based order. She has not previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 

41These matters are important to a determination of the appropriate sentencing outcome, although they can never be given such weight as to result in a sentence that is disproportionate to the gravity of the criminality: Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600 at [53]. In this case, the criminality was of a high order, the appellant being a significant part of the distribution of a commercial quantity of heroin. While there was no evidence of what the appellant hoped to gain from her involvement in the matter, there seems little doubt that a financial motive was the most likely one. 

42In determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the appellant, it is also necessary to consider the sentences imposed on her co-offenders. Those co-offenders were dealt with by Judge Sweeney in the District Court and ultimately on appeal by this Court in Pham and Tran v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 194. It is difficult to make a strict comparison between the sentences imposed on the co-offenders with that imposed on the appellant because the co-offenders faced sentence in respect of a number of other charges, many of which were of similar seriousness to the present charge and one of which (a charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of MDMA) was significantly more serious. 

43Tran received a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years for the offence with which the appellant was sentenced. The total sentence was one of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.

44Pham received a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years in relation to the commercial supply of heroin and a total sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10.5 years was imposed.

45The difficulty in comparing these sentences arises because Judge Sweeney was constrained by principles of totality and made adjustments to the various individual sentences imposed. However, In Postiglione v The Queen (supra) Dawson and Gaudron JJ said (at 301-302):
""Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.""

46In Green and Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 French CJ, Crennan and Kieffel JJ said at [30]:
""The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application."" 

47Thus it is necessary to consider the sentences imposed on Pham and Lam taking into account the different circumstances objectively and subjectively and remaining alive to the operation of the totality principle on the individual sentences imposed. In so far as comparison is capable of being made, I take into account the sentences imposed on the co-offenders in coming to a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the appellant. In my view the appellant should receive a sentence significantly less severe than the total sentences imposed on each of the co-offenders and an individual sentence which is about the same as the sentence imposed on the co-offenders for the common count. In making the comparison, account has to be taken of the fact that the co-offenders' sentences were structured to take into account the partial cumulation of the several individual sentences imposed at the same time. 

48Taking into account all of the above matters, the principles and purposes of sentencing at common law and under s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and noting the fundamental nature of the error involved in the approach taken by the sentencing Judge, I am satisfied that a different, less severe sentence is warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

49I am also satisfied that there should be a slight adjustment between the proportion of the non-parole period to the total sentence: see s 44(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). There are special circumstances in the appellant's case including the fact that this is the first time that she has been sentenced to imprisonment, the early period of separation from her family and the evidence of the steps that she has taken in terms of rehabilitation since she was incarcerated. There is a strong community interest in the appellant receiving a longer than usual period of parole in order to continue the rehabilitation steps that she has taken. I have come to a different conclusion to the sentencing Judge in relation to this issue but this is explicable on the basis of the evidence that is available to me which was not available to Judge Ainslie-Wallace. 

50The sentence that I propose is one of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. The sentence will commence on 27 November 2007. 

51I propose the following orders:
(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court.

(3)In lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 27 November 2007 and expiring of 26 November 2015. There will be a balance of terms of four years commencing 27 November 2015 and expiring on 26 November 2019. 

(4)The appellant will become eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2764530,R v Higgins; R v Higgins [2014] NSWDC 356,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Higgins, I normally tell people in advance what sentence is to be imposed. I am going to tell you what sentence I am imposing for you. I am going to explain how the sentences are made up, but I have to give my reasons which will need to be detailed because, ultimately, the Parole Authority will read my judgment. Other people will read my judgment too. Each party has its rights of appeal and all those sorts of things, but it's important that I set out the reasoning behind my sentencing of you, which is not an easy exercise. It's quite a difficult exercise.
	
	
	I propose to sentence you to a total of five years and 10 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years, which will effectively date from 1 September 2013. It is partly concurrent with your balance of parole. Notwithstanding the Crown's cover sheet, when I checked the custody records, your balance of parole that you were required to serve because you were bail refused for these matters, was seven months 28 days. That started from 4 May 2013; the date that you were arrested, and it expired, according to the custody record, on 31 December last year.
	
	
	What I am proposing to do is sentence you to two years three months for the breaking, entering and stealing on 29 April. That is where you broke into the house up in the outskirts of Sydney. I am fixing a non-parole period for that matter of one year. The starting point of that sentence is three years.
	
	
	I am going to then fix the sentences for the other offences at Narrandera cumulative upon that non-parole period. For the break and enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation, that is where you held Mrs McDermott captive, so to speak; although you and she did go around cleaning up the house at various points, the starting point of that sentence is six years' imprisonment. I am fixing a non-parole period of two years for that sentence, and I am giving you a balance of sentence of two years six months.
	
	
	For the assault upon her, I am sentencing you to nine months' imprisonment, and for the detain with intent to obtain advantage from a starting point of three years six months, I give you a discount of 25% and I am sentencing you to two years seven months, again with a non-parole period of two years. Those three offences are so intimately bound up with one another that I'm making all those sentences concurrent with one another. You will be eligible for release to parole on 31 August 2016.
	
	
	Your counsel will write all this out for you, and I will be repeating these orders. You will have to stand up when I make the orders when I have finished going through my reasons.
	
	
	Jacob Higgins appears today for sentence in relation to four offences; three offences committed at the one time, that is on 11 April 2013 at Narrandera, and the fourth offence being committed at Westmead on 29 April 2013. The three offences committed at Narrandera were firstly, an offence of breaking and entering the dwelling house of Helen McDermott, which was situated at 33 Charles Street, Narrandera; and in that dwelling house stealing one iPad, the property of Mrs McDermott in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he did deprive Helen McDermott of her liberty. This is an offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty years' imprisonment and has a standard non-parole of five years' imprisonment.
	
	
	The second charge is one of assault committed on 11 April 2013 at Narrandera in the State of New South Wales. That carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and the third charge is a charge alleging that you, on 11 April 2013, at Narrandera in the State of New South Wales did, without consent, detain Helen McDermott with the intention of obtaining an advantage; namely not allowing her to contact the police. That carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years' imprisonment.
	
	
	The fourth charge is an offence for which you pleaded guilty at the Local Court and were committed for sentence of breaking, entering and stealing at Westmead at a property at 18 Wentworth Street, Westmead; and stealing one iPad and approximately $400 odd in cash, the property of Eric Warta.
	
	
	The starting point of those sentences will be as I have calculated, but in relation to the matters on the indictment, the discount is 20%.
	
	
	In respect of the three matters at Narrandera, the accused was arraigned in relation to those matters on indictment in this jurisdiction, having been committed for trial on 24 April 2014. I will return to the issue of the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty, but I agree with the submission put that the discount in this matter for reasons set out in the submissions should be 20%. The discount for the committal for sentence matter should be 25% to represent the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson v Houlton.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested in relation to the matters at Narrandera on 4 May 2013, when he attended the Narrandera Police Station. He has been in custody since that date. Whilst in custody, serving the balance of parole and awaiting sentence in relation to the Narrandera matters, he was interviewed, or at least arrested and charged, in relation to the Westmead matter on 13 August 2013.
	
	
	As I have earlier indicated in outlining the foreshadowed sentences to the prisoner, the prisoner was subject to parole at the time of the commission of all the offences. His parole had in fact been revoked by the Parole Authority before his arrest on 4 May 2013, he having not complied with the conditions of parole in reporting to Community Corrections as required. The balance of parole fixed by the Parole Authority was seven months 28 days. That began to run from 4 May 2013 and expired on 31 December 2013.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner for the various offences with which I am concerned, there are a number of issues that affect the structure of the sentences and the commencement date of the effective sentence imposed.
	
	
	I have concluded in the context of Simpson J's observations in the 2006 decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal of Callaghan, bearing in mind, of course, that I am required to take into account the breach of conditional liberty as an aggravating factor, to avoid double dipping so to speak, and noting of course the chronology of relevant events, that the sentences that I impose should effectively commence from 1 September 2013; that is partway through the balance of parole to be served by the prisoner, or that has been served by the prisoner.
	
	
	The structure of the sentences will involve accumulation, or at least partial accumulation, upon that balance of parole, and of course, there will be some accumulation in sentencing the prisoner for the Narrandera offences upon the sentence to be imposed in relation to the Westmead offence.
	
	
	These various accumulations of themselves give rise to special circumstances warranting an adjustment of the relationship of the effective non-parole period imposed with the balance of parole. There are other matters to be taken into account in relation to special circumstances which I will deal with shortly.
	
	
	The facts in relation to the offences committed at Narrandera are set out in a statement of facts which is largely undisputed, as I understand it, although the document is not put forward to the Court as ""Agreed statement of facts"", although I was provided with a copy with a number of signatures on it and I heard no submission to contradict what asserted within the facts.
	
	
	The victim, Mrs McDermott, is a 68 year old retired lady, who as I understand it, is a widow and lives alone in an address in Charles Street, Narrandera. She knows the prisoner, and appears to know him well; the prisoner was a friend of her son, Wayne. She attended the residence of her son at a time when the prisoner was there, and other people, as I understand it; and it would appear that while she was in the house, her handbag went missing and she went off to the police to report it. She spent some time trying to find her handbag, ultimately returning to her own residence.
	
	
	She went to bed where she lived alone in her home. She tried to sleep; she could not. She went back to her son's residence about 1.30am and she noticed that her son had her handbag. He did not give her any information as to how it came into his possession; it seems as though, frankly, that either her son was playing some game with her or had himself taken the handbag or someone close to him had taken the handbag. In any event, these matters are not matters for which the prisoner is responsible.
	
	
	She remained at her son's residence for a period of time. She fell asleep on a couch and eventually left the residence after other people had left, including her son. She walked towards her home shortly after 2am and the prisoner walked up to her. She offered him a lift home, but he declined that. She last noticed the prisoner walking away from her residence.
	
	
	For reasons that are not explained in the facts, the victim then got in her motor vehicle at her home and drove to another residence in Narrandera, to where her son was at that time. She mentioned the meeting of the offender near her home and said she was frightened. She went to her car, waiting for her son to accompany her, but he would appear to have, as he had throughout the evening, shown little regard for her convenience or concerns, and eventually she drove home by herself at 4am.
	
	
	When she arrived back at her home, she noticed there was disturbance in cupboards and drawers and when she was standing in the doorway of her bedroom, the prisoner grabbed her around the neck in a form of headlock. She felt immediate pain to her throat and neck. She was told by the prisoner to calm down before he would let her go.
	
	
	He then let her go, and although he had tried to disguise himself with his clothing, wearing a type of over garment called a hoodie, she could see him or recognise him from under that purported disguise. In fact, she said to him, ""What on earth do you want, Jacob"", and the prisoner said, ""Where's your money"".
	
	
	She told him she did not have any money, because he knew that her bag had been stolen and he claimed ""No, you've got a lot of money; you have it hidden somewhere"". Part of the background material available or history available from the psychological report points to the fact that the prisoner had a belief, a fixation in fact, that the victim did have a quantity of money at the house and that was one of the reasons he broke into the house.
	
	
	He did not break into the house, I hasten to say, in order to detain the victim, which I bear in mind. In fact, it would appear as though he broke into the house when he believed the victim was away from the premises and had been searching through the house for what he thought was the money when the victim returned and disturbed him. The facts state:
	


""The victim made the offender help her clean up the mess in the main bedroom. She tried to stall the accused, hoping that (her son) would come.""


	
	The victim saw other disturbance around the premises and the facts state at various points, she was cleaning up and the prisoner was sitting nearby her; one on occasion on the bed in a spare room. The victim saw the prisoner handling her iPad. She took it off him at one stage without any resistance from him, and placed it under a blanket in her bed and at various times, she saw him in possession of items that belonged to her and persuaded him to return those items to her.
	
	
	Ultimately, she noticed the iPad was missing. At various times, things were being picked up by her and the prisoner sat by. The prisoner at one point knocked over a plastic tub that contained a number of beads that she collected. The prisoner sat on the bed near her as she placed the beads back in a plastic tub. The facts state that she was fearful of what the prisoner might do to her. She tried using her mobile phone to call her son but the prisoner made her show the phone to him to see who she was ringing.
	
	
	It was starting to get light and she went to the front door and then endeavoured to try to get out of the residence. The prisoner grabbed her from behind, again in a headlock, and dragged her back into the hall and then let her go. She did not try to escape anymore. Eventually, she said, bearing in mind she had fears for her safety, not unreasonably, ""Just take what you want and leave me alone and just go"".
	
	
	To calm herself down, and perhaps calm down the prisoner, although there is no suggestion he was agitated or threatening her directly with words or other actions, she went into a room and started playing her piano. Ultimately, when she stopped playing the piano, she found the prisoner had left the premises without further ado.
	
	
	The prisoner apparently was in her home for about two and a quarter hours. The offence in the context of the detention of a person for advantage is a somewhat bizarre offence. I do accept, of course, the victim was fearful for her safety. The prisoner was an uninvited intruder. He was obviously seeking to take her property from her. He had grabbed her in a headlock on two occasions, but at the same time, he had also complied with the requests she had made in relation to his behaviour. In fact, as I said earlier, at one stage helped her clean up part of the house that he had rearranged in searching for the money in her absence.
	
	
	The prisoner was ultimately arrested on a warrant on 4 May. The victim's impact statement I have read. She ruminates over the experience. I am mindful of the fact that she knew the prisoner. In some instances, being attacked in this way, or being held in this way by a stranger may be far more disconcerting. On the other hand, it is little comfort for her knowing the perpetrator.
	
	
	She says in her statement that she had enjoyed her life at this point, being alone and was not afraid of being alone. She had been a widow for six years at that time and had grown used to living in the house by herself but this event had unnerved her. She made the very important point in her victim impact statement, ""Our homes are supposedly our safe havens, but I feel that my safety and security have been taken away from me"".
	
	
	She has feelings of fear, anger and disgust. Certainly she says the events have affected her adversely and this is clearly to be understood. It is something of a shame that the prisoner, when he was in the house, having been obviously disturbed by the victim, knowing the victim, being a friend of her son, did not have the good grace and the common sense to leave her alone and abandon the premises when he had an early opportunity to do so. He might ruminate upon how he would feel if his mother was treated the same way.
	
	
	The second offence the prisoner committed seems to have occurred with the prisoner effectively on the run, in breach of his parole. He went to a domestic premises in Westmead. He gained entry through a window by removing a flyscreen when the owner of the premises was absent.
	
	
	A latent fingerprint that matched his fingerprint was found on the flyscreen and his identity was easily secured by the investigating police. The prisoner took $422 in Australian currency and an iPad from inside the house. As I said, he was arrested in relation to that matter whilst in custody serving the balance of parole.
	
	
	The prisoner was born in February 1989. He is now 25 years of age. He was 24 years of age when these offences were committed. He has a very, very extensive history of offending as a young person, from the age of 14 onwards, with many appearances in Children's Courts in Wagga and Narrandera, and occasionally elsewhere for a range of offences of breaking, entering and stealing, offences of some violence, street offences, damaging property and the like.
	
	
	I do not propose to go through the detail of his Children's Court appearances. He has a finding of guilt for escape from police custody, it would appear at the age of 16, and has convictions for assaulting police officers in the execution of their duties. His Children's Court record runs for almost 33 pages of the 34 pages of the criminal history.
	
	
	As an adult, he was convicted of affray at the Wagga Wagga Local Court on 14 April 2009 and was sentenced to twenty months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months; that sentence being backdated to 2008, and was also convicted of common assault and sentenced to six months' imprisonment.
	
	
	On release to parole, he was convicted again at the Wagga Wagga District Court on 8 February 2010 in relation to an offence of assault with intent to resist or prevent apprehension, for which he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, and aggravated breaking and entering and commit a serious indictable offence, knowing people were in the premises, for which he received a sentence of three years nine months, commencing on 18 February 2010, with a non-parole period of 21 months.
	
	
	I note from the custody record that the earlier parole that he was granted for the sentences imposed in 2009 was revoked, as was the parole that he was subject to when he committed the offences with which I am concerned. I have not deliberately skimmed over his extensive history as a juvenile. I have given some flavour of it but the circumstances of his offending from a very early age very much a reflection of aspects of his background and his disadvantage which I will refer to shortly.
	
	
	I have two reports to assist me in providing some context for the current offending, the circumstances of his parole, supervision and other relevant matters. One is a report from the Family and Community Services Ageing, Disability and Home Care division. This sets out a little bit of background of the prisoner, which I will deal with in greater detail when I deal with the psychological report. It notes a history of neglect and abuse as a child.
	
	
	The prisoner was removed from his parents' care, according to the Department's records, on 15 December 1994 and he had multiple foster placements and other placements over the next four or five years. He was, in fact, given twenty different placements and had some considerable disconnection from his siblings and his parents, being one of five children.
	
	
	It would appear that when he was first released to parole as an adult in 2009, he was placed in the care of the Community Justice Program. He presented various complex challenges notwithstanding his youth, but he returned to custody within a month of his release to parole and little could be done to assist him.
	
	
	When he was released from custody on parole before committing the current offences, he was given various support programs including what was called a Drop In Support (DIS) package, operated by Life Without Barriers. This provided up to thirty-five hours of support and the prisoner was eager to engage with that service. But in March 2013 he failed to report for a mandatory drug test and subsequently his parole was revoked and he disengaged with the Life Without Barriers program.
	
	
	It is clear, having regard to the timing of the offences committed at Narrandera, that the prisoner had, shortly after his release to parole, begun using again prohibited drugs and this was one of the contributing factors to his offending. The report notes that the prisoner has largely spent his adult life incarcerated and it states that he ""lacks peer networks outside of gaol"". He has obviously developed many friendships with people in custody; and although he has told the staff of the Department that he would cease these relationships when he returned to the community, it is problematic as to whether that has been done.
	
	
	He has been in a relationship with a young woman, as I would understand it, for four or five years and has a two or three year old son from that relationship. He says this is a positive influence on his life, I note these positive influences, which existed when he was last released to parole, did not prevent him offending last year.
	
	
	He was initially paroled to reside in Wagga, but then approval was given for him to return to Narrandera. He also has indicated to the Family and Community Services department that he ""struggles with life management skills"". He obviously has difficulty dealing with being at large.
	
	
	He has certain skills. He was regarded, for example, as a ""pleasant and suitable tenant"" in the accommodation that was provided to him. He is able to communicate with staff and has no difficulty verbalising what he needs as far as assistance is concerned, but does not appear to have been able to take up the assistance that was available to him.
	
	
	The report notes that the prisoner requires ""specialist services to address his complex needs"" and the Community Justice Program is still dedicated to delivering some assistance to him in the future with accommodation. Some of the matters they identify as requiring particular assistance include his general functioning skills, his general and mental health, managing his finances, developing family relationships, developing education and employment opportunities, having pro social recreation and social contacts, cultural engagement and accessing appropriate services.
	
	
	This brings me to the psychological report, from which most of the history of the prisoner I have derived, based to a large extent on the account given by the prisoner, but confirmed, as I have foreshadowed in the material in the Family and Community Services report.
	
	
	The report from Delphine Bostock of Duffy Robilliard is an excellent report. It is quite thorough for a report of its type and undertakes a number of the psychometric tests that one would expect a psychologist to undertake. Many of the psychological reports we are receiving nowadays are merely unquestioning pre-sentence reports that do not even ‘stoop’ to undertake the tasks that the psychologist is supposedly skilled to undertake.
	
	
	It provides a history of the prisoner growing up in an environment of alcohol abuse and reported drug injection by the prisoner's father. It notes the extended period of care by the Department. Finally the prisoner being, as a small child, moved into foster care by the age of nine, being separated from his siblings, as I said. He was diagnosed with ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, when he was seven years of age; not assisted, one would think, by the lack of stability in his home life.
	
	
	I have mentioned the number of placements he had over a period of time; one particular family when he was about eleven or twelve actually provided some positive support and displayed some interest in him. According to the history given the psychologist, they bought him a bike and a dog, they enrolled him in school, they arranged for him to undergo psychological testing in Melbourne.
	
	
	Unfortunately, or fortunately, as the case may be, he ended up coming back to his hometown to play football. He met members of his extended family. He became homesick and ultimately, after repeated running away, he was returned to live with extended family members.
	
	
	Notwithstanding all of this, he claims a good relationship with his parents. His mother earlier in the proceedings, when the evidence and the submissions were made, was a vociferous contributor to the proceedings without displaying any real understanding of the facts upon which her son was being sentenced and the character of the charges that he was facing.
	
	
	He has had very little education and whatever education he has had has been considerably interrupted by foster placement, lack of interest in him by those who were supposed to care for him and, on some occasions, unwillingness of education authorities to take responsibility for him.
	
	
	He freely concedes supporting himself over many years through criminal activity and living off welfare payments and the like; and he has had little work experience. Although in custody he has completed a number of courses including, he says, a course in horticulture, a bricklaying course, even a barber's course; and he enjoys doing hands on work.
	
	
	I have mentioned his current relationship, but that has been interrupted by various terms of imprisonment and also by his continuing drug use. I have mentioned the son that he cares for, but has had spent little time with due to his own criminal activity. His criminal history has largely developed, at least in recent years, to support drug dependency and often, he has offended under the influence of illicit drugs, which is no consolation for his victims or the community.
	
	
	He did say that he thought he had some stability on his latest release but he could not avoid offending. He described to the psychologist that conditions were good for him at the time; he had lined up a job interview, he was trying to get his driver's licence, which is of course a very important thing for a person to have in order to obtain employment, but he had difficulty, he said, adopting to outside life, and he felt, perhaps not using his words, ""institutionalised"".
	
	
	This appears to be self evident from his regular offending and return to custody notwithstanding the support of his partner and his love of his son. He acknowledged the crimes involving Mrs McDermott were to obtain money to buy methylamphetamine. I have noted the fact that he was fixated with the belief that she had money in her home, which she did not have. To the psychologist he expressed some insight into his offending and regret for his conduct.
	
	
	The results of the various tests undertaken note that his symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were in the mild range. His composite IQ score was in the thirteenth percentile for a person of his age and would be considered below average for persons of his age. Although he was below average in verbal tests, in non-verbal tests he was within the average range; and this reflected his lack of or poor educational achievement.
	
	
	Although the psychologist suggested that his intelligence quotient was within the borderline range of intellectual functioning, there was nothing in the report, nor in the histories given by the prisoner or the facts of the case, to suggest a direct relationship between intellectual functioning and the offending and no suggestion was made there was such a connection in the submissions.
	
	
	The psychologist said that he suffered, self evidently, from a substance dependence disorder; and he had a very high probability of relapse. His profile on testing suggested that he had little insight into the problems of drug use and he had some defensiveness talking about it. His needs were described as ""complex"" as they had been by the Department of Family and Community Services and his needs extended ""beyond recovery from substance dependence"".
	
	
	The testing revealed a very high risk of general recidivism. He scored in the 94th percentile of what was described as the Self Appraisal Questionnaire, a reliable and valid self report measure designed to assess the risk of general and violent recidivism in adult male offenders.
	
	
	The key areas of factors contributing to his recidivism included drug and alcohol use, his criminal history, or criminal experience as it might be otherwise described, and antisocial associates, although his associates had nothing to do with the commission of these offences. I know nothing, of course, of Mrs McDermott's son and his relationship with the prisoner, but it does not appear that her son in any way contributed to this offending.
	
	
	The psychologist noted that his offending was, at least in part, related to his childhood problems and that he very much would benefit from individual counselling to address these issues, as well as dealing with the negative effects of crime and the positive effects of living crime free.
	
	
	His lack of education and his background of limited employment was a limitation for obtaining employment. His limited insight into his drug dependency made him ill equipped to make decisions and solve problems. His borderline intellectual functioning did complicate his capacity to live a pro social life.
	
	
	He had, in the view of the psychologist, severe impairment in several areas of development, what are described as reciprocal social interaction skills, communication skills and other activities. His ADHD also contributes to a range of difficulties for him to organise his life, to meet commitments, undertake education, develop relationships and maintain employment.
	
	
	He has a history of self harm. He had something of a collapse in custody apparently in 2010. He requires careful monitoring in custody. He needs, in the view of the psychologist, psychiatric and psychotherapeutic assistance. He also needs to undertake programs to address, obviously, his significant drug dependence and needs significant support in the community to assist him in these ways.
	
	
	It is in the context of this report and the report of the Family and Community Services I have concluded in addition to the effective accumulation of sentences there are reasons that exist for a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and a substantial reduction of the relationship of the ultimate non-parole period fixed in respect of two of the Narrandera offences to permit an extended period of supervision, notwithstanding his previous failures on parole.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence about his time in custody throughout his adult life. He says he was in protection at Junee Gaol but, as I understood his evidence, one of the reasons he is there is because Junee Gaol is a protection gaol, and this gives him greater access to his family. He did not describe to me any particular threat to his person or any specific matter arising from his offences which warranted particular protection in custody.
	
	
	He said that he had had limited access to courses at Junee. He was interested in undertaking courses, but on occasions, he has not been able to undertake what he would like to achieve. He was a witness who had difficulty articulating his thoughts. When asked when released to parole whether the Court could have confidence in him not offending, he said, as I noted it, ""I don't know, my son"", being a reference, I take it, to his son. If he was saying that his son was an incentive for him not to offend, then it was not a powerful incentive at the time of the commission of these offences, given the background I have outlined.
	
	
	He conceded that he did not have a long term plan. He really did not seem to know what he was going to do on his release from gaol, other than assert that he was going to try and not use amphetamines, and he said that he did not want his son to become a drug user.
	
	
	If he was concerned about the welfare of his son and his future, he should understand, of course, the self evident fact that he will set an example for his son. There is a very high probability that if he wants to pursue a life of crime, in due course, his son will follow that course, no matter what the best endeavours of the boy's mother may be.
	
	
	Of course, the longer he stays in custody through his adult life, the more problematic will be the future of his son. He said in evidence that he planned to return to Narrandera, but if not allowed to live there, he would live in Wagga. Whether he should reside at Narrandera or not will be a matter for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	He said he did not know why he did what he did to Mrs McDermott. He knew it was wrong, but he could not in any way explain why he subjected her to detention for the period of time that he did. In submission, his counsel noted the breach of conditional liberty as an aggravating factor, which is self evidently so.
	
	
	The plea of guilty was entered after committal for trial, but before a trial date was fixed; and as I have earlier indicated, I am prepared to give him a discount of 20% for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty for the matters upon which he was arraigned on indictment. It was submitted there should be some partial accumulation upon the balance of parole and I have agreed with that submission.
	
	
	In dealing with the character of this aggravated breaking and entering and stealing matter, being an offence under s 112(2), I was taken to the decision of John Hunter v R [2011] NSWCCA 141, and particularly the judgment of Adams J at [52]. His Honour was discussing in that matter characteristics of offences that might fall within the middle range of objective seriousness, where the breaking, entering and stealing offence carried a circumstance of aggravation of either being in company or knowing people to be inside the premises.
	
	
	I have noted what his Honour said (at [52]), referring to characteristics that might put an offence within the middle range of objective seriousness, there being some significant degree of planning, property of substantial or significant value being stolen, persons present in the premises frightened by the incursion and some significant damage occasioned to the premises.
	
	
	In that particular matter, it was held that a conclusion that the offence was in the middle range of objective seriousness was not an appropriate conclusion. Some of the matters referred to by Adams J, of course, picked up characteristics of breaking, entering and stealing matters that were discussed in the guideline judgment of Ponfield from 1999, particularly the judgment of Grove J. Many of the observations of Grove J about aggravating and mitigating factors in fact found their way into the legislation subsequently enacted, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that came into law in 2001, and particularly the relevant provisions in that regard in s 21A of the Act.
	
	
	Learned counsel for the prisoner noted the matters identified by Grove J and suggested that this offence might, in the context of his Honour's assessment of the matter, fall beneath the middle range of objective seriousness. The difficulty with that submission is whilst there was not an extensive planning in relation to this matter, it is quite clear that the prisoner was interrupted by the victim near her house, contemplating at that early stage entering her house in the belief that she had money in her house, which in fact she did not have.
	
	
	I have already dealt with the circumstances in which he clearly was interrupted, not expecting her to be there, which is a matter I take into account. But what is missing in the analysis of learned counsel for the prisoner was the importance of the particular aggravating feature pleaded in assessing where an offence may arise in the middle range or not, below or above, of objective seriousness, having regard to that aggravating feature.
	
	
	The pleaded aggravating feature in this matter was a very substantial matter to consider indeed. This is not a matter of simply breaking into premises in company with someone else because you need two people to carry a television out of the premises. This is not a case of breaking into premises knowing somebody is in the house, intent however only on stealing property.
	
	
	Although he did not know that he would be interrupted, it might have been reasonably expected by him that Mrs McDermott would return home. When he was aware of her being in the premises he did detain her for an extended period of time. So far as the consideration of this matter falling within a range of objective seriousness, I have concluded that it does fall within the middle range of objective seriousness of an offence contrary to s 112(2), particularly by regard to the character and nature of the circumstance of aggravation that is pleaded.
	
	
	I appreciate the significance of aggravating features that are pleaded will depend upon the intensity of the particular aggravation on the facts of the case and other features of the offending, but the matters of which Adams J was referring to very much were more concerned with the typical house breaking case which is different from this particular matter, although in fairness to the prisoner, this offence started out as ""a typical house breaking"" offence.
	
	
	I was taken to a number of decisions that reflect upon the offences of detention for advantage and the character of that offending, and I have taken those into account. There is R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183, and particularly the observations of Howie J at para [32]. At the present I am not just only dealing with the pleaded offence of unlawful detention but also the pleading of aggravation in relation to the offence contrary to s 112(2).
	
	
	He said that there are a number of factors that may be relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offence involving this character of conduct, including the period of detention, the circumstances of the detention, the identity of the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. The last factor, the nature of the advantage the offender sought to obtain, is not necessarily conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence. He went on to say:
	


""I am not persuaded that before an offence can come within the most serious range of an offence falling within the scope of the section, the detention must be for the purposes of ransom.""


	
	There is another decision of Allen [2010] NSWCCA 47. Of course, this was a much more serious case, although the detention was somewhat considerably shorter than the detention here, where a man abducted a child for the purposes of sexually assaulting the child. I note particularly the observations of her Honour at [20]-[22]. I note in that matter that her Honour concluded, in determining the seriousness of the detention offence, that bearing in mind that the detention was solely for the purposes of committing the other offences and no longer than required, the offence was less serious than been assessed by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The other judgment is R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130, and particularly the analysis of Johnson J which appears at [48] through to [55]. As I said, those authorities and their discussion of the character of unlawful detention for advantage very much are concerned with the principle offence and, of course, the third count on the indictment.
	
	
	It was submitted that the criminal history of the prisoner was not a circumstance of aggravation under s 21A(2), bearing in mind most of his breaking, entering and stealing offences were committed when a juvenile and he was still relatively young. I have ultimately concluded that whilst his criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency, of course, that must be so, it is not an aggravating factor in this matter.
	
	
	It was conceded, as I said earlier, there was no causal connection between his psychological condition and the offending. The disadvantages of his upbringing were referred to and I will deal with some aspects of that in a moment. I was urged not to fix a “crushing” sentence; the prisoner was still suitable for a consideration of a finding of “special circumstances” and I have already dealt with that matter with the earlier finding I have made.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that the prisoner had committed the offences with which I am concerned barely four months since being released on custody. It noted the victim was vulnerable because of her age and the fact that she was alone. The prisoner was in breach of conditional liberty, and of course the detention offences were serious offences, the prisoner having no insight into his conduct, it was submitted. These were matters that required special consideration of general and specific deterrence, particularly in relation to the Narrandera matters.
	
	
	In assessing all these matters, one of the factors that needs to be taken into account is the relevance of the prisoner's obvious deprivations as a child, through no fault of his, the dysfunctional character of his upbringing and the context of many other difficulties, which have no doubt contributed to his long history of offending behaviour, his lack of pro social attitudes, his drug abuse, dependency and ultimately what appears to be self evident, institutionalisation.
	
	
	Courts have long been concerned with the sentencing of young Aboriginal people for serious crimes in circumstances where the upbringing and relevant social dynamics are at least contextual issues in the sentencing exercise. In the judgment of Wood J of Fernando in 1992, these matters were taken into account. There, of course, the “Fernando principles” as they have been described, developed by his Honour, were more directly concerned with eruptions of violence within the Aboriginal community, fuelled by alcohol and drug abuse, contributed to by significant historical, social and economic dysfunction.
	
	
	Those general principles as enunciated by his Honour, in part, of course, are not without relevance here. But there is nothing in the facts of the matter to suggest the prisoner's offending in relation to Mrs McDermott had any direct connection with the social economic dynamics of the Aboriginal community. But there was, in my view, a considerable indirect connection.
	
	
	The issue of the Aboriginality of an offender and its relevance to the sentencing exercise has been discussed extensively recently by the High Court in two decisions, Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 and Munda, an appeal from Western Australia ([2013] HCA 38). In Bugmy, where the appellant was charged with an offence carrying the standard non-parole period, which of course is only applicable in New South Wales law, the High Court said, in line with the decision of Muldrock [2011] 244 CLR 120 that:
	


""While the objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders, it is only concerned with the nature of the offending. The moral culpability of an offender may be diminished in circumstances where, as in Bugmy, the prisoner had been raised in a community surrounded by drug abuse and violence. The circumstance that the offender was raised in these conditions 'may mitigate the sentence because his moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way' [40].""


	
	The same view was expressed in Munda; a very serious case of domestic violence leading to death, with the Court noting the consideration of this matter must be balanced with the seriousness of the offender's offending. A number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal since Muldrock have discussed the importance of moral culpability in sentencing, such as McLaren [2012] NSWCCA 284, at [28]-[29].
	
	
	A recent Information Bulletin from the Judicial Commission's Research Director said that these observations about ‘moral culpability’ have been accommodated in s 54B(2) of the amended Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act, the amendments to Pt 4 Div 1A coming into effect in October last year.
	
	
	Section 54A(2) of the Act now provides that for the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents a non-parole period that takes into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence and whether it is in the middle range of seriousness.
	
	
	However, s 54B(2) provides - reflecting the principles laid down by the High Court in Muldrock, that the standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.
	
	
	The standard non-parole period is just one of the many matters that a Court has to take into account. It is not a starting point for any consideration of the appropriate non-parole period or sentence to be imposed, and of course, in that regard, the legislation and the earlier decision of the High Court note there are many other matters for the Court to take into account, including, as I said, the issue of the moral culpability of the offender.
	
	
	There are some other observations in Bugmy and Munda that also need to be taken into account. The majority in Bugmy said at [41]:
	


""Aboriginal Australians as a group are subject to social and economic disadvantage measured across a range of indices, but to recognise this is to say nothing about a particular offender. In any case in which it is sought to rely on an offender's background of deprivation in mitigation of sentence, it is necessary to point to material tending to establish that background.""


	
	In Munda, the majority of the Court said (at [51] and following):
	


""In R v Fuller-Cust [2006] 6VR 396, Eames JA observed that, in the application of the principle stated by Brennan J in Neil v The Queen, regard to an offender's Aboriginality serves to ensure that a factor relevant to sentencing which arises from the offender's Aboriginality is not 'overlooked by a simplistic assumption that equal treatment of offenders means that differences in their individual circumstances related to their race should be ignored'. Moreover, the personal disadvantages affecting an individual offender may be, because of the circumstances in which they were engendered, so deep and so broad that they serve to shed light on matters such as, for example, an offender's recidivism.""


	
	Such is the case here. The principles that emerge in decisions such as Bugmy and Munda, Fernando, Fuller-Cust and the like continue to have currency, even if there be continual offending. The Court of Criminal Appeal itself has said on a number of occasions that there is not a sunset clause in relation to relevant considerations in this respect, as was ultimately found in Bugmy v The Queen.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner, I have naturally had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and seek to balance the competing purposes of sentencing, noting obviously the continual need for some element of general and personal deterrence, but also other matters that have to be taken into account, including the promotion of the rehabilitation of the offender.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A, in respect of the Narrandera offences, clearly an aggravating factor is that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. I accept that the victim was a vulnerable victim, although it is to be fairly said, without diminishing the conduct of the prisoner, that such force the prisoner used was for limited periods of time and on a number of occasions during the period of the detention, the prisoner was compliant with the direction or the requests of the victim. The most important aggravating factor is, of course, the offence was committed whilst on conditional liberty.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors in respect of all the offences, I have concluded ultimately that the offences were not planned offences, as that expression is understood, certainly not part of organised criminal activity. There is very little else that can be identified, of course. I cannot say the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend, or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. He very much will be a work in progress for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	He has expressed remorse, and I am prepared to accept as a mitigating factor his expression of remorse in the manner that he did, taking responsibility for his actions and acknowledging the harm particularly to Mrs McDermott. The plea of guilty, of course, is a mitigating factor, but for that he receives the discrete discount to which I have referred.
	
	
	I earlier, in my haste, foreshadowed penalties to be imposed upon the prisoner by reference to the Narrandera offences which, in effect, included a discount of 25%, when in fact I had calculated the discount of 20%. I will need to adjust the balance of sentences to be imposed to reflect that fact. Naturally, the starting point of the sentences remains the same.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 29 April 2013, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole for twelve months. That sentence will date from 1 September 2013. The balance of sentence is one year and three months. That will expire on 30 November 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of breaking, entering and stealing in circumstances of aggravation, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of two years; that will commence on 1 September 2014. The sentence will expire on 31 August 2016. The balance of sentence will be two years and ten months and that sentence will expire on 30 June 2019.
	
	
	In relation to the matter of common assault, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten months. That will date from 1 September 2014 and expire on 30 June 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of detaining with intent to obtain advantage, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non- parole period of two years. That will date from 1 September 2014, expire on 31 August 2016. I fix, in relation to that sentence, a balance of sentence of ten months, to expire on my calculation on 31 July 2017.
	
	
	In fixing the sentences, I have had regard to the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen [1998] 194 CLR 610, particularly the majority judgment at [45] and subsequent Court of Criminal Appeal decisions discussing the need to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence.
	
	
	I have determined that the sentence for the Narrandera offences should be accumulative upon the non-parole period fixed for the other breaking, entering and steal matter, but the sentences for the Narrandera matters should themselves be concurrent one with the other because of the overlap between the pleadings in counts 1 and 3 and the fact that I have taken into account the assault of the victim in the context of the circumstances of the detention, which is reflected in counts 1 and 3 of that indictment.
	
	
	In fixing the sentence for the breaking, entering and stealing matter, of course, I have noted the maximum penalty for that offence. I see the offence, so far as its objective seriousness, given the quantity of property taken, is at the lower end of the scale of offences of that type, with little planning and not a great deal of property stolen.
	
	
	I foreshadowed that the total sentence was five years and six months. It is actually five years and ten months. The error was on my part in the calculation of the discount for the Narrandera matters. The non-parole period, effectively, is three years' imprisonment.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release to parole, as I would calculate it, on 31 August 2016. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are returned to the community on parole.

		09 October 2015",2014-08-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764533,R v Firebrace (No 3) [2014] NSWDC 276,"Judgment


	
	I presided over the trial of Wesley Firebrace at Parramatta recently. Wesley Firebrace’s legal representatives issued subpoenas to Campbelltown Hospital and to the Campbelltown Mental Health Unit. The subpoenas required production of documents connected with the complainant in the proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Firebrace had been accused of raping the complainant. I should immediately add that yesterday the jury found him not guilty of that charge and I acquitted Mr Firebrace.
	
	
	Because the proceedings were sexual assault proceedings, the issue of the subpoenas and the production of documents raised issues of sexual assault communications privilege which is dealt with in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	During the course of the proceedings, specifically on 31 July, 1 August and 4 August 2014, I made rulings concerning the production of some of the documents which had been delivered to the Court in compliance with the subpoenas. In fact the subpoenas, according to the Criminal Procedure Act, ought not to have been issued by this Court without leave. I do not think leave was granted. It seems to be common ground that I can, and should in this case, grant that leave retrospectively and I do so.
	
	
	The real question concerned whether the documents should be made available to defence counsel who was representing Mr Firebrace. This was a controversial issue.
	
	
	The complainant was represented in this aspect of the proceedings by Mr A Harris who assisted me in determining the matters and relied upon submissions prepared by Mr George Breton. Counsel for Mr Firebrace was Ms K Stares who also filed written submissions and relied upon those.
	
	
	At this point it is relevant to observe that defence counsel in these kinds of applications do not yet have access to the documents. They may have a broad idea of the kinds of documents which may exist but they cannot address submissions to the individual documents because they do not have access to them. Accordingly the judge needs to determine the issue based upon the submissions made on behalf of the complainant who has access to the documents and broad-based submissions made on behalf of the accused, who does not have access to the documents.
	
	
	Ms M Knowles prosecuted the proceedings against Mr Firebrace on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions and she essentially had a watching brief so far as this aspect was concerned.
	
	
	I have been assisted, as I have said, by the submissions both of Mr Harris and Ms Stares. In addition to those, I have read and considered the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266; 84 NSWLR 172; 229 A Crim R 46, NAR v PPC1 [2013] NSWCCA 25; 224 A Crim R 535, R v Markarian [2012] NSWDC 197 (a judgment of his Honour Judge Berman SC) and R v Russell [2013] NSWDC 129 (a judgment of his Honour Judge Marien SC).
	
	
	I do not propose to recite the legislative scheme in detail, nor to refer to excerpts from the authorities. The purpose of these remarks is to provide my reasons for granting or refusing to grant the application for leave to access documents. I am obliged to do that in accordance with s 299D(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	I have been assisted in particular by the judgments of Judge Berman SC and Judge Marien SC each of whom was determining specific applications. Their Honours made very helpful observations about the applicability of these provisions in practice.
	
	
	I wish to express an opinion about a particular aspect of the legislation which was also touched upon by their Honours. The legislation creates what it calls “protected confidences”. A protected confidence “means a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence” (s 296(1) of the Act). A counselling communication is further explained by subs 4 of that section.
	
	
	The specific point which I wish to make some observations about is the meaning of the word “counsels”. Section 296(5) of the Act says -
	


“For the purposes of this section, a person counsels another person if:

(a) the person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and

(b) the person:


	
	listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or
	
	
	advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person, whether or not for fee or reward.”
	



	
	In introducing the Second Reading of the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Bill in the Legislative Assembly on 21 March 2002, the Attorney General said -
	


“The principal purpose of this bill is, therefore, to ensure that the sexual assault communications privilege is capable of protecting confidential communications made in connection with counselling provided by counsellors who lack formal training or qualifications in the diagnosis of psychiatric and/or psychological conditions and which takes the form of listening to the thoughts and feelings of the alleged sexual assault victim and providing verbal or other support, rather than providing expert advice.”


	
	Returning to the legislation itself, the definition of “counsels” in s 296(5) is quite wide. Nevertheless I do not regard it as inappropriate to resort to a dictionary definition of the verb “counsel”. This is because I want to consider the meanings of the words “therapy” and “treats” used in the definition. The Macquarie Dictionary (6th ed 2013, Macquarie Dictionary Publishers) defines the verb to “counsel” as “to give counsel to; advise” and “to give counsel or advice.” The noun “counsel” is relevantly defined as “advice; opinion or instruction given in directing the judgement or conduct of another.” I think this is relevant in approaching the definition of the meaning of “counsels” in subs (5). It is clear that the provision made in subs (5)(b)(i) is consistent with the dictionary meaning of “counsels”. I repeat it: the person “listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person”.
	
	
	What concerned his Honour Judge Berman SC was the breadth of the meaning of “counselling”. I can understand his Honour’s concern because s 296(5)(b) goes on to provide an alternative to the meaning of listening and giving verbal support or other support or encouragement to the other person; that alternative is that the person “advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person.”
	
	
	The word “advises” is clearly consistent with the dictionary meaning of “counsels”.
	
	
	The word “therapy” can have a broad meaning which the same dictionary defines as “the treatment of disease, disorder, defect, etc., as by some remedial or curative process”. An alternative definition is “psychotherapy” and it gives an example of a phrase to “be in therapy” as meaning “to be undergoing treatment by a psychotherapist.”
	
	
	It is difficult to see any such shade of meaning for the word “treats”. To my mind however, given the purpose of the legislation and the selection of the word “counsels” and its definition in s 296(5)(b)(i) - which is almost in all respects consistent with the dictionary definition of counsels - the word “treats” must be read in that context so that the treatment envisaged by that word would not include, to use his Honour Judge Berman SC’s example, the application of a bandage by a triage nurse in casualty. It means, in my opinion, treatment of the kind given by a person who is counselling another person. The word “therapy” itself is defined by reference to treatment. In my opinion, the word “treats” in the context in which it is used in this legislation means that the counselling person treats the other person in a way that a counsellor in the customary sense, for example a psychologist or a psychiatrist, would treat a patient. An obvious example would be the prescription of medication or the provision of referrals. In my opinion, the word “treats” must be given a meaning in accordance with its context. That, in my opinion, also accords with the purpose of the enactment.
	
	
	Having made those observations, I turn now to specific rulings. Strictly speaking, I am not obliged to give reasons for most of these matters because I formed the opinion that they were not protected confidences. MFI 8, MFI 12 and MFI 13 are all documents produced under the Mental Health Act 2007. MFI 8 is a document completed by a medical practitioner. It is clear, in my opinion, that the medical practitioner’s purpose in completing the document is to provide an opinion, as the form itself states, regarding the mental state of a detained person. It is clear, in my opinion, that the author of that document was not counselling that person in any relevant sense. Those observations apply to MFI 8 and MFI 13. The documents in MFI 12 comprise a series of documents completed by police officers, once again under the Mental Health Act. The purpose of the document is for the police officer to request an assessment of a person who may be mentally ill or mentally disturbed. The officer makes observations about the person concerned and hands them over to medical staff. It is clear in my opinion that none of the documents in MFI 12 contains a protected confidence because the authors do not counsel any person.
	
	
	The MFI 15 documents comprise a bundle generally described as “Ambulance Electronic Medical Record” I respectfully agree with Judge Marien SC in Russell where his Honour said at [32] -
	


“it cannot be said that a communication made to an ambulance officer is a communication made to another person who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered. It is not the commonly understood role of ambulance officers to counsel persons.”

I would require in a case such as this some evidence that the ambulance officers have “undertaken training or study” or have “experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm”. I expect it is likely that they have, but I would require some evidence of that. In addition, and in agreement with his Honour Judge Marien SC, I think it unlikely that an ambulance officer could be said to counsel their patient in the way which I have interpreted that word earlier in this judgment. Accordingly I did not regard the documents in MFI 15 as containing protected confidences.


	
	The documents in MFI 14 are all documents which are self-described as “mental health assessment”. They do record a history from the patient but it is obvious, in my opinion, that the role of the person to whom the communication is made is not to counsel the patient but to assess the patient. Therefore I do not regard any of the documents contained in MFI 14 as counselling communications and therefore not protected confidences.
	
	
	I expressed the opinion that the documents in MFI 17 were protected confidences. I did not grant access to those documents. I took into account s 299D(1) which provides that I “cannot grant an application for leave” unless I am satisfied, amongst other things, that “other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available”. I formed the opinion that other documents which had been produced under the subpoenas covered, in substance, the matters raised in MFI 17. For that reason I refused leave for access to those documents.
	
	
	Finally, MFI 11 comprised a series of reports. I expressed the opinion that they were not protected confidences. Looking more closely at those documents I am not sure that I was correct in that opinion. I think that some of the documents which have a heading “Nursing handover Mental Health” may well be protected confidences. I would be prepared to find that a mental health nurse is a person who has the relevant study or experience. Some other documents in MFI 11 comprise what appear to be emergency department triage notes. To my mind those documents are consistent with being an assessment or a report about the physical condition of the person in the emergency department. I am not convinced that the emergency nurse was necessarily counselling the patient in a relevant respect. Nevertheless I did grant access to those documents, rightly or wrongly.
	
	
	I granted access, from recollection, to another bundle of documents which I also marked for identification. They were produced, I think, by the Campbelltown Hospital. Ms Stares made extensive use of them in her cross-examination and tendered a redacted version of them. Those documents raised issues concerning the ingestion of alcohol and cannabis by the complainant. They also referred to previous behaviour by the complainant. I should say that Mr Firebrace defended the allegation, acknowledging that he had sex with her, but claiming that it was by consent. A cogent aspect of the prosecution case was that the complainant, after having sex with Mr Firebrace, cut her own arms and phoned triple-0 to report the incident to the police.
	
	
	The documents to which I gave access to Ms Stares were, I expect, protected confidences. But I formed the view that their probative value was substantial. That view was vindicated by the use which Ms Stares made of them relevantly and effectively in her case. There were no other documents which disclosed such material. I considered the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of such confidences and the protected confider from harm. But I formed the view that that public interest was substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence the contents of the documents. I took into account the important factors regarding the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the person from harm, which are listed in subs 299D(2). But I formed the view that the interests of Mr Firebrace in resisting a claim of sexual assault substantially outweighed those public interests. He was facing a charge of aggravated sexual assault. That carried a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment. As I said, the prosecution case contained cogent evidence about the behaviour of the complainant immediately after the sexual encounter. However the documents disclosed that her behaviour was not an isolated incident. I should also add that Mr Firebrace and the complainant had been drinking on that day and the documents disclosed behaviour associated on previous occasions with alcohol and cannabis use.
	
	
	They are the reasons for the rulings which I gave.

2764548,Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion [2014] NSWDC 126,"Judgment

The parties

1The plaintiff is a self-represented litigant who gives his occupation as ""beggar"" (Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion (Supreme Court of New South Wales, McCallum J, 2 December 2013) at [2]). After refusal of his long stay business visa by the Federal and High Courts in 2009, he became a ""rough-sleeper"" in Woolloomooloo, Sydney, outside the police station and across the road from the first defendant's premises.

2The first defendant (which is informally known as ""HopeStreet"", as one word) is a not-for-profit, faith-based organisation, managed by the Baptist Church and funded by donation, which has been in operation for over thirty years. Its mission is to ""bring justice, compassion and hope to people in need by working together with their individual, community and structural contexts"" (Exhibit 3, page 1). Its Community Development and Homeless Support programme helps homeless persons find housing and provides practical assistance such as food bags, swags and sleeping bags. Its employees liaise with police, Centrelink, Housing NSW and the Homeless Persons' Legal Service (Exhibit 3), a free legal service for homeless persons. 

3HopeStreet also provides gambling addiction counselling, and employment training programme (ETP) and a Women's Space, and partners a number of other not-for-profit organisations for the homeless (Exhibit 3, pp 9 - 10). Facilities it operates to provide social interaction for those to whom it offers help include an ""Op Shop"", the Back Shed Café and administration offices.

4The second defendant, a counsellor, became the Community Development Coordinator in 2011. Originally from Melbourne, he returned there to live in 2012. While in the first defendant's employ, he was accountable to the Operations Manager, Rod Ravenscroft (Exhibit 4). He is the author of the two matters complained of. 

5The second defendant, like the plaintiff, is not legally represented. He was served by the plaintiff with an earlier draft of the statement of claim (Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion, supra, at [6]). According to the Further Amended Statement of Claim at page 6, under the section ""Details About Defendants"", the plaintiff states that the second defendant ""[w]as served the Amended Statement of Claim by the Plaintiff on 25 September 2013"". He has not been served with any documents since, or notified of any court directions hearings in the Supreme or District Courts, and was not notified of the hearing date of these proceedings.

The case management of these proceedings

6These proceedings were commenced and case managed in the Supreme Court of NSW before being referred to this court. The statement of claim identified no imputations or publications, and sought damages for 'two causes of action and persecution"". 

7In the course of five listings before the court's registrars, an amended statement of claim was filed (15 February 2013), to which the first defendant filed a defence on 6 June 2013. The amended statement of claim identified the publications as being that the police said to the plaintiff ""we have to search you to see if you stole things other than the phone"" and that he had made ""repeated death threats"" to the HopeStreet staff. 

8The manner in which the parties conducted the hearing, including the informality of the pleadings, the absence of the second defendant and the presentation of the evidence, resulted from the lack of funds of the parties, a factor about which I have been reminded on several occasions by both Ms Chrysanthou and the plaintiff. 

9The second defendant, who had ceased being an employee of the first defendant and moved interstate, was not served until 25 September 2013. The lack of evidence that he had been served was drawn to the plaintiff's attention by the Supreme Court registrar and, on 17 June 2013, the plaintiff served a Notice of Motion returnable on 18 June seeking a referral to the pro bono panel and ""substituted and informal service"" on the second defendant pursuant to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR) r 10.4 . Orders were also sought for the production of documents from the first defendant. On 5 July 2013 the first defendant consented to the pro bono panel referral, but objected to the orders for substituted service, on the basis that the plaintiff had not served any evidence demonstrating the steps taken by him to bring his claim to the second defendant's attention, despite orders by the registrar on 18 June 2013 to do so. 

10The registrar declined to make the order for substituted service sought by the plaintiff, and referred the pro bono assistance order to Campbell J. Campbell J made an order for referral of the plaintiff to the pro bono legal panel, and since that time the plaintiff has received legal assistance in the drafting of pleadings, in seeking orders such as extension of time for service and substituted service, and in preparing subpoenae for witnesses and documents. 

11The proceedings were transferred to this court on 3 March 2014, on the basis that they were both suitable for this court to hear and ready for hearing. Case management orders were proposed by this court on the first return in the defamation list, and a two-hour hearing fixed for outstanding issues, but the parties preferred instead to ask for a hearing date on the day when these outstanding issues were to have been heard.

12In conducting this hearing, I have endeavoured to follow the practices adopted by experienced defamation trial judges in relation to the case management and evidentiary difficulties which occur when parties on both sides are unrepresented. In PW v MS (No 3) [2014] WASC 202 at [5] - [6], Le Miere J noted this presented difficulties for them in adducing evidence, particularly for the plaintiff, who bears the burden of proof. The principal problem was that much of the evidence was hearsay (at [20] - [22]), or irrelevant, in circumstances where it was unclear whether the unrepresented opponent had omitted to object to the hearsay evidence for some tactical reason or had simply not known that such evidence should be objected to. The course Le Miere J took was to give such inadmissible evidence the probative value the court considers appropriate (citing Hughes v National Trustees, Executors and Agency Co of Australia Ltd (1979) 143 CLR 134 at 153 (per Gibbs J), Cross on Evidence (LexisNexis, last updated April 2014) at [1650] and [1655], Ritz Hotel v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 170 per McLelland J and Robert Bax & Associates v Cavenham Pty Ltd [2012] QCA 177 at [43] per Muir JA).

13I have additionally taken into account the approach adopted as appropriate by Higgins CJ where an unrepresented defendant fails to attend to give evidence in proceedings where a defence of qualified privilege was made (Lamont v Dwyer [2008] ACTSC 125). 

The circumstances giving rise to publication of the matters complained of

14The plaintiff has set out the events in his successive statements of claim and the principal facts relating to events on Friday 20 January 2013 are largely not in dispute. 

15Earlier on the morning of 20 January, the plaintiff had asked another HopeStreet volunteer, known to the court only as ""Dianne"", to take his place on part or all of his Friday lunch shift, which meant helping to serve patrons coming to the Back Shed Café. This café was run by the first defendant, and the second defendant had some supervisory role in relation to its activities. The plaintiff nevertheless went to the café and remained there until approximately 12.20 or 12.40 pm.

16It was while the plaintiff was still at the café, at about 12.20 or 12.40 pm, that Dianne handed him the HopeStreet mobile phone and asked him to give it to the second defendant, who was sitting at a table outside the café. The plaintiff was anxious to leave the premises because a bowl of alcoholic punch for the staff was sitting on the floor, covered with a towel, which was strictly against HopeStreet's teetotal rules. The presence of this alcohol upset him, he told the court.

17The plaintiff did not like to interrupt the second defendant, who was sitting at the table outside in a meeting, so he walked past him and went to the Matthew Talbot Hostel across the road for lunch. He then to a nearby centre to work at his computer. The plaintiff returned to the Back Shed Café nearly two hours later, at about 2.20 pm (according to the further amended statement of claim), which was about 40 minutes before it was to close. He had forgotten about the phone, which was in his pocket. 

18When he returned, Dianne was ""in a distressed state"", according to the statement of claim, and shouting repeatedly ""someone has pinched the phone"" (see the successive statements of claim, paragraphs 7(f) and 7(g)). 

19The plaintiff did not tell her he had the phone. The second defendant told Dianne that he would ring the phone, which would enable him to find its location from the ring tone it gave. The plaintiff then took the phone out of his pocket and handed it to the second defendant.

20The second defendant said: ""Amir, what is my phone doing in your pocket?"" The plaintiff replied ""within earshot of approximately six patrons"" (further amended statement of claim, paragraph 7(h)): ""What are you saying? How dare you! Fuck off George!"" (T 32; amended statement of claim, paragraph 7(h)).

21The second defendant said: ""Amir, take a fifteen minutes time out"". The plaintiff replied: ""You are not my youth worker; don't talk to me in a sneaky, poofty [sic] ways [sic]"" (further amended statement of claim, paragraph 7(i)). The second defendant then said ""You are barred for three months"". The plaintiff responded: ""What are you doing; killing Hope Street?"" 

22I note that the second defendant told the police that the plaintiff said he would kill him, not that he was killing HopeStreet, but that this alternative version of what the plaintiff said is denied by the plaintiff. 

23The second defendant said: ""If you don't leave now I will call the police"" (further amended statement of claim, paragraph 7(j)). The plaintiff said ""I am not going anywhere as this is my shift, and your games and lies will take Hope Street down"" (previously pleaded as ""I'm not going anywhere and your games will take Hope Street down"") (further amended statement of claim, paragraph 7(j)). The second defendant then said that he would call the police whereupon the plaintiff replied ""Call the police, you are doing it almost every day, dogging [sic - the plaintiff used the word ""dogging"" as if it were ""dobbing""] people in"" (previously pleaded as ""Call the police, you are doing it almost every second day, dogging people in"") (further amended statement of claim, paragraph 7(k)). The second defendant then said, ""You are barred for six months"" and called the police.

24The plaintiff's evidence was generally consistent with the accounts set out in these pleadings. The remainder of the statement of claim sets out events occurring after the publication of the matters complained of, which are set out in more detail in the section of this judgment concerning evidence of the parties.

25Although there were other persons in the café, none were called by either side. However, Sergeant Merritt, who arrived at the scene a few minutes later, and who was the person to whom the first publication was made, was called to give evidence by the plaintiff. 

26The version of these events given by the second defendant in his incident report to the first defendant (Exhibit F) was as follows:

""At around 2 p.m. Dianne (café volunteer) approached me in a distressed state, claiming that she had lost my work mobile phone, earlier lent to her.

This conversation took place in the café in front of the counter. I explained to not worry, that I could simply dial the number from my other personal phone.

As I was dialling, Amir - who was behind the counter - turned his back, and appeared to discreetly take my phone out from his pocket.

When I asked ""Amir, what is my phone doing in your pocket?"" he replied in a yelling tone: 

""How dare you?"" ""

""What are you saying?"" 

""You are a dog."" 

""Fuck off."" 

""You are a poofter.""

When Dianne confronted him with why my phone was in his pocket, he responded to her in an aggressive, intimidating tone.

At that point, I requested that Amir take a 15 minute time out.

This triggered an angrier response from Amir and vitriol of a similar tone continued.

I expressed that I am requesting him to leave the café (by this time it was 2.45 pm, near to closing time).

He responded by claiming ""I will kill you"".

At this point I said to him, that the threat he just made will result in a ban. I also informed him that I will call the Police to escort him out of the premises.

I explained that a ban also means that he will need to remove his belongings from of [sic] the Art Space.

Amir responded with many claims of ""Call the Police. I am not going anywhere.""

He also said on two occasions, ""If you touch my stuff (in the Art Space) I will kill you.""

Police eventually arrived and spoke to Amir at length.

It was explained to me by Police that Amir could be charged for:

1. Theft of mobile phone

2. Trespassing, if returned from [sic] Hope Street once banned.

I explained that I did not wish to proceed with a theft charge.

With police escort, Maureen & I transferred Amir's belongings from the Art Space, to the corridored [sic] area outside the Art Space.

At around 3.30 pm Amir re-presented at HopeStreet door, aggressively requesting to see Sage and Andrew. My request that he back away, and explanation that he is banned, was met with another claim of ""I will kill you"".

Police were notified again, who spoke to him.""

27This report then went on to discuss events occurring after the publication of the matters complained of, which are set out in more detail in the section of this judgment concerning evidence of the parties.

The issues for determination

28The issues for determination are as follows:

(a)Publication to a third party of each of the matters complained of and the ""republication"";

(b)Whether the imputations are conveyed (defamatory meaning is conceded);

(c)Common law and statutory qualified privilege (s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Act""));

(d)Whether, if the matters complained of were published on occasions protected by common law qualified privilege, the plaintiff can establish malice;

(e)Whether, in relation to each of the matters complained of, the conduct of the defendants was reasonable in the circumstances;

(f)Damages; and

(g)Whether damages were mitigated by correspondence to the plaintiff dated 24 December 2012 from the recipient of the second matter complained of, Mr Ravenscroft, informing him that he was welcomed to return to the café and Op Shop (Exhibit L), and by an apology dated 14 January 2013 (Exhibit M) signed by Reverend Hall, who was called by the first defendant to give evidence

The publications and imputations

29There are two publications and one ""republication"".

(a) The first matter complained of

30The first matter complained of is set out in the statement of claim as being that the second defendant told police that ""he left his phone with a female colleague and that he believes that the plaintiff only handed it over as he didn't have time to turn it off and it would have rung in his pocket"" (further amended statement of claim paragraph 8(a)).

31The plaintiff has never pleaded the imputation asserted to arise from this publication. Its contents were clarified by McCallum J in an ex tempore judgment of 2 December 2013. The difficulty facing the court was that neither the matters complained of nor the imputations arising had been set out by the plaintiff. If the matter was to proceed, these issues had to be clarified. Ms Chrysanthou told her Honour (T 9):

""CHRYSANTHOU: Now that we understand that the two publications are those that have been identified, namely the words said to police and the words said perhaps to Mr Ravenscroft or other staff resulting in that letter of 23 January, we are content to proceed with that. As long as that is noted somewhere, so we are not faced at trial with some different case."" 

32McCallum J went on to give a short oral judgment confirming this position, the relevant passages of which are as follows:

""3. the two publications Mr Bodenstein says he relies on are, first, the words said by Mr Vlamakis to police referred to, but not pleaded, in paragraph 7(k) of the amended statement of claim and, secondly, the words said by Mr Vlamakis either directly or indirectly to Mr Rod Ravenscroft recorded in Mr Ravenscroft's letter to Mr Bodenstein dated 23 January 2012...in particular the allegation that the plaintiff made repeated death threats to a member of the Hope Street staff and refused to leave the premises of Hope Street after verbal notice had been given of his ban from those premises. Those indications by Mr Bodenstein dispose of the defendant's objections."" [Note: The spelling of ""HopeStreet"" used by her Honour has been left unchanged].


33Sergeant Merritt, who gave evidence in these proceedings, was the recipient of the matter complained of from the second defendant. It appears to be common ground that the second defendant did not speak to the male police officer accompanying Sergeant Merritt, and that the male police officer's role was that he carried out a search of the plaintiff.

34Sergeant Merritt's COPS entry states:

""[The second defendant] told police that he had left his phone with a female colleague and that she told him that she had lost the phone. He told her not to worry and that he would just ring it. At this time [the plaintiff] was in close vicinity [sic]. Upon hearing this [he] has taken the phone from his pocket and handed it to [the second defendant].

""[The plaintiff] has no reason to be in possession of this phone and [the second defendant] did not give him permission to have it. [The second defendant' believes that [the plaintiff] only handed it over as he didn't have time to turn it off and it would have rung in his pocket"".

35Sergeant Merritt was not asked by either party what the second defendant said to her. I am satisfied by concessions made by Ms Chrysanthou at the end of her submissions that a publication was made to her by the second defendant in accordance with what is set out in the plaintiff's statement of claim, namely that the second defendant ""left his phone with a female colleagues and that he believes that the plaintiff only handed it over as he didn't have time to turn it off and it would have rung in his pocket."" The imputation conveyed was never distilled by either party, but an imputation of attempting to steal a mobile phone is clearly conveyed and conceded to be defamatory.

(b) The second matter complained of

36The second publication by the second defendant is his oral report to Mr Ravenscroft, his superior, to the effect that the plaintiff has made repeated death threats, as is set out in the extract of McCallum J's judgment as set out above. This oral publication is evidenced by Mr Ravenscroft's letter to the plaintiff dated 23 January 2012 (Exhibit G), as well as by the incident report (Exhibit F) written by the second defendant in which he stated the plaintiff said to him more than once ""I will kill you"". This incident report (Exhibit F) was used as a source for the letter of 23 January 2012 (see Exhibit G). As is noted by McCallum J, the plaintiff pleads publication to one person, namely Mr Ravenscroft. 

37The first defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff has established that this imputation is conveyed and defamatory.

(c) The ""republication""

38The plaintiff made copies of the 23 January 2012 letter to which he added certain words from Chapter 23 of Exodus. He taped two copies of this publication to landmarks in Tom Uren Square on 25 January 2012 (Exhibit H.

39Whether these publications are in fact republications at all, as opposed to publications (as to which see Jones v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 364 - if so, they were added to the statement of claim after the expiry of the limitation period) the plaintiff must establish that he was:

(a)Legally or morally obliged to make the publication (or republication) in question;

(b)That it was made to persons with a legitimate interest in receiving it; and

(c)Such publication was reasonably to have been anticipated by the defendants.

40There is no evidence satisfying any of these requirements. In addition, it was the plaintiff's evidence that the second defendant was in the square when he was putting these letters up. As soon as the second defendant saw them, he ripped them down and as the plaintiff told the court, no one ever saw them except the second defendant. Leaving aside the difficult question of whether the publisher of a libel can also become the third party if the plaintiff gives the document back to the publisher (see Trantum v McDowell [2007] NSWCA 138), this claim fails in limine on the plaintiff's own evidence and there is no evidence any third party ever saw it. 

41The next issue is whether the first defendant is vicariously liable for the publications of the second defendant.

Vicarious liability

42In the amended defence filed on 19 February 2014 the first defendant pleaded (paragraph 6) that the first defendant ""notes that the plaintiff does not rely on any alleged publication therein for the purposes of his claims in defamation (see judgment of McCallum J, 2 December 2013)"". This seems to have been based on a misunderstanding by the pleader that the second defendant was another volunteer, or somehow a person for whose publication the first defendant could not be liable, vicariously or otherwise. 

43The first defendant now accepts that it is vicariously liable for the second defendant's publications to the extent that they are proved to have been carried out in the course of his employment (written submissions, page 7). The circumstances in which this concession was made relate to the failure of either party to notify the second defendant, a former employee of the first defendant, that these proceedings were listed for hearing.

Conclusions as to publication and the imputations conveyed

44As noted above, I am satisfied that the first and second publications were published by the second defendant, in circumstances where the first defendant was vicariously liable, that each of these statements conveyed the imputations pleaded, and that those imputations were defamatory.

45The remaining issues are the defences of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and the issue of damages.

46In the statement of claim the plaintiff has raised other issues, called ""aggravation"" (paragraph 8(a)). This relates to the circumstances in which certain of his property was removed from the Art Space and, after the plaintiff did not collect it for about nine months, sold. Some cardboard boxes containing his records, also not collected for some months, were stolen. A bicycle he left behind was sold and the proceeds of $35 given to the plaintiff. Neither party has addressed me on these issues.

A preliminary issue: The location for these events

47At the request of the plaintiff, the first defendant's premises were the subject of a ""view"". The plaintiff pointed out the locations at which the events set out above occurred. 

48These events took place at the Back Shed Café which was a community coffee shop with outdoor seating, operating on Mondays to Thursdays between 9:00am to 3:00pm and on Friday between 11:00am and 3:00pm, for which two shifts of volunteers were, according to the plaintiff, managed by the first defendant's staff. The plaintiff was a volunteer on Wednesday and later on Friday mornings. In return, he received free coffees on weekdays, four items from the Co Shop per week and had access to a workstation at nights and on weekends.

49The Back Shed Café is a very small open-air café operating out of the back of the HopeStreet centre, offering low-cost coffee and snacks to locals. There are less than half a dozen tables inside and a similar number outside. Prominently attached to the coffee machine, as at the time of the matter complained of, was the following sign:

""Violence will not be tolerated

In the Back Shed Café or the Op-Shop

This includes Verbal [sic] abuse, swearing and making threatening comments, weapons of any sorts [sic] and physical abuse.

All of the above will be dealt with in a serious manner, police will be called immediately and you will be banned from HopeStreet for two weeks minimum.""

The plaintiff's evidence

50In his evidence in chief, the plaintiff describes the events in question as follows:

""Q. Why don't you tell us what happened on the day, just tell us what you say happened, and we'll just let you tell your story.
A. I had, two days before the incident, which was Wednesday, I had a particular incident with the second defendant, yet it wasn't the first one and I would like to go even further back, when he entered the position of the coordinator of the first defendant, of Hope Street Urban Compassion. This position was vacant for a few months, after Fiona Simpson had left, and I reckon, if I can testify about myself, I was very receptive, and tried to assist the second defendant, because he came from Melbourne. He was new, he used to work as a youth worker, and because I already was homeless for quite few years, I knew the older agencies, and I introduced him, and we had like kind of, he liked to have a walk around the waterfront, so, at least three occasions we went for a walk and I just share with him my knowledge about the agencies, and I even took him to the Matthew Talbot Hostel, and I introduced him to people at the Matthew Talbot and as I stated in the statement of claim, I tried to be useful. At a certain point, he called me one of the three local priests, and in particular this was on my 50, I said, 50th birthday. That he was repeating it, considered me one of the

Q. He considered you one of the what?
A. One of the local priests.

Q. PRIESTS?
A. Yes.

Q. You said he considered you one of the local priests?
A. Yes and I think I got like, credit, and yet as the time passed, he had a few incidents that I was just like a bystander, yet not with me, but he had, used to do incident that, that I mention also in my statement of claim, and I just, like, observed his behaviour, and it started with him, at one point, he was assisting a friend of mine, regarding his being barred from the Matthew Talbot, and he went to talk with the staff at the Matthew Talbot and is coming back and say, the one at the front desk, at the Talbot, are bastards. Kind of was talking about a colleague, workers of another agency and it was followed with a few incidents that he had also with one of the artists that what is now became to be the Ex Art Space and I saw him really using force with two customers, one was, his name is Cookie, that was drinking and basically no drink are allowed at the coffee shop, or at sitting outside. So, he really, instead of engaging and convincing him, he really started dragging his chair, and dragging his physical contact. The same he did with a woman, a tranny, her name is Trish. Once again, physical, grabbing chairs, and it's kind of, he had nonstop incidents.

Q. He had what, nonstop?
A. Continuous

Q. He was continuously having what sort of incidents?
A. He was telling lies. He was, he wasn't confident at job, yeah, sorry, this is kind of an opinion. He went, and he had to step into large shoes that Fiona had left and even if he making a compliment about male body, trying to be nice and to say, look what arms you have, this is things that it's not like, it's weird, especially dealing with the homeless, and most of the residents, or the people that are living there are homemade. At a certain point of time, and this was on the 18th, on Wednesday, this is the first huge incident that I had with him, and he was present. This was outside the Art Space. I and he was with him, and with the CEO at the time, Andrew Watkins. I stipulate my, I'm really concerned, my complaints, and it started with the fact that he was saying that the Art Space is going to be shut down and I was claiming at the time that it's not true, and this was what ignite the discussion, my complaints with the CEO and the CEO basically says that it's not on the cards, because what had happened at that certain point of time, of the incident of two days prior, is that they had a job agency, the Hostel had a job agency in Woolloomooloo, and it was flooded with water, rain water. So they moved their activity to the Art Space and basically the second defendant said that, that's it, the Art Space won't be used anymore by artists and when I raised it with the CEO, he said that it's completely wrong. Funny enough, I reckon this was one of the things that eventually, the second defendant was right, it was, one year afterwards, afterwards, one year afterwards, the art place really was shut down. This is happened two days before the incident, the second defendant was present. It was outside the Art Space, and I raised all of what I had just mentioned, also the fact that he was taking excessive, to my opinion, excessive amount of Oz Harvest's product. This was on the Friday, on my shift, to himself. The fact that he was going, on Wednesday, instead of taking people to aerobics was going just by himself, to have, this is through Hope Street, through the organisation, they have a free entry to the swimming pool, and so we had to take, he was going to have swimming lessons and other incidents. I was quite full on, I knew the, quite well, and I think that I had quite good rapport with the CEO and this was at Wednesday, two days before the incident. On the day of the incident, and then we are going, I want to talk a little bit about the third party which is what has been mentioned in the police report, the colleague volunteer. No, she was a colleague worker but she was a volunteer as I was. I reckon she was also a client. She was a regular at Tom Uren Square and I knew her and, really, the bond with us was all the time with a warm hugging. We had a few, two common mates that we knew and I reckon also, because of my background, it was a mutual kind. I don't know if it was mutual but as least as far as I felt from her side it was kind of a respect and I think that already in this stage I just want to make a little remark. It's that I was under the impression until recently, when all the papers were produced, that she really supported me either with the police but I know that maybe I am running too fast so I will be back to the third party but I can say that, prior to the day of the incident, which was the plaintiff or my shift, I was already disengaging and I prepared her and I asked her to cover for my shift because I started feeling not comfortable and this was the reason that I asked her to cover that first two hours till noon of the coming shift. Prior to that she was just covering whenever I had a break with my friends, have a coffee break, and a few weeks beforehand I missed and, in turn, this was the first time and the only time that regarding her, basically, that I missed an entire shift and I believe that it was in this occasion, in this shift, that her phone probably was calling, disappeared. It's she might

Q. Her phone disappeared?
A. Yes, and this is I am talking about, like, her own

Q. This is this lady named Dianne?
A. Dianne.

Q. Dianne what?
A. Dianne. I don't know her second name and she is not the not charged. She is the third party and it's, like, I always feel uncomfortable for the fact that she was dragged into it and for quite a while I was thinking that she turned against me but I was completely, completely wrong and I just .. (not transcribable).. it when all the documents were produced.""

51The interruptions caused by repeating words just spoken come from the difficulties in understanding what the plaintiff said. The plaintiff spoke very quickly and with an accent, and at times his voice sank to being unable to be recorded, hence the references to some parts being ""not transcribable"" when a transcript was later ordered.

52The plaintiff described how Diane came to be doing his shift:

""A. A real job. On Friday the 20th, the day of the incident I basically was around but I didn't approach the café whatsoever till around ten minutes after 12pm and all of the time I was in the computers adjacent, learning was in the learning centre, which I do on regular base and working and writing on a computer, immigration and other matters that I have to deal with, and the first time that I went to the café, and basically the café is part of the area that I live in, I sleep I think it's not more than 25 metres from the Back Shed Café, and when I entered the café, the Back Shed Café, saw on the floor what looked to be I smelt it also afterwards, but I then realised it was a bowl of alcoholic punch and I was told by Maureen, first in my first statement I think I stated that it was Dianne and then kind of recalled that it was Maureen which was worker of the first defendant, and she told me the guys are having a party to night. I want to mention also that this is the first time that I saw any alcohol inside the café.

Q. How did you know it was alcohol?
A. It was covered with a towel, I pull off the towel, I smell it, it's alcohol. And there was like a group of they were homeless at the time, apparently they left immediately after, there was a group of Kiwis that was sitting at a table, they were kind of all the time watching and probably they are the one, I know they are the one that prepared the punch and they were really sitting nearby but still outside of the café. Immediately after the CEO, they all had a meeting because of the flooding of the job agency, they have a big meeting outside the Art Space, it's less than 15 metres from the café, it was around eight workers of the first defendant, they were sitting in a big circle, kind of a group meeting, outside at Tom Uren Square and at certain point the CEO had approached me, I was already in the café and Ozzie came, Ozzie is one of the locals at the time, sleeping out, she's quite alcoholic and she had to change her clothes so the CEO had asked me if I can take care of, so I took I escort her to the op shop, I organised some clothes and I went back to the café and at certain point I ask Dianne whether she can keep me a bag because at that time the way of distribution was that the produce was put in a bag. Prior to that it was like customers were taking from boxes, but at that time it change, which prior for that it required much more responsibility, lot more flexibility dealing with customer not taking too much. However at this time it already had been changed into packed, repacked and prepacked bags and I asked her, because I already, I saw ..(not transcribable).. something wrong here, this is going completely out of control and I ask Dianne whether she can keep me one bag, know that I'm sleeping outside and I'm provided with food at the Matthew Talbot and I'm not really consumer of food but usually I use this bag as part of my way of surviving, going to friends, bringing them some food and after I ask her, she said, ""No you didn't kept me one"" which was kindly right and she talked about an incident a week before that I kept a bag, I had a bag for me, a bag for her, this was nearly closing time and the second defendant approached me and ask me like ""Why do you have two bag?"" I tell him, ""Listen this is a bag for Dianne"", he said, ""Ah no worries, like Pam already took her a bag"", so he took the bag, and when she came I said to her, ""Listen George told me that"" the second defendant had told me, ""Pam had took you a bag"", she said, ""No way there is no bag"", so she was quite upset because of that and this is the context of what she was saying

Q. Can you just remind me, is Dianne a homeless person?
A. No.

Q. Why was Dianne needing a bag?
A. Because the bags also were distributed to customers and volunteers. She also a needy person to an extent, who am I to judge, but I reckon she was a client of Hope Street and it's a common that all the volunteer will take were eligible to receive the bag with

Q. This isn't a sleeping bag, this is a bag of
A. A bag of food, produce of Oz Harvest.

Q. A food bag?
A. It's a food bag.

Q. You're saying that George had said that Pam had taken a bag for Dianne is that right?
A. This is the week before and this is in the context why she said, ""You didn't keep me one"". A week before on the Friday before-

Q. What has that got to do with what happened? You say it's the context, how is it relevant?
A. It's relevant because this is part of what I can call the finally call it in Court the poison that the second defendant had put around because eventually Pam didn't keep her [sic].

Q. How was that poisoned?
A. No I'm saying kind of putting controversy between people and in this incident between me and Dianne. She already was kind of upset that I didn't keep her one the week before, and.

Q. But how is that George's fault?
A. Because Pam didn't keep her none [sic].

Q. But what about if George had just been mistaken?
A. I think that it was fully intentioned of creating controversy between me and Dianne, because it wasn't true. He said that to Pam.""

53The plaintiff was asked to tell the court what happened on 20 January 2013:

""Q. What happened after that?
A. Around like lunch started 2.30, around 12.40, I told her that I'm going I told Dianne that I'm going for lunch at the Talbot, and she asked me, ""Can you give the phone to George?"" I tell them, ""Look you know me and George are not"", and she continued like, ""Please, please, I'm very busy"", which she was, ""I'm very busy"" and I took the phone. So she stated ""Please give it back, back to George"". I knew this mobile phone, she used the mobile phone. I used this mobile phone, this mobile phone wasn't George's phone, it was Hope Street's phone which I knew it. It was used by visitors, myself, other volunteers and as Dianne did. And at that time I want also to mention that the phone was not switched off and it would not it is not rung.

Q. It was not switched off or it was not switched on?
A. It was not switched off, meaning I didn't switch it off, it was switched on. And it was not rung.

Q. It was not rung. Nobody rang on it?
A. No one rang on it, yes.

Q. Yes, what's next?
A. On my way to the to lunch, I saw the meeting outside. I didn't want to interrupt. Also the position of me kind of after the incident two days before approaching George, and they were all busy in a discussion, I put it in my pocket and I continue walking

Q. Wait a moment, did you say, ""I saw George""?
A. Yes I did saw George in a meeting, it was in discussion, it's a group meeting of at least other workers.

Q. You didn't give him the phone?
A. I didn't give him the phone. And I put it in my pocket. After lunch there was at the time, it's not relevant anymore, it's not existing anymore, there were lockers at the Talbot Hostel and I went to the locker as usually I do. I went after the computer and I didn't really return, this is it took me time to realise just through the report, I was sure that I returned really shortly after, like after lunch like around quarter past 1, apparently I came back at around 2.20pm, and I forgot about the phone, it was in my pocket, I forgot about it. Wasn't ringing. I came back 2.20pm. I went behind the counter. The counter is not positioned as it's positioned now, at the time like you are kind of turning your back to the side, you are turning your back when you are making the coffee and I started making myself a coffee when I heard the Dianne, ""Someone has pinched a phone"".

Q. You heard Dianne say?
A. I heard Dianne say, ""Someone has pinched the phone"" and immediately after

Q. Wait a moment, you heard Dianne say, ""Someone has pinched the phone""?
A. Yes. And immediately after I heard George say, like, ""I will ring it"" was like seconds. I turned my back, I took the phone out of my pocket and I handed it to George. This is inside the café, the Kiwi group sitting like less than 2 metre from the counter outside of the café and there were other patrons inside the café and George said like, ask, ""What is my phone doing in your pocket?"" and I

[Objection]

A. I said in reply, ""What are you saying? How dare you. Fuck off George"".

Q. What did he say?
A. He said, ""Amir please take 15 minutes break"".

Q. What did you say?
A. I turned to him, ""Don't act you are not my youth worker, don't talk with me please in sneaky poofty way"".

Q. You said, ""You are not my youth worker don't talk to me in what""?
A. In a sneaky

Q. A sneaky what?
A. Poofty.

Q. Poofy or poofter?
A. Poofty, this is the way that I put it, poofty way because

Q. No, no, what's poofty?
A. Poofty is like reading poofter, but the way that I pronounced it was poofty.

Q. POOFTY, poofty?
A. Yes.

Q. Poofty way?
A. Poofty way, which like well evidently the way that he was kind of speaking, kind of patronising. And he tell me, ""Amir you are barred for three months"". I said to him, ""What are you doing? What, you are finishing?"" And they stated there ""killing"", I believe that it was ""finishing"" because this is a word, but I took it to the extreme in case

Q. No, Mr Bodenstein, you need to tell me what was said. He said, ""Amir you are barred for three months"", and your answer was, ""What are you doing?"" Did you say something like ""You are destroying Hope Street""?
A. Yeah, yeah, to the extent ""You are finishing"", but it may be that I said, ""Killing"", I doubt.

Q. ""You are killing Hope Street""?
A. Yes.

Q. Yes and what did George say to you?
A. They reckon at this stage he said, ""You are barred for six months, if you won't leave now I will call the police"". But I am not leaving anywhere

Q. Wait a moment so you replied to that and you said, ""I'm not leaving""?
A. ""I'm not going anywhere. This is my shift"", it's like 20 minutes to 3 or 2.30 and he said, ""Listen if you don't leave I'll call the police"". To him, ""Call the police you're doing it every second day, you are dogging"" it might be that I said, ""dogging""

Q. You said, ""Call the police, you are calling them every second day""?
A. After that, ""You are dogging people in all the time"".

Q. ""You are dobbing people in all the time""?
A. Yes. I don't think that I said dogging, but it might I doubt it, because I love dogs, I don't have any problem

Q. No dobbing, do you know what a dobber is?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you say dobbing as opposed to dogging?
A. Yes.

Q. You said dobbing ""You are dobbing people in all the time"", that's what you said to him is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. What did he say to that?
A. Once again ""I will call the police, you go out"".

Q. He asked you to leave?
A. Yes.

Q. How loudly were you speaking at this stage?
A. Not yelling definitely and.

Q. What about George, was George yelling?
A. No this is like George is not yelling, George is talking very soft and very compassionate and very patronising. George is not yelling, and I wasn't yelling.

Q. So George was being patronising you say. All right, what happened next? Did the police come?
A. Next I left, as I left I saw him calling which was not the first time, it was pretty regular, this is the first time that he called police on me. And I was waiting outside and this was at least 15 metres from the Back Shed Café, this was more near the Art Space which is separate. And when police arrive, first they talk with George. I was against the wall. They ask me

Q. Wait a minute, when the police arrived, what did they do? They went in and spoke to George, is that right?
A. They went and talked with George.

Q. They didn't come up to you at all?
A. Yeah, they just like ask me to go a little bit further, 10 metres from the Art Space. So like 20 metres from the Back Shed Café, I was 10 metres from the café when they arrived and then they ask me to stand against the wall, not yet searching me.

Q. Who were the police officers who came, was one of them the lady who gave
A. Yes.

Q. Is that Meredith?
A. Merritt.

Q. One of them was Sergeant Merritt, who was the other one?
A. I don't know, it was a police officer, a man. But I reckoned that Merritt was conducting the event because she was calling the shots and she was immediately after she talked with George, she asked the male officer to have a search of me and she stated that ""We have to make a search to see if you have any other stolen property on you"", which they did. They searched me. And not more than and I told her that Dianne had handed me the phone. I doubt whether I told him that this is Hope Street phone, I don't know, I can't really recall, but the only thing if I may raise about Sergeant Merritt she is the only there are many police officers, she is the only one that I had and the record could show at least regarding Woolloomooloo, she's the only one that I had any previous contact with there, or this agreement because the way that she was also waking people up by tapping them with her shoes. I had definitely history with Merritt and she knew me. At the time she was not stationed at Woolloomooloo station, and immediately it's not more than five minutes with Merritt present, they went into the Art Space. They remove almost because the foosball for example of the bike remained there, the computer screen but on the boxes and this is Friday before the weekend, on the boxes of documents computer video camera I had all my stuff, not clothing stuff but all the documents and they removed it outside into the corridor which basically is open during the weekdays and this happened very, very quick. George was assisted by Maureen which was another worker of Hope Street. I believe that the police, if they arrive by 2.40, they left around 3 o'clock, it was very, very quick and they saw the café the Back Shed Café was closed and immediately after I tried and she stated that I'm barred and.""

54The plaintiff described how the police were called again and his requests to other employees of HopeStreet to assist him were rejected.

""Q. You asked to speak to who?
A. With Sage, which is another worker, and she

Q. SAGE?
A. Yes. Who was another worker of Hope Street. She had my passport stored in her cabinet. She came down with the cabinet, with my passport, told them, I told them, listen, you can keep the passport, I want urgently to talk with Andrew, the CEO. At certain point, as far as I recall, Andrew came down, we had a brief talk, and I told him, please, I'm asking at least solution. Whatever was putting out the Art Space for the weekend. He refuse.

Q. You're asking to leave your stuff in the Art Space?
A. For the weekend.

Q. He refused.
A. He refused.

Q. What happened then?
A. And then, I didn't that day have any contact or previous matters.

Q. Did you go away again?
A. Yes.""

55The plaintiff was critical of both defendants, saying that HopeStreet had now just become a place for drug transactions to take place:

""A. That people will know what had happened. What had happened, because the main way of operation of George was gossiping. Was just talking, he didn't have, he had no idea of any clients. Fiona before him had eight, ten clients, all the time, assisting this paper. He was sitting and talking, and talking, and being nice, and I knew what is coming, and immediately after, I heard, like, he stole George phone. You try to kill him. You stated that you will kill him and I want to mention about that. If I may jump to the incident that he was writing, the judgment raised that in this incident, he is mentioning, four times, that I stated to him that I will kill him, not once, four times, at least, four times, that I repeated threatened. I raised immediately my concern with the CEO, with Rod which was the operation manager. Constant, I didn't provide it as evidence, but constantly I raised my concern and I said that those allegation, which was apparent at this time, was just life. This was in the banishment letter and I stated repeatedly that this allegation is wrong. I had never threatened.

Q. You never said you'd kill him, but you said he was killing Hope Street, is that what you said?
A. Yes. I believe that I said finishing, but I'm taking it to the extent that it might, that I said killing him, killing Hope Street, and I said also, you are taking Hope Street down. Which I believe that he did and we have to come to the site, we can see. So it was in the context, and I saw what is coming. He finished Hope Street, he killed Hope Street. Not because of me, because what had happened afterward. He created a complete destruction. Systematically and I raised my concern.

Q. You're saying he destroyed Hope Street, and Hope Street was finished as a result of his conduct.
A. Yes.

Q. This was all because, of the circumstances, and was all because of what he did to you?
A. No. No whatsoever. Because his performance is incompetent. He destroyed it. There is no more Art Space, and what remains is

Q. There is no more what?
A. Art Space.

Q. That's his fault, is it?
A. Yes, it's mainly his fault, not just, but it's mainly.

Q. Is Hope Street still in existence?
A. In a different mode of operation, there are no more volunteers at the Back Shed Café. It's mainly used for the transaction of whatever drugs.

Q. It's mainly used for drug transactions?
A. Kind of, not mainly, sorry to go to the extreme.

Q. No, mainly used for drug transactions?
A. If we are talking about a purpose of a place, and gossip. And gossip, gossip, gossip.

Q. It's mainly used for drug transactions and gossip?
A. Yes.

Q. Hope Street has been destroyed by all of this, is that right?
A. Absolutely.

Q. There are no volunteers, there are just people who are there to have drug transactions and gossip.
A. And having their coffee, obviously, it's part. Coffee, and still having their Oz Harvest, but I want to mean, it's like, it's not a drug station. But this is what's going on, because they don't have anything. Beforehand they have art, they have activity, they have excursion to museum, to the zoo. Which I was very privileged to have. Now, it's an empty shell, the volunteers operate there's one volunteer that operate the Hope shop. Hardly any volunteers, hardly any volunteer, maybe there are one or two volunteers operating, or working at the Back Shed Café. So, I really believe that what was I was stating there, and I really also helped him. I really helped him, just like, to schmooze around, because he was hopeless. In this position. I really reckon that he was the main factor of destroying Hope Street. And it's definitely the Hope Street that used to be, is not anymore. And we have a big wrong."" (T 28 - 39)

56As the plaintiff was self-represented, and Ms Chrysanthou could not take him through his evidence (although she assisted in this way in relation to reputation evidence) it was necessary for me to ask many of these questions. After the view, the plaintiff returned to the witness box and I invited him to give a narrative by way of recapitulation:

""A. Hardly but I remember saying that he was what I was saying basically that I was just a bystander which is trying to do the best around and I was involved in the activities of Hope Street and I really cherish the fact that not like other agency, they really opened the door and they are more close to the public and the people in need, and I raised the concern at the management and still I was trying to keep going and whenever if ever needed like for me to put the ..(not transcribable).. and also me, sometimes just trying to calm down a situation as it happened with an artist from the Art Space that had a really big continuous incident with George and it's not that it just was my Friday shift, I was around, this was whenever I'm having a break I'm making a friend down there, I'm not a drinker, still I'm smoking, having a coffee and this was really a privilege, also the privilege that I had the working station at the Art Space. Also the lovely excursion that I participate, and it came out that eventually after basically a year, understand that I'm kind of ..(not transcribable).. because I raised the issue, it's like carrying me to a tipping point when I raised two days before the incident, basically my complaints, but obviously we got involved, the action group, the local action group was altogether just for local people that are caring and there was another three student that came on and off and I joined this action group, I'm not like enthusiastic going with the signs outside, I was doubtful to start with when I joined, it wasn't my initiative, it was Sage's initiative which was also a worker, a lovely worker of Hope Street and people really you can see by the material that was made, have best intention and intelligence and even in that small group, George couldn't fit himself and Carl was my computer tutor and was coming after I requested, ""Okay come, you have Woolloomooloo Greenings"" and they know he's a genius and it wouldn't take a it just came out that usually we're holding the meeting from three to around 4.30 and it's running late into dinnertime and I'm eating at that time, I'm eating out of the hands of agencies all around, without agencies I wouldn't be here and just like I took ten minutes and coming back, all of a sudden they have kind of a fight and whatever as it document itself, and then Carl go on and on and basically quit the group and eventually the group and I think it's also mentioned in and George was very articulated, he knows his way and this is why I wrote as an exhibit the email, the way that he can explain himself, very articulated, though it's obviously not what I can consider constructive, but he know to express himself. But I believe that as we saw yesterday it's kind of a rough area. To an extent there's a kind of criminal, there is kind of comrades and people are and it's a very forgiving environment, it's like the one that really carries on and not letting go, can't survive on the street for long and apparently it was overwhelming with George almost. At a later stage after the incident it was one time that some big local land on him and try to attack him, so it's a very sensitive I told you he was calling the police again and again which there are times that it's normal(?) but you have to manage the conflict and the only thing this is regarding the incident that I kind of regret, was my main consideration not to pursue it is the word poofty. ""Fuck off"", this is a standard. He could've ask me privately not everyone there, he was after, I gave him you know, but I reckon I didn't in that situation, I didn't have any other choice, and it was really like, ""What are you saying how dare you"" and the ""fuck off"" on the word, it's a kind of a standard, but still it's kind of a warning and him instead of later on privately ""Amir at the time"" it was in August, it wasn't his phone as he presented even to the police and later on the sneaky I don't have any problem with but the poofty I had, because I respect and I don't have any problems, sexuality of people, but it was definitely that it wasn't a game, he had a girlfriend from the local, she was also participating in the action group and it was just in the context that he wasn't speaking his real tongue, he's kind of find the right words to describe it. After the incident, part of Homeless Legal Services, basically said that they didn't really realise and I was dealing with Homeless Legal Services on other issue which was my main issue, all the status of immigration and not just, and around that point of time, let's say what I provided to the Court regarding my immigration status that I was at the time. Cause I was in more near the detention centre. Which George also knew about, because I was stupid enough ..(not transcribable).. because I'm not, hardly anyone, I participate with the circumstances, part of what I'm reading or giving this Court but him, after one of our walk, yeah, may I please tell me what the story but I kind of just, relatively shortly, but the current situation, the time is, a silent figure is much, much better, than the situation that my status had 2012 though, that I was still lawfully in Australia, but it was and part of, and my main engagement with Homeless legal service was regarding the immigration, though that immediately after the incident, I was asking, I get advice and now I can recall that I was asking, now it's going to the particular, and I whether I have to check with the script of Homeless legal service, but I believe that over there, I ask them, like, formal service and et cetera et cetera. It came out the substitute service. This is when it first arrived. But I approached them, if the incident was at 20 January, I approached them because they are coming on Tuesday, this was Friday, I believe, on the first Tuesday after the incident. I approached them and when we first discussed it, and then later off I backed off because the immigration issue was much, much more severe and later on I still made inquiries. This is regarding Homeless legal service. I immediately, after the incident, the first contact that I made, and tried to approach, was with the CEO. We were quite acquainted, we were already, I was, and this is prior even to when George came on board. I'm talking, George came, I think, I reckon, mid or early, but I reckon mid 2011 and my involvement with Hope Street was from around the beginning of 2010, when I arrived to Woolloomooloo, which might be even the end of 2009. Around that time. So, I knew all the staff, and I don't, it's like, provided by document, of Hope Street, I had never had any incident under their umbrella and this, they were part of my living zone, my comfort zone, and I wasn't acting. I wasn't acting, just like to give back, because I know, not just, you know, I remember when first I was assisted, this is around 2007, I was advised by mental health at Darlinghurst, that go to volunteer, and I was thinking, what are they talking, I hardly live, going to volunteer. Eventually I met Louise, and she met me when I was volunteering back at the café, and yeah, I had volunteering, and there is a cure ..(not transcribable).. a huge privilege, what you, you have the privilege of making people happy. People happy, by giving them a nice coffee, or making them a bottle milkshake and so, the CEO and all the other staff, whether it's Sage, another social worker, and Maureen, and Andrew Watkins and whatever ever, and they were changing; and also the Baptist church, the local community, which as I was participating in the Sunday breakfast. Mainly because, also because, it's where is now the gym, it was Mary Mackill, this is where there were helding [sic] the Sunday breakfast, and I was capable of, there was a few computer stations, so while they had the ceremonies I was nearby on the computer. And that's a major fact that I'm living on the street, I'm much more exposed to the element and to the environment, it's like, it's real life at the same time because it's intense. Never, prior of the incident, one incident that I had kind of a severe incident with, prior to, for the Court entry of 20 January, with Sergeant Merritt, it wasn't serious, she moved me on, prior to that incident and I can say that I melted and I had quite good relation, though that even I mentioned before, and I reckon it's mentioned on the piece of the ABC, that there was one time that I was bashed, but hardly any fighting. I was bashed, usually I am running away. This is regarding the entire concept of, and especially we are talking about an agency, the Christian agency about their forgiveness. Once again I want to say that the forgiveness, this is the reverend at Hope Street, when he became acquainted with the homelessness, he told me, I explained to him and he completely agreed, that on the street, the first trait that you have to adapt yourself, is forgiveness. And this was my entire growth down to an extent. There are certain times that you have to stand for your principle, and this is one of the real one. That to my perception, has to persist, and to pursue the justice but the one that really not letting go in the street, they can't supply. Either they are find themself in gaol, or either they can't, they can't live around. While they are being bashed and kicked out from the area. To conclude this agent never had a problem with congregation, the opposite. Very, very good rapport, both sides and whatever a volunteer lunch, and even whenever I was volunteering, I was behind the counter, they think that Maureen in her letter stated, I'm on call. I'm on call, I'm around, someone need a because there was all volunteers, someone need a break, whatever, I'm around, still doing my thing. It's not, I'm not living their part, and I'm not trying to be part of their employee, and enjoying the privilege of being a volunteer. After the incident, and this is immediately, this was the second call that eventually led to the second call of the police, by George, I tried to talk with Andrew. He's mentioning that I was, this is, I don't know if it's part of no, this is probably part of the submission, is, and his incident report. I hardly can recall what, really at certain point I talked with Andrew, and he said it's irreversible, and the stuff will be out for the weekend. This was my main concern, and going by stages, I have to rescue the most important, and since then, it was a continuing effort to resolve it. I didn't want to go to court. At certain point, eventually, I obviously, I said even to Rod, who was the operation manager, I'm disputing and asking for a fair hearing, and saying, at least what was on the face at the time, following the banishment letter, the fact that, immediately I said this allegation is wrong, and I had never ever threatened any of Hope Street's staff, and in particular, George. I disputed also the fact that I was banished, but on the wrong ground, but I wouldn't have any problem if I was banished, because I had used, as if, abusive language. But for George, apparently it wasn't enough. He went, the further, because he had to come with some explanation. The first meeting that I had with the CEO, Andrew Watkins, it's after like, this happened like three, four months, after the incident. His main response was, I came to the bottom line. Like, listen, if you want to fix the situation, and I'm receiving all the time the response of the gossip, you stole the phone, you know, everyone knows, all of a sudden I'm not at the café and they told them, eventually in this conversation, after explaining to him what had happened, et cetera and cetera. I told Andrew that listen here, I will go to court, it's not a joke and his response was, we will, I have to support my staff. I have to take, to give them back, and we will have a hopeless defence and this is like around, I reckon, May 2012. Or April, May and we have free legal service, so and still I continued, I had never since the, from the event I had never talked with George, not even one word or that he make attempt to approach me. Whether it was kind of don't be around, you are just if not, I'm calling the police and other kind of, but not as many, because I tried to avoid him, but I was in the area. I was in the area, and in a way I was watching him. I more a watcher, and I'm trying to keep myself quite reserved, this is my makeup, I believe. It was also involved the story with the foosball table, but they solved it, they cancelled the dealing at the last minute, just because I was around, and the foosball table is something that quite big, and they gave George gave the excuse that they were thinking that it was donated good. But I can show over the document that it's not consistent and whenever they took it outside, someone almost pick it this is later on, they never, they physically removed it prior to the time that they said that I had the time to remove it. Obviously world operation manager was involved but still saying all the time, that it's up to Andrew and whenever Andrew left I was raising the issue again with the new interim CEO, Warren sorry I can't really pronounce his surname, and they sent me a letter and this is prior, they sent me a letter of response, this was around the end of December. This is 24 December 2012, and basically trying to why not listening to what I'm saying, if you want like retrieve and fix what has been done, and still in the way that for me was kind of patronising, they respond in writing that whatever has passed, whatever had been happening is the past and we don't have any problem with you et cetera, et cetera, but not really answering my concern that I have a mark on my name and eventually the day after I respond to him of that letter, I believe it was 24 December 2012, I sent him an email and told him I provided it also today, the documents that I consider your letter more so than the insult -"" (T 65 - 68)

57At T 68 I asked if the plaintiff could stop for a moment, as I was having trouble keeping up with writing his evidence down, there being no transcript ordered at the time. Ms Chrysanthou asked how much longer he would be so that she could organise her witness (T 69). Although the plaintiff said at the time that he wanted to ""apologise to the Court"" (T 70) for taking so long, it later transpired that he was upset at being interrupted.

58The issues about which Ms Chrysanthou, in her short but effective cross-examination, asked the plaintiff, related to malice and damages. Relevant extracts are set out in the sections of this judgment below dealing with these aspects of the plaintiff's claim.

59The plaintiff's answers appear discursive and disjointed, but he disliked interruption and became angry at any challenge to his version of events or manner of presentation of the case. This included any adverse ruling on evidence, my request that he stop his narrative of evidence, or objection to how he proposed to present his evidence, and made the conduct of the proceedings difficult at times. It is for this reason that I have set out so much of the plaintiff's evidence in full. It is only by setting out the plaintiff's lengthy, and at times angry and discursive, evidence that an insight into his reasons for commencing this litigation can be understood.

The evidence of Sergeant Merritt

60The plaintiff called Sergeant Merritt as a witness. On the day in question, Sergeant Merritt was one of the two police officers who attended the scene to investigate the incident. According to the NSW Police incident log 234342-20012012 (Exhibit A), a call was received at 14:34 on 20 January 2012 and the informant stated that:

""There is a person at hope street refusing to leave and is being a pest.""

61In examination in chief, the plaintiff asked Sergeant Merritt the reason for her attending the scene and she acknowledged that a message along these lines had been broadcast. As she approached the Back Shed Café on the day in question, she could hear the plaintiff (whom she knew from prior encounters) yelling from some distance away, as she recorded in her notes. The plaintiff asked:

""Q. In paragraph 2, upon approach, police could hear the POI yelling at the victim. Do you remember how far he was from the victim, where I was, from Tom Uren Square? The victim basically was around the ..(not transcribable).. He was stating here that I was yelling, do you remember what kind of yelling, and how far I
HER HONOUR: That's several questions in one, let's deal with them one after the other.

Q. Can you remember how far away you were when you say on approach. How far away were you, and when you got there, how far away was Mr Bodenstein, from the person you call the victim?
A. They were standing close together.

Q. How far away were you?
A. It was when I approached the cafe. So as I approached, walking towards the cafe. It was 2012. I would have been within hearing, not far away.

PLAINTIFF

Q. Just stating that police separated, it's meaning, like, physically separated and, like, there was any kind of physical contact between the victim and the person of interest?
A. No.

Q. So it's just separating, it's to move?
A. As in, to move both parties to speak independently to them.

Q. The victim told this is part of a screed. The victim told police that he left his phone with a female colleague and that she told him that she had lost the phone. Are you stating here his phone? Do you know whose phone was it? Once again, the victim told police that he left his phone. Do you recall to whom this phone was belonging?
A. I believe it belongs to the victim.

Q. He told her not to worry and that he would just ring it. At this time the POI was in close vicinity. Upon hearing this, the POI has taken the phone from his pocket and handed it to the victim. Did you see what is mentioned here, the female colleague? Did you interview her?
A. I don't recall whether I spoke to her on that day. I spoke to George and I spoke to yourself.

Q. Yes.""

62Sergeant Merritt explained why, although she had spoken to the plaintiff, another police officer searched him:

""A. There was also another police officer there on that day.

Q. He was conducting the search, was he? Like, did you instruct him to conduct the search on the POI?
A. I wouldn't have instructed him.

Q. But he was conducting the search as far as you know?
A. He searched you. Yes. I didn't.

Q. For what reason?
A. You're a male so a male officer would search you."" (T 3-4)

63The plaintiff went on to ask (at T 5):

""PLAINTIFF

Q. I am just asking, like, why didn't you investigate the female colleague because this was the reason that the POI, he stated that she had given him the phone to hand it to the victim. My question is simple. Why didn't you ask her?
A. I don't recall asking her. It's not to say that she wasn't asked. I don't know what my partner would have said on that day and the victim at that time didn't want to proceed with a larceny.""

64The fact that the second defendant did not want to proceed with any charges in relation to the mobile phone is common ground in these proceedings. The police's radio broadcast messages described the reason for the call as being that a person was being a ""pest"" and would not leave the Back Shed Café premises despite requests to do so.

65The plaintiff asked of the Sergeant Merritt her impression of him (referring to himself in the third person as ""the victim"", ""the person of interest"" and finally as ""Mr Bodenstein"") (at T 7):

""Q. What was your impression of Mr Bodenstein when you had spoken to him on these numerous occasions?
A. I would have to go back to every individual occasion.

Q. Just an overall impression then?
A. An overall impression?

Q. Yes.
A. At times you've been quite confronting and this particular day in question you were quite aggressive.""

66The plaintiff put it to Sergeant Merritt that she was biased against him by reason of their prior encounters:

""Q. I'm talking about the general role at Woolloomooloo. Were you waking people that were sleeping, the homeless people, that sleep in Tom Uren Square. Was it part of your job in general, not the day of the incident, to wake them up in the morning? To wake the people that are sleeping around the police station and around Tom Uren Square, is it part of the police job, do you remember, when you were there? To wake up the homeless people, that sleep?
A. In the morning, if they were asleep in front of the police station, and I opened the police station down there, which is a shop front attached to Kings Cross local area command, yes, I would wake people up. People need clear access to the police station, that's correct.

Q. I reckon, as far as I remember, they were waking also nowadays, because of then, all the people they can sleeping, isn't it? All the people that are sleeping at certain point, the police wake them up. Noone was allowed to sleep after eight, 9 o'clock?
A. That's right, so people had access to the shops, to the cafes, to the police station.

Q. Do you remember what was the particular, how you were waking people up? Were you calling them by name, were you touching them, were you tapping them with your leg, do you remember? What was the method of waking those people up I'm talking about your specific method?

[Objection, overruled]

Q. Would you just mind telling the Court, just answer that last question, and say, the people who were sleeping outside the police in the morning, how did you wake them up?
A. I would just say, the police station's open, everything's opening up, people need to gain access, you're blocking the doorway, can you please get up now and move yourselves and your property."" (T 12 - 13)

67In cross-examination, Sergeant Merritt had the following to say regarding her observations of the plaintiff, both through their prior dealings and on the day in question:

""Q. On the day in question, on 20 January 2012, you've given evidence that upon approaching the scene, you saw Mr Bodenstein, or heard Mr Bodenstein, yelling at Mr Vlamakis?
A. That's correct.

Q. Do you have any recollection at all of the sorts of words he was using?
A. No, I just heard his raised voice.

Q. Did you hear any swearing at all?
A. I couldn't tell you.

Q. You said you'd had some dealings with the plaintiff in the past. Had it been your experience in the past that he would swear when he was upset?
A. Yes.

Q. When you say he was aggressive, in what manner do you say that he had previously been aggressive towards police?
A. Are we talking on this occasion?

Q. We'll start with this occasion?
A. He was just, highly agitated and aggressive. He was swearing, you know, the allegation was that he was swearing, and we arrived, we had to separate parties, which we would only do if someone is aggressive and the situation is volatile."" (T 10 - 11)

68Sergeant Merritt had an independent recollection of the events and did not need to look at her notes. She did not recall what swear words the plaintiff was using, but she was certain he was swearing. She described the events clearly and objectively.

69As a senior police officer with two decades of experience in the police force, most of it in the inner city, Sergeant Merritt had not only the experience but the understanding of the potential volatility of the situation. Her description of the plaintiff as ""highly agitated and aggressive"" was the observation of a police officer with many years of training and personal experience, and in the present proceedings was enlivened by her prior knowledge of the plaintiff.

70The picture painted by Sergeant Merritt was that of a volatile situation, where she and her colleague immediately took steps to put distance between the plaintiff and the second defendant. Her confirmation of the plaintiff's use of swearing confirms that he was in fact doing so, and I note the rules of HopeStreet's Back Shed Café warned that abuse and swearing would result in the police being called.

71Sergeant Merritt was not asked what the second defendant said about the mobile phone. It was clear from her evidence that her priority was the defusing of a volatile situation where she saw the plaintiff as a potential danger.

72Sergeant Merritt was an impressive witness whose objectivity and professionalism meant her evidence could be relied upon. I am satisfied that the plaintiff was highly agitated and aggressive, as well as swearing, that it was necessary to separate him from the second defendant, and that his conduct was intimidating.

The first defendant's evidence

73The only witness called by the first defendant was Reverend Kenneth James Hall, who is the pastor of Woolloomooloo Baptist Church and also a member of the community development team of the first defendant (T 125).

74He described the use of volunteers at the Back Shed Café as follows:

""Q. Who, thinking January 2012, who was able to volunteer at the Back Shed(?) Café?
A. Anyone from the community, both housed or homeless that seemed to be able to deal with people, seemed to be trustworthy, could make good coffee, and yes, that generally one or two agreed to the was okay with the policies and procedures of the volunteers."" (T 128)

75Reverend Hall was shown Exhibit 1, a still from an ABC report showing the plaintiff next to the coffee machine in the café, approximately where he was standing at the time of the conversation with the second defendant. On that coffee machine was a sign. The text was as follows:

76The sign referred to in Exhibit 1 reads as follows:

""Violence will not be tolerated

In the BackShed Café or the Op-Shop

This includes Verbal abuse, swearing and making threatening comments, weapons of any sorts and physical abuse.

All of the above will be dealt with in a serious manner, police will be called immediately and you will be barred from HopeStreet for two weeks minimum."" (Exhibit 1)

77I note the similarity of this text to the text in the café during the view. There were two such signs in the café during the view; only Exhibit 1 was there at the time of the matter complained of. When shown Exhibit 1, Reverend Hall confirmed that the sign on the coffee machine had been a fixture ""all the time"" not only when the image in March 2011 was captured, but also at the time of these events in January 2012. He went on to explain the purpose of the sign:

""Q. What was the purpose of the sign?
A. The purpose of the sign was to let anyone who came into the café know that unruly behaviour, abuse, swearing, use of drugs, alcohol, threatening violence or anything was not allowed, I couldn't read that but it probably said something about police will be informed if any of those rules are broken.""

78He then explained the ""banning"" process:

""A. The banning process would be if a person was deemed to be either too abusive or violent or whatever, that they would be asked to leave the café. Hopefully that would eventually happen but there had been times where we had to give a letter of ban to people for whatever period was deemed acceptable or suitable at the time.

Q. There's unruly behaviour, swearing. What would you call swearing? I mean there must be a bit of it floating around
A. There is, there's a lot of it floating around yes, swearing is very common down there, of course, but actual abuse of people is personal and directed and seeking to undermine or swearing violently towards a person.

Q. What about using demeaning language or demeaning somebody's race or sexuality?
A. Yes, that would be something which was always discouraged, yes.""

79He explained his reference to the drugs and alcohol problem:

""Q. You mentioned drugs and alcohol, what was Hope Street's policy in relation to any drugs and alcohol on the premises?
A. If we were aware that anyone was dealing drugs, that's not to say that we were aware of it all the time, I'm sure a lot has gone under our noses undetected, but if we were aware of anyone using or dealing drugs, we would ask them to leave, and every now and again for example as well, people have sat there with a bottle of beer or something and I've had to say to them ""Either put it away or walk away"", they can move quite close by and drink but certainly not sitting at our tables and chairs.

Q. It's not acceptable to have alcohol on the premises?
A. No.

Q. Would the staff of Hope Street have been aware of that policy?
A. Very aware yes.

Q. Were the volunteers made aware of that?
A. I assume that that would've been in the volunteer manual."" (T 128-129)

80Reverend Hall was asked whether a bowl of alcoholic punch would have been left by staff on the floor of the café on 20 January 2012. He said that this would never have been permitted because of the total alcohol ban. Reverend Hall went on to describe the procedures staff members followed if someone is threatened at the café: 

""Q. In addition to the sign I showed you, exhibit 1, which appeared in the café, are there any other procedures that staff are required to follow if they feel threatened by someone at the café?
A. Yes, there would be the procedure would be to if a person is being aggressive or whatever, abusive, to seek to calm them down, yeah, not try to enflame the situation at all, to seek to speak to them calmly and rationally, and hopefully either calm them down or lead them away from the premises or get them to leave the premises.

Q. Are staff encouraged to employ a time out method?
A. That may be encouraged depending on the situation yes.

HER HONOUR: Am I going to hear something about internal review procedures and follow ups or whatever?

CHRYSANTHOU: Yes your Honour, I'll come to that.

Q. If an incident occurs at the premises and police are called?
A. Yes.

Q. Are staff required to report that such an incident has occurred to the operations manager?
A. If it got to the point where police were called, that would've been the case, yes.

Q. To whom should such incidents have been reported in January 2012?
A. That would've been to Rod Ravenscroft, the operations manager.

Q. You are aware that Mr Le Marcus [sic - Vlamakis] completed a report in relation to an incident in January 2012?
A. I am aware of that, yep.

Q. Have you seen that report?
A. Yes, I have, yes.

EXHIBIT F SHOWN TO WITNESS

Q. If you just look at the first two pages of exhibit F is that what you would expect of an incident report that was required to be prepared?
A. Yes, that's very detailed.

Q. If you just look at the third page, we're just not quite sure what that is? Is that a followup from the incident report?
A. That would have just been a followup letter placed within the file.

Q. Having looked at that report is there anything that you are aware of that Mr Le Marcus [sic - Vlamakis] did that was outside of the scope of Hope Street's policies and procedures?
A. No."" (T 130-131)

81Reverend Hall was cross-examined by the plaintiff, but he essentially repeated the evidence he had given in examination in chief.

82Reverend Hall was an impressive witness. He described the many attempts that the first defendant had made to reconcile with the plaintiff, in the interest of the plaintiff's welfare as a homeless person. He presented as a person with great gifts of compassion and understanding of homeless and marginalised people. I accept him as a witness of credit and, where his evidence conflicts with that of the plaintiff, I prefer his evidence to that of the plaintiff.

The failure of the second defendant to give evidence

83Rule 29.7 UCPR provides that if an action is set down for hearing and one of the parties fails to appear, the court may proceed with the trial, so far as any claim for relief in the proceedings is concerned, or adjourn the trial. If it is the defendant who fails to appear, then the plaintiff may prove its claim so far as the burden of proof lies upon it and, if a plaintiff can establish that he or she is entitled to the relief claimed, and such other relief as is consistent with what is sought, the court may proceed to make final orders (see Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) at [29.7.2], referring to Stone v Smith (1887) 35 Ch D 188 and Kingdon v Kirk (1887) 37 Ch D 141; see also Satz v ACN 069 808 957 Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 365 at [64]). In an adversarial system, the responsibility for conduct of a case rests with the party concerned and failure to appear in court is not a matter into which courts should inquire.

84However, for a party to be relevantly absent, they must have had ""adequate"" notice of the hearing date (Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) at [29.7.2], citing Magjarraj v Asteron Life Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1433 at [22]).

85""Adequate"" notice was identified as being ""reasonable"" by Hallen J in French Consulting Pty Ltd v Donald [2011] NSWSC 584 at [14]:

""The clear purpose of UCPR rule 29.7 is the efficient dispatch of Court business. However, in despatching Court business, I cannot ignore the right of a defendant to be informed, or, at least, to be made aware, of a trial date. It is a fundamental principle that a party who may be adversely affected by the making of court orders has a right to be heard: Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5; (1944) 68 CLR 571, in which Rich J said (at 589):

It is a fundamental principle of natural justice, applicable to all courts whether superior or inferior, that a person against whom a claim or charge is made must be given a reasonable opportunity of appearing and presenting his case. If this principle be not observed, the person affected is entitled, ex debito justitiae, to have any determination which affects him set aside, and a court which finds that it has been led to purport to determine a matter in which there has been a failure to observe the principle has inherent jurisdiction to set its determination aside. ... In such a case that has been no valid trial at all.""

86Nor do I consider that litigants in person should be treated with less consideration than litigants who are legally represented. There have been many defamation actions where a defendant is self-represented; courts generally give a greater degree of leeway to such litigants: see Hallam v Ross [2011] QCA 274. As is noted in Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law and Practice (LexisNexis Australia) at [60,590], defendants represent themselves in about 20% of all defamation actions resulting in a jury trial or hearing, and around 10% of all defamation trials are undefended. Litigants in person are common in defamation actions. Both the courts and their opponents need to have the flexibility to cope with this.

87Mere service of the originating process is insufficient, as subsequent orders made without notice to opposing parties in litigation may result in the setting aside of judgment as irregular: Roach v B & W Steel Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 110; see also Italiano v Carbone [2005] NSWCA 177. Ultimately the court must reconcile case management principles with justice: Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd v Cassar [2009] NSWCA 30 at [36] - [47] per Hislop ACJ.

88The plaintiff said he did not serve the second defendant because he ""didn't have a clue"" where he was (T 53). He only served the statement of claim upon him because he ""met him by coincidence"" (T 52). He did not tell him about the subsequent motion dates, despite directions by the registrar to do so (see [7] above) and did not tell him about the hearing date. He gave three reasons for doing so: the judgment of McCallum J of 2 December 2013 relieved him of any such obligation; he had attempted to seek orders for substituted service on the first defendant in the Supreme Court; and that it would have been improper for him to contact the second defendant, or even search for him on the internet, and that the court (or the first defendant) should have done so.

89In her judgment of 2 December 2013 McCallum J noted that the statement of claim served on the second defendant had not informed him of the date on which he should attend the court. Her Honour said that as the statement of claim ""did contain the usual endorsement warning Mr Vlamakis that if a defence was not filed within 28 days, he would be in default and judgment could be entered against him without further notice"" (at [8]). Her Honour stated at [9] that she had ""drawn all of those matters to Mr Bodenstein's attention"". The plaintiff submits that this absolved him from any obligation to take any further step, including notifying the second defendant of further court dates, the change of court from the Supreme to the District Court, or the hearing date.

90However, her Honour's comments must be viewed in context. Her Honour was under the impression that the second defendant had now been served personally, and that service problems were no longer an issue. While her Honour does refer to default judgment being entered, she was clearly speaking in the generalised and informal way that is commonly the case in ex tempore judgments, and not expressing a concluded view that default judgment, sometimes said not to be available in defamation (French v Triple M Melbourne Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 36 at [18], citing Altarama v Forsyth [1981] 1 NSWLR 188) would be entered, particularly where other issues, such as quantum and the co-defendant's liability remained contested issues. Additionally, her Honour would have been aware, from the Registrar's orders on the file, that the registrar had told the plaintiff of his obligation to serve the second defendant, and refused an order for substituted service. 

91Although Mr Bodenstein is correct to say that he sought orders for substituted service in the Supreme Court, he did not tell me that the Supreme Court had refused to do so because of his non-compliance with orders to file an affidavit setting out the steps he had taken to find the second defendant. The plaintiff's alternate argument - that it would not have been proper for him to contact the second defendant personally, or even to look for him on the internet - is not only without legal basis but implausible for a litigant receiving pro bono advice about, inter alia, seeking orders for substituted service. 

92The first defendant is equally responsible. Although he was their former employee, the first defendant had ""done nothing"" to advise the second defendant about these proceedings: 

""CHRYSANTHOU: Not on our part your Honour, because it didn't concern us. So we have done nothing. Your Honour, I should say we have no contact with the second defendant, he hasn't been employed by my client since before the commencement of these proceedings. As we understand it he's not resident in Sydney."" (T 52)

93I am satisfied that both the plaintiff and the first defendant knew that the second defendant had gone to Melbourne and worked as a counsellor. The plaintiff heard ""on the grapevine"" that the second defendant was coming to Sydney for the period 20 - 28 September, and told the registrar on 20 September that he would be effecting personal service as a result, which he did. 

94The first defendant was similarly aware of the second defendant's current employment. In cross-examination, Reverend Hall stated:

""A. George wasn't sacked. George was from Melbourne, he'd come up from Melbourne pursuing a lady. That relationship hadn't worked out, probably get too personal for George here, but so he was born and raised in Melbourne and lived there all his life, he sought reemployment back in Melbourne and left in November to begin a role as a school counsellor at a high school in the Melbourne area in January 2013. He wasn't sacked.""

95Reverend Hall went on to say that the second defendant had visited the first defendant's premises fairly recently, namely ""three or four months ago"" (T 134) and, during their brief conversation had stated that he was still living in Melbourne. Reverend Hall said he had not mentioned the case to him (T 134).

96I am satisfied that both the plaintiff (who has computer skills and regular access to a computer) and the first defendant knew, if not the second defendant's precise whereabouts, sufficient information to find him by the most cursory of internet searches. While I have been told by Ms Chrysanthou from the bar table that the second defendant, who was able to be contacted more or less instantaneously by telephone, does not wish to participate in these proceedings, there is no evidence that he knew prior to being telephoned of this hearing taking place, or appreciates that he may be personally liable for damages. 

97Ultimately it is the first defendant who suffers most from his absence, in that the first defendant cannot call the second defendant for the purpose of establishing the elements necessary to defeat a claim by the plaintiff of malice. This is because the first defendant was relying upon the fact that the plaintiff had not filed a Reply in defeasance to malice as being a strike-out point. The fact that the plaintiff has not filed a Reply would be significant if the plaintiff had failed to comply with a timetable for the filing of a Reply, as Ms Chrysanthou previously told me (at directions hearings on 11 April and 4 July 2014) was the case. A search of the file and the orders made shows no such order was ever made and, as the plaintiff is a litigant in person, this is the kind of issue where the court will always be flexible. The plaintiff submits, and I accept, that the references to malice in his statement of claim are sufficient to enable him to lead evidence of malice. I have accepted his entitlement to rely upon the evidence he has led and the contents of his statement of claim in this regard (and it is for this reason that the notice of motion he attempted to file on 28 July 2014 is unnecessary). Where matters were raised in the plaintiff's submissions in relation to malice that took the first defendant by surprise, I permitted Ms Chrysanthou leave to provide short written submissions in reply, which have been served on the plaintiff.

98However, the plaintiff must similarly accept that his failure to notify the second defendant of the hearing date should deprive him of the evidentiary advantages that might flow if the second defendant had been told of the hearing date and, in those circumstances, elected not to attend (for example, a Jones v Dunkel presumption (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298)).

99In practical terms, the parties' failure to tell the second defendant that the hearing is on can be resolved by the first defendant accepting vicarious liability. However, the practice of not telling a party to litigation that proceedings are on foot, which seems to be increasingly common in defamation actions, is not to be encouraged. The problems caused by such conduct can be seen in several recent defamation proceedings, such as Kim v Lee [2012] NZCA 248; Kim v Lee [2012] NZCA 600.

The defences

100The Amended Defence filed on 19 February 2014 pleads the following defences:

(a)A plea that neither publication was made by the first defendant (now abandoned);

(b)Absolute privilege (paragraph 8) (now abandoned);

(c)Qualified privilege at common law (paragraph 9);

(d)Qualified privilege pursuant to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (paragraph 10);

(e)Section 33 unlikelihood of harm (now abandoned).

101In relation to mitigation of damages, the first defendant relies upon s 38(1)(a) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).

Qualified privilege at common law

102The common law's recognition that communications are protected where a person has an interest or a duty (legal, social or moral) to make a statement on an occasion where the recipient has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it, is set out in Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 334 per Lord Atkinson. The NSW Court of Appeal, in Malouf v Prince [2014] NSWCA 12, has helpfully set out the relevant principles.

103Jordan CJ explained, in Andreyevich v Kosovich (1947) 47 SR(NSW) 357 at 363, that a publisher should demonstrate by evidence ""that both the givers and the receivers of the defamatory information had a special and reciprocal interest in its subject matter, of such a kind that it was desirable as a matter of public policy... that it should be made with impunity, notwithstanding that it was defamatory of a third party"" (cited in Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5; (2004) 218 CLR 366 at [140] and [55]). The defamatory imputations must be ""sufficiently connected to the privileged occasion"" (Bashford at [27]) or ""germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion"" (Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 321). It is not essential that the imputations be central to the matter being communicated: see Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon [2011] HCA 30; (2011) 243 CLR 298 at [20]-[21].

104As Exhibit 1 shows, when the plaintiff was standing next to the coffee machine making himself a coffee, he was standing beside the notice which warned that ""verbal abuse"" as well as swearing and ""making threatening comments"" as well as more serious behaviour, would result in police being called immediately and a ban from the premises for ""two weeks minimum"". In communicating with the police the second defendant was not acting as a volunteer (Papaconstuntinos v Holmes à Court (2012) 249 CLR 534 at [32]) but in the course of carrying out his employer's clear and public instructions.

The first publication

105 A complaint to police is made on an occasion of qualified privilege: Mann v O'Neil (1997) 191 CLR 204 at 213 - 4; Shiels v Manny [2012] ACTA 22 at [35] and [46] - [47]. As Reverend Hall explained, the first defendant had a publicly stated policy, brought to the attention of café users by the notice, of calling the police when such conduct occurred. There would not be many cafes which had this kind of sign on the wall; it was put there as part of the operation of a drop-in centre for homeless and marginalised people who might be motivated by problems such as drugs or mental illness, in circumstances where this rule was there to protect everyone. The plaintiff acknowledged that the second defendant had to call the police ""pretty regularly"" to the Back Shed Café (T 34).

106As to the statements made by the second defendant to Sergeant Merritt, her evidence was that when she arrived some minutes later, the plaintiff was still ""yelling at"" the second defendant (T 7) and that the situation was ""quite volatile"" (T 11). 

107I am satisfied that Sergeant Merritt (and any police officer with her, although no other person appears to have heard what the second defendant said) had a duty to receive that information and an interest in receiving it. The second defendant had a duty to report the plaintiff's conduct, as well as an interest, in that it was his employer's phone and café, and the plaintiff's aggression was directed towards him. In addition, as Exhibit 1 shows, it was the policy of the first defendant that the police be called in such circumstances, and this policy was, as Reverend Hall explained, mandatory.

The second publication

108As to the second publication, the duty/interest relationship between an employer and employee in relation to internal communications made concerning matters arising as part of employment is clear: Hunt v Great Northern Railway [1891] 2 QB 189 at 191. Reverend Hall stated that where the police were called, a report by the second defendant to his immediate superior was required. It is clear, from the internal documentation of the first defendant, that the second defendant's call to police and the circumstances leading to and resulting from it were examined and reconsidered by the first defendant. 

109I am satisfied that the second defendant was following the first defendant's procedures and policies in reporting the incident to Mr Ravenscroft and that the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege at common law.

Conclusions concerning the defence of qualified privilege at common law

110As I am satisfied that each of these publications was made on a protected occasion, the question of malice arises. This is discussed in more detail below. As malice is also relevant to the s 30 defence, I shall deal with that defence before turning to the issue of malice.

The section 30 defence

111Section 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides:

""30 Defence of qualified privilege for provision of certain information

(1) There is a defence of qualified privilege for the publication of defamatory matter to a person (the ""recipient"") if the defendant proves that:

(a) the recipient has an interest or apparent interest in having information on some subject, and

(b) the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to the recipient information on that subject, and

(c) the conduct of the defendant in publishing that matter is reasonable in the circumstances.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a recipient has an apparent interest in having information on some subject if, and only if, at the time of the publication in question, the defendant believes on reasonable grounds that the recipient has that interest.

(3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1) whether the conduct of the defendant in publishing matter about a person is reasonable in the circumstances, a court may take into account:

(a) the extent to which the matter published is of public interest, and

(b) the extent to which the matter published relates to the performance of the public functions or activities of the person, and

(c) the seriousness of any defamatory imputation carried by the matter published, and

(d) the extent to which the matter published distinguishes between suspicions, allegations and proven facts, and

(e) whether it was in the public interest in the circumstances for the matter published to be published expeditiously, and

(f) the nature of the business environment in which the defendant operates, and

(g) the sources of the information in the matter published and the integrity of those sources, and

(h) whether the matter published contained the substance of the person's side of the story and, if not, whether a reasonable attempt was made by the defendant to obtain and publish a response from the person, and

(i) any other steps taken to verify the information in the matter published, and

(j) any other circumstances that the court considers relevant.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a defence of qualified privilege under subsection (1) is defeated if the plaintiff proves that the publication of the defamatory matter was actuated by malice.

(5) However, a defence of qualified privilege under subsection (1) is not defeated merely because the defamatory matter was published for reward.""

First matter complained of

112Ms Chrysanthou has helpfully summarised the conduct of the second defendant relied upon by the first defendant as being conduct that was being reasonable in the circumstances for the purposes of s 30(3):

(a)He first made the allegation to the plaintiff (thus giving him an opportunity to respond);

(b)The plaintiff did not offer an explanation, instead verbally abused the second defendant;

(c)The second defendant invited the plaintiff to take a 15 minute time out, which he declined to do;

(d)The second defendant warned the plaintiff that he would call the police twice before doing so;

(e)The plaintiff did not then take the opportunity to give an explanation as to why the phone was in his pocket;

(f)The second defendant asked the plaintiff to leave, which he declined to do;

(g)The plaintiff was yelling at the second defendant, but the second defendant was at all times softly spoken (T 34 line 25);

(h)Upon the publication by the second defendant to the police the plaintiff was present and able to give his version of events to the police;

(i)The publication was limited to one person;

(j)It is apparent that the second defendant believed the allegation to be true - at no time did the plaintiff give an explanation as to why he had the phone in his pocket. In any event, such a belief is presumed unless rebutted by the plaintiff (see Roberts v Bass (2002) 212 CLR 1 at [96] - [97]);

(k)The café is located in what the plaintiff told the court is a ""rough"" area and it was thus appropriate to call the police and report the incident to them;

(l)The second defendant was at all times conducting himself in accordance with the policies of the first defendant (Exhibit 1).

113Applying these facts to the s 30 checklist, it is clear that every single item in that checklist can be made out. It is not necessary for a defendant to make out every item in the list (LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah [2011] NSWCA 370), but I am satisfied that each of these requirements has been met in this case.

114The sole remaining issue in relation to s 30 is whether any finding should be made as to malice. The difficult relationship of issues relating to malice and s 30 do not arise in this case by reason of my finding, set out below, that the second defendant was not motivated by malice.

115As previously noted, it is not necessary for the second defendant to give evidence for the defence to be successful, for the reasons explained by Bergin AJA in LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah, supra, and by Higgins CJ in Lamont v Dwyer, supra. I have set out the relevant section of his Honour's judgment in more detail below.

The second matter complained of

116The second matter complained of is an even clearer example of a publication which was reasonable, in that it was a recording of an incident by the second defendant in the form of an incident report to his supervisor (Exhibit F). The death threats allegation had been given to police and the plaintiff had been given an opportunity to (and did) deny it, but the entitlement of the first defendant to receive a full report setting out the relevant facts and matters was important. Ms Chrysanthou in her submissions states that the publication was merely a recitation of what occurred without further material or commentary, and that the second defendant was obliged to make it.

117It might be said that the second defendant was obliged to set out that these allegations had been denied by the plaintiff in the second matter complained of. However, it is by no means clear that the second defendant was aware of this. On the plaintiff's own version, all the second defendant received from him was abuse, and not an explanation or a denial of any kind, either in relation to the whereabouts of the phone or in relation to the death threats. In the circumstances where the highly excited plaintiff was, on his own version, referring to ""killing Hope Street"", it is entirely possible that the second defendant misheard him and took it as a death threat. If so, his belief that he had been threatened with being killed would be entirely understandable. 

118However, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, by reason of the evidence principally of Sergeant Merritt, that the plaintiff did indeed threaten to kill the second defendant, on more than one occasion. In those circumstances, it was reasonable of the second defendant, conformably with his duties as an employee of the first defendant, to report those threats to his supervisor. Given the at times dangerous nature of the work carried out by the first defendant in what even the plaintiff called a ""rough"" area of the city, the conduct of the second defendant in reporting these matters was reasonable.

119Accordingly, subject to my findings in relation to malice below, I am satisfied that the publication of both matters complained of was reasonable in the circumstances. This brings me to the issue of malice, which is relevant to both defences, but in particular to the defence of qualified privilege at common law. 

120I am conscious of the fact that the first defendant is at a real disadvantage in this regard. The plaintiff has clearly had a considerable amount of pro bono legal advice and he must have understood at some stage during that legal advice, given his familiarity with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) and his ability to include such complex claims as compelled republication, that a Reply particularising malice was necessary. His failure to file any Reply, or particularise malice in an appropriate way, cannot be explained by his complaint about the alleged inconsistency between UCPR r 14.30 and r 14.4 (the provision concerning the filing of a Reply). The very sophistication of this argument undermines his claim that he is a litigant in person with limited knowledge of the rules.

121Having noted these matters, I now consider the issue of malice in relation to both publications.

Malice

122Malice is a state of mind (Aldridge v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 544 at 550 per Hunt J) at the time the publication takes place. It is the defendant's primary or predominant motive in publishing the remark that is determinative: Roberts v Bass (2002) 212 CLR 1; McKenzie v Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 42; Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174.

123Malice may be found if there is evidence of ""any improper motive or purpose that induces the defendant to use the occasion of qualified privilege to defame the plaintiff"" (Roberts v Bass at 30). It is not to ""be confused with the defendant's ill-will, knowledge of falsity, recklessness, lack of belief in the defamatory statement, bias, prejudice or any other motive than duty or interest for making the publication"" (Roberts v Bass at 31). This does not mean that each of these matters is irrelevant; if proved, any of these elements usually provides a premise for inferring that the defendant was actuated by an improper motive in making the publication. Proof that the defendant knew that a defamatory statement made on an occasion of qualified privilege was untrue may be conclusive (Roberts v Bass at 32).

124However, proof of the defendant's ill-will, prejudice, bias, recklessness, lack of belief in truth (Roberts v Bass at 35-36) or improper motive is not sufficient to establish malice. The evidence or the publication must also show grounds for concluding that the ill-will, lack of belief in the truth of the publication, recklessness, bias, prejudice or other motive existed on the privileged occasion and also actuated the publication.

125Even actual knowledge or a belief that the defamatory statement was false will not destroy the privilege, if the defendant was under a legal duty to make the communication. In such cases, the actual truth is not a matter that concerns the defendant, and provides no ground for inferring that the publication was actuated by an improper motive. For example, a police officer who is bound to report statements concerning other officers to a superior will not lose the protection of the privilege even though he or she knows or believes that the statement is false and defamatory, unless the officer falsified the information. Conversely, even if the defendant believes that the defamatory statement is true, malice will be established by proof that the publication was actuated by a motive foreign to the privileged occasion. That is because qualified privilege can only be destroyed by ""the existence of an improper motive that actuates the publication"" (Roberts v Bass at 31).

126In Gross v Weston (2007) 69 NSWLR 279 at 297, Hunt A-JA explained these propositions as follows:

""(i) Except where the defendant was under a legal duty to publish the matter complained of, the defendant's knowledge that it was false is ordinarily conclusive evidence that the publication was actuated by an improper motive.

(ii) Recklessness in the publication of the matter complained of does not establish knowledge of its falsity unless it amounts to wilful blindness on the part of the defendant which the law equates with knowledge.

(iii) Recklessness - when present with other evidence - may neverthe-less be relevant to whether the defendant had an improper motive which actuated the publication.

(iv) If a plaintiff's case rises no higher than evidence that the defendant did not have a positive belief in the truth of what he published, there is no evidence that its publication was actuated by an improper motive.

(v) The absence of a positive belief in the truth of what was published may nevertheless be relevant - with other evidence - to whether the defendant's improper motive actuated the publication, but it will not establish that fact by itself.

(vi) Where the plaintiff relies on the defendant's knowledge of the falsity of the matter complained of to establish an improper motive, it is unnecessary to identify that improper motive, as there can be no proper motive in those circumstances unless the defendant has a duty to publish the matter complained of.""

127The plaintiff's case is that the second defendant was motivated by prior hostility and ill will to make up the claim that he had stolen his phone and use this as an excuse to have the plaintiff banned from HopeStreet. Even if the plaintiff could establish prior hostility and ill will (and I have set out below the reasons why, given the conflicting explanations for this ill will, I am not satisfied in this regard), that would be insufficient to establish malice, as Ms Chrysanthou has helpfully pointed out in her written submissions.

128In particular, as was the case in Lamont v Dwyer, supra, I am satisfied that the second defendant believed in the truth of what he was saying, notwithstanding the fact that he is not here to give that evidence. On the plaintiff's own version of events, he had offered the plaintiff a chance to explain why (when Dianne was shouting in the background that the phone had been stolen) the plaintiff had been seen taking the phone out of his pocket. He was never given an explanation and instead was abused, which triggered the HopeStreet policy about calling police and banning the person using verbal abuse.

Recklessness and other extreme behaviour

129Evidence of recklessness as to whether the matter complained of was true or false may amount to malice. In Roberts v Bass the High Court notes (at 34) that:

""In exceptional cases, the sheer recklessness of the defendant in making the defamatory statement, may justify a finding of malice. In other cases, recklessness in combination with other factors may persuade the court that the publication was actuated by malice. In the law of qualified privilege, as in other areas of the law, the defendant's recklessness may be so gross as to constitute wilful blindness, which the law will treat as equivalent to knowledge. ""When a person deliberately refrains from making inquiries because he prefers not to have the result, when he wilfully shuts his eyes for fear that he may learn the truth"", said this Court in R v Crabbe, ""he may for some purposes be treated as having the knowledge which he deliberately abstained from acquiring."" In less extreme cases, recklessness, when present with other factors, may be cogent evidence that the defendant used the occasion for some improper motive. This is particularly so when the recklessness is associated with unreasoning prejudice on the part of the defendant.""

130In Gross v Weston Hunt A-JA at 295 explained:

""Recklessness, short of a wilful blindness, is not enough to destroy the defence of qualified privilege. In exceptional circumstances, the sheer recklessness of the defendant in making the defamatory statement may justify a finding of malice [improper motive]. The defendant's conduct may be so gross as to constitute wilful blindness, which the law will treat as equivalent to knowledge.

In less extreme cases, recklessness - when present with other factors - may be cogent evidence that the defendant used the occasion for some improper motive. This is particularly so when the recklessness is associated with unreasoning prejudice on the part of the defendant."" (citations omitted)

131Whether a person is reckless will depend on the facts of the case, including the occasion and circumstances giving rise to the defamatory statements, the nature of the information and the basis upon which the claim of privilege is made. As malice is defined as an ""improper purpose"", recklessness does not meet the test unless it amounts to ""wilful blindness"" which is considered the equivalent of knowledge of falsity: Gross v Weston at 295 per Hunt A-JA, referring to the principles laid down in Roberts v Bass.

132There is no evidence of recklessness here. To the contrary, the second defendant invited an explanation, spoke calmly and quietly, and gave the plaintiff a chance to explain himself. The plaintiff answered with abuse and dared him to call the police.

133I have put these findings ahead of the evidence because the nature of the evidence of malice, much of it hearsay (PW v MS, supra, at [20] - [22]), and all of it conflicting, is so weak as not to amount to a scintilla of malice. I now set out what that evidence is.

Evidence of Malice

134Malice must be proved by drawing inferences from proved facts (McKenzie v Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd, supra, at 51 per Clarke JA) and proof is not confined to the publication. Malice is a state of mind able to be inferred from the acts, conduct or expressions of the defendant or of persons whose acts, conduct and expressions are binding on the defendant. 

135This means it is necessary to inquire into the state of mind of the defendant at the time of publication and to evaluate all those circumstances surrounding its publication, including events before and after the publication (Turner v MGM Pictures Ltd [1950] 1 All ER 449 at 455).

136However, a court will be slow to find evidence of malice because to do so is to restrict the protection offered by law to such occasions: Calwell v Ipec Australia Ltd (1975) 135 CLR 321; per Mahoney JA in King v McKenzie (1991) Aust Torts Reports 81-118 (imposing a Briginshaw standard (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336)).

137Evidence of the defendant's conduct and motivation may include evidence of hostility between the defendant and plaintiff, further repetition by the defendant, and whether the statements were gratuitously volunteered. The fact that an allegation is volunteered and not solicited may be considered with other evidence in supporting an inference that a defendant is motivated by malice.

The plaintiff's evidence of malice

138The plaintiff's evidence of malice, according to his closing submissions, was the material set out in the statement of claim at paragraph 10, namely that the second defendant conducted a systematic and continuous campaign to ridicule and injure the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of his friends and colleagues in the local community, to cause him to be shunned and avoided and to put him in danger of acquiring a criminal record which would have been extremely prejudicial to his immigration status.

139What was this conduct? At the end of his oral submissions, the plaintiff said that the malice resulted from the second defendant's anger that the plaintiff had spoken to the second defendant's supervisor about an ""incident of temper loss with Trish and Cookie, regarding [the second defendant] using physical force"" (T 227). This conversation occurred two days before the publication of the matters complained of, and the predominant motive for the second defendant calling the police was not because of the missing phone or the abuse, but because of his malice towards the plaintiff.

140The plaintiff's evidence about these events at T 25 was:

""I saw him really using force with two customers, one was, his name is Cookie, that was drinking and basically no drink are allowed at the coffee shop, or at sitting outside. So, he really, instead of engaging and convincing him, he really started dragging his chair, and dragging his physical contact. The same he did with a woman, a tranny, her name is Trish. Once again, physical, grabbing chairs, and it's kind of, he had nonstop incidents.""

141However, the plaintiff went on to make clear, in his evidence at T 26, that the discussion he had with the second defendant's supervisor two days beforehand related to the second defendant saying that the Art Space was going to be closed down (about which the plaintiff was angry, as he thought the second defendant was wrong), and that the second defendant was taking excessive amounts of Oz Harvest produce (these were free food bags prepared for the homeless):

""At a certain point of time, and this was on the 18th, on Wednesday, this is the first huge incident that I had with him, and he was present. This was outside the Art Space. I and he was with him, and with the CEO at the time, Andrew Watkins. I stipulate my, I'm really concerned, my complaints, and it started with the fact that he was saying that the Art Space is going to be shut down and I was claiming at the time that it's not true, and this was what ignite the discussion, my complaints with the CEO and the CEO basically says that it's not on the cards, because what had happened at that certain point of time, of the incident of two days prior, is that they had a job agency, the Hostel had a job agency in Woolloomooloo, and it was flooded with water, rain water. So they moved their activity to the Art Space and basically the second defendant said that, that's it, the Art Space won't be used anymore by artists and when I raised it with the CEO, he said that it's completely wrong. Funny enough, I reckon this was one of the things that eventually, the second defendant was right, it was, one year afterwards, afterwards, one year afterwards, the art place really was shut down. This is happened two days before the incident, the second defendant was present. It was outside the Art Space, and I raised all of what I had just mentioned, also the fact that he was taking excessive, to my opinion, excessive amount of Oz Harvest's product. This was on the Friday, on my shift, to himself. The fact that he was going, on Wednesday, instead of taking people to aerobics was going just by himself, to have, this is through Hope Street, through the organisation, they have a free entry to the swimming pool, and so we had to take, he was going to have swimming lessons and other incidents. I was quite full on, I knew the, quite well, and I think that I had quite good rapport with the CEO and this was at Wednesday, two days before the incident.""

142In fact the Art Space was closed down at about that time, but for the reasons that Reverend Hall gave, and this event had nothing to do with the second defendant. Reverend Hall's evidence indicates that the Hope Street administration staff were generally aware that the generous benefactor who had donated the space had sold the building, and it was in fact being shut down prior to the publication of the matters complained of. There was no question of anyone at HopeStreet blaming the second defendant for this event and any connections between the plaintiff's complaints to HopeStreet to this effect and alleged malice by the second defendant are fanciful. 

143The evidence about the second defendant taking food bags was difficult to follow, but I understand the plaintiff to submit that because Dianne, the worker filling in for him who claimed that he stole the HopeStreet phone, missed out on a food bag during the previous week, this was the second defendant's fault (T 29 - 30). Another HopeStreet regular had told the second defendant that she was taking a bag for Dianne, and apparently this was correct. The plaintiff said it was because of this incident two days beforehand (T 31) that he was reluctant to approach the second defendant to hand over the phone, and instead went back to the Matthew Talbot Hostel. The plaintiff gave other reasons elsewhere in his evidence for his reluctance to approach the second defendant to hand over the phone, and this reason was no more convincing than those.

144This is contradicted by the plaintiff's claim in the original statement of claim in paragraph 5, which recites that the plaintiff and second defendant had a good relationship, with the second defendant calling the plaintiff a priest due to his perceived position in the community, but that:

""A turn for the worse occurred when [the second defendant] shared with [the plaintiff] his accusation that Dianne was stealing money, and from then onward their relationship deteriorated further following other incidents.""

145There is further material about this incident in paragraph 6 of the statement of claim:

""Tensions ensued between [the plaintiff and the second defendant] after the accusation made by [the second defendant] that [Dianne] stole money following which she burst into tears. The tension grew further as [Dianne' claimed that: her phone was stolen during one of the shifts, she had an incident that occurred in the [café] toilet [deleted] & the fact that [the plaintiff' didn't keep aside an Oz Harvest produce bag for her.""

146Apart from a reference to a dispute between the plaintiff and Dianne about an Oz Harvest bag (for which the plaintiff somehow blamed the second defendant) these incidents were not referred to during the hearing, let alone as being matters relevant to malice. 

147In paragraph 5 of the statement of claim, after referring to the theft allegations the second defendant allegedly made about Dianne, he goes on to say that:

""On 18 January 2012, [the plaintiff' raised to [sic] the Director of HSUC, Mr Andrew Dawkins, the following issues, regarding [the second defendant] with him being present at the time: his spreading or rumours & gossip, making disparaging [note: this word is deleted in the pleading] about people's appearance, his telling of lies about other incidents of temper loss, misbehaviour and bad language.""

148Mr Dawkins was present on the day of these events, and spoke at length to the plaintiff about his banning (T 21, 106). The plaintiff did not give evidence about having had this conversation on 18 January with Mr Dawkins, or ask the Reverend Hall about it, and did not mention his name until the end of his submissions (at T 225). Ms Chrysanthou said there were ""no names"" in the statement of claim, and she was unsure whom the plaintiff said he had had the conversation with. I granted her leave to provide further submissions, because I had a recollection of Mr Dawkins' name being in the statement of claim, which is in fact the case. However, the version of the conversation that the plaintiff says he had with him in the statement of claim is simply not in evidence.

149The plaintiff gave yet another version of his complaint made two days beforehand at T 65, when he said that the ""tipping point"" leading to his complaint was the conduct of the second defendant at local action group meetings:

""Also the lovely excursion that I participate, and it came out that eventually after basically a year, understand that I'm kind of ..(not transcribable).. because I raised the issue, it's like carrying me to a tipping point when I raised two days before the incident, basically my complaints, but obviously we got involved, the action group, the local action group was altogether just for local people that are caring and there was another three student that came on and off and I joined this action group, I'm not like enthusiastic going with the signs outside, I was doubtful to start with when I joined, it wasn't my initiative, it was Sage's initiative which was also a worker, a lovely worker of Hope Street and people really you can see by the material that was made, have best intention and intelligence and even in that small group, George couldn't fit himself and Carl was my computer tutor and was coming after I requested, ""Okay come, you have Woolloomooloo Greenings"" and they know he's a genius and it wouldn't take a it just came out that usually we're holding the meeting from three to around 4.30 and it's running late into dinnertime and I'm eating at that time, I'm eating out of the hands of agencies all around, without agencies I wouldn't be here and just like I took ten minutes and coming back, all of a sudden they have kind of a fight and whatever as it document itself, and then Carl go on and on and basically quit the group and eventually the group and I think it's also mentioned in and George was very articulated [sic], he knows his way and this is why I wrote as an exhibit the email, the way that he can explain himself, very articulated [sic], though it's obviously not what I can consider constructive, but he know to express himself.""

150It was because of ""the incident before"" (at T 103) that the plaintiff ""wasn't happy"" with the plaintiff on the day of publication of the matters complained of:

""Q. You were very upset, weren't you?
A. I was surprised, I was disappointed but to an extent. It's not an event that is outside of the whole context like today before I made complaint there was incident before but whether I was upset, I wasn't happy.""

151The issues relevant to malice ultimately put to the court, at the end of final submissions, were that the plaintiff ""got in physical engagement with two customers outside the café"" (T 190) and this submission:

""I would like to remind the court that two days beforehand, and even prior to that, a few weeks, and mainly two days beforehand, I basically confronted Mr Vlamakis [sic] behaviour, he was present, and I raised a few serious issues regarding his, let's say, performance, and he was definitely having a motive.""

152These events are the circumstances in which the second defendant used physical force to restrain a drunken homeless person named Cookie and to require a person named ""Trish the Tranny"" to leave the premises. Given Reverend Hall's evidence about the strict manner in which alcohol and abusive conduct were not permitted in the café, it is hard to understand how the plaintiff's complaint that the second defendant should have reasoned with them instead of removing them by force when they would not leave is evidence of the second defendant ""having a motive"". As the plaintiff himself acknowledged, in the course of the view of the site of publication, this is a rough and dangerous part of Sydney.

The failure of the second defendant to give evidence

153Is it essential that the second defendant give evidence in relation to malice issues? In Lamont v Dwyer, supra, the sole defendant, who was acting for himself, did not appear. Higgins CJ, noting the burden of proof lay on the plaintiff, approached the issue of malice as follows:

""[102] The plaintiff points to the defendant's express statement that his intent was to damage HIA. However, a primary indicator of malice is knowledge of the falsity of the imputations or the facts supporting them.

[103] The classic statement is to be found in Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135, per Lord Diplock, at 149-150:

The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be inferred from what he did or said or knew. If it be proved that he did not believe what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice ...

[104] That is subject to the qualification his Lordship expresses, at 150:

Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion - which is presumed unless the contrary is proved - may not be sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest, but to give vent to his personal spite or ill will towards the person he defames.

[105] I am not persuaded that the defendant had no honest belief in the truth of his two assertions. I would not elevate them to the level pleaded. They are, simply, that the plaintiff blocked or diminished the defendant's representations to Minister Bailey and the Federal Government and did so because he was to be recruited by HIA.

[106] As the defendant conceded, his choice of language was ""robust"" but I bear in mind that it was in the course of political exchanges albeit intended to be shared with a significant section of the public. See, for example, Calwell v Ipec Australia Ltd (1975) 135 CLR 321 at 332-5 per Mason J (at 332):

At common law it has been repeatedly said that a court should not be quick to find evidence of malice in the terms of defamatory material published on a privileged occasion because so to do would restrict considerably, if not defeat, the protection which the law confers on privileged communications.

[107] Bearing those warnings in mind, I am not persuaded that the plaintiff has made out a case of malice on the part of the defendant. The defendant's focus was, and remained, on the reform of the builders' warranty insurance issue, an issue that he considered was opposed by HIA for reasons of its own self-interest. Whether that was true or not, it was, in itself, a reasonable conclusion.""

154Is it essential for the second defendant to have filed a defence pleading qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30, or is the (admittedly belated) acceptance by the first defendant of vicarious liability sufficient? It is clear from Reverend Hall's evidence that each of these publications was made in the course of the second defendant's duty. 

155I am only aware of one other case where findings of absence of malice have been made in circumstances where no qualified privilege defence has been filed. In LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah, supra, Bergin AJA set aside a finding of malice, on the basis that the appellant's store employees (who did not give evidence) could not be said to have been motivated by malice. The plaintiff's case for defamation lay against the police, not against the LVMH store; as no claim for defamation was brought against LVMH (who were not, in fact, the appellants, but respondents to a cross-appeal concerning indemnity), no qualified privilege defence had been filed. While this judgment is of little assistance, it is by no means a universal rule that a defendant must both file a defence and be available for cross-examination in order for a defence of qualified privilege to succeed.

156Essentially, however, the problem the plaintiff must grapple with is that he failed to file a Reply, in circumstances where the Supreme Court gave him every assistance with case management of his claim, and failed to tell the second defendant that the case was listed for hearing. As to the first point, there are very few cases where a plaintiff has not filed a Reply where a defence of qualified privilege is pleaded. In Beck v Brener (District Court of NSW, Bozic SC DCJ, 5 May 2011, published by the Gazette of Law and Journalism), the trial judge was satisfied that the publications were made on protected occasions and entered a verdict for the defendants. There is no mention of a Reply or of malice, and clearly no Reply was filed (unusually, the plaintiff did not give evidence). Leave to appeal was refused. The facts of the case are an important warning of the importance of filing a Reply. As to the second, there is a degree of artificiality in criticising a defendant for failing to give evidence when he or she has not been told that the proceedings have been listed for hearing.

The first matter complained of

157On the plaintiff's own evidence, the person who said the phone was stolen was Dianne, not the second defendant. The plaintiff went off with the HopeStreet mobile phone in his pocket for two hours on the busiest day for the café and forgot he had it. This caused Dianne to say, when she saw the plaintiff return to the café, that someone had stolen the phone. When the second defendant asked ""What is my phone doing in your pocket?"" after the plaintiff took the phone out of his pocket, instead of apologising for forgetting about the phone, the plaintiff became abusive, saying ""how dare you"" and calling him a ""poofter"" or ""poofty"". The plaintiff agrees that he was asked to take a 15-minute time out and refused, and that he was warned more than once that police would be called. He was aware that this was café policy and of there being a sign to this effect on the wall. In fact he invited the second defendant to call the police.

158The description of the plaintiff's conduct and demeanour by Sergeant Merritt is fatal to the plaintiff's case. 

159It is essential for the plaintiff to show that the improper motive was predominant. Even if the second defendant had mixed motives, that would be insufficient. However, I am satisfied that all of the evidence of the circumstances of the first publication tell against there being any improper motive by the second defendant. He was struggling to deal with an aggressive, yelling man who abused him. It is irrelevant whether ""fuck off"" is slang; the rest of what the plaintiff said was offensive, intimidating and uncalled for.

160The plea of malice must fail in relation to the first matter complained of.

The second publication

161It was incumbent upon the second defendant, having called the police, to make his report to his supervisor, Mr Ravenscroft (T 131). Apart from the material relating to the threats to kill him (the plaintiff says he says ""you are killing HopeStreet""), there is very little difference in the account of events.

162It is evident, from the plaintiff's evidence, that other staff members at HopeStreet were in the administrative section of the building. The plaintiff refers to conversations with them. They would have been aware what was going on. The plaintiff was yelling abuse, according to Sergeant Merritt, that she could hear some distance away. Additionally, Sergeant Merritt recorded in the COPS entry, completed about an hour after the events, that the second defendant reported the plaintiff as saying ""to fuck off and that he would kill him"" (Exhibit B). The statement that the plaintiff said these words was not a later embellishment, but made at the time to the police.

163It is also clear that, when he prepared his report, the second defendant discussed what had happened and whether the length of the ban, and its imposition, were warranted. Reverend Hall's evidence was that the report was ""very detailed"", that the second defendant was obliged to write it, and that there was nothing in the report that was outside the policies and procedures of the first defendant for the entire episode (T 131). Accordingly, the plaintiff must fail in relation to the second matter complained of.

Conclusions concerning liability

164As both defences of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30 have succeeded, the claim must be dismissed. I have set out at the end of this judgment the orders I propose to make, including the nature of the orders to be made in favour of the second defendant.

165In the event that I have erred in my determinations as to these defences, I set out below my findings on quantum. 

166I have set out my findings on liability in a manner that may be repetitive to a member of the legal profession because I am conscious that the plaintiff is a litigant in person who would want his submissions to be considered in detail, and may need explanations repeated. Similarly, in relation to my observations on quantum, I have made these fuller than might generally be the case (in Lamont v Dwyer, supra, Higgins CJ dealt with damages in one sentence), in part because of the specific circumstances of this case, and in part because there are substantial issues of mitigation.

Damages

167Damages under the Act are capped. The current amount as at 1 July 2014 is $366,000. It is sufficient, if the matter complained of is found to be defamatory of the plaintiff, for there to be some award of damages, since damage is presumed: Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [20]-[31] per Basten JA.

168It has long been accepted law, both under the repealed and present legislation, that there are three purposes to an award of damages in defamation, namely consolation, recompense for damage to reputation and vindication of the plaintiff's reputation: Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [60] per Hayne J. More recently, the relevant principles were reviewed in detail by the Court of Appeal in Ali v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 183 at [70]-[78].

169The plaintiff did not give evidence of hurt to feelings. The first defendant submits that this is unsurprising, since, in relation to the death threats allegation, he admitted that he had made repeated death threats to another person while holding a knife to the victim's throat. I do not give this incident the same weight that the first defendant does. The plaintiff is a man who is ""living rough"" in dangerous circumstances, and incidents of this kind do not have the same impact that they might have in the life of a person living a life within more normal parameters.

170There are, however, some real problems for the plaintiff in relation to the evidence before me. The first is that there is very little evidence that anyone knew of the publication of the matters complained of beyond the persons to whom the matters complained of were published. 

171The plaintiff called two reputation witnesses. Their evidence is indicative of the narrow compass of publication of the matters complained of.

The evidence of Ms Greaves

172Ms Robyn Greaves is the manager of the Kings Cross Community Centre and has known the plaintiff since 2011 (T 72). Their level of acquaintance was described as follows in examination in chief:

""Q. In what context, if you remember, we were first acquainted?
A. You were referred to me by Duncan McFarlane, who is one of the volunteers at the centre, and also on the management committee; and I believe at the time you were working on a project with him, I think it was a photographic one, down at the Auslan centre at Woolloomooloo. So Duncan asked me would I see you, because I do quite a lot of advocacy work, to try and assist you with your immigration problem.

Q. Your assistance with the immigration problem, how long did it take, roughly the timeframe?
A. I can't remember, but I wrote letters to the minister, spoke to the minister's office, and all sorts of things, and, it's just a rough guess, maybe over a period of about six months. I can't really remember.

Q. Your acquaintance with the plaintiff was more close?
A. Sorry?

Q. Did they became part of the activities of the community centre?
A. You did, you

Q. In what sense, can you describe the operation of the community centre, and how I was?
A. How you came to be there?

Q. Yes?
A. I think, well, I think it was because I had tried to assist you, you approached me, you knew that there were volunteers in the organisation. And you said, you know, is there anything I can do, like, become a volunteer. I think that's how you became to be there."" 

173In the plaintiff's examination of Ms Greaves, he was having difficulties asking reputation questions. Ms Chrysanthou assisted in this regard and asked the following:

""Q. You've known Mr Bodenstein since about 2011?
A. Yes.

Q. In the Kings Cross community, do you know other people who also know Mr Bodenstein?
A. Many people do, yes.

Q. Prior to January 2012, what was your perception of Mr Bodenstein's reputation amongst those people in that community?
A. He's got an extremely high reputation, and he's highly regarded and well liked."" (T 74)

174Although working close by, and a resident of the area for many years, Mrs Greaves knew nothing of the events which occurred at the Back Shed Café. She was a witness as to the plaintiff's good reputation only.

175In cross-examination, Ms Chrysanthou asked:

""Q. You gave evidence that Mr Bodenstein has an extremely high reputation, is highly regarded, and well liked?
A. Yes, he is.

Q. That's the case today, isn't it?
A. I would think so.

Q. There's been no alteration between his reputation, when you met him in 2011, and his reputation today?
A. No."" (T 75)

176Mrs Greaves' evidence shows the limited extent to which these events were the subject of public knowledge or indeed local knowledge. She was clearly highly regarded in the area for the kind-hearted and professional assistance she provided not only to the plaintiff but for many others in his situation. The fact that she knew nothing of these events was telling. Reverend Hall gave similar evidence (at T 132):

""Q. Since that incident in January 2012 have you heard people around the cafe or around the square talking about it?
A. No, not at all.

Q. Have you heard anyone say something to the effect of ""George accused Amir of stealing""?
A. I don't believe so, no.""

The evidence of Ms Curtis

177Ms Jacqueline Curtis, a ""struggling"" artist (T 76) said she did hear about these events, although from other residents, some months later:

""Q. What did you heard about the incident that were happening about the incident between myself and George Vlamakis and from whom?
A. I heard through elderly people of the community, upstanding citizens of the community had heard that you'd stolen his phone which was untrue. And threatened to murder him and that's not true at all.

Q. Like from around how many people that you heard?
A. At least six. At least six.

Q. Do you remember like was it like in an interval of three days or was it for how long like you get this response?
A. Over the course of over the course of months, you know.

Q. How come that like you acquainted with those people?
A. Because I've been volunteering in the Art Space for many years, or a couple three years and have grown very close to a lot of the community in Woolloomooloo teaching their children, their grandchildren and just in general friend friendships, that's my relationship.""

178Ms Curtis said she had been told about these events by people in the community:

""Q. You said you heard from some elderly people?
A. Yep.

Q. About Mr Bodenstein stealing a phone and threatening to kill Mr Vlamakis and you were quick to say twice that that was not true?
A. Yep.

Q. You weren't there, were you?
A. I wasn't there but I know some of the people that were there and they told me what happened.""

179However, Ms Curtis was in hospital for an extended period which appears to predate the publications of the matters complained of. After her return to the community some time later, she claimed that people came up to her in the street to talk about it to her, in circumstances which I find implausible. I am satisfied that the reason that Ms Curtis was discussing this matter was that the plaintiff told her about it and she then discussed the matter with other persons in the community.

180Ms Curtis took every opportunity to criticise the second defendant, whom she blamed for the closure of the Art Space.

181It transpired that these conversations took place later because the witness had spent some months in hospital, due to the distressed state she was in, she told the court, because of the conduct of the second defendant:

""CHRYSANTHOU

Q. The reason you're here today is because you want to take the opportunity to criticise Mr Vlamakis, that's correct, isn't it?
A. No, I'm here to support my friend Amir through this defamation.

Q. You are willing to say anything in order to support him?
A. No, not willing to say anything only the truth.

Q. Pam Judge spoke to you months later, what did she actually say to you?
A. She said, ""Oh, I don't know why you're hanging out with your friend Amir because he's done this, this and this"" and I said to her, ""And you know this how?"" and again it was through rumour, through rumour it got back to her. This is how this George Vlamakis works in the community.

Q. Again I want to put to you that in an unresponsive way you've taken another opportunity to say something negative about Mr Vlamakis, do you accept that?
A. Yep."" (T 79-81)

182Ms Curtis was quite frank in her wish to say something negative about the second defendant. She blamed him for the closure of the Art Space, which had resulted in her having an extended stay in a psychiatric institution. When asked about the plaintiff's ""additional publication"" claims, Ms Curtis gave the following answer:

""Q. You're aware, aren't you, that a couple of days after this incident Mr Bodenstein taped notices around Tom Uren Square which set out the allegations that Mr Vlamakis had made about him and his response?
A. No, because I wasn't around. I checked myself into a nuthouse.""

183Her evidence about the degree to which people were speaking about this incident in the community is inconsistent with the evidence of Ms Greaves and Reverend Hall, both of whom are, I find, witnesses who are reliable. Ms Curtis's evidence is of little assistance.

General damages

184The first defendant submits, and I agree, that this is a case calling for nominal damages. 

185The principles relevant to an award of general damages, and the appropriate range, are set out at length by Applegarth J in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2014] QCA 33 and it is unnecessary to repeat them. These are publications to one person, in circumstances where the context of those publications was such that those persons, each of whom was well acquainted with the plaintiff, would have taken into account the events which led to publication of the matters complained of.

186The plaintiff, as I have already noted, did not give evidence of his own hurt to feelings. It is hard to gauge the degree to which his feelings were hurt. I accept that he has called evidence of his good reputation but his good reputation must be viewed in the context of what he admits was his conduct on the occasions in question.

187I am satisfied that any persons other than the recipients of the matters complained of who heard about the contents of the matters complained of would have been likely to have heard about it from the plaintiff himself. In particular, I do not accept the evidence of Ms Curtis that the incident was the subject of discussion months later. 

188While the imputations in question are serious, each of them are published to one person, and the level of seriousness, in the context of the matters complained of, is not high.

Aggravated compensatory damages

189The plaintiff did not address me in relation to aggravated compensatory damages. Having regard to the circumstances in which each of the matters complained of was published, it would be inappropriate to award them.

Mitigation of damages

190Reverend Hall gave evidence of an apology that was given by Mr Cardwell in early 2013:

""Q. As far as you are aware Mr Bodenstein is now welcome at Hope Street premises?
A. Yes.

Q. You are aware aren't you that an apology was given to him by Mr Cardwell in early 2013?
A. Cardwell, yes, yes.

Q. As far as you're concerned was that a true apology?
A. Yeah, I think it was genuine attempt because, yeah, because relationship were sort of a bit shaky between Mr Bodenstein and Hope Street, and Warren Cardwell was genuinely trying to fix things up.

Q. Do you genuinely welcome Mr Bodenstein back to Hope Street?
A. Yes."" (T 131)

191The plaintiff's evidence was that he was approached several times by the second defendant, who was seeking to engage in conversation with him, but that he refused to speak to him. The plaintiff refused to collect his belongings from the Art Space, and the second defendant wrote a series of letters about a ""fuse ball"" [sic] table (Exhibit J) and a bike which was kept for nearly a year, and then accidentally sold (Exhibit K) where the plaintiff was given the sale proceeds of $35 in December 2012. A meeting was held on 21 December where Mr Ravenscroft, the recipient of the second matter complained of, sent a letter on Christmas Eve which said there were ""no open issues following the earlier incident and we now want to move on"" (Exhibit L). The plaintiff dismissed this letter, saying he disbelieved its contents and the sincerity of the author (T 114).

192A further meeting was held in the first week of January 2013 and a further letter of apology sent by Warren Cardwell on 14 January 2013. The plaintiff said that this date was falsified in order to make it appear that it was sent before his statement of claim was filed and served. It would not matter, given the long history of apologies and attempts at reconciliation by both defendants, whether this letter was sent before or after this latest offer of an apology was made, but I note that it refers to a meeting ""last week"" between the plaintiff and Reverend Hall, and as that is not challenged, the date on this letter is likely to be correct. The plaintiff agreed that he had met with Reverend Hall ""a few times"" (T 111) but said that this apology (and, by inference, its author as well as Reverend Hall) was not sincere (T 112), came a year too late (T 113) and that the date was falsified.

193The plaintiff's response to these offers of apology was to serve a statement of claim on the first defendant (and, nine months later, on the second defendant) seeking varying but substantial sums of damages for what McCallum J has reduced, in her Honour's judgment of 2 December 2013, to two publications to two people. 

194In the course of the plaintiff's submissions, the plaintiff submitted that the earlier attempts at apology were inadequate and that the letter of 14 January 2013 arrived after he filed the statement of claim, which was too late. He told me that he had made at least five attempts to obtain an apology, but the exhibits to which he referred (Exhibits L, M and N) were the apologies offered by the first defendant. However, he stopped short of saying that, if HopeStreet had given him the apology he had ""repeatedly"" (T 195) asked for, he would not have commenced proceedings, although he relied upon the first defendant's offers of apology and meetings with him as how he had ""tried to resolve the matter out of court prior to the proceedings"" (T 196). 

195I am satisfied, from the documents tendered and the frank and sincere evidence of Reverend Hall, that both defendants made repeated efforts to turn the other cheek, and to reconcile and renew a relationship with the plaintiff, out of the compassion for which their organisation was named, and from concern for his marginalised lifestyle. 

196These were sustained and significant attempts to apologise, which I am satisfied the plaintiff has rejected on unconvincing grounds, despite the plaintiff stating, several times during the hearing, that he did not bring these proceedings for ""the love of money"" (T 153) and it was ""not the money"" (T 60) but his reputation.

197I formally note that the making of these apologies does not constitute an admission or otherwise derogate from the entitlement of the defendants to conduct their defences: s 20.

198Very substantial allowance should be made for the mitigating circumstances of these meetings and letters during the year preceding the commencement of these proceedings.

199In Lemaire v Smith's Newspaper Ltd (1927) 28 SR (NSW) 161 the plaintiff, a litigant in person, opened his case to the jury by saying that he would accept an apology published by the newspaper in satisfaction for the action. The newspaper immediately offered the apology sought, in open court, but the plaintiff refused it. The Full Court held that there were no grounds for it to interfere with the jury's verdict of one farthing, on the basis that the conduct of the plaintiff in refusing the offer, as well as the conduct of the newspaper making the offer, were matters that could be taken into account in assessing the damages.

200While it would be going too far to make a similar award here, I am of the view that the substantial mitigating effect of these apologies and meetings must materially reduce any damages awarded. 

Conclusions as to quantum

201Ms Chrysanthou submits, and I agree, that any award of damages for a publication to one person would be nominal. In the present circumstances, those damages should be further reduced by reason of the first defendant's employee being the person to whom one of the matters complained of was published, in circumstances where that person was involved in the year-long apology process.

202Accordingly, if I have erred in holding that the matters complained of were each published on occasions of qualified privilege at common law which was not lost due to malice, then I would award the sum of $100 damages for each of the publications.

203I was not addressed on aggravated compensatory damages. They are not referred to in the statement of claim, which seeks simply a lump sum of damages, for amounts varying, from one version to another of this pleading, from $180,000 to $70,000. Given the plaintiff's account of the events in question, I would not award aggravated compensatory damages in any event. The second defendant was, even on the plaintiff's version, responding as best he could in a difficult confrontation with an aggressive and intimidating person who was in breach of HopeStreet's rules about verbal abuse.

Other issues

204There are two remaining issues. The first is that, at the commencement of addresses on the third day of the hearing, the plaintiff asked the court for a ""mistrial"". I refused to make this order and indicated I would give my reasons for refusing to do so in this judgment. The second is that, after I reserved judgment, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion and a further version of the statement of claim. I shall deal with each in turn.

Plaintiff's application for a mistrial

205These are the complaints of the plaintiff in relation to what he perceived principally as being the inadequate assistance that the Supreme Court, and this court, had rendered to him in case management, the transferring of this case to this court, and the conduct of these proceedings. I have set out the basis upon which the plaintiff's application for a ""mistrial"" was refused.

Inadequate case management

206This was the first issue raised by the plaintiff, and was identified by him, together with the final ground raised (case management in relation to malice evidence), as the principal issue.

207The plaintiff's principal case management complaint was that the conduct of his case in the Supreme Court was marred by the following injustices:

(a)His case went through ""three different judges"" and ""ten mentioning"" [sic] in the Supreme Court (T 146), after which his case was, against his wishes, transferred to the District Court. He should have had one judge at all times.

(b)The court should have issued a subpoena to the second defendant from the beginning (T 146), as it was ""improper"" of the plaintiff to approach the second defendant directly (T 147). It was not up to the plaintiff to tell the second defendant about the hearing or to subpoena him, because this should be done by the defamation list judge who set the matter down for hearing (T 148). As a result, the plaintiff had been put by me ""under a cloud"" of not giving a ""fair go"" when I had inquired whether the second defendant had been notified of the hearing; I should have realised that this was the court's responsibility and not his (T 149 - 150).

(c)The case was transferred from the Supreme Court when it ""wasn't ready for hearing"" (T 148).

(d)There was no discovery order made by the Supreme Court in these proceedings (T 154). (I note Ms Chrysanthou, who appeared in the Supreme Court, confirmed that the plaintiff had issued subpoenae in both courts, that her client had produced all the documents in its possession in response to those subpoenae).

(e)Either this court or the Supreme Court should have provided a jury for this trial, because issues such as whether ""fuck off"" was an insulting expression or merely daily slang were more suited to a jury determination than to a judge (T 156).

(f)The plaintiff had been prevented from pleading malice in his statement of claim by the Supreme Court (T 156 - 159). This point was the ""last, and the big one"" the plaintiff wanted to make (T 156). He drew my attention to UCPR r 14.30, which stated that a plaintiff should not provide particulars of malice in the statement of claim. He ""wasn't allowed to mention any malice"" in his statement of claim (T 157) by reason of the Supreme Court rulings. This was why he ""didn't follow your Honour's advice"" (T 158) about filing a Reply, because he found the fact that UCPR r 14.30 forbade the particularisation of malice ""confusing"" (T 158).

(g)In the course of closing submissions, the plaintiff added a complaint that he had been prevented by McCallum J's judgment of 2 December 2013 from pleading a wide number of other defamatory publications by the defendants.

208I do not propose to analyse the case management of these proceedings in the Supreme Court, beyond expressing appreciation for the careful management of these proceedings by the Registrars and defamation list judges at all times. This included referring the plaintiff to the pro bono panel, where he received extensive advice concerning extension of time to serve the claim, substituted service, drafting court documents such as pleadings and subpoenae, how to seek leave to file a subpoena, and conduct of the proceedings generally. The plaintiff even included a claim for compelled republication in his statement of claim, which is a pleading of some sophistication. The plaintiff was also given very great latitude in the formulation of his pleadings by McCallum J, including being excused from formulating imputations and being assisted in identifying the ambit of the publications, in circumstances where the first defendant had filed a notice of motion for summary dismissal of the claim. This compassionate and flexible approach to the plaintiff's position in relation to that application goes well beyond the assistance generally afforded to other litigants, including litigants in person: Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244. 

209As is set out above, the plaintiff's complaints about being unable to plead malice have been accommodated, albeit ""on the run"", by the first defendant seeking to answer the plaintiff's case on malice, notwithstanding the plaintiff's failure to file a Reply or identify the evidence upon which his claim of malice is based. He was, as he conceded, told during pre-hearing case management that a Reply was generally filed to these defences.

210The plaintiff also complained he had not been given ""a fair go"" by myself during the trial. When he was asking his reputation witnesses to give evidence, Ms Chrysanthou had objected to certain questions (for example, evidence about the plaintiff having a good reputation) and I had not admitted the evidence. However, judges have to rule on objections, and it was not the case that all of Ms Chrysanthou's objections were successful. His other complaint about not being given a ""fair go"" during the hearing related to the circumstances in which, after he spoke without stopping for half an hour, I asked if he could give shorter answers, as there was no transcript, and I was having difficulty writing everything down, and reminded the parties there was (at that time) no transcript. Ms Chrysanthou, in response to this criticism, noted that the difficulties she and her instructing solicitor has in keeping up with the plaintiff's long answers (and particularly this one) had resulted in her client having to order a transcript half way through the trial, although the cost was significant. 

211The plaintiff did not complain about my having asked whether the second defendant had been served, but submitted that I should not have placed any blame at his door for this, and that I had not given him a ""fair go"" by appearing to do so. He said that he had been excused from any obligation to contact the second defendant by the judgment of McCallum J of 2 December 2013, and that the obligation to notify the second defendant lay with the court, or the first defendant, and not with him. 

212I can understand a litigant in person having such a belief, but the plaintiff had been told by the registrars in the Supreme Court that this was his responsibility, and McCallum J did not excuse him from this obligation. Judges have to be able to inquire about the whereabouts of a missing party without incurring complaint. What I had not expected, as a result of this inquiry, was to be told that the second defendant had not been informed about the further conduct of the hearing, or of the hearing date. He had simply been served with a document that barely complied with the pleading requirements for defamation actions, and had never been contacted again.

213The complaint with most substance is the complaint that these proceedings should not have been heard by the District Court. I have dealt with this in detail below. I apprehend that the plaintiff was asking that I cease hearing the matter and remit it to the Supreme Court so that he could start all over again in front of a jury. The plaintiff also complained that the failure to case manage these proceedings continued in this court (T 156). As is set out below, the plaintiff was offered case management in this court but preferred to seek a hearing date. 

The complaint that these proceedings should not have been transferred to the District Court

214On 3 March 2014 Beech-Jones J transferred these proceedings from the Supreme Court to the District Court: Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion [2014] NSWSC 174.

215The plaintiff in his submissions on this issue referred to his earlier arguments before Beech-Jones J opposing the transfer, which were submitted to his Honour in writing and remain on the file.

216The plaintiff's written submissions to Beech-Jones J first noted that the case had been started in the Supreme Court and was one callover away from a hearing date, and that the question of transfer had not been raised before (paragraphs 13 and 20). The court should not transfer the case because the plaintiff was self-represented, so his case required ""the utmost efficient and diligent supervision of the proceeding by the highest available court"" (paragraph 15) because of its ""complex set of legal issues in relation to privileged by an employer"" (paragraph 22). 

217The plaintiff submitted that the District Court, by comparison, was ""a mix of Criminal and Civil proceedings and the plaintiff was ""already over exposed to criminal environment [sic] in his daily life"" (paragraph 16). The District Court was also inconveniently situated in geographic terms. The plaintiff, who had been living on the streets of Sydney for the last five years while he conducted litigation in the Federal and Supreme Courts, regarded the surrounding of the Supreme Court Building as ""his most comfortable zone, as he also enjoys the nearby free food supply and his Pro Bono barber at Martin Place"" (paragraph 18). The plaintiff was also concerned that the transfer might cause ""accounting bureaucratic complications"" (paragraph 19). 

218Finally, the plaintiff was concerned that some of his witnesses, who had had prior experience with the District Court, mostly in relation to criminal offences, would be more reluctant to appear if the matter were moved to the District Court (paragraph 21); the plaintiff himself had ""some unpleasant experiences"" with the District Court on several occasions (paragraph 23), whereas he had been able to conduct Supreme Court litigation between 2002 - 2010 (paragraph 17) without such difficulties.

219Some of the plaintiff's concerns are well founded. The case does raise complex legal issues in relation to qualified privilege defences by an employer; although the general principles for liability for publication mean that many of these potential difficulties fall away. The transfer was raised late, and in circumstances where the plaintiff understandably felt more comfortable in the court of his choice. The plaintiff is entitled to feel his case is of general public importance (paragraph 23), and should be before the highest court in New South Wales. The Supreme Court brought up the issue of transfer of its own motion, and did so at a time when there was only one callover left before the allocation of a hearing date.

220However, Beech-Jones J dealt with the plaintiff's concerns in a sympathetic and constructive manner. His Honour took into account that the claim is for two publications of one imputation to two persons, both of who had long prior acquaintance with the plaintiff, where damages were modest, and would have noted from the Amended Defence that there were issues of mitigation of damages. The legal costs for the first defendant, a charitable organisation dependent upon donations for its survival, will probably be irrecoverable. The ambit and complexity of the claim are within the parameters of proceedings suitable to the District Court, which can offer a speedy trial at reduced cost.

221Beech-Jones J also noted that this court offers a defamation list where case management can be offered to a litigant in person such as the plaintiff. Contrary to the plaintiff's claims, such assistance was offered to the plaintiff, but rejected. When these proceedings were first listed for a return date in this court, two hours were specially set aside for a further hearing in the Defamation List on 16 May, and a series of issues was carefully selected for determination, after reviewing the main issues in the case in consultation with the parties. However, on 16 May the plaintiff elected, instead having these matters determined, to ask for a hearing date. 

222Additionally, after the hearing date was allocated, in the course of a series of rulings and directions prior to this hearing, the parties had the opportunity to, and did, raise a series of case management issues. The included subpoenae, arranging a view of the site, witness issues and a review of the pleadings. In particular, inquiries were made by me as to whether a Reply was filed, and whether the second defendant would be participating in the hearing.

223While I can understand the plaintiff's disappointment that his claim has not been heard in the Supreme Court, Beech-Jones J's referral of these proceedings was consistent with the requirements of s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), and his Honour's careful explanation of the reasons should have settled the concerns the plaintiff felt.

Service of Further Amended Statement of Claim and Notice of Motion after the hearing

224On 28 July 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking the following orders:

""1. A Leave for the Plaintiff to file on 1 August 2014 the Further Statement of Claim by away of a Reply to the Defence of Qualified Privilege with no malice.

2. A Leave for the Plaintiff to move a Motion for a Further Trial by Jury.

3. An order to the Commissioner of NSW Police Force to conduct a criminal investigation in relation to this Case regarding the following allegations:

a. Theft of the mobile phone;

b. Repeated death threats;

c. False representation resulting in a police investigation and a body search.

4. Any other order chooses by her Honour.""

225The plaintiff filed a ""Further Amended (Statement of Claim) [sic]"" on 1 August 2014. The amendments are not underlined. The plaintiff neither sought, nor was granted, leave to reopen his case or to bring any notice of motion or to amend his pleadings.

226The orders sought in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion are unnecessary in that I have already dealt with the existing statement of claim as if the malice in the existing pleadings had been properly pleaded by way of a Reply. The orders sought in paragraph 2 for a ""Further Trial by Jury"" and in paragraph 3 for the Commissioner of NSW Police to conduct ""a criminal investigation in relation to this Case"" regarding the theft of the mobile phone, the repeated death threats and ""false representation resulting in a police investigation and a body search"" have been withdrawn, according to an email sent by the plaintiff on 11 August 2014. It was only when this email from the plaintiff was received that the notice of motion and ""Further Amended (Statement of Claim) [sic]"" came to my attention.

227The additional material in the ""Further Amended (Statement of Claim) [sic]"" includes complaints about the defendants as follows:

""10. A Good Name

Both Defendants knew of the Plaintiff's circumstances, but, with the intent to give this 'pest' 'no reason to return', acted to portray him as a volunteer who betrays the trust of a faith based charity by stealing a mobile phone and threatening the life of their employees.""

228Other new material includes claims that the plaintiff only commenced these proceedings after his ""futile attempts to resolve all with the Second Defendant"" and fresh claims of prior hostility such as the second defendant calling workers of another agency ""bastards"" (paragraph 5). No evidence to this effect was called at the trial so the plaintiff should not be permitted to raise it at this late date. However, the balance of the material in the statement of claim is material which I have already considered on the issue of malice, so no further amended pleading is necessary.

229The notice of motion return date of 15 August 2014 has been vacated in my orders below.

Concluding remarks

230 As I have found in favour of the first defendant, it would ordinarily be entitled to an award of costs in its favour. Mr Bodenstein submits that the first defendant's legal costs, which he understands exceed $100,000, should not be borne by him, because he may have to go bankrupt and this may have some impact on his refugee status. There is no other reason why the general rule that costs follow the event should be displaced. Ms Chrysanthou has made clear that the costs burden upon her client has made the conduct of this case difficult, and that ordering a transcript (necessary because of the difficulties of following the plaintiff's evidence) has been a financial burden. 

231What I propose to do is to reserve the issue of costs, on the understanding that this liberty to apply must be exercised within seven days. What is essential for both parties in this litigation is finality. However, the plaintiff must pay the filing fee and hearing fee, and I have made orders to this effect.

232I was not addressed by either party as to what order I should make in relation to the second defendant. The admission of vicarious liability in relation to his claim, made by the first defendant in submissions, is not supported by a pleading to that effect. He has not filed a defence. 

233I am conscious, however, of the financial restraints under which the first defendant has been operating (to which both parties have referred during the hearing). I am inclined to the view that, as the second defendant is also a litigant in person, a small portion of the compassion and assistance that the court has previously given to the plaintiff should now be accorded to the second defendant. Accordingly, I have decided, in the absence of submissions on the subject, that the appropriate order to make in relation to the second defendant is for the proceedings against him to be dismissed.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the first defendant.

(2)Plaintiff to pay the court filing fee and hearing fee in 28 days.

(3)Plaintiff's claim against the second defendant dismissed.

(4)Liberty to apply in relation to costs, such liberty to be exercised in 7 days.

(5)Vacate the notice of motion return date of 15 August 2014.

(6)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

2764555,Darrin Michael Gillies v William Brewer [2014] NSWSC 1198,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: By Statement of Claim filed 9 December 2013, the plaintiff, Darrin Gillies, initiated proceedings against his former counsel, Mr Brewer, the first defendant, and his former solicitor, Ms Lesly Randle, the second defendant. The plaintiff seeks recovery of monies allegedly paid by the plaintiff to the first and second defendant for provision of their professional services during the course of criminal proceedings in 2006. Although not absolutely clear, the plaintiff seeks recovery of a sum of $90,000, being the amount paid by the plaintiff to the defendants for their legal services, plus an amount of $25,000 for the services of an expert witness, Dr Storey-Whyte. There may also be a claim for damages arising out of the plaintiff's imprisonment.

Background
2The plaintiff was charged with three counts of having sexual intercourse without consent, one count of attempted sexual intercourse and one count of assault with an act of indecency (together, the sexual assault charges). The charges concerned events on the night of 9 July 2004. 

3The plaintiff retained the second defendant, a solicitor, on 14 February 2006 to provide legal services in relation to the sexual assault charges. The second defendant represented the plaintiff at directions hearings on 16 February 2006 and 3 March 2006 and otherwise throughout the trial. The second defendant instructed the first defendant, a barrister, at trial. The trial commenced on 31 July 2006 in the New South Wales District Court before Solomon DCJ and a jury of 12. At his trial, the plaintiff pleaded not guilty to each count.

4On or about 17 August 2006, during the trial, the second defendant withdrew the first defendant's instructions to appear. This was done shortly after the first defendant had stated that the plaintiff's case was complete, but prior to the closing addresses. The second defendant applied for a discharge of the jury at this stage, which request was refused. Consequently, the second defendant appeared for the plaintiff in the proceedings thereafter, without counsel. It is an issue of contention whether the withdrawal of counsel's instructions was with or without the consent of the plaintiff. 

5On 24 August 2006, the plaintiff was convicted of one count of sexual intercourse without consent. He was sentenced on 1 December 2006 to a term of imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years, with a further term of one year and eight months. 

Current proceedings before the Court

6On 9 December 2013, the plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim seeking relief due to ""the unlawful failure to follow the instructions provided by the plaintiff in order to gain personal financial benefit"" in the course of his criminal indictment and subsequent trial. 

7The plaintiff submits that the second defendant ""acted well outside of her instructions"" when appearing on behalf of the plaintiff in the proceedings on 26 February and 3 March 2006, and during the criminal trial held between 31 July and 24 August 2006. This is particularised by reference to the second defendant ""not dealing with a subpoena issue in respect of the Crown's expert Mr Rowlison""; committing the plaintiff to a trial date; and dismissing the first defendant on 17 August 2006 without the plaintiff's instructions. 

8The plaintiff further alleges that: 

""...the first defendant acted well outside of the agreed instructions set by the plaintiff and he does not call either expert to the stand to give their testimony in support of the plaintiff's defence""

and:

""It was a term and condition that if the first and second defendants were to represent the plaintiff in his trial then they were to contest the Crown's evidence with the use of the plaintiff's independent and appropriately qualified experts in support of the plaintiff's defence.""


9The plaintiff does not further particularise his claim, nor has he filed any supporting evidence. 

10The current proceedings have been before this Court on three previous occasions. On 4 April 2014, the matter was before Registrar Bradford for a directions hearing. The plaintiff attended the directions hearing and consented to short minutes of order proposed by the first defendant. The plaintiff subsequently left the Court prior to the matter being reached in the list and the first defendant mentioned the plaintiff's appearance. The plaintiff failed to appear at the two subsequent directions hearings on 16 May 2014 and 27 June 2014. 

11On 4 April 2014, Registrar Bradford made orders requiring the plaintiff to serve any affidavit evidence on the motion by 9 May 2014. Subsequently, on 16 May 2014, Registrar Bradford made orders requiring the plaintiff to file and serve evidence in reply to the defendants' motions by 24 June 2014. On 27 June 2014, Registrar Bradford made orders requiring the plaintiff to serve written submissions in reply by 1 August 2014. 

12To date, the plaintiff has failed to serve any evidence or respond to the first defendant's or second defendant's motion, notice of which was filed and served on 16 April 2014 and 13 June 2014 respectively. 

13Affidavits filed on behalf of the first and second defendant attest that, to date, the plaintiff has also failed to respond to correspondence regarding this matter since 4 April 2014. Affidavits also establish that the plaintiff was served with the motions; the affidavits on which the defendants rely; and a notice of hearing of the motions. He did not appear.

14The first and second defendants seek to have the Statement of Claim struck out pursuant to r 14.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (UCPR). 

15The first defendant seeks inter alia to strike out the Statement of Claim and proceedings as against the first defendant on the basis that: 

""(a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; and/or

(b) by virtue of the operation of section 14 of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) the proceeding is not maintainable; and/or

(c) the first defendant is immune from suit."" 

16The second defendant submits, in the alternative to their submission under to r 14.28, that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to r 13.4 of the UCPR, alleging:

""(a) the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, is frivolous, vexatious and embarrassing; and/or

(b) the proceedings are an abuse of process of the Court, in that they involve an impermissible collateral attack on the decision of another court; and/or

(c) the claim is statute barred, having been filed more than six years after the accrual of any cause of action;

(d) the second defendant is immune from suit as she is protected by advocate's immunity;

(e) the plaintiff's chose in action is not able to be prosecuted, as this vested in his trustee in bankruptcy when he became bankrupt in December 2006.""

17The first and second defendants also seek a determination of a separate question pursuant to r 28.2 of the UCPR, regarding whether, should any liability arise from the Statement of Claim, the defence of advocates' immunity would be a complete answer to the plaintiff's claim.

18As the orders sought in both the first and second defendants' motions are in substantially the same terms, I will deal with their submissions together. 

Principles relating to Summary Dismissal

19The first and second defendants, as applicants on the motions, bear the onus of establishing that there is no issue that prevents the denial of the plaintiff's ordinary right to have his claim tried. The test is stringent and demanding and requires a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome of the proceedings if it were to be tried in the ordinary course: see Agar v Hyde [2000] HCA 41; (2000) 201 CLR 552.

20In General Steel Industries v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 59; (1964) 112 CLR 125, Barwick CJ stated:

""...the jurisdiction summarily to terminate an action is to be sparingly employed and is not to be used except in a clear case where the court is satisfied that it has the requisite material and the necessary assistance from the parties to reach a definite and certain conclusion.""

21However, where the case of the plaintiff is clearly untenable and cannot, on that aspect, succeed, a defendant will be entitled to summary dismissal. 

22It is the above principles that I apply to the matters now before the Court.

Has the plaintiff disclosed a reasonable cause of action? 

23The Statement of Claim pleads relief for ""the unlawful failure to follow the instructions of the plaintiff in order to gain personal financial benefit as pleaded here within"". 

24As noted above, the plaintiff refers to the actions of the second defendant at the directions hearings on 16 February and 3 March 2006 and alleges that she ""acted well outside of her instructions"".

25The plaintiff also alleges that the second defendant ""sacked the First Defendant and was without the instruction of the Plaintiff"" and that it was ""a term and condition"" that the defendants were to contest the Crown's evidence through the use of the plaintiff's experts. 

26I can only assume, given the lack of particulars, that this reference to ""term and condition"" is a reference to a term or condition of the retainer. The plaintiff has not specified to which term or condition this purported breach relates. 

27The claim pleads the relief to be ""one for recovery of amounts of money"" for $90,000 and $25,000. The $90,000 is the sum paid to the defendants for the provision of their professional services. The $25,000 is in respect of an expert witness's account, being Dr Storey-Whyte. It is unclear whether the expert's account has been paid. It is also unclear whether the claim is made in contract or in tort, or whether other damages are claimed as a result of the plaintiff's incarceration. 

28The plaintiff also seeks aggravated, exemplary and general damages, however there is no pleading in support of these claims for relief. 

29The first problem with the claim, as currently pleaded, is the failure to particularise the first and second defendants' conduct in the form of being wrongful in a legal sense. That is, the plaintiff does not allege that the conduct of the first or second defendant constituted negligence or other form of tort, nor does he substantiate, under the law of contract, his allegations that the first or second defendant were in breach of her or his retainer.

30In addition to the failure to detail the allegations of wrongful conduct under law, the plaintiff has also failed to particularise any financial loss attributable to the wrongful conduct of the first or second defendant. The only damage or loss that can be inferred from the Statement of Claim is that the ""failure to abide by instructions"" resulted in the amount paid for legal fees somehow constituting contractual damage. 

31In their written submissions, both the first and second defendants note that it is unclear whether the Statement of Claim additionally pleads damage or loss arising from the finding of guilt. If the plaintiff seeks damages for his imprisonment, he faces insurmountable obstacles. His imprisonment is a result of a conviction. The courts have adjudged him guilty and imposed an appropriate sentence. The sentence was imposed on the plaintiff for conduct for which the law holds him responsible. In the absence of an order quashing the conviction and sentence, the plaintiff's lawful custody cannot be ""damage"" in any justiciable sense.

32In Adams by her next friend O'Grady v State of New South Wales [2008] NSWSC 1257, I said:

""[123] There was, and is, in place a lawful order of the Court of Criminal Appeal imposing a limiting term on Ms Adams. The restrictions on her liberty are the result of the lawful conduct of the authorities. It is instructive to ask what, precisely, the State of New South Wales could do to avoid this damage. Once the Court of Criminal Appeal imposed the limiting term, it was a statutory duty imposed upon the authorities to ensure, in accordance with the order of the Court, that Ms Adams' liberty was constrained. 

[124] Even in wrongful imprisonment cases, damages are awarded only up to the time of a lawful order authorising imprisonment: Presland, supra, [100]-[101]. The same principle should be applied in the determination of damages for negligence: Presland, ibid. 

[125] Whatever ""damage"" was suffered by Ms Adams was the result of a lawful order issued under the Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act and is not ""damage"" that is compensable under the civil law.""

Note: reference to Presland is a reference to Hunter Area Health Service v Presland [2005] NSWCA 33; (2005) 63 NSWLR 22.

33Adams concerned a situation where, for reasons of mental illness, the plaintiff was not fully responsible for her actions. Here, the plaintiff has been judged responsible for his conduct and punished accordingly. The punishment is not ""damage"", but the due operation of the law: see also Clavel v Savage [2013] NSWSC 775.

34Accordingly, while it is not clear that the plaintiff intended to rely on the guilty verdict and subsequent imprisonment to ground his claim for damages or loss, if he were so intending, the claim would be futile and I will not further discuss the issue. 

35I find that the Statement of Claim fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action in that regard. 

Does the Claim amount to an Abuse of Process? 

36As noted above, the plaintiff was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years, with a further term of one year and eight months. The plaintiff appealed both his criminal conviction and his sentence to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal granted leave to appeal, which appeal was heard on 27 August, 30 September and 1 October 2008. The Court of Criminal Appeal delivered judgment on 23 December 2008, dismissing the appeal: Gillies v DPP (NSW) [2008] NSWCCA 339. 

37The bulk of the grounds on appeal related, in one way or another, to the conduct of the plaintiff's solicitor and counsel during the trial, being the first and second defendant in the current proceedings.

38The grounds regarding the conduct of the plaintiff's legal representatives were linked to a second group of complaints regarding the authenticity of videotapes of the sexual activity, presented by the prosecution in the course of the trial. The plaintiff also appealed on two other grounds, which are not directly relevant to the current proceedings. 

39During the appeal proceedings, the applicant tendered evidence intended, as noted by the Court of Criminal Appeal at [25], to: 

""... demonstrate a miscarriage of justice through:

(a) the failure of his lawyers to follow instructions with respect to trial strategy; and

(b) inappropriate pressure placed on him by his lawyers to take a course contrary to his instructions."" 

40The Court of Criminal Appeal observed, at [26]:

""This course would, in most circumstances, be misconceived. A miscarriage of justice will generally be capable of demonstration only by reference to the objectively verifiable circumstances of the trial.""

41However, the Court of Criminal Appeal acknowledged that an exception may arise in a case where withdrawal of instructions in the course of a trial is followed by an application for an adjournment. Their Honours found such an exception applied in the appeal proceedings: Gillies v DPP (NSW) at [27].

42As a consequence of this finding, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the conduct of the applicant's lawyers, being the first and second defendant, in considerable detail: see Gillies v DPP (NSW) at [32] - [71]. Their Honours held that the conduct of the plaintiff's legal representatives did not amount to a miscarriage of justice. In coming to this conclusion, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed all grounds of appeal against the plaintiff's lawyers, including, relevantly, whether it was appropriate for counsel to challenge the authenticity of the videotape. The Court of Criminal Appeal also found that the plaintiff accepted legal advice to this effect.

43The plaintiff's Statement of Claim seeks relief from the first and second defendant relating to their conduct in the criminal proceedings outlined above. 

44An attempt to relitigate an issue resolved in earlier proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction may, depending on the facts, involve an abuse of process: see, for example, Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665; Sea Culture International v Scoles [1991] FCA 523; (1991) 32 FCR 275 at 279; O'Shane v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 315. As noted by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at [37] - [39]: 

""...proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings. The jurisdiction of a superior court in such a case was correctly described by Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (39) as ""the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.""

45However, the power to strike out a Statement of Claim as an abuse of process must be exercised sparingly and only upon examination of the relevant circumstances of the particular case before the court. As noted by Giles CJ in Eq in State Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Stenhouse Ltd (1997) Aust Tort Reports 81-423 at 64, 089:

""...whether proceedings are, or an aspect of proceedings is, an abuse of process because a party seeks to relitigate a issue already decided depends very much on the particular circumstances. The guiding considerations are oppression and unfairness to the other party to the litigation and concern for the integrity of the system of administration of justice...""

46Hunt CJ at CL provided a helpful guide in balancing such considerations in Haines v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1995] NSWSC 136; (1995) 43 NSWLR 404, where his Honour noted, at [31]:

""The issue to be determined in the earlier case which is sought to be litigated in the later case must be one which the party propounding it in the latter lost in the former ... It must be an issue which was necessarily determined in the earlier case, and one of importance to the final result.""

47This creates several hurdles that must be satisfied in order for a party to be able to relitigate an issue determined in a prior proceeding.

48First, the previous judicial decision is required to have resolved all those matters that are legally indispensable to the conclusion: Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532; Brewer v Brewer [1953] ALR 441; (1953) 88 CLR 1. This extends past the points upon which the court was required to adjudicate to include ""every point which properly belonged to the subject matter of the litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time"": Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45; (1981) 147 CLR 589.

49The issue as to the competence of the plaintiff's legal representatives was the primary ground for his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Given the detailed examination of that issue by the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is not the function of this Court, as currently constituted, to re-examine this issue, particularly given the inadequacy of the plaintiff's particulars and the lack of evidence currently before it. 

50The second hurdle regards the identity of the party. Abuse of process by relitigation has a wider reach than the doctrine of res judicata and issue estoppel, extending to preclude a party relitigating an issue against persons who were not party to the original proceedings: Reichel v Magrath; Rippon v Chilcotin [2001] NSWCA 142. 

51The plaintiff instigating the current proceedings is the same person as the applicant in Gillies v DPP (NSW). It is irrelevant that the first and second defendants were not party to the Court of Criminal Appeal hearing. 

52The plaintiff has failed to establish that the overall balance of justice requires relitigation of the issues explored by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Accordingly, as the claim is seeking to litigate issues resolved in earlier proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, the claim is an abuse of process. 

53Thirdly, the allegation in the claim would, even if it were possible to agitate it, once more fail on the question of damage. If, as the plaintiff claims, the defendants did not challenge the admissibility of evidence, or its veracity, and/or should not have withdrawn the second defendant's instructions, what flows? The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that the evidence was admissible, it has held that the verdict was not unreasonable and that there was no miscarriage of justice. On the basis of the appeal judgment, no challenge to the evidence or its veracity would have altered the result. Nor would the continued appearance of the first defendant. 

Are the proceedings Statute Barred?

54Section 14 of the Limitation Act 1969 provides that a plaintiff has six years from the date of the accrual of a potential cause of action to file a claim. A cause of action in contract generally accrues on the date in which the contract is breached: Ward v Lewis (1896) 22 VLR 410; Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15; (1988) 164 CLR 539. In tort, a cause of action accrues upon the sustaining of actual or measurable loss or when a legal right is infringed, being when measurable damage is first suffered, even if damage continues to accrue: Argyropoulos v Layton [2002] NSWCA 183. 

55It is unclear whether the plaintiff's claim is framed in contract or tort, or both. For completeness, I will consider whether a claim in either contract or tort would be within the legislative timeframe. 

56Assuming the claim is based in contract, the cause of action would have accrued on the date the plaintiff alleges the defendants were in breach of their retainer, being the date the first defendant and the date the second defendant allegedly failed to follow his instructions. As noted above, the second defendant terminated the retainer of the first defendant on 17 August 2006. The second defendant's retainer can be said to have concluded on the date the plaintiff was convicted, being 24 August 2006. Therefore, any potential cause of action in contract accrued at or before these dates. 

57Alternatively, assuming the claim is based in tort, the cause of action would have accrued when the plaintiff sustained damage: Wilson v Rigg [2002] NSWCA 246. Given the lack of particulars, it is not clear upon which action in tort the plaintiff seeks to rely. One can only assume it is negligence. Therefore, any cause of action would have accrued on the first date in which the first and second defendant purportedly acted in contradiction of the plaintiff's instructions, or, at the latest, the date when the verdict of guilt was delivered. This would result in a similar, if not identical, timeframe as any claim in contract. 

58Consequently, the plaintiff was required to file his Statement of Claim on or before 17 August 2012 with respect to the first defendant; and 24 August 2012 with respect to the second defendant. 

59The plaintiff filed the Statement of Claim on 9 December 2013. This is more than 12 months outside the limitation period prescribed by s 14 of the Limitation Act for a claim against either the first defendant or the second defendant. No leave has been sought to file the Statement of Claim out of time, nor is there any evidence suggesting that the plaintiff took reasonable steps to have the Statement of Claim served within the legislative timeframe.

60Accordingly, by virtue of the operation of s 14 of the Limitation Act, the proceeding is not maintainable. 

Are the first and second defendant immune from suit?

61The basis of advocates' immunity was discussed in Giannarelli v Wraith [1988] HCA 52; (1988) 165 CLR 543, particularly by Mason CJ. The Chief Justice referred to the judgment of Tindal CJ in Lanphier v Phipos (1838) 8 Car. & P. 475 at 479, where it was noted, ""Every person who enters into a learned profession undertakes to bring to the exercise of it a reasonable degree of care and skill"". His Honour continued, at 555: 

""On the other hand, the common law has for a very long time recognised that the barrister is not subject to such general duty of care. The immunity of the barrister from liability in negligence to his client, at least in respect of court work, is supported by powerful authority, ancient and modern, in England, Scotland and Ireland. 

...

Of the various public policy factors which have been put forward to justify the immunity, only two warrant serious examination. The first relates to the peculiar nature of a barrister's responsibility when he appears for his client in litigation. The second arises from the adverse consequences for the administration of justice which would flow from the re-litigation in collateral proceedings in negligence of issues determined in the principle proceedings.""

62The principle of advocates' immunity, as explained in Australia in Giannarelli v Wraith, is now well established in Australian law; see, for example, D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; (2005) 223 CLR 1; Attorney-General (NSW) v Spautz [2001] NSWSC 66. The High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid held, at [25]:

""....an advocate cannot be sued by his or her client for negligence in the conduct of a case, or in work out of court which is intimately connected with the conduct of a case in court...""

63Their Honours continued, at [45]:

""...the central justification for the advocate's immunity is the principle that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few narrowly defined circumstances. This is a fundamental and pervading tenet of the judicial system, reflecting the role played by the judicial process in the government of society. If an exception to that tenet were to be created by abolishing that immunity, a particular type of relitigation would arise. There would be relitigation of a controversy (already determined) as a result of what had happened during, or in preparation for, the hearing that had been designed to quell that controversy. Moreover, it would be relitigation of a skewed and limited kind. No argument was advanced to this Court urging the abolition of judicial or witness immunity. If those immunities remain, it follows that the relitigation could not and would not examine the contribution of judge or witness to the events complained of, only the contribution of the advocate. An exception to the rule against the reopening of controversies would exist, but one of an inefficient and anomalous kind.""


64The immunity applies to work in court, or with a connection to in court work. The test to determine whether work done satisfies this connection was expounded by Mason CJ in Giannarelli v Wraith at 559-60, where his Honour noted it was ""artificial in the extreme to draw the line at the courtroom door"", and stated that the connection includes both work done in court and ""work done out of court which leads to a decision affecting the conduct of the case in court"": see also Beazely JA in MacRae v Stevens [1997] ANZ ConvR 129.

65To similar effect, in Giannarelli v Wraith, Brennan J reasoned, at 579:

""...neither a barrister nor a solicitor may be sued by a client in respect of any act done or omission made in the conduct of the client's case in court or in the making of preliminary decisions affecting the way in which the case is to be conducted when it comes to a hearing.""

66Furthermore, a solicitor acting in a litigated matter can enjoy wide protection under advocates' immunity, even in circumstances where counsel has been briefed: Bird v Ford [2013] NSWSC 264.

Tort

67The conduct of the first and second defendant, about which complaint is made, consists solely of their actions, and arguably omissions, during the period in which the plaintiff retained them as his legal representatives to conduct his criminal trial.

68Specifically, the plaintiff particularises the relief claimed as damages arising from the failure of the first and second defendants to act in accordance with relevant professional rules in their representation of the plaintiff in criminal proceedings. This was said to include the second defendant acting ""well outside of her instructions"" in two directions hearings and by dismissing the first defendant, and the first defendant doing same during a voir dire application. 

69It is difficult to imagine work that could more clearly fall within the category of work in court or, otherwise, fall within the category of work intrinsically connected with the conduct of a case in court than the representation of a plaintiff during directions hearings and voir dire applications and the engagement of or disengagement of counsel. 

70Notwithstanding that I have found that the conduct was intimately connected to the conduct of the criminal proceedings, I will, for completeness, deal with the plaintiff's submission that the conduct was ""to gain personal financial benefit"". 

71The plaintiff has failed to particularise this claim or support it otherwise. Consequently, it is not pleaded, nor is it obvious, that there is some other aspect of the first or second defendants' conduct that suggests they acted in a manner to which this immunity would not attach. On the contrary, the evidence before me indicates that both the first and second defendant acted in the usual and proper manner in the representation of the plaintiff in the interlocutory proceedings and at trial. This finding is supported by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the plaintiff's criminal appeal.

72The application of the immunity depends on a question of fact, namely, whether the alleged conduct occurred in court or was ""intimately connected"" to the hearing of the case in court: Donnellan v Woodland [2012] NSWCA 433 at [265]. On the allegations in these pleadings, the acts or omissions of the first and second defendants relating to their conduct during the directions hearings and substantive trial, about which complaint is made, are so intimately connected to the conduct of the case in court that there is an immunity from suit in relation to them. The contrary is unarguable.

Contract

73Should the plaintiff's claim rely on contract, it assumes that the first and/or second defendant breached their retainer by acting contrary to the plaintiff's instructions throughout the trial. 

74A legal practitioner owes a duty to a client to take reasonable care to exercise due care, skill and diligence by performing tasks to the requisite skill expected of legal practitioners in the profession: Voli v Inglewood Shire Council [1963] HCA 15; 110 CLR 74 at 84; Hawkins v Clayton; Donnellan v Woodland. However, a legal practitioner's duty to his or her client is subject to an overriding and paramount duty to the court: Giannarelli v Wraith at 555. This duty may require a legal practitioner to act in a manner contrary to a client's instructions, or to act in a manner that may possibly disadvantage his or her client: Giannareli v Wraith at 556. This duty also extends to the administration of justice, requiring a legal practitioner to ensure, among other obligations, the expeditious and efficient conduct of litigation: Kelly v Jowett [2009] NSWCA 278 at [57].

75Any retainer of a legal practitioner is subject to that legal practitioner's overriding duty to the court. It would be in direct contradiction to this duty for a legal practitioner to be required, despite the practitioner's view of the law, to challenge every piece of evidence relied upon at trial and to follow the instructions of a client without regard to the duty to the court. 

76This immunity extends to the plaintiff's claim to recover, from the first or second defendant, any costs associated with the expert witness that purportedly result from their failure to follow his instructions: D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [83]; Donnellan v Woodland at [232].

77As a consequence of this immunity, both the first and second defendant are protected from a claim for damages, whether in tort or contract, arising from their conduct in representing him during the criminal proceedings. 

Order

78For all of the above reasons, the Court issued the following orders:

(1)Pursuant to r 13.4 of the UCPR, the proceedings be dismissed against the first and second defendants on the basis that:
(a)No reasonable cause of action is disclosed; 
(b)By virtue of the operation of s 14 of the Limitation Act, the proceeding is not maintainable; 
(c)To the extent not otherwise covered by 1(a) above, the first and second defendants are immune from suit. 

(2)The plaintiff shall pay the first and second defendants' costs of and incidental to the motions and proceedings.

2764560,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Pelletier [2014] NSWLC 9,"Judgment

REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender is before the Court today for sentencing in relation to an offence of negligent driving occasioning death. This offence is created pursuant to section 42(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The penalty available at sentence for a first offence of this nature is 18 months imprisonment and a fine of $3,300 or both. 

2The offence was committed on 27 February 2012 on the Gore Hill Freeway, Naremburn. Before proceeding further it is pertinent to outline the history of these proceedings.

3The matter first came before the Local Court on 10 October 2012 as what is commonly known as a ""back up"" charge to the more serious offence of dangerous driving occasioning death. This offence is a strictly indictable offence that cannot be dealt with to finality within the jurisdiction of the Local Court. Both offences moved through the committal process. On 19 September 2013 the offender was committed to stand trial in the District Court in relation to the strictly indictable offence. These proceedings accompanied that charge pursuant to section 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

4In May 2014 the charge now before the Court was remitted back to the Local Court by order of Berman DCJ. On 29 May 2014 the Local Court was informed the DPP does not propose to proceed with the charge of dangerous driving occasioning death once the sentencing proceedings in the Local Court are completed. 

5The Court record indicates that on that date the court was informed there would be a plea of guilty to the charge of negligent driving occasioning death. It is assumed such an indication had been given before the District Court for such an approach is consistent with remission of the matter back to this jurisdiction and the approach to be taken by the DPP following conclusion of proceedings before me. Consideration of the utilitarian value of the plea for the purpose of sections 21A(3) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) will proceed on that basis.

The facts
6Sentencing will proceed in part on the basis of an agreed statement of facts signed and tendered by both parties. This document is not the only material the Court has been invited to consider. Both the DPP and counsel for the defence tendered a number of documents going to the tragic events of 27 February 2012. Reference to pertinent aspects of other tendered material will be made where appropriate and are informative of the reasons behind the ultimate sentence.

7According to the agreed statement of facts, at about 3.05pm on 27 February 2012 the offender was driving his vehicle in a southerly direction along the Gore Hill Freeway. The vehicle occupied the T2 lane. Ms Laryl Snell, the offender's companion, was seated in the front passenger seat. It is accepted the offender was travelling within or at the prevailing speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour. This equates to 22 metres per second. Ahead in the same lane was a stationary white Daihatsu Tipper Truck, its hazard lights activated. The truck had broken down some time earlier.

8The offender did not see the truck or identify the fact that it was not moving until the very last moment. The offender's vehicle swerved to the right immediately prior to the impact with the rear of the stationary truck. The sudden change in direction brought the front passenger side into contact with the offside rear of the truck causing the death of Ms Snell. 

9According to the statement of facts, ""There were no tyre marks on the roadway prior to the collision scene; indicating that Mr Pelletier had not braked heavily before the impact to avoid the collision.""

10The offender subsequently provided an account to investigating police. This was done through his legal representative. For completeness the offender stated:

On the afternoon of Monday 27 February 2012 I was driving my motor vehicle, an Audi Station Wagon registration number [XXXXXX]. My partner, Laryl Annette Snell, was the only passenger and was seated in the front passenger seat. We were travelling from our home at Pearl Beach to Cremorne.

I was driving in the transit lane on the Gore Hill Freeway when my motor vehicle collided with the rear of a truck that I believe was stationary in the transit lane. I do not recall seeing any hazard or other lights or any other warnings indicating the presence of the truck.

11The majority of this statement reflects nothing more than a statement of events. It is the last sentence towards which submissions by counsel were directed. Resolving the factual scenario on this point also goes to the basis of the plea entered by the offender as being one ""entered on the basis of a failure to keep a proper lookout.""1 This is a statement devoid of anything other than an anodyne conclusion of what caused the accident to happen. It is incomplete as to the why and does not address the degree of moral culpability attaching to the manner of driving or contribute significantly to evaluating the level of objective seriousness within the commission of the offence. To resolve these issues more is required.

12Those answers are to be found in two reports tendered by counsel for the offender, one of little or no consequence, one of material assistance. 

13The lengthy report from Dr Max Humphreys is tendered as an expert report. It purports to comply with the District Court Bulletin on experts dated 2/10/2002. There is no issue that it does not. The report describes the offender's ocular history, his visual fields prior to the collision, results of a visual examination, potential importance of visual perceptual factors and attempts to draw conclusions as to the influence of the driver's visual problems on the likelihood of the collision. 

14Dr Humphreys describes the less than optimum capacity within the offender's eyesight. The Court accepts that for a variety of reasons set out within the body of the report the offender is not blessed with perfect vision. It is problematic whether the limitations on the effectiveness of his vision played a part in this tragedy. The Court notes the offender successfully navigated his way from Pearl Beach on the Central Coast to the scene of the accident without any suggestion of an inability to cognitively cope with the surrounding environment during this journey.

15The Court also notes that at page 7 of Dr Humphreys' report the offender is assessed as eligible for an unrestricted driver's licence. The question to be answered is to what degree do the offender's issues surrounding his visual acuity mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence? In layman's terms does it partially excuse his conduct and thereby ameliorate the assessed seriousness of the offending? It is the view of the Court that it cannot; and for good reason.

16It is the view of the Court that every person issued with a licence to drive assumes the same level of responsibility for public safety and the preservation of human life as the next person. There can be no rational basis for a sliding scale of accountability predicated on the potential impact of a physical impediment. To introduce such a standard would lead to a higher level of expectation from those who have no impediment, whether visual or otherwise, and introduce inordinate difficulty in determining whether one impediment was more intrusive and thus more ameliorating than another to the point of inequality in treatment. The corollary might arguably be that those who know they have an identified impediment would be expected to be more diligent than the ordinary person. Such an approach would not assist this offender.

17The detail in the Optometrist's report is certainly relevant on the question of whether the offender should be issued with a licence but not on the question of the appropriate sentence or degree of culpability for an offence. At its highest it is to be regarded as informative but neutral.

18In any event on the facts as agreed, the inference is that whatever may have been the limiting factors in relation to the offender's visual acuity, he clearly did not see the stationary truck until the very last second(s). At page 10, paragraph 4 of Dr Humphreys' report, he opines:

The collision appears to have occurred due to Mr Pelletier either misjudging the distance between his car and the truck or not seeing the stationary truck early enough to avoid the collision or misjudging it to be moving.

19Observations made by others and contained within the report of Jamieson Foley, Consulting Forensic Engineers point overwhelmingly to the second of the three opinions, that is, the offender did not see the stationary truck because he failed to keep a proper lookout. Indeed the defendant's own statement that he could ""not recall seeing any hazard or other lights or any other warnings indicting the presence of the truck"" is inconsistent with the first and third propositions expounded by Dr Humphreys. This too is the essence of his plea of guilty. The issue in this regard is, for how long did he fail to keep a proper lookout?

20The Jamieson Foley report is tendered as an expert report falling within the same ambit of requirement for this status as the report by Dr Humphreys. The report is informative but in terms of the ultimate opinion, when it comes to its conclusions regarding perception/ reaction times, contradictory. 

21The report goes to some length to explain the meaning of ""Accommodation/ Perception and Reaction"" in relation to the basic steps a driver needs to undertake to react to environmental factors, in this case the stationary truck on the road ahead. It is not necessary to repeat the essence of this concept. The author expresses an opinion at page 24 that the closing speed of the offender's vehicle and the stationary truck in the surrounding circumstances was such that the ambiguity of not expecting a stationary image ahead renders the accident totally explicable. 

22Such an opinion is not shared by the Court. The plea and the concession within it together with the weight of other material within the report strongly caution against accepting an opinion that argues against a lower level of culpability. 

23Why this is so starts with the final two paragraphs at page 45 of the expert report. This part of the report asserts:

The total time consumed for this process varies (ibid). Factors which affect the time consumed for perception/reaction include: alertness of road user; weather conditions; light conditions road users experience in similar circumstances.

For almost all road users, the range of times consumed by this process spreads between .75 of one second (in an almost ideal situation) through to about 2.5 seconds for less clear situations. Having quoted this ""most common"" time range it should be noted there have been experimental incidences where road users have reacted faster than the time range and also slower.

24Within the report are extracts from a number of witnesses, whose veracity and observations are relied on in part to assist in the formation of an opinion. Those extracts are informative as to the circumstances leading up to the accident and the inferences that arise going to the degree of seriousness in the offender's conduct.

25Alison Scotland made her first observation of the stationary truck from a distance she estimated as 50-100 metres whilst travelling behind the offender's vehicle. Robert Jarden, the driver of a bus in front of the offender, saw the vehicle from an estimated 200 metres and changed lanes. His observations are similar to those of Peter Shaw, a passenger on the bus.

26Rodney Menzies saw the stationary truck from an estimated 200 metres away, at a time he was travelling in the lane alongside the offender and Ms Snell. Looking to the left he says he saw the offender and Ms Snell appearing to be in conversation. At the time he thought to himself that they should be changing lanes. An estimated 40-50 metres from the truck he reduced his speed to allow the offender's vehicle to change lanes only to see it remain in its lane until the last second when it swerved to the right towards his lane and hit the truck.

27The Jamieson Foley report takes these observations into account and expresses the view at part 6.2 on page 17:

It will be conservatively assumed ... there were no vehicles occupying the left of three lanes for about 200 metres prior to impact. Up until this point it is assumed the shuttle bus driven by Mr Jarden (or some other vehicle) may have been occupying the lane thus blocking the view of Mr Pelletier.

28The overwhelming inference from these observations is that no one else had any identified difficulty seeing the stationary truck some 200 metres ahead. Those travelling in the lane in question changed lanes to cope with the obstruction well in advance of the truck. The observation by Mr Menzies from alongside the offender's vehicle after he detected the truck and from an estimated 200 metres to its rear is that the offender and Ms Snell were observably talking and distracted within themselves by it. 

29The reasonable inference is that in the course of engaging in that conversation the offender's attention to the road ahead was distracted. The distraction seems, on the observations of Mr Menzies in particular, to have lasted for almost the entirety of the journey from approximately 200 metres to the rear of the truck until the point of the last second swerve.

30The offender enters his plea on the basis of failing to keep a proper lookout. It is the view of the court for the purpose of sentencing that the degree of negligence established is towards the higher end of responsibility. The Jamieson Foley report does not lend itself to affecting that conclusion.

31The surrounding factors that elevated the duty of care of the offender were the speed at which he was travelling, the presence of other traffic and the fact that vehicles in front of the offender in the same lane as the offender were clearly changing lanes, all attracting a necessity for any reasonable and prudent driver to assess the roadway ahead and around his direction of travel. The offender's moral culpability is high and in the factual context is indicative of an abandonment of responsibility to keep a proper lookout for about 200 metres when travelling at about 80kph in the vicinity of other vehicles. Objectively the serious of the conduct within the commission of the offence attracts considerations of a sentence towards the higher end of the range.

The plea
32The charge before me is one remitted back to the Local Court from the District Court in accordance with section 169 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Counsel for the offender informed the Court a plea of guilty had been entered to this charge before the District Court and was adhered to in this jurisdiction. The submission was made that the plea is an early plea. This submission was disputed by the solicitor representing the DPP. The Court agrees with the DPP that the plea is not an early plea. So much is made obvious by reference to the Principles of General Application set out in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102.

33The choice by the offender to delay the plea for reasons unconnected with ultimate guilt will result in a reduction in the discount. Principles 8 and 9 are clear on this point. In my view the utilitarian value of the plea is measured at 15%. An argument that the offender was constrained in entering a plea at an earlier date because of the existence of a more serious charge is unpersuasive. Section 22(1) makes provision for an offender to indicate an intention to plead guilty rather than enter a plea of guilty. The offender could have availed himself of his opportunity but chose not to do so.

Victim Impact Statement
34Section 3A(g) provides that one of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender is ""to recognise the harm done to the victim and the crime to the community"".2 

35The DPP tendered a Victim Impact Statement prepared by Stuart Snell, Ms Snell's son. Such a statement is admissible pursuant to section 30 of the Sentencing Act. Out of respect for Mr Snell's privacy the details of the statement will not form part of the reasons for sentence in this matter. I do however acknowledge the heartfelt and deep sense of loss experienced by Mr Snell. 

36As I have observed from my own experience and from previous matters, the sudden and unexpected death of a loved one disturbs our perception of the natural order of things in life. A life lost in such tragic circumstances sears our memories with a greater sense of loss not least because it takes away the opportunity to say goodbye and express our gratitude for all that the person has done for us and meant to us. 

37Having made this observation it is nonetheless the case that the law does not allow the personal impact of the loss of a life to be taken into account on the quantum of sentence. As Howie J said in R v Barbetta [2008] NSWSC 688 at [18]:

Under the law all lives are precious and the death of any person is a harm inflicted on the community in general.

38In addition to the immediate and enduring sense of loss following the death of his mother Mr Snell recounts a subsequent event involving the offender and his late mother's estate. I can make no comment on this circumstance. The issues between Mr Snell and the offender, so I am informed, are sub judice in the Supreme Court. 

Subjective factors
39The offender is a 71 year old former legal practitioner. Retired, he describes himself as a pensioner. His letter to the Court dated 23 July 2014 indicates that he and Ms Snell had been ""a couple"" for some 7 years and had lived together for the 5 years prior to her death. He is a person without a criminal record and is thereby entitled to be regarded as a person of previous good character and one who is unlikely to reoffend. His traffic record is middling. It contains a number of entries for minor traffic matters. It is not sufficiently extensive to attract the sort of considerations expressed in Tsakonas v R [2009] NSWCCA 258 at [37]-[39]. Given the offender's age and antecedents, for the purposes of section 21A(3)(h) there are good prospects of rehabilitation.

40Correspondence from Reverend Watt of the Uniting Church; Dr Hor, the offender's long term medical practitioner; and Dianne Pelletier, his former wife points towards an acceptance that the offender is deeply remorseful for the events of 27 February 2012. I understand that in the mind of Mr Snell this acceptance may be coloured by subsequent events, however for the purpose of section 21A(3) I do find genuine contrition is established. 

41The report from Dr Diamond, Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 3 July 2014 referring to his treatment of the offender confirms the deep and abiding impact this tragedy has had on the offender particularly on his mental health. He is described as suffering from adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety arising out of the accident. Dr Diamond's prognosis is that the condition is likely to remain and will not resolve easily or quickly. It is reasonable to observe that outside any penalty this Court imposes, the offender will continue to endure the consequences of knowing that it was he who is responsible for the death of another person. The consequences are self-inflicted, however this does not make them any less real.

42Outside these factors I have already referred to the fact of the offender's plea of guilty. On balance he is unlikely to reoffend.

The sentence
43Sentencing for an offence that is the product of tragedy arising out of an everyday and otherwise lawful activity is one of the most difficult tasks in which a Court may become engaged. The collective psyche of the community at large is not easily reconciled to the need for punishment attaching to negligence through the experience of failing to keep a proper lookout. This is because it is likely that everyone who drives a motor vehicle has been at one time or another guilty of this act of omission but fortunately with little or no consequence. The concept in judging tragedy in these circumstances will invariably be tempered at first blush by the aphorism ""there but for the Grace of God go I"". This form of self-evaluation is not something that sits comfortably with the criminal law. Courts are required to apply the law, not distort it.

44Some everyday courses of conduct are subject to a criminal sanction when unacceptable consequences flow from a failure to achieve an acceptable standard of performance. This offence is one of them.

45Parliament has legislated on behalf of the community in this area and over the years has periodically increased the maximum penalties for this offence in pursuit of general deterrence. As will be observed later in these remarks, the express will of the Parliament is not to be ignored.

46Counsel for the offender submitted the appropriate penalty for this matter was a bond under section 9 of the Sentencing Act. It was also submitted that for reasons to do with his place of residence and need to attend a variety of medical and related practitioners the statutory period of disqualification that flows from conviction be reduced significantly.

47In support of submissions on the offender's subjective circumstances counsel referred the Court to the decisions of R v Dhanhoa [2000] NSWCCA 257 and Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48. 

48The decision in Dhanhoa relates to a crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence. I think it safe to observe from reading the lead judgment of Priestley JA that had it not been for the double jeopardy principles his Honour would have been inclined to increase the sentence at first instance. The purpose of the decision however seems to be that it is open to the sentencing judge to take into account psychiatric evidence regarding the impact of the offence on the offender by reason of his relationship to the deceased such that it may lead to the exercise of discretion to impose a lesser sentence.

49The decision in Hughes was a severity appeal against the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Judge at first instance. The focus of submissions from this decision relate to the consequences of remorse where the victim is a person with whom the offender was in a relationship. The court cited the observations of Lord Lane in R v Boswell and Other Appeals (1984) 3 All ER 353 at 357: 

Sometimes the effect on the defendant if he is genuinely remorseful, if he is genuinely shocked [may be]... a possible mitigating factor.

The court held at [25] that:

Although his Honour referred to the despair and depression that the applicant experienced at the loss of Ms Cook, and the consequent genuineness of his remorse, it is difficult to conclude that this significant element of mitigation ... has been appropriately reflected [in the sentence].

50I have already referred to the impact of the reality that the offender is solely responsible for the death of Ms Snell on his mental health. I accept the observations in the foregoing cases require me at law to take that factor into account, with other factors, in mitigation of penalty. This is not to say that such a circumstance mitigates the sentence to such an extent that it fails to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending. It is however to be applied with other factors in the reasoning process applied in determining the appropriate sentence. 

51In the course of sentencing submissions I raised the decision of Howie J in Bonsu v R [2009] NSWCCA 316 at [19] and [24] in particular. Therein the Court said at [19] that ""little regard or insufficient regard is being paid in the Local Court or the District Court on appeal to the fact that the offender being sentenced has caused the loss of life"", and at [24] that ""the range of penalties being imposed, at least in the Local Court, is inadequate"". 

52Counsel for the offender submitted that his Honour's words are obiter and not binding on the Court. The response of this Court is, and must be, that when the Court of Criminal Appeal expresses a view in relation to consistency on sentencing and identifies a lack of appropriateness in the penalties being imposed, it behoves an inferior court to take heed lest it creates an environment whereby a Crown appeal predicated on inadequacy of sentence becomes an inevitable consequence.

53Further to the observations in Bonsu the decision in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [52] remains as a reminder of the need for a Court to recognize the intention of the legislature when there are increases in penalties (citations omitted):

Traditionally any intention on the part of the legislature that the offence should attract a heavier sentence has been manifested by an increase in the statutory maximum. The courts are expected to recognise and reflect that intention when sentencing offenders for offences after such amendments are made.

54Although the maximum penalty for this category of offence was increased in 1998 to 18 months the observation remains pertinent.

55In the context of these proceedings once it is established that the degree of negligence and thereby the moral culpability of the offending is towards the higher range of objective seriousness, then irrespective of the plea and the offender's subjective circumstances that go to mitigate the penalty, the observations of the court in Bonsu and Way bring the court to the point of considering whether the threshold set out in section 5 of the Sentencing Act has been crossed such that ""having considered all the possible alternatives... no other penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.""

56As Howie J said further in Bonsu -

19 ... I have difficulty in understanding how ... [section] 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 can be used for such an offence....
...
24 Nothing that I say in this matter and the penalty that I impose should be taken in any way by either a Magistrate in the Local Court or a Judge in the District Court to indicate that a good behaviour bond is an appropriate penalty for this offence in these circumstances.

57I turn to the observations of the Court in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 in relation to the steps that are to be taken. At [23] the Court said:

... when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment under that Act, a court is required to undertake a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. Each step requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender, but it is the first of those considerations that will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt. This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR(NSW) 554; R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594.

58In my view the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A of the Sentencing Act, particularly in relation to the need for general deterrence and denunciation point towards a sentence of imprisonment. This matter is markedly different from a case of momentary inattention of the type considered in R v Pyritz (1998) 29 MVR 90 and R v Foster (2001) 33 MVR 565 where the moral culpability was less because of the short period of inattention and thus warranted a sentence other than one of condign punishment. The conduct in this matter is far more serious. In my view the threshold under section 5 is crossed.

59Again, in line with the decision of Zamagias it is necessary to determine the length of the sentence and the manner in which it is to be served.

60The maximum available sentence for this offence is a term of 18 months imprisonment. The appropriate sentence for this offence having determined it is in the higher range of objective seriousness is a sentence of 14 months. After the application of the discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the plea the sentence will be one of 12 months.

61Once again in line with the decision in Zamagias I turn to the manner in which the sentence is to be served. 

62The Sentencing Act provides four alternative forms in which a sentence of imprisonment may be served. 

63The least onerous is by way of a suspended sentence pursuant to section 12 of the Act. I am not of the view a suspended sentence adequately meets the principle of general deterrence which, in matters of this nature, is the paramount pillar of consideration. The community must be made aware that the preservation of human life and maintenance of public safety in the use of a motor vehicle is of absolute importance. When the necessary standard is not achieved the consequences as in this case are tragic and irreversible. As was said in R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 at [49], ""a suspended sentence... provides very little, if anything, by way of general deterrence.""

64The offender's physical and mental health issues render him unlikely to be assessed as suitable for an Intensive Correction Order given the community service work component. The reports from both Dr Diamond and Dr Hor establish underlying medical conditions consistent with ageing and mental health problems arising from an acute grief reaction and shock related to the accident. Although an Intensive Correction Order is a sentence of imprisonment under the Act, its strictures do not lend themselves to consideration because of the offender's medical condition. In any event such a sentence would not adequately address the need in this case for general deterrence and denunciation.

65The offender's prior good character, plea of guilty, genuineness of remorse, mitigation of the kind accepted as appropriate in the decisions of Dhanhoa and Hughes and prospect of rehabilitation in combination are sufficient to persuade me that a sentence of full time imprisonment imposed under section 5 of the Act may be mitigated to the extent of not being appropriate. Those factors together with the need to manage his physiological and mental health issues on a long term basis point towards an assessment of suitability to serve the sentence about to be imposed by way of Home Detention under section 6 of the Act.

66The formal sentence of the Court is as follows:
THE DEFENDANT IS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO A NON PAROLE PERIOD OF IMPRISONMENT OF NINE MONTHS WITH AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS TO BE SERVED ON PAROLE. THE TOTAL SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT IS ONE OF TWELVE MONTHS. 
THE PROCEEDINGS WILL BE ADJOURNED UNTIL 9 OCTOBER 2014. DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ADJOURNMENT THE OFFENDER IS TO BE ASSESSED AS TO HIS SUITABILITY FOR HOME DETENTION.

Licence disqualification
67It was put to the Court that the Court should exercise its discretion to reduce the automatic period of disqualification. The automatic period is 3 years from the date of conviction. Counsel argued that a reduction would ameliorate the difficulties the offender would otherwise have attending medical practitioners because of his residential location. This may be so, however I am not persuaded in this matter that the Court should exercise its discretion to intervene and reduce the period of disqualification below the automatic period. The offender is disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence for the automatic period of 3 years. That period is to commence forthwith. The offender is to surrender his licence to the Court.

Facts

6On 20 July 2011, in the evening, two males, who were armed and disguised, broke into a residence in Marrickville and demanded from the owner the keys for a Suburu WRX which was parked on the street. They took the keys and drove off in the Suburu. Three or four hours later, the applicant drove the Suburu to Belmore where it was parked in the garage of a unit (Count 1).

7On 22 July 2011, the applicant drove the Suburu to Penshurst (Form 1, charge 1). He sprayed the inside of the vehicle with WD-40 to destroy forensic evidence. However police had installed a listening device in the vehicle which recorded the applicant's conversations with his co-offenders.

8Between 1 and 2 August 2011, the applicant stole the front and rear registration plates from another Suburu which was in Brighton-Le-Sands (Form 1, Charge 2). He placed those plates on the original Suburu and dumped its registration plates in a drain in Sans Souci.

9At about 3.45 am on 2 August 2011 the applicant and Jason Andrews and Simon Ahmed (the co-offenders) drove to the Botany Bay Water Police complex at Sans Souci. The applicant gave instructions to the co-offenders about stealing a police radio from the complex, including as to its location. The co-offenders went into the complex and stole the base of a radio and three ballistic vests. Andrews was apprehended (Count 2 and Form 1, charge 3). The applicant and Ahmed fled in the Suburu. The applicant asked Ahmed whether he grabbed ""the silver box"", to which Ahmed replied, ""I nearly grabbed it, I nearly got it.""

10In the early morning of 3 August 2011, the applicant travelled with Roberts and Ahmed to Chatswood Police Station. The applicant told them: ""Here's the scenario, we're getting a box"". The box was a reference to a police radio. The applicant and Roberts reconnoitred the scene and discussed the plan to steal a radio (Count 3 and Form 1, charge 4).

11At about 2.34 am they arrived at Marrickville where Ahmed collected a Glock pistol, which was placed in the door compartment of the Suburu. The applicant and Roberts travelled to Belmore and left the Glock pistol in a garage there. The applicant and Roberts then continued to try to find a radio in a police vehicle that was unattended.

12At about 10 pm on 4 August 2011, the applicant drove the Suburu from the garage in Penshurst and collected Roberts, the co-offender. They drove to the Arncliffe Scots Sports and Social Club car park where there was an unattended Audi station wagon. The applicant instructed Roberts how to drive the Audi to avoid detection. He advised him not to ""drive like a spastic"" because he did not want him to be ""seen and chased"" after they had stolen it. The applicant instructed Roberts to ""take their bags, everything. Fuck 'em, so they can't go back in and call the cops. Phones, everything"". He also said to Roberts:
""Even if it's a big cunt just whack him. Don't hesitate man. Say 'brother give me the keys. I'm asking you once, next time I crack you in the head,', do you know what I mean?""

13They planned to use a red and blue strobe light as if it were a police light to apprehend the driver of the Audi. Such a light was found plugged into the cigarette lighter of the Suburu (Counts 4 and 5).

14Police, who were monitoring the conversations via the listening device, were concerned for the safety of the owner of the Audi. When the applicant saw a fully marked police car which had been sent to the area, he drove to the M5 motorway and was recorded as travelling some 3.3 km in about one minute, which amounted to a speed in excess of 180 kph (s 166 certificate, charge 1).

15The applicant dropped Roberts off and proceeded to a driveway at Penshurst where he was arrested. At the time of his arrest he was wearing a black balaclava and black gloves (Count 6). A crowbar was found on the front sear and a number of housebreaking implements were in a bag on the rear seat (Count 7).

16On 5 August 2011 police executed a search warrant on an address at Belmore and found a .22 model Glock pistol (Count 8), further housebreaking implements (Form 1, charge 5), and fifty shotgun rounds (s 166 certificate, charge 2).

The Remarks on Sentence

Findings of objective seriousness of the offence

17His Honour described the applicant's conduct as amounting, in various respects, to ""serious criminal activity"" (Count 1), ""serious organised criminal activity"" (Count 2 and Form 1, charge 3) and, in respect of the attempts to find a police radio in an unattended car, ""brazen organised criminal activity"". His Honour considered, in relation to Counts 2 and 3, that the offender played the ""lead role"" in the criminal conduct and, in respect of counts 4 and 5, found that the applicant was ""the major organiser of this extremely serious conduct"".

18His Honour assessed the seriousness of the applicant's offending conduct and said:
""One can observe that the offender in a very short period of time, namely from 20 July until 5 August 2011, was involved in very serious criminal conduct. The conduct was not impetuous- it involved a good deal of planning in the main ...

""In my view this was very serious criminal conduct indeed. All of it was calculated criminal behaviour for financial benefit. The serious matter of the planned carjacking was very much an example of extremely serious criminal conduct.""

19His Honour addressed the effect of taking the Form 1 matters into account in the indicative sentence for Count 4 in the following terms:
""I will take into account the maximum penalties when I come to consider how much the Form 1 will aggravate the penalty that I must impose in respect of the conspiracy to commit robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon.""

Aggravating factors

20The sentencing judge took into account the fact that the applicant was on parole for the offence of possessing a precursor with intent to use in manufacture or production at the time of the offending.

The applicant's criminal history

21The sentencing judge noted that the applicant's criminal history does not entitle him to leniency ""to say the least"". His Honour noted that the applicant had been before the Children's Court for serious offences with respect to motor vehicles and had a finding of guilt for using a weapon to prevent lawful detection. In 2001 a sentence imposed on him for driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner and breaking and entering a building and stealing was suspended. In 2005 he was sentenced for stealing and attempting to steal motor vehicles, larceny, receiving and goods in custody as well as doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. He served sentences for these offences from 6 November 2005 until 5 November 2007, although he was on parole from 6 May 2007. While still on parole he committed further offences for which he was sentenced on 29 November 2007, which included the offence of possess precursor for which he was on parole when he committed the subject offending.

Subjective circumstances

22The sentencing judge took into account the report of Dr Nielssen who did not regard the applicant as meeting an accepted criteria for a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. His Honour also referred to the evidence of the applicant's wife, whom he married in March 2011, who operated a hairdressing salon in Carlingford. His Honour noted his wife's high opinion of the applicant and her preparedness to wait for him until he is at liberty. She gave birth to a daughter in early 2012. 

Prospects of rehabilitation

23His Honour found that the applicant had the capacity to rehabilitate himself but could not conclude that he had good prospects of so doing, having regard to his substantial criminal history. In the remarks on sentence his Honour said:
""I cannot conclude that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. He has the capacity to rehabilitate himself but his conduct over the last ten years or so does not instil one with confidence that he will turn his life around. Having seen him in the witness box I conclude it is a tragedy that he has decided to involve himself in considerable unlawful activity over a long period of time. He is a person with potential. If he chooses not to engage in criminal activity in the future I consider he has the capacity to become a worthwhile member of our community. He certainly has in my view the capacity to be engaged in useful employment.""

The applicant's evidence before the Sentencing Judge

24The sentencing judge found the applicant to be an honest witness in that he admitted that if the marked police car had not arrived at the club at Arncliffe the robbery would have taken place. His Honour found:
""I thought Mr Stoeski gave his evidence in a straightforward fashion. He did not seem to me to be seeking to avoid the consequences of his serious criminal conduct. From within the witness box, as best as I could detect, he expressed his wish to rehabilitate himself and turn his life around. He is very conscious of the fact that he engaged in serious criminal behaviour following the rekindling of relationships with peers who likely also, I think, have significant criminal records.""

The plea of guilty

25The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.

Commencement date of the sentence

26The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had been in custody since his parole was revoked on 19 August 2011 and that his sentence for the earlier offences expired on 6 June 2012. His Honour fixed the commencement date of the sentence at 1 January 2012.

Special circumstances

27Before the sentencing judge, the applicant accepted that there was no basis for a finding of special circumstances. However, the sentencing judge noted that as the sentence will be accumulated on an earlier sentence there could be some allowance for the ratio between the minimum term and the parole period to take account of time already spent in custody.

Co-offenders

28The sentencing judge, when addressing considerations of parity, said: 
""Certainly for the major offence of 4 and 5 August 2011 I conclude he very much was the organiser of that activity. He may well have been engaged by others to procure the police radio and other equipment but it is evident from the transcripts that it was the offender who was giving the directions to Mr Andrews and Mr Ahmed.""


The grounds of appeal

29The grounds of appeal that appear in the notice of appeal as filed are:

(1)His Honour erred in imposing a sentence of three years and nine months for ""Count 1"" and some lesser sentence is warranted, in that:

(a)His Honour gave greater weight to the objective criminality of the offence of accessory after the fact offence than was warranted;
(b)His Honour selected a starting point when settling on a sentence that was too high in all the circumstances.

(2)His Honour erred in imposing a sentence of seven and a half years for ""Count 4"" and some lesser sentence is warranted, in that:

(a)His Honour gave greater weight to the objective criminality of the offence of conspiracy to rob whilst armed with an offence weapon than was warranted;
(b)His Honour gave greater weight to the five matters on the Form 1 than was warranted.

(3)His Honour failed to apply properly the doctrine of totality when determining individual sentences and the aggregate sentence - in that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that the sentences being imposed upon the appellant was 95% cumulative to earlier cumulative sentences of nearly ten years imprisonment.

(4) (i) His Honour erred when determining the aggregate sentence in that he failed to apply to it the 25% utilitarian discount he had earlier given when setting individual sentences. 

(ii) Alternatively, when determining the aggregate sentence a starting point of 13 years and 4 months with a 9 year 4 month non-parole period was excessive and a lesser sentence was required.

(5) His Honour erred when making his finding that he ""could not conclude that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation"" [Sent. T. 25/06/13 p. 18.9] in that:

(a)His Honour erred in rejecting the uncontested evidence of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, without giving reasons why it was not to be accepted on the balance of probabilities.
(b)His Honour erred in failing to give any basis for preferring to rely upon the offender's conduct of the past ten or so years in circumstances where the defence had tendered evidence relevant to and contrary to the finding.

30Mr Nicholson SC, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, conceded that grounds 1 and 2 were inapposite since there is no appeal from ""indicative sentences"" that are indicated in the course of imposing an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act). The application for leave to appeal must be in respect of a ""sentence"", which is a sentence actually imposed, being the aggregate sentence, not an indicative sentence which, by definition, has not been imposed.

31Accordingly, the applicant sought leave to amend his notice of appeal to add the following further ground:
""His Honour erred in imposing an aggregate sentence which is manifestly excessive.""

32The applicant accepted that grounds 1 and 2 ought be treated as particulars of the new ground and that the submissions made in respect of them ought be regarded as being made in respect of it. I propose to address the indicative sentences for counts 1 and 4 in the context of the allegation of manifest excess in respect of the aggregate sentence. Ground 3, which concerns totality, is also relevant to the new ground of manifest excess. I will address the remainder of the grounds before turning to the new ground and ground 3, which will be dealt with together.

Ground 4: alleged failure to apply 25% discount when setting the aggregate sentence and manifest excess of aggregate sentence

33The applicant submitted that, if the sentencing judge applied the 25% discount, the starting point for the aggregate sentence must have been 13 years and 4 months with a 9 year and 4 month non-parole period. He submitted that this sentence would have been excessive. Accordingly, he contended that either the sentencing judge failed to apply the discount (in which case the sentence of 10 years with a 7 year non-parole period would need to be discounted by 25%) or the sentencing judge must have started at a point that was excessive (13 years and 4 months with a 9 year and 4 month non-parole period).

34I do not discern in the sentencing remarks any indication that the sentencing judge failed to apply the discount of 25% to the aggregate sentence. Indeed, I am satisfied by the remarks that his Honour applied the discount in accordance with his stated intention to do so. The starting point for the aggregate sentence was, accordingly, 13 years and 4 months with a 9 year and 4 month non-parole period. Whether this was manifestly excessive will be considered when the new ground is addressed below.

Ground 5: alleged error in sentencing judge's finding on prospects of rehabilitation

35The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge ""rejected the uncontested evidence of Dr Nielssen"". Dr Nielssen's opinion as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation was as follows: 
""Notwithstanding the apparent return to criminal activity so soon after release, Mr Stoeski was thought to have reasonably good prospects for longer term rehabilitation, on the basis of his capacity for work, the strength of his relationship and the absence of a current substance use disorder or an unremitting pattern of antisocial conduct.""

36The applicant also contended (in ground 5(b)) that the sentencing judge did not give reasons for relying on the applicant's conduct for the previous decade although the defence had tendered evidence ""relevant to and contrary to that finding"".

37As referred to earlier the applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing about which his Honour made findings which are set out above.

38The assessment of an offender's prospects of rehabilitation is a question of fact that is to be determined by the sentencing judge. As with the prediction of any further course of events or conduct, it is necessarily uncertain. Although judges may be assisted by reports of psychiatrists or psychologists, the assessment is to be made having regard to all the evidence of which the reports form a part. Those reports may be based on a particular history which may not correspond exactly with the facts as found by the sentencing judge. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept Dr Nielssen's opinion in terms since it was a piece of evidence to be weighed with all the other evidence admitted at the sentence hearing, including the applicant's own evidence and his criminal history. His Honour was obliged to come to an independent assessment of whether the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation and, if so, take it into account as a mitigating circumstance under s 21A(3)(h) of the Act.

39Although the future is not determined by the past, the past is a relevant circumstance when ascertaining future prospects. On the one hand, the applicant has a substantial criminal history; on the other he is not afflicted by mental illness or drug addiction. On the one hand, he is married to a woman who is devoted to him and who has had a child with him; on the other, he has several criminal associates who may tempt him, or be led by him, into recidivism. On the one hand he is motivated by financial gain; on the other, the financial rewards of criminal conduct are frequently greater in the short term than lawful means, although the risks of the former are greater. These are the matters which the sentencing judge had to balance and assess in forming a judgment as to whether the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. I consider his Honour's reasons to be ample to explain the conclusion, which was open to his Honour on the evidence.

40Ground 5 has not been made out.

New ground: manifest excess- indicative sentences for Counts 1 and 4 too high and too great a weight given to objective seriousness and Form 1 matters (formerly grounds 1 and 2) and totality (ground 3)

41Before addressing the substance of this ground, I propose to address the significance of indicative sentences in the context of an aggregate sentence imposed under s 53A of the Act. The Act requires a sentencing judge to set out the sentences that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence: s 53A(2)(b) of the Act. However, the specification of indicative sentences is not necessary for the aggregate sentence to be valid, since a failure to comply with s 53A does not invalidate an aggregate sentence: s 53A(5) of the Act.

42Nonetheless although the consequence of invalidity does not follow non-compliance, this is not to disparage their worth. The specification of indicative sentences serves a number of purposes, which were identified by R A Hulme J (Hall J agreeing) in R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [58] as follows:
(1)to assist the sentencing judge in the application of the totality principle;
(2)to expose for appellate review how the aggregate sentence was arrived at;
(3)to allow victims of crime and the public at large to appreciate the seriousness with which the court regards particular offences; and
(4)to allow this Court to assess an appropriate aggregate sentence if one or some of the convictions are quashed on appeal.

43The only purpose in examining the individual indicative sentences for counts 1 and 4 in the present application is that, if one or more of the individual indicative sentences is excessive, it may support the contention that the aggregate sentence was manifestly so. However, it must be borne in mind that the relationship between the indicative sentences for individual counts and the aggregate sentence depends at least as much on the degree of internal accumulation or concurrence implicit within the aggregate sentence as in the individual indicative integers. Furthermore, since manifest excess, like manifest inadequacy, is a conclusion, it is not necessary for the applicant to identify a specific error: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6].

The indicative sentence for count 1

44The starting point for the indicative sentence for count 1 was 5 years (before the application of the 25% discount for the plea of guilty). As the narrative of facts set out above indicates, the applicant was trusted by the two offenders who handed over the Subaru vehicle to him soon after the robbery. He concealed it in a garage and used WD-40 to reduce the risk of detection. When he took it out of the garage on the night of 1 August 2011, he stole number plates from another Subaru and dumped the original number plates in the drain. 

45In my view it was well open to the sentencing judge to regard the offence in count 1 as amounting to ""serious criminal activity"". The course of conduct was planned and carried out with a view to avoiding detection and identification. The objective seriousness of the offence is not reduced by the fact that, as the applicant submitted, it was ""spectacularly futile"" since ""police were already aware of the vehicle and its location"". Diligent police investigation and the use of surveillance devices do not operate in an offender's favour on sentencing.

46The assessment of objective seriousness of an offence and the weight to be given to such an assessment are pre-eminently within the discretion of the sentencing judge: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] per Spigelman CJ and at [46] per Simpson J (referred to with approval in R v KB; R v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [51]-[52]; see also Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [24]). Such assessment is an important factor to be taken into account in what has been described as the ""instinctive synthesis"" involved in sentencing: see, for example, Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [75] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ and Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [37]-[39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 

47An appellate court ought adopt a cautious approach before coming to the conclusion that the primary judge gave too much weight to one factor over another when no error in the sense addressed in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 has been identified, much less demonstrated.

48There is, in my view, no basis for concluding that the indicative sentence for count 1 would, if imposed, have been unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen. The seriousness of the offending, the circumstance that the offence was committed while the applicant was on parole, his criminal history of similar theft and the absence of mitigating circumstances are all relevant factors. I am not persuaded either that the starting point of five years for the indicative sentence for count 1 was too high or that any error in the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence has been shown. 

The indicative sentence for Count 4

49For similar reasons as are set out in respect of count 1, I am not satisfied that any error has been shown in the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of count 4 or the weight attributed to this factor in either the indicative sentence or the overall sentence.

50For the reasons given by the sentencing judge, the applicant was the dominant actor in the commission of this offence which he was bent on committing. The Form 1 offences are themselves very serious and are to be taken into account with a view to increasing the sentence for the principal offence due to the greater weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] per Spigelman CJ. As Spigelman CJ said at [18]: 
""A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. (See eg R v White (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 13; Murrell v The Queen (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 179 per Blackburn J; R v Vougdis (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 at 128-129; R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372.)""

Ground 3: alleged failure to apply totality having regard to earlier periods in custody

51The remarks on sentence disclose that his Honour was aware of the periods spent in custody for past offences and also the revocation of parole as a result of the offending conduct. Indeed, the sentence hearing was adjourned for the material relevant to the time in custody and the question of special circumstances to be obtained and considered.

52His Honour determined that the sentence for the index offences ought commence from 1 January 2012, which was some months before the expiry of the earlier sentence (which was unsuccessfully challenged in the Court: Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230). No criticism could, in my view, reasonably be made of the sentencing judge's exercise of discretion. The remarks on sentence reveal that the sentencing judge considered that there ought be a degree of concurrence between the aggregate sentence his Honour was imposing and the sentence for the previous offences. In these circumstances it must be concluded that his Honour took into account the previous offending in assessing the date from which the aggregate sentence ought commence and, accordingly, the totality of the criminal conduct. 

53Furthermore no inference can be drawn from the fact that the sentencing judge did not perform a calculation to ascertain what proportion the sum of the non-parole period and the period already spent in custody bore to the total term of the sentence. Such a calculation would be irrelevant. Nor is such a calculation required by s 44(2) of the Act. His Honour, having found special circumstances and stipulated the ratio between the non-parole period to the total term to be 70%, applied the ratio to the aggregate sentence his Honour imposed which was backdated to take account of some time spent in custody for previous offences as a result of revocation of parole. His Honour's approach was entirely orthodox and consistent with principle.

54The applicant's submission that the aggregate sentence was ""crushing"" does not assist in the analysis of whether it was open to the sentencing judge to impose such a sentence. The adjective ""crushing"" in this context is apt to refer to the type of sentence that is of such a length that it tends to deprive the offender of the hope and expectation of a useful life after release: R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [17]. I do not regard the word as apposite to describe the sentence in the instant case. The applicant will be eligible for parole on 31 December 2018, at which time he will be 37 years old.

55The applicant took exception to the sentencing judge describing the offending as ""extremely serious criminal conduct"" and submitted that the words disclosed error since they implied that the offending was in the worst case, when this could not reasonably be concluded. I do not consider this to be a fair construction of the phrase. I read it as saying no more than ""very, very serious"" criminal conduct. I regard the description as apt. Such semantic pedantry has no place in an analysis of remarks on sentence. 

Whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive

56The starting point for the aggregate sentence, before the discount for the plea of guilty was applied, was 13 years and 4 months with a 9 year 4 month non-parole period. The sentence was imposed in respect of significant offending conduct that occurred in the period between 20 July 2011 and 5 August 2011. The most serious offence, as was reflected in the indicative sentence, was count 4, which incorporated five Form 1 charges. For the reasons given above I discern no error in the indicative sentences for either counts 1 or 4, which are the most substantial indicative sentences.

57The sentence must take into account all relevant factors including the seriousness of the offending and the characteristics of the offender. The length of the sentence is a product of these matters. The seriousness of the offending conduct and the applicant's substantial criminal history do not suggest that the sentence was other than appropriate. The offences which involved a conspiracy to steal a police radio or acts that were designed to make the public believe that a private car was a police car are particularly heinous. Such offences have a tendency to undermine law enforcement by the police and interfere with police investigation and detection. The offences were committed deliberately and with considerable foresight, planning and cunning. I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

58Accordingly, the new ground, which incorporates grounds 1, 2 and 3, has not been made out.

Proposed orders

59The orders I propose are:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

2764566,Amaca Pty Ltd v Tullipan [2014] NSWCA 269,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The respondent, David Tullipan, suffers from a terminal lung condition. He brought proceedings in the Dust Diseases Tribunal alleging the condition was asbestosis brought on by inhaling asbestos dust from building material manufactured by the appellant, Amaca Pty Ltd. The appellant denied liability and argued the lung condition was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It was held by the trial judge that the lung condition had manifested itself as long ago as 2000 and that such longevity was more consistent with a diagnosis of asbestosis than IPF. In reaching this finding, the trial judge observed that the appellant's expert witnesses had conceded that the lung condition ""could not be anything but asbestosis"" if it had manifested in 2000, as the respondent would have already died if it were IPF. Damages were assessed at $1,464,282, with $350,000 of that amount reflecting general damages for pain and suffering. 

Section 32 of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW) provides a dissatisfied party with a right of appeal against a decision in point of law. The appellant alleged various errors of law, including in finding that there had been a concession by Amaca's medical experts and in the amount awarded for general damages. 

The Court (Basten JA, Gleeson JA and Leeming JA) held, dismissing the appeal:

1. No error in point of law was established in respect of the concession. The trial judge was entitled to find that the evidence of the appellant's expert witnesses supported the conclusion that longevity likely established asbestosis. It was incorrect to say that there was a concession that such longevity could only mean the condition was asbestosis, but the error was immaterial. Furthermore, there was evidence to support the finding that the lung condition had commenced as long ago as 2000: [31]-[37], [60] 

2. Counsel for Amaca accepted that if the challenge with respect to the alleged concessions failed, the appeal failed. It was therefore not necessary to address other grounds relating to liability: [22], [37]

3. A challenge to an award of damages where the appeal is limited to an error of law needs to demonstrate that the amount is so disproportionate to the harm that it cannot be assumed the judge operated correctly in accordance with the limits of his or her function under the law. The appellant failed to demonstrate this: [43]-[44]

Davies v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1942] AC 601; Miller v Jennings [1954] HCA 65; 92 CLR 190; Planet Fisheries Pty Ltd v La Rosa [1968] HCA 62; 119 CLR 118 applied.
Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 28; 78 CLR 353 considered




			Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The respondent, David Tullipan, suffers from a terminal lung condition.  If it were found, as a probability, to have been caused by inhalation of asbestos dust, the condition would be described as asbestosis and Mr Tullipan would be entitled to recover damages from the appellant, Amaca Pty Ltd.  If the causal link with asbestos were not demonstrated, the condition would be described as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (""IPF""), indicating that it was not caused by a known exogenous pathogen.  In that case, Amaca would not be liable.  In proceedings commenced by Mr Tullipan against Amaca, the Dust Diseases Tribunal (Finnane DCJ) was satisfied that the condition was caused by asbestos fibres and therefore found Amaca liable.  Amaca sought to challenge that finding in this Court on the basis that it was erroneous in point of law.
2The Tribunal awarded Mr Tullipan damages assessed at $1,464,282.  The largest proportion of that amount was for future economic loss.  If Mr Tullipan had not survived until judgment, he would not have been entitled to an award on that basis: Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1944 (NSW), s 2(2)(a)(ii).  Mr Tullipan is still alive, though his prognosis is not good.  There is no challenge to the assessment of future economic loss.
3The other significant element of the damages was an amount of $350,000 allowed on account of general damages for pain and suffering.  His entitlement to such damages did not depend on him surviving until judgment: Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW) (""the Tribunal Act""), s 12B(2).  Amaca sought to challenge that assessment as erroneous in point of law.
4The decision of the Tribunal was delivered on 4 June 2014.  On 4 July 2014 Amaca filed both a notice of appeal and a summons seeking relief in the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court.  Both proceedings were listed for hearing on 6 August 2014.  At the conclusion of the hearing the Court made orders dismissing both the appeal and the proceedings for judicial review.  This judgment sets out my reasons for making those orders.
Nature of proceedings in this Court5Pursuant to the Tribunal Act, there is an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal in point of law: s 32.  The finding that Mr Tullipan suffered from asbestosis was a finding of fact, based upon the medical evidence.  As will be explained below, Amaca struggled to identify a relevant decision of the Tribunal in point of law, let alone one which was erroneous.  A similar difficulty arose with respect to the challenge to the award of general damages, that being an evaluative judgment of a peculiarly indeterminate nature.
6On one view, a provision in the form of s 32(1) identifies as the subject matter of the appeal ""a decision of the Tribunal in point of law"".  While it is well established that there need not be an express decision, so long as a decision may be identified which is implicit within the Tribunal's reasons, there is doubt as to whether all forms of legal error fall within such an appeal.  It was perhaps for that reason that Amaca, as well as appealing, commenced proceedings by way of summons seeking judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal.  (As a matter of drafting, the summons inappropriately adopted the language of s 32, namely seeking to identify errors in point of law: it should have sought to identify error of law on the face of the record - as a ground for a quashing order - or jurisdictional error.)  
7Whether review is available for error of law on the face of the record is not beyond doubt.  Section 13(5) of the Tribunal Act contains a form of privative clause, stating that a decision of the Tribunal is not liable to be ""questioned or appealed against in any court"", except as provided by s 32 of the Tribunal Act ""or s 48 of the Supreme Court Act 1970.""  (The reference to s 48 of the Supreme Court Act appears to be inapt, as that provision allocates certain proceedings to this Court, but does not constitute a source of jurisdiction.)  Section 13(5) might have the effect of limiting judicial review to jurisdictional errors, in keeping with the approach adopted to s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW).  In any event, it is not necessary to pursue these issues further as no attempt was made to identify any error which might attract relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act which did not constitute error for the purposes of s 32 of the Tribunal Act.  The summons was therefore dismissed on the formal ground that it was otiose.
8The greater part of this Court's jurisdiction, other than appeals from a Division and civil appeals from the District Court, are expressed in some form as limited to questions of law.  As a result, the Court has considered on numerous occasions the limitations imposed by such language, in comparison with the scope of an appeal by way of rehearing under s 75A of the Supreme Court Act or s 127 of the District Court Act.
9It is generally accepted that such statutory provisions reflect an implicit distinction between errors of law and errors of fact.  However, although the distinction is legitimate, the boundary between the categories is porous.  Furthermore, different issues arise in different circumstances.  One critical aspect in considering the scope of appeals limited to questions of law is whether the appellant was the party bearing the onus of proof in the court below.  That party will face difficulties in identifying legal error on which to challenge an erroneous finding of fact of the kind identified by Glass JA in Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156-157.  However, Amaca was not an unsuccessful applicant: it was an unsuccessful respondent.  
10The difficulty in drawing a bright line boundary between errors of law and errors of fact is illustrated by the present case.  One aspect of Amaca's challenge was that the trial judge had ""ignored critical evidence"", being evidence tendered on behalf of Amaca.  That was described in various ways, including ""failing to afford procedural fairness to [Amaca]"" and as ""failing to exercise jurisdiction"": amended ground 7.  The scope for challenging findings of fact on such bases was noted in Goodwin v Commissioner of Police [2012] NSWCA 379 at [18]-[25].  The issue was also considered in State Super SAS Trustee Corporation v Cornes [2013] NSWCA 257, where the Court said:
""[11] Goodwin considered whether the rejection by the trial judge of a recusal application, based on a reasonable apprehension of bias, could give rise to a grievance with respect to a decision 'in point of law'.  However, the Court also identified the possibility that a mistake in understanding the facts, applying the law and reasoning to a conclusion could amount to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction if it revealed 'a basic misunderstanding of the case brought by an applicant, [so that] the resulting flaw is so serious as to undermine the lawfulness of the decision in question in a fundamental way': Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26; 77 ALJR 1088 at [88] (Kirby J), referred to in Goodwin at [20].  The reasoning also accepted the proposition that a failure by a tribunal to bring its own mind to bear on the issues before it was a constructive failure to exercise its jurisdiction: LVR (WA) Pty Ltd v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2012] FCAFC 90; 203 FCR 166 (North, Logan and Robertson JJ) at [5], reasoning adopted in Secretary for Justice v Simes [2012] NZCA 459 (Randerson J, writing for himself, Stevens and French JJ) at [58]-[59], and SZRUI v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship [2013] FCAFC 80, in relation to an administrative tribunal, particularly at [2]-[5] (Allsop CJ).
[12] Broad statements in Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries ... to the effect that a finding of fact which could be characterised as 'perverse' or 'illogical' does not raise a point of law should be understood as qualified in this way.  It is not in doubt that merely to identify a finding of fact as in some way erroneous does not raise a question of law.  However, if the finding has resulted from an error of the kind identified above, it may reveal a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction and thus an error of law.  The fact that the finding could also be fairly characterised as 'perverse', or the process of reasoning by which it was reached 'illogical', does not diminish the legal error so identified.  The language of perversity or illogicality is neither sufficient nor necessarily inadequate to identify a point of law: some greater level of precision may be necessary.""
11These issues can be articulated further by reference to the specific complaints made by Amaca with respect to the decision of the Tribunal.  There was, however, an entirely separate basis on which Amaca challenged the decision of the Tribunal, namely that its reasons were inadequate to comply with the legal obligation of the Tribunal to expose its reasoning.  This was treated as a ground separate from the complaint that particular evidence had not been properly addressed.  There was no specific complaint that the Tribunal had failed to make findings which were necessary for its ultimate conclusion: cf Waterways Authority v Fitzgibbon [2005] HCA 57; 79 ALJR 1816 at [129]-[130] (Hayne J).  As explained in Resource Pacific Pty Ltd v Wilkinson [2013] NSWCA 33 the content of the duty to give reasons will vary ""according to the nature of the jurisdiction which the court is exercising and the particular matter the subject of the decision"", referring to Wainohu v New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181 at [56] (French CJ and Kiefel J).
12Although its name identifies the Dust Diseases Tribunal as a tribunal, its status by statute is ""a court of record"": Tribunal Act, s 4(2).  Whilst it enjoys some procedural flexibility, designed to allow for the efficient exercise of its highly specialist jurisdiction and to address cases expeditiously where a claimant may be dying, it generally bears the hallmark of a court.  Thus proceedings are generally in open court (s 13(1)), parties have a right to legal representation (s 19) and the rules of evidence generally apply (s 25(1) and (2)).  The statute allows for some variation with respect to evidential material.  Thus, ""[h]istorical evidence and general medical evidence concerning dust exposure and dust diseases which had been admitted in any proceedings before the Tribunal may with leave of the Tribunal be received as evidence in any other proceedings"": s 25(3).  Further, there is scope for an ""issue of a general nature"" to be determined in one set of proceedings so that the finding may be available in later proceedings without being relitigated: s 25B.  
13The parties accepted that the dictates of justice in the present case warranted a significant level of expedition.  There was a debate as to whether it was proper to characterise the reasons of the Tribunal as having been given ""ex tempore"".  There is no reason to decide whether that label is apt or inapt: the fact is that, after a six day hearing concluding on 2 June 2014, reasons were given on 4 June 2014.  In those circumstances, the appropriate level of scrutiny of the tribunal's reasons is one which does not focus on infelicities of expression or possible ambiguities.  Further, to the extent that Amaca asserted that it was aggrieved because it did not know why it had lost, it is open to this Court to take into account the course of the proceedings in the Tribunal which had been completed only two days earlier.  Further, to the extent that Amaca alleged that the trial judge had failed to consider particular evidence, it is open to this Court to take account of discussion in the course of the hearing which demonstrated familiarity of the trial judge with respect to that evidence.  Given the brief period within which the proceedings were determined, it is implausible that matters discussed in open court on Monday had been forgotten by Wednesday of the same week.
14It is not necessary to set out the general principles regarding review for inadequacy of reasoning, which were summarised in Resource Pacific at [42]-[57].  As noted by Mahoney JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 273, ""it will ordinarily be sufficient if ... by his  reasons the judge apprises the parties of the broad outline and constituent facts of the reasoning on which he has acted.""  As counsel for the respondent noted, adopting the language of McHugh JA in Soulemezis at 281, ""great care needs to be taken that dissatisfaction with the finding of fact does not mislead the Court into holding that the learned judge has failed to give his reasons for his finding.""  Finally, in Soulemezis at 282, McHugh JA stated:
""What is decisive is that his Honour's judgment reveals the ground for, although not the detailed reasoning in support of, his finding of fact.  But that is enough where no appeal lies against the finding of fact.  Accordingly there was no failure to give reasons sufficient to constitute an error of law.""
15As will become apparent in considering the issues raised by the appellant, the attack on the reasons was an artefact: if the judge was entitled to decide the case on the basis which he in fact articulated, the failure to deal with other issues and other evidence was both justifiable and immaterial.
Issues16The nature of Mr Tullipan's condition depended entirely upon the medical evidence.  This evidence fell into two broad categories.  First, there was the historical evidence which included radiology (X-ray reports and high resolution CT scans), together with reports of treating doctors over a two year period from May 2007 until May 2009; none of these doctors gave oral evidence.  Secondly, there were experts for each party, who did give oral evidence.  The first complaint of the appellant is that the trial judge erred in ""failing to consider"" by failing ""to properly understand"" the historical evidence: ground 1(c), (d).  (There was also a complaint that the judge failed to ""make findings about such opinions"".)  Further, the judge was said to have failed to give reasons for not accepting those opinions: ground 2(c). 
17The second category of evidence covered the conflicting opinions of the principal experts called for the plaintiff and for Amaca.  The grounds of appeal identified the position adopted by the trial judge as preferring opinions of Professors Bryant and Breslin (called for the plaintiff) to the opinions of Professor McKenzie and Dr Jones (called by Amaca).  Again there were complaints of ""failing to consider"" by failing ""to properly understand"" the opinions of Professor McKenzie and Dr Jones and failing to make findings about those opinions (grounds 1(a), (b)), failing to ""properly understand"" the articles tendered as the basis for their opinions and make findings ""about"" such articles (ground 1(e)); failing to give adequate reasons for not accepting the opinions of Professor McKenzie and Dr Jones; and preferring the opinions of Professors Bryant and Breslin (grounds 2(a), (b), (d)) and ""preferring the opinions of Professors Bryant and Breslin to the opinions of Professor McKenzie and Dr Jones, based upon their supposed eminence and greater experience, when there was no evidence of these matters, and in any event such matters are not an appropriate substitute for recording and weighing the opinion evidence, and giving reasons for preferring one opinion over another"": ground 6.  There was a degree of tension between grounds 2 and 6.
18There were two more focused complaints.  One was an alleged error in finding that Professor Bryant had said that the plaintiff ""had had asbestosis since the year 2000"", there being no evidence to support such a finding: ground 3.  The second specific complaint alleged an erroneous finding that ""all the medical evidence"" supported the view that the plaintiff must have had asbestosis, ""otherwise he would be dead years ago"", when the opinions of Professor McKenzie and Dr Jones were to the contrary: ground 5.
19It remains to note the terms of ground 4, which was closely related to ground 5.  Ground 4 was of central importance in the way in which Amaca presented its case on appeal.  Counsel for Amaca accepted that if ground 4 were not upheld, the appeal on liability must fail: CA Tcpt, 06/08/14, pp 26(7)-(10), 28(10)-(12).  Accordingly, it is convenient to set out ground 4 in full:
""The trial judge erred in point of law in finding that both Dr Jones and Professor McKenzie conceded that if [the plaintiff] had his disease as long ago as 2000, it could not be anything but asbestosis, when there were no such concessions made.""
20Ground 7 alleged, in generic terms, that the trial judge ""ignored critical evidence in the case and failed to give adequate reasons for his decision on the issue of diagnosis"".  These factors, which had been particularised in the earlier grounds, were said to promote a sense of grievance, and to constitute procedural unfairness and a failure to exercise jurisdiction.  It is sufficient to note that the particular grounds must be established at a sufficiently serious level to warrant such descriptions.
21Ground 8 was a challenge to general damages as being outside a sound discretionary range.  No specific error was identified in the reasons: the award itself was said to ""demonstrate appealable error of law.""
22Because counsel for Amaca accepted the central importance of the alleged concessions, it is convenient to start by addressing that issue.
Challenge to concessions23The experts were agreed on three propositions central to the determination of an appropriate diagnosis.  First, the plaintiff's condition was consistent only with asbestosis or IPF: there was no plausible third option.  Secondly, a precondition to a diagnosis of asbestosis was a history of sufficient exposure to airborne asbestos dust.  The level of exposure was, to some extent, controversial but Amaca conceded, at least in this Court, that there had been sufficient exposure to satisfy that precondition.
24Beyond these propositions, there were particular diagnostic criteria which were associated with one disease rather than the other.  However, absent a biopsy, which was not practicable in relation to the plaintiff, each criterion which might inform a differential diagnosis was indecisive.  For example, there was a question as to the likelihood of there being asbestosis, absent pleural plaques.  Not only was there debate as to the relative significance of the absence of pleural plaques, but there was disagreement as to whether the plaintiff exhibited that symptom.  The criterion which had the greatest potential to permit a diagnosis of asbestosis in the present case was the longevity of the disease.  Thus, asbestosis was a condition which progressed slowly (some patients might die with, rather than from, asbestosis), whereas IPF generally progressed much faster.  The plaintiff's case was that he had had the disease for at least 12 years and that the probability of a person with IPF surviving more than four or five years was remote: accordingly the correct diagnosis on the probabilities was asbestosis.  
25The judge discussed in some detail the history of the plaintiff's medical examinations from May 2007 when he was experiencing symptoms including a cough, a hoarse voice and occasional breathlessness.  X-rays were taken at that time, as was a high resolution CT scan.  However, it was later discovered that an X-ray had been taken in 2005.  That X-ray was shown to Dr Bryant shortly before the hearing.  The judge stated (reasons, p 9):
""With that X-ray, Dr Bryant, who did not have it initially when he did his reports, was able to come to the opinion that this man had this disease, asbestosis, as long ago as 2000.  That is, it was manifesting itself in 2000.  And in his opinion, it could not be idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis because that disease is one of rapid progression and if he had had that in 2000 he would have been dead years ago.  It was just not possible for him still to be alive.
Ultimately, Dr Jones, who certainly is an expert radiologist, and Dr McKenzie conceded that if he had this disease as long ago as 2000, it could not be anything but asbestosis.""
26In a later passage (reasons, p 10) the judge explained that, given Dr Bryant's very extensive experience and expertise, the fact that he was a treating doctor and that his opinion was backed by Professor Breslin, an eminent authority in the area, he preferred Professor Bryant's opinion to that of Drs McKenzie and Jones.  The judge continued:
""To some extent they differ, but they do not differ on the essential matter that this man should have been dead years ago if he had idiopathic pulmonary disease.  I therefore have come to the conclusion that he did have asbestosis, he has got asbestosis.""
27These statements should be read together: that is the final statement suggesting that Dr McKenzie and Dr Jones accepted that the plaintiff ""should have been dead years ago"" depended on an assumption as to the point at which he first manifested the disease.  Amaca's challenge to these passages was twofold.  First, it challenged the characterisation of the evidence of its witnesses as a ""concession"" in the terms identified by the trial judge.  Secondly, it challenged the finding purportedly based on Dr Bryant's opinion that the plaintiff had in fact had the disease ""as long ago as 2000.""  
28It is convenient to refer first to the evidence of Dr McKenzie.  He was taken in cross-examination to the X-ray report from 2005 which showed the existence of fibrotic changes: Tcpt, p 202(37).  He accepted that the radiologist ""described what he saw as coarse increased interstitial markings"" and that they ""may represent long standing pulmonary fibrosis"": p 202(43)-(46).  He further agreed that the report was consistent with ""the existence as early as 2005 of interstitial disease that was clearly found to be present in 2007.""  He also agreed that if there had in fact been interstitial disease seen by the radiologist in 2005 ""it would have been developing for some years prior to 2005"": p 202(50).  The cross-examination and answers continued:
""Q.  If we make that assumption that the interstitial process had been progressing for some time before 2005 and had progressed to the stage of honeycombing in 2007, which the CT scans demonstrate, it is highly probable is it not that if what Mr Tullipan had was IPF, he would be dead by now.  A - Yes, more probable than not, so - 
Q.  And for that reason it is more likely, is it not, that his fibrosis is a result of asbestosis and not idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  A - I don't agree that follows.
Q.  Well the length of time, if one assumes the fibrosis occurred before 2005 to the present, would make it much more likely, would it not, that what Mr Tullipan is suffering from is asbestosis rather than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  A - I disagree with that.  I would say if someone had asbestosis in 2005 with normal lung function in 2005 the chance of that person being dead from asbestosis in 2014 I would say is well less than 10%.  I would say that it is very, very unlikely.  Whereas I think there is probably a 20 to 30% chance that someone could have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for that long.""
29The denial with which the last answer commenced was contradicted by the explanation.  Treating the survival rate as the obverse of the mortality rate, the survival rate for a person with asbestosis was 90%.  The highest survival rate proffered for a person with IPF was 30%.  That is, a person having pulmonary fibrosis in 2005 and surviving to 2014 was at least three times as likely to be suffering from asbestosis as IPF.  Those figures more than satisfy a standard applying the balance of probabilities.  That constituted a sufficient concession to warrant the remark by the trial judge.  Nevertheless, the cross-examiner returned to the fray shortly thereafter eliciting the following answers (p 204):
""Q.  Professor, if the plaintiff had fibrosis as early as about 2003, and if he was suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as you have said, if he is still alive now, that would be an unusually long survival time for the condition.  A - Yes it would.
Q.  Most would be dead years ago.  A - Yes.  ...
Q.  Mr Tullipan's survival from an apparent onset of fibrosis in 2003 to the present is more consistent with asbestosis than with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, do you agree with that proposition.  A - Yes, I think I will agree with that.""
30The cross-examiner undertook a similar line of questioning with Dr Jones, ending with the following exchange (p 144):
""Q.  If Mr Tullipan had fibrosis as early as 2003 and if he in fact was suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, that would be an unusually long survival time would it not.  A. - Yes it would.
Q.  And that survival time and that circumstance would be more consistent I would suggest with asbestosis than with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  A. - Yes it would.
31Dr McKenzie, dealing with the passage of eight or nine years, treated the survival rate in IPF sufferers as no greater than 30%.  Dr Jones gave evidence that the mortality rate from IPF at five years was 70% and the survival rate 30%: Tcpt, p 143(14).  The finding by the trial judge as to agreement that the plaintiff ""should have been dead years ago"" if he had IPF was imprecise and involved an unnecessary element of hyperbole.  It did not, however, involve any material error.  It is correct to say that neither Dr Jones nor Dr McKenzie conceded that ""if he had this disease as long ago as 2000, it could not be anything but asbestosis.""  This statement involved two errors, but neither of them assists Amaca.  First, Dr McKenzie used a period from the date of the first X-ray in 2005.  (Counsel may have been confused by the figures cited and not realised it was a powerful concession.)  In the second passage, Dr McKenzie accepted the probability when the disease was measured from 2003.  Counsel used the same year, 2003, in obtaining the final concession from Dr Jones.  He may also have failed to appreciate that Dr Jones gave a survival rate of 30% at five years, which would have been satisfied by going back no further than 2007.  Thus, it would have been sufficient for Mr Tullipan's purposes if the concessions had been identified by reference to a disease commencing in 2003: however, the concession would have strengthened rather than diminished by going back to 2000.  More importantly, with respect to Dr McKenzie, reliance on 2005 would have been sufficient because he accepted that the disease in fact would have developed some years prior to 2005.  The error was therefore harmless. 
32This analysis assumes that the relative frequencies of asbestosis and IPF were comparable, an assumption consistent with the concessions.  It should also be noted that the analysis relevant to competing causes for a known disease may be quite different from that applicable to the differential diagnosis of an unknown disease, where there are only two competing candidates: cf Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111 at [56], [64] and [70].
33The second error was a case of hyperbole.  Neither witness said ""it could not be anything but asbestosis.""  In fact, both witnesses adhered to the view that it could be IPF.  Each did so on the apparent basis that if some might live longer than five years with IPF, that possibility remained open.  Dr Jones said ""the time scale [for IPF] is something like 12 years"": p 143.  By ""time scale"" he appears to have meant something like the longest possible period of survival absent exceptional circumstances.  The plaintiff's case, however, had to be determined on the balance of probabilities and not by the exclusion of mere possibilities.  
34The final step in the reasoning required that there be evidence to support the finding that formed the basis of the concessions, namely that Mr Tullipan had fibrosis ""as early as 2003"".  Amaca challenged the finding, supposedly based on Dr Bryant, that the disease had arisen ""as long as 2000.""  Dr Bryant did not give such evidence, according to the appellant.  Amaca submitted that the finding by the trial judge was based on a misreading of the following evidence (Tcpt, p 30), where Dr Bryant had stated:
""My opinion was that ... because the honeycombing was detected in 2007, that it's likely that this condition has been going for at least some years irrespective of the 2007 chest X-ray which I've only just become aware of.  So I felt that this suggested that the condition that we're observing now had its genesis back sometime in the period in the early years of 2000."" (Emphasis added.)
35Amaca's point was that ""the early years of 2000"" meant somewhere between 2001 and 2004, perhaps, but not ""as long ago as 2000"".  If this were a factual error, it would have been immaterial because this evidence was at least consistent with a disease dating from 2003, which was the basis of the relevant concessions.  However, there was no factual error.  One point that Dr Bryant appeared to be making was that he had reached that conclusion as to the genesis of the disease without having access to the 2005 X-ray.  He gave further evidence in cross-examination (Tcpt, p 176) in the following terms:
""... if he had a highly abnormal chest X-ray and CT scan back in 2005 or 2007 but normal lung function, and if the disease has been progressing since that time at the same rate that it was beforehand and there is no reason to assume that it is an incorrect proposition, then it has taken him nine years to go from having few, if any symptoms to being at death's door.  Presumably that means that the condition was present for five or ten years beforehand, so we're talking about a disease which is progressing actually very slowly, it's taken nearly 20 years from the probable time of onset of his disease for him to die.  Now I have never seen a patient with IPF do that.""
36Shortly thereafter, adhering to that reasoning, he suggested that the disease had actually been present ""for a substantially longer period than [from] 2005"" but said, ""I can't tell you [how] long.""  This evidence supported the finding that Professor Bryant held the opinion that the disease had commenced ""as long ago as 2000"".  The evidence of Professor Breslin, set out by Leeming JA, was to similar effect: Tcpt, p 88(27).
37The trial judge decided the case on the basis of the three factors referred to above.  The first two (sufficient exposure to asbestos and the absence of any third possibility) were not in dispute.  The third factor was longevity.  The principal witnesses for Amaca accepted, on the balance of probabilities, based on the known mortality and survival rates for the two conditions, that longevity demonstrated that the disease was more likely to be asbestosis.  The trial judge was entitled to accept that evidence and determine the case on that basis.  To do so demonstrated no error in point of law (or fact).  Accordingly, as counsel for Amaca conceded, if it failed on that challenge (which it does) the appeal with respect to liability must be dismissed (as it was).  The other issues do not arise.
38I agree with the further reasons of Leeming JA on this matter.
Challenge to general damages39The challenge to the award of general damages in the sum of $350,000 eschewed any reference to the reasoning of the trial judge.  That was, no doubt, because the judge ignored nothing that he was required to take into account and did not rely upon factors which he was prohibited by law from taking into account.  So much may be accepted: however, the fact that he gave careful attention to the suffering of the plaintiff, the periods over which that suffering had continued and its effect on his life, together with reference to the periods of hospitalisation demonstrate that the assessment was made by reference to relevant considerations and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.  To say that the award falls outside ""a sound discretionary range"" requires some indication as to the limits of that range and how far outside this figure is said to fall.  
40Counsel for the plaintiff noted that neither the trial judge nor this Court should ""seek out a norm or standard"" in the decision of either appellate or trial courts for the purpose of determining, by way of comparison, whether the award in question was ""disproportionate"": Planet Fisheries Pty Ltd v La Rosa [1968] HCA 62; 119 CLR 118 at 124 (Barwick CJ, Kitto and Menzies JJ).  That warning is to be accepted.  The correct approach in assessing what is fair and reasonable compensation for the injuries received and the disabilities caused was described in Planet Fisheries in the following terms at 125:
""It may be granted that a judge who is making such an assessment will be aware of and give weight to current general ideas of fairness and moderation.  But this general awareness is quite a different thing from what we were invited by Planet's counsel to act upon in this case.  The awareness must be a product of general experience and not formed ad hoc by a process of considering particular cases and endeavouring, necessarily unsuccessfully, to allow for differences between the circumstances of those cases and the circumstances of the case in hand.""
41The rejection of a ""norm or standard"" was unexceptional: as was the statement that the judge will make an assessment which is not arbitrary or capricious, but based upon ""general awareness"", as a product of general experience.  Such reasoning is consistent with the approach required of an appellate court in Davies v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1942] AC 601 at 616-617, where Lord Wright stated:
""An appellate court is always reluctant to interfere with a finding of the trial judge on any question of fact, but it is particularly reluctant to interfere with a finding on damages which differs from an ordinary finding of fact in that it is generally much more a matter of speculation and estimate.  No doubt, this statement is truer in respect of some cases than of others.  The damages in some cases may be objective and depend on definite facts and established rules of law ....  At the other end of the scale would come damages for pain and suffering or wrongs such as slander.  These latter cases are almost entirely [a] matter of impression and of common sense, and are only subject to review in very special cases.  ...  In effect the court, before it interferes with an award of damages, should be satisfied that the judge has acted on a wrong principle of law, or has misapprehended the facts, or has for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered.  It is not enough that there is a balance of opinion or preference.  The scale must go down heavily against the figure attacked if the appellate court is to interfere whether on the ground of excess or insufficiency.""
42This passage was cited with approval and applied by Dixon CJ and Kitto J in Miller v Jennings [1954] HCA 65; 92 CLR 190 at 195-196.  
43These statements were made in the context of appeals not restricted to questions of law.  It is arguable that the test to be applied on an appeal limited to errors of law is yet more constrained, although the practical result may not be different in most cases.  In a case limited to review for error of law, especially where reasons are given which demonstrate no error of law, the amount of the award must be so disproportionate to the harm done that the assumption that the judge had operated correctly in accordance with the limits of his or her function under the law, must be false: cf Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26; 78 CLR 353 at 360 (Dixon J).  Given the imprecision necessarily attendant upon an assessment of general damages, an appellant challenging an award for error of law will, in most cases, bear a heavy burden.
44There are of course principles of certainty and transparency which militate in favour of appellate intervention where what might be normally accepted as a proper range for an award of general damages appears to have been contravened.  However, such considerations have more traction in relation to an appeal by way of rehearing than one limited to the correction of decisions in point of law.  One way of demonstrating that the appellant did not satisfy this burden is by reference to the schedule of non-economic loss promulgated under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).  The maximum amount of damages now payable for a most extreme case, pursuant to s 16 of that Act, is $551,500.  The trial judge did not approach the assessment before him by reference to that figure (which was not legally applicable) and was correct in that regard.  Nevertheless, the fact that the award in this case was less than two-thirds of the statutory figure under the Civil Liability Act supports the view that, given the plaintiff's circumstances, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that the award was outside a sound discretionary range.
45For these reasons, the challenge to the quantum of the award for general damages was rejected.
Conclusions46In making orders on 6 August, the Court reserved the question of costs.  The parties were given leave to file submissions in respect of this issue, if agreement were not reached.  The Court has since been informed that agreement has been reached.
47For convenience, the substantive orders made by the Court on 6 August 2014 may be recorded - they were as follows:
In matter 2014/197925:Dismiss the summons filed by Amaca Pty Ltd on 4 July 2014 with costs to be costs in the appeal.
In matter 2014/179948:(1) With respect to the motion to amend the notice of appeal:
(a) grant Amaca Pty Ltd leave to file an amended notice of appeal as contained in the Orange Appeal Book at pp 34-39;(b) dispense with the requirements for service of the amended notice of appeal as filed;(c) order that costs of the motion be costs in the appeal.
(2) Dismiss the respondent's motion to strike out the notice of appeal as incompetent, with costs of the motion to be costs in the appeal.
(3) Dismiss the appeal.
48GLEESON JA:  I agree with Basten JA and with the additional reasons of Leeming JA.
49LEEMING JA:  I agree with the reasons of Basten JA.  It follows in particular that I agree with what his Honour has written about (a) the nature of the appeal, (b) the failure of Amaca's challenge to the finding of general damages, and (c) it being appropriate, in resolving Amaca's urgently expedited appeal, to deal only with the central and dispositive issue.  When the appeal was heard, senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that had there been evidence from the doctors called by Amaca conceding that, if Mr Tullipan had a disease as long ago as 2000, it could not be anything but asbestosis, then the appeal as to liability had to be dismissed.  The other alleged errors going to liability are not material, and should not delay the delivery of this Court's reasons for the orders made at the conclusion of the hearing.  
50I also agree with his Honour's analysis of the evidence so as to support the finding of liability, but wish to elaborate on some aspects of the reasoning and evidence.  For the litigation proceeded on a basis, perhaps unusual, which made the opinions of statistical likelihood more probative than may often be the case.
51First, the parties proceeded on the basis that Mr Tullipan's disease was one or other of asbestosis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  When dealing with statistics drawn from a population, an assessment of relative risk requires a consideration of all the possibilities:  Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111 at [56].  That requirement was satisfied.
52Secondly, it is known that exposure to asbestos fibres can cause asbestosis (although most people who are exposed do not develop the disease), and it was accepted that Mr Tullipan had sufficient exposure to asbestos to develop asbestosis.  However, it is not known what causes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (hence its description as ""idiopathic"").
53Thirdly, it was not possible to establish directly whether indeed Mr Tullipan suffers from asbestosis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (which are two distinct diseases but with similar clinical symptoms, both manifesting as pulmonary fibrosis).  In particular, it was common ground that it was not possible to obtain a biopsy so as to test for the presence of a larger than normal number of asbestos bodies in Mr Tullipan's lungs (there was apparently uncontroversial evidence in the academic literature that ""the presence of diffuse fibrosis and asbestos bodies in tissue sections are sensitive and specific criteria for diagnosis of asbestosis"":  Blue 128).  Hence the focus on evidence which indirectly supported a particular diagnosis.   
54Fourthly, Amaca accepted that it was open for the primary judge to accept evidence that there was pulmonary fibrosis not merely in 2005 but some years earlier ""in the early years of 2000"". 
55Fifthly, there was unequivocal evidence that most sufferers from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis die within ten years of diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis.  (There was evidence from the experts called by Mr Tullipan that the mean survival period was around three years, and that ""the great majority of patients are dead within 5 years of diagnosis"", although Amaca's experts considered that the position was not so bleak.).  On the other hand, most sufferers from asbestosis survive for ten years after diagnosis.  
56The differential survival rates (or mortality rates) are not by themselves sufficient to establish causation.  It is necessary also to have regard to the relative frequency of the two diseases.  Let it be assumed that disease A is highly likely to kill within 10 years, and disease B is highly unlikely to kill within 10 years.  If disease A is extremely common throughout the population, and disease B is extremely rare, it would be unsafe to conclude from the different survival rates per se that a person suffering from one of those diseases who has survived for 10 years is suffering from disease B.
57Although this appears not to have been addressed explicitly by the experts, all experts agreed that ""the main differential diagnosis [of asbestosis] is with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"" (as one of them, Professor Breslin, put it).  That would not be so if, for people who have been exposed to asbestos presenting with pulmonary fibrosis, one of the diseases was extremely common and the other extremely rare.  Further, there is a body of scientific literature (which was in evidence) directed to distinguishing asbestosis from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Accordingly, it is safe to proceed on the basis that the relative frequencies of asbestosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2013 were not so disproportionate as to detract from the significance of the different mortality rates.  (Whether this will continue to be true into the future is an open question; the literature suggested that the incidence of asbestosis was declining and likely to continue to do so, while the incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was increasing.)
58Sixthly, evidence as to the relative likelihood that a person who has been exposed to asbestos and who has pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed a decade ago is suffering from asbestosis as opposed to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was directly relevant to the question of discharging Mr Tullipan's burden of proof.  If the relative risk is sufficiently high, that may of itself support an inference of causal connection:  Amaca Pty Ltd v Booth [2011] HCA 53; 246 CLR 36 at [43] and [88].
59It follows that the relative likelihood that Mr Tullipan was suffering from asbestosis, as opposed to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, was very high.  It was capable of discharging the civil onus he bore, accepting (as I do) that the court is required to reach a level of actual persuasion:  see Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; (2000) 49 NSWLR 262 at [136].  Illustrative of this was the evidence of Professor Breslin:  
""for somebody with IPF to have virtually no symptoms in 2005, minimal symptoms in 2007, honeycombing in 2007, normal lung function in 2007 and to have survived what is at least, at least ten years, because his disease radiologically was present in 2005, probably started at least two to three years before that, so he's survived more than ten years in the presence of honeycombing, I think it's nigh upon fanciful to call that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.""
60In light of that background, one turns to the ""concessions"" relied on by the primary judge said to have been made by the expert witnesses called by Amaca, Dr McKenzie and Dr Jones.  Their evidence has been reproduced by Basten JA.  Although there is a factual error in the reasons of the primary judge (who referred to 10 years as the likely maximum survival period for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rather than 12 years) nothing turns on that.  It is also true that the evidence fell short of the ""certainty"" to which the primary judge referred, but again, nothing turns on that.  The evidence of Amaca's experts supported the conclusion that the most likely diagnosis, by a considerable margin, was asbestosis.  Indeed, it does not by much exaggerate Dr Jones' evidence in cross-examination that the combination of pulmonary fibrosis shortly after 2000 coupled with Mr Tullipan being alive in 2014, around 12 years later, meant that his disease could not be idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Dr Jones knew no one who had survived more than 12 years with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
61In consequence, there was no error in point of law (or fact) in the primary judge not addressing the other complexities in Amaca's case (such as the absence of pleural plaques or other pleural disease, the negative diagnoses by the doctors who first saw Mr Tullipan, and the conflicting evidence about the variability of the progress of the diseases).  ""A judge's reasons are not required to mention every fact or argument relied on by the losing party as relevant to an issue"":  Whisprun Pty Ltd v Dixon [2003] HCA 48; 200 ALR 447 at [62].
62For those reasons, which are wholly consistent with those of Basten JA, I joined in the Court's orders on 6 August 2014.

2764570,R v Gommeson [2014] NSWCCA 159,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Crown appeals under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed upon the Respondent, Robert William Gommeson, in the Sydney District Court on 11 October 2013 with respect to a series of offences of child sexual abuse.

2The Respondent pleaded guilty to 20 offences committed against seven victims between January 2005 and December 2011, at times when the young male victims were aged between nine and 16 years. The Respondent was aged between 55 and 62 years when the offences were committed. The Respondent befriended the families of the victims and the offences were committed in that context. By the time of the sentencing hearing in the District Court, the Respondent acknowledged that he was a paedophile.

The Offences and Sentences

3The Respondent pleaded guilty to the following offences:

(a) one count of possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment;

(b) 11 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 14 years (the circumstance of aggravation being that the victim was under the authority of the Respondent) contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900, each offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment;

(c) five counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 14 and 16 years (the circumstance of aggravation being that the victim was under the authority of the Respondent) contrary to s.66C(4) Crimes Act 1900, each offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 12 years' imprisonment;

(d) one count of attempted aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16 years contrary to s.61J(1) and s.344A Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment;

(e) two counts of aggravated indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years (the circumstance of aggravation being that the victim was under the authority of the Respondent) contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900, each offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of eight years.

4In passing sentence with respect to a number of these offences, the Respondent asked the sentencing Judge to take into account, on four separate Form 1 documents, a further 11 offences. Those offences were:

(a) three offences of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 14 years contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900;

(b) six offences of aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 16 years contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900;

(c) one offence of aggravated act of indecency contrary to s.61O(1) Crimes Act 1900;

(d) one offence of indecent assault contrary to s.61L Crimes Act 1900.

5As mentioned, there were seven victims of the Respondent's crimes:

(a) JG, who was aged between 10 and 13 years at the time of offences committed against him between 2005 and 2007; 

(b) KG (JG's brother), who was aged between 13 and 15 years when offences were committed against him in 2006 and 2007;

(c) JH, who was 14 years old when offences were committed against him in 2011;

(d) LW, who was 14 years old when offences were committed against him in 2009 and 2010;

(e) BW (the brother of LW and JW), who was between nine and 10 years old when an offence was committed against him in 2011;

(f) JW (the brother of LW and BW), who was between nine and 10 years old when an offence was committed against him in 2011; and

(g) JK, who was 13 years old when an offence was committed against him in 2009-2010.

Grounds of Appeal

8The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - the sentences for the offences against JH (Sequences 49 and 29) were manifestly inadequate.

(b) Ground 2 - the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate because of the inadequate accumulation of individual sentences.

Facts of the Offences

9An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Respondent gave evidence at that hearing and accepted the accuracy of the facts contained in the Agreed Statement.

10The nature of the Respondent's offending was identified briefly, in tabular form, in the recital of the offences and sentences set out at [6] above. However, some narrative description is required to allow a clear understanding of the breadth and extent of the Respondent's crimes.

11At all relevant times between 2005 and 2012, the Respondent (born in 1949) lived on his own in south-western Sydney. He befriended the families of each of the victims, who lived nearby. He came to be known to the victims as ""Uncle Bob"". In his evidence, the Respondent acknowledged that he was a paedophile. His offending conduct against the present victims encompassed a seven-year period between 2005 and 2011, when the Respondent was aged between 55 and 62 years.

12What follows is a shortened account of the offences drawn from the Agreed Statement of Facts.

Offences Against JG and KG

13JG met the Respondent when he was about 11 years old (about 2005). KG, who was two years older than JG, met the Respondent when he was about 12 years old. The Respondent was a close family friend who lived a short distance away and would socialise with the family of the boys on a regular basis. 

14JG and KG would regularly stay overnight at the Respondent's house on weekends. 

15Over an extended period of time, the Respondent engaged in conduct including the playing of pornographic movies to the boys, accompanied by sexual interaction with them. The activities involved, at times, each of them being naked in a spa bath. The Respondent provided alcoholic drinks to the boys as well as providing them with sex toys including rubber vaginas and a blow-up female doll. 

16The Respondent's sexual offending took place in his home with the boys and whilst on outings or weekends away. 

17The Respondent gave expensive items to the boys, as part of an ongoing process of grooming them and facilitating their involvement in sexual activities with him. These gifts included trail bikes, play station games, radio-controlled cars, pornographic magazines, clothing, a gym set, money and other items.

18In 2006, the Respondent took photographs of JG, then aged 11 or 12 years, lying naked on a bed in a sexually explicit pose. The Respondent retained these photographs, which were located at his house on the execution of a search warrant on 5 July 2012. An electronic copy of the photographs was located on a memory card discovered at the same time. These matters gave rise to the charge of possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 for which the Respondent was sentenced (see [6] above, Sequence 3).

19The charged offences and Form 1 offences were accepted by the Respondent as being representative counts, against the background of a significant number of other similar activities involving JG and KG. 

20The Respondent's sexual offences against KG continued up to KG's 16th birthday, after which the Respondent ceased to show interest in him. 

Offences Against JH

21JH had known the Respondent since he was eight years old (about 2005). His family lived a short distance from the Respondent and were good friends with him, socialising on a regular basis.

22When JH was about 10 years old, he commenced to spend the night on occasions at the Respondent's house together with his friend, LW. 

23On occasions when JH stayed at the Respondent's house, the Respondent touched him on the penis. This occurred many times, with the charged offences being representative counts. Much of this activity occurred when JH was in the spa bath with the Respondent, including occasions when LW was there, as well, and was touched by the Respondent in the same way.

24JH repeatedly demonstrated his unwillingness to participate in sexual activity with the Respondent by telling him to stop or pushing his hand away or otherwise manifesting resistance. Despite these responses from JH, the Respondent persisted in regular sexual abuse of him over a period of time. 

25The Respondent took JH to the Gold Coast on one occasion, but JH made it clear to him that he would not perform sexual acts with him. 

26On occasions when JH went to the Respondent's house, he was asked by the Respondent to fill out questionnaires compiled by the Respondent. A number of these documents were tendered at the sentencing hearing. They are in typed form, and included questions such as:

* ""Do you have fun at Bobs?"".

* ""Do you enjoy having your cock sucked at Bobs?"".

* ""Would you like to have sex with Bob and [LW]?"".

* ""What would you do to Bob for $50?"".

* ""What alcohol do you like?"".

* ""What would you do for Bob if he took you to Queensland?"".

27JH filled out questionnaires of this type about three times when he was at the Respondent's house.

28During the period in which JH would stay at the Respondent's house, he estimated that the Respondent had masturbated his penis at least 15 times and had sucked his penis about 10 times, and JH recalled seeing the Respondent masturbate and suck LW's penis.

29Over the years that JH knew the Respondent, he gave JH money, mobile telephones, two scooters, helmets, shoes, clothes, an Xbox 360 and games and phone credits. 

Offences Against LW

30LW met the Respondent when he was about seven or eight years old (about 2004). The Respondent lived nearby and was a close friend of LW's family. LW's father looked up to the Respondent and saw him as a father figure. BW and JW are the younger brothers of LW.

31When LW was about eight years old, he went to the Respondent's house for a swim. The Respondent touched LW on the penis on the outside of his board shorts. Before LW departed for home, the Respondent said ""Don't tell anyone what happened"". 

32Further offending conduct occurred against LW when he was at the Respondent's house with JH, including the spa pool incident referred to earlier (at [23]). After an occasion where the Respondent touched LW on the penis, the Respondent gave him $20.00 and said ""Don't tell anyone"". 

33When LW was 13 years old (in 2009-2010), he went to the Respondent's house with his cousin, JK. The Respondent provided the boys with premixed vodka cruiser drinks and cigarettes. After a time, the Respondent, LW and JK entered the spa. The Respondent told them to remove their pants and he played with LW's penis under the water.

34A questionnaire directed to LW was prepared by the Respondent which included questions of the type referred to earlier (at [26]) together with other questions. These included (AB196):

* ""Were you happy to have the weed when [xx] and [xx] had it here""?

* ""Do you relax more when your [sic] at Bobs, being spoilt lol""?

* ""Do you like the cruisers when your [sic] here""?

* ""Is there any other type of drink your [sic] would prefer me to get for you""?

* ""Does anyone at your school know anything about you/[xx]/[xx] going to Bobs""?

Offence Against JK

35JK met the Respondent through his cousin, LW, who was about the same age.

36The Respondent provided alcohol to JK and LW and touched JK's penis in the spa. The Respondent gave JK money, alcohol and cigarettes and also bought him a phone and credit for the phone.

37The Respondent provided a questionnaire to JK for completion, with part of the questionnaire requesting that the boys nominate new people who they could bring to the Respondent's house. JK stated that he listed some of his friends on the document so that the Respondent ""didn't whinge"". Tendered at the sentencing hearing (AB198) was a typed document entitled ""New guy to join us"". It was located at the Respondent's house on 5 July 2012. The document was prepared by the Respondent, and contained criteria for recruitment including the following:

* ""13 or 14 years old"".

* ""Doesn't have a girlfriend"".

* ""Slim build"".

* ""Likes cruisers or beer"".

* ""Needs some money"".

* ""Doesn't have many toys: like Xbox of PS3 or good scooter or bike"".

* ""May be from houso, living with mum, no dad or step"".

* ""Will want hav spa, drink cruisers, watch porn"".

* ""Is OK to go skinny dippin in spa"".

38The document contained other criteria of a more graphic type as well. The document concluded with space for names to be included, with provision made for an indication whether the nominated boy fitted each of the specifications listed earlier on the page.

Offences Against BW and JW

39On an occasion in 2011, when BW was aged between nine and 10 years, he went to the Respondent's house with his younger brother, JW, for a sleep over. At one point when JW left the room, the Respondent told BW to sit on his lap and placed his hand down BW's pants touching his penis and testicles.

40The next morning, the Respondent took BW and JW to a skate park and then to McDonalds for breakfast. 

41On an occasion in 2011, when JW was aged between nine and 10 years, he rode his scooter to the Respondent's house with BW to play games on the Respondent's Xbox. Whilst the Respondent showed JW some scooters on the computer, he brought JW closer to him and put his hand down the front of JW's pants and touched his penis. The Respondent removed his hand when JW told him to take his hand out. The Respondent told JW ""Don't tell anyone"". 

Arrest of Respondent in July 2012

42On 4 July 2012, the Respondent was arrested on unrelated interstate charges and was released on bail that day. 

43On 5 July 2012, police undertook a search of the Respondent's home. During the search, the photographs of JG referred to earlier (at [18]) were located, together with the memory card. 

44The questionnaires referred to earlier (at [34] and [37]) were located, together with a questionnaire of a similar type (AB197). In addition, a further handwritten questionnaire was located (AB199-200). This document (prepared by or at the direction of the Respondent) contained questions apparently posed by one or more of the victims to the Respondent, seeking his response to a number of questions relating to sexual activity and gifts. Questions on this document purportedly addressed to the Respondent included:

* ""Do you like us staying over?"".

* ""Do you like buying us gifts?"".

* ""What do you like the most?"".

* ""Do you like us smoking weed?"".

45This document added a further dimension to the manipulation of victims being undertaken by the Respondent. 

46On 15 July 2012, police attended the Respondent's premises and arrested him for failing to report in accordance with his bail undertaking. He was taken to Campbelltown Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview in relation to allegations made by JH, LW, BW and JW. During the course of the interview, he made a number of admissions, but denied being ""a paedophile"" or ""a predator"". He described the questionnaires as ""just a fun thing we did"".

47The Respondent was charged that day with offences against JH, LW, BW and JW and was refused bail. 

48Police from the Child Abuse Squad continued their investigation and were able to identify further complainants. 

49On 10 September 2012, the Respondent was charged in relation to KG, JG and JK. He did not participate in an interview concerning those victims. 

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances

50As mentioned earlier, the Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. The sentencing Judge found that his evidence was ""contradictory in places"" (ROS14). Her Honour said that his apology ""appeared sincere"" (ROS13). Her Honour doubted the accuracy of the Respondent's claim that he had only known of his attraction to children ""for about 15 years"" although she observed that this claim at least was ""qualitatively different from his earlier statement to police in which he denied being a paedophile or predator"" (ROS14). Her Honour accepted that there was some movement towards insight, although time would ""tell if his insight continues to grow"" (ROS16). In these circumstances, her Honour observed that it was ""not possible to make any finding other than that he has potential prospects [of] rehabilitation"" (ROS16).

51No other evidence was presented in his case. No psychiatric or psychological report was tendered on the plea. 

52The Respondent told the District Court that he grew up in rural Victoria and, after leaving school, became a police officer in that State, a position which he held between 1968 and 1979. After resigning from the police force, he worked in a hotel. He later took over the hotel business, which was in country Victoria. He moved from Victoria to New South Wales in 1988. 

53The Respondent stated that he had been married, but was divorced. He was working in the glass manufacturing industry in a managerial capacity at the time of the offences. 

54The Respondent acknowledged in evidence that he was a paedophile. He apologised to the victims. He said that he had not obtained psychological or other help with respect to paedophilia until he had spoken to an officer at Parklea Correctional Centre in 2013 concerning possible custodial programs which would be available to him.

55The Respondent has no prior criminal history.

Victim Impact Statements

56Victim impact statements were made by KG, JH, LW, BW and JW (AB204-208).

57Each of the victims referred to the significant disturbance he had suffered and the very considerable difficulty each continued to experience. Feelings of anger, worry, betrayal, confusion and distrust of others were expressed, together with indications of sleep disturbance and adverse effects upon schooling.

58The sentencing Judge adverted to the harm caused to the victims, in the context of a submission about the statutory aggravating factor of ""substantial harm"" in s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ROS6-7):

""Consideration is given as to whether the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage, caused was substantial such as to amount to an aggravating feature. I have read and considered each of the victim impact statements, some of which were read in court by supporters and all of which were tendered by consent and read by me. Whether a complainant has provided such a statement or not the Court is well aware of the anguish suffered by the victims of such offences over the course of the offending behaviour and the serious difficulties and psychological distress that can follow. Often the difficulties do not surface for a considerable time. In turn the distress of the child is compounded on the families who were not direct victims of the abuse but are left to attempt to support their children. Feelings of shame, lack of confidence and lack of ability to concentrate are sadly features of these children's lives as a result of the abuse suffered.

The consequence for each of the complainants, whether they have been able to provide a statement or not will be taken into account. The statements remind the Court of the consequences of this behaviour.

The offences were committed on children who were at an age where they were on the threshold of becoming adolescents or were adolescents. They are recognised to be of the most serious nature because of the long term affects of such offences can have on a developing mind. That is why such offences are considered to be of a serious nature with maximum penalties which reflect in part the consequences that frequently accompanies such behaviour.

The consequences spoken of in this case are sadly a usual and common result of this type of offending. They do not form a separate aggravating circumstance.""

Ground 1 - The Sentences for the Offences Against JH (Sequences 49 and 29) Were Manifestly Inadequate

Submissions of the Crown

59The Crown submitted that the sentences for offences committed against JH, which comprised fixed terms of imprisonment of two years and three years respectively, were manifestly inadequate. It was emphasised that the maximum penalties for these offences were imprisonment for 20 and 12 years respectively.

60The Crown submitted that these offences were representative counts, with a further offence being taken into account on a Form 1 on sentence for the s.66C(4) offence (Sequence 29). 

61The accumulation applied by the sentencing Judge was such that only 12 months' imprisonment was referable solely to the offences against JH. All of this, the Crown said, pointed to the manifest inadequacy of these sentences.

Submissions of the Respondent

62Mr Smith, counsel for the Respondent, submitted that the first ground of appeal was artificial in focusing attention upon sentences imposed with respect to a single victim, when the overall sentencing exercise was a complex one involving seven victims and multiple offences. 

63Reliance was placed upon BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 128 at [17], where it was said that a narrow focus on a sentence imposed on one of several counts may introduce an element of artificiality, given that a sentencing Judge has had regard to principles regarding concurrency, accumulation and totality in passing sentence for all offences.

64It was submitted that the individual sentences for offences against JH were not manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of the case.

Decision

65The sentencing Judge utilised fixed-term sentences for each of the sentences involving JH. It was not stated why this course was adopted, although it may be taken that it related to the fact that sentences were being passed for multiple offences. These fixed terms ought to be treated as what would otherwise have constituted the non-parole period components of sentences if the Court had set a non-parole period and balance of term for each offence: Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [56]-[58].

66As counsel for the Respondent submitted, it is true that concentration on some of a larger number of sentences in an appeal to this Court may introduce an element of artificiality. This aspect poses an additional hurdle to the first ground of appeal.

67That said, the context in which that observation was made by this Court in R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [82], and in BT v R, was somewhat different to this case. The present case involves child sex offences committed against one of seven victims. R v Thalari and BT v R were not cases where challenge was made to a sentence imposed with respect to one of a number of victims of offences committed at different times.

68The offences committed against JH were representative counts. It was not argued for the Crown that the approach adopted by Basten JA (to which I gave guarded support) in Giles v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCCA 308; 198 A Crim R 395 ought be taken in this case in approaching sentencing for representative counts. 

69The law to be applied, in those circumstances, remains that stated in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466. Applying that principle, the Court should bear in mind that the present offences were not isolated offences against JH: R v JCW at 478 [67]-[68]. 

70These were serious offences committed against a young boy in the care of the Respondent at the relevant times.

71In addition, one of the questionnaires related to JH (see [26] above). This aspect involves a particular additional insidious aspect of the Respondent's offending, in circumstances where the planned and ongoing nature of his conduct was already manifest. 

72Further, the Agreed Statement of Facts made clear that JH, on several occasions, made clear his unwillingness to participate in sexual acts with the Respondent. Of course, the question of consent was entirely irrelevant to the Respondent's criminality. However, in circumstances where the victim made quite clear to the Respondent that he did not wish this conduct to occur at all, the Respondent's ongoing offending is rendered objectively more serious.

73To make good the first ground of appeal, the Crown must demonstrate that the sentences imposed for offences against JH were unreasonable or plainly unjust. A finding of error by way of manifest inadequacy is not justified simply because the result arrived at is markedly different from other sentences imposed in other cases: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538-539 [59]. 

74It may be contended, reasonably, that longer sentences ought to have been imposed for the offences against JH. That, however, is not the test by which to measure this ground of appeal.

75In the context of a case involving a large number of offences committed against multiple victims in which questions of concurrency, accumulation and totality loom large, I am not persuaded that the first ground of appeal has been established.

76However, a further issue arises, namely whether a period of only one year's actual imprisonment solely referable to the offending conduct against JH is indicative of error. It is this issue which is at the heart of the second ground of appeal, and I turn to it now.

Ground 2 - The Overall Sentence Was Manifestly Inadequate Because of Inadequate Accumulation of Individual Sentences

Submissions of the Crown

77The Crown did not seek to challenge the individual sentences (with the exception of those with respect to JH considered under Ground 1), but submitted that the level of accumulation was too low, and the sentence failed to adequately reflect the totality of the Respondent's criminal conduct to such an extent that manifest inadequacy was demonstrated. 

78The Crown pointed to the range of offences committed against seven separate victims, the applicable maximum penalties, the Form 1 offences and the gravity of the Respondent's offending conduct in support of this ground. 

79In particular, it was submitted that the overall effect of the sentences imposed did not reflect the need to punish the Respondent for offences committed against seven victims, with a number of the sentences containing either no discrete period to be served by reference to a particular victim or inadequate accumulation. 

80Whilst acknowledging that a sentencing exercise involving multiple offences and multiple victims required the Court to undertake a discretionary exercise addressing issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality, the Crown submitted that the exercise actually undertaken in this case gave rise to a manifestly inadequate total effective non-parole period and head sentence. 

Submissions of the Respondent

81Mr Smith submitted that the sentencing Judge had addressed issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality and had reached a discretionary conclusion in that respect which did not disclose error.

82Counsel submitted that this was a difficult sentencing exercise having regard to the circumstances of the offences and the victims, and the circumstances (including the age) of the Respondent, and that the Crown had failed to demonstrate that the sentencing outcome was manifestly inadequate. 

83Reliance was placed upon the decision in R v PFC [2011] NSWCCA 117 as a decision which assisted the submission that the ground of appeal ought be rejected.

Decision

84By asserting manifest inadequacy, the Crown alleges that the result embodied in the sentencing Judge's orders was unreasonable or plainly unjust. To make good this ground, the Court must be satisfied that error occurred in the sentencing Judge's approach to accumulation, or in the outcome itself, so that this Court should conclude that the total effective sentence imposed at first instance was manifestly too short: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325 [6]. 

85In order to uphold this ground, this Court must conclude that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how that occurred is not apparent from the remarks on sentence: Hili v The Queen at 539 [59]. 

86A claim of manifest inadequacy of sentence requires consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to the fixing of sentence: Hili v The Queen at 539 [60].

87The Respondent was to be sentenced for 20 offences committed against seven different child victims in a period between 2005 and 2011. Attaching to four of these offences (involving four victims) were a further 11 offences to be taken into account by way of the Form 1 procedure, in accordance with the principles in Abbas v R [2013] NSWCCA 115.

88These were not historic child sex offences being dealt with long after the commission of the offences. The Respondent had engaged recently in the repeated serious sexual abuse of a number of young boys, demonstrating a capacity and desire to move on to new victims. The questionnaire documents prepared by him (see [37] above) displayed an intention to recruit further victims (including vulnerable ones from broken families), utilising a form of seduction and manipulation of those victims.

89Despite the fact that the Respondent was 62 years old in 2011, he had shown no sign of slowing down in his entrenched and repeated pattern of sexual offending against boys.

90The Respondent's offences involved a range of substantial maximum penalties, including offences punishable by 20 years' imprisonment (12 offences), 12 years' imprisonment (five offences) and 10 years' imprisonment (three offences). The s.61M(2) offences in the last category were accompanied by a standard non-parole period of eight years. The maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods were important legislative guideposts for the purpose of sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27]; R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [87].

91The Respondent was to be sentenced for an offence under s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 concerning child abuse material in the form of photographs he had taken of one of his victims in explicit poses in 2006. The Respondent had retained these images, giving rise to the s.91H(2) offence in 2012. Unlike many offences of possession of child abuse material, the photographs depicted one of the Respondent's own young victims whom he had abused over a number of years. This was a s.91H(2) offence of considerable objective gravity. 

92The maximum penalty for an offence under s.91H(2) was increased from five to 10 years' imprisonment, in accordance with a recommendation of the NSW Sentencing Council. In recommending this course, the NSW Sentencing Council observed that an increase in the maximum penalty for possession offences to 10 years' imprisonment would serve to emphasise the need for denunciation and general deterrence for this class of offence: R v Gavel at [92]. 

93The s.91H(2) offence raised an additional feature of the Respondent's offending behaviour against JG, which was to be reflected in the application of the principles of accumulation, concurrence and totality.

94The second ground of appeal in this case is similar to that considered by this Court in R v PFC, R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 and Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4. 

95Some observations made by Grove AJ (Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreeing) in R v Brown at [38] are pertinent to the Respondent and his criminal conduct:

""The high level of criminality in the respondent's conduct is not only obvious in the commission of very many serious offences over a very long period of time but in the circumstance, pointed to by the Crown prosecutor, that the respondent constantly found new victims. When he found them, he accompanied his behaviour with the accoutrements of the experienced sexual predator, showing his victims pornographic films and plying them on occasions with alcohol and drugs.""

96Again in R v Brown, Grove AJ said at [50]:

""The aggregate sentence imposed in the District Court significantly failed to reflect the seriousness of the respondent's multiple offences against many victims over a very long period of time. Neither did it adequately reflect the circumstances in which the crimes were committed in particular in the constant acquisition of new victims, the exposure of young people at impressionable ages to pornographic material and, from time to time, plying them with alcohol and drugs all to enable the respondent to experience forms of sexual gratification.""

97This Court has emphasised the serious harm caused to victims of child sexual assault. In R v Gavel, the Court said at [110]:

""This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the 'long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do'. The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].""

98Child victims are especially vulnerable. It is important that sentences passed for child sex offences recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Gavel at [112]. 

99There were seven victims of the present Respondent. As mentioned above, five victim impact statements were placed before the sentencing court. The fact that victim impact statements were not made by other victims did not permit a conclusion that they were anything other than significantly harmed by these offences: s.29(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

100Where there are several victims, a failure to accumulate (at least partially) may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to individual victims: R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]. This statement has particular resonance when it comes to victims of child sexual abuse. It is important that there be punishment that is referable in a real sense to each of the seven victims of the Respondent's serious and separate criminal conduct: Doyle v R; R v Doyle at [459]-[461].

101Reference was made earlier (at [58]) to the sentencing Judge's comments concerning the victims. In this extract, her Honour was addressing the question whether the harm to the victims fell within the statutory aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely ""the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence is substantial"". 

102Whilst it is important that this aspect be considered on sentence, it is necessary, as well, to keep in mind the need for the sentences imposed to reflect the harm which the law understands is done to young victims as a result of the predatory and repeated criminal conduct of persons in the position of the Respondent. This must be reflected in sentences actually imposed, which should recognise the harm done to victims of crimes of this type: R v Gavel at [104]ff.

103Although the sentencing Judge referred to these aspects, the level of accumulation does not reflect practical application of this principle in the circumstances of this case.

104The sentencing Judge explained the approach adopted with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality (ROS16-17):

""I will refer to each of the offences separately. However it is useful to look at the totality of the offending and the context of the individual charges as consideration will be given in due course to striking a balance between insuring the criminality of each offence is reflected in the sentence imposed and the principle of totality, that is reflecting the entire criminality of the course of conduct.

Many of the charges are individual offences occurring separately from other actions of the offender towards each individual victim. In such cases partial accumulation will be considered in order that the individual counts are reflected as individual acts of criminality. Where there are multiple offences against a single complainant it is appropriate to provide some accumulation and some concurrency. Most of the offences fall into that category. The offender will be entitled to a finding of special circumstances due to the accumulation of sentences with an adjustment made to the parole period ratio for the final offence to reflect a suitable portion of the total sentence. I consider that a small allowance should also be made due to his potential prospects of rehabilitation.

Due to the length of the sentence I propose there will be a substantial period of supervision after the expiry of the minimum term anyway. Clause 228 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act limits the amount of supervision to three years except in some circumstances. There ought be an incentive for Mr Gommeson to engage in therapy while in custody and if a crushing sentence is imposed no such incentive will exist. At present he is superficially motivated. For an offender who has indulged in years of offending any great insight would not be common at this stage.""

105The issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality will arise in a variety of circumstances. 

106Where there are several victims of crimes of violence (including sexual offences), it is important for the sentences actually imposed to recognise the fact that several individuals have been victimised by the offending conduct. Sometimes there may be several victims of the one course of violent conduct, such as persons robbed at the same time (three victims of robbery in a public place as in Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 253; 174 A Crim R 116 at 121 [19]) or two victims detained and terrified by an offender simultaneously (as in Jeffries v R [2008] NSWCCA 144; 185 A Crim R 500 at 512-513 [90]).

107In R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 165 A Crim R 179, an offender was sentenced for a series of domestic violence offences committed against different partners over a period of years. On a Crown appeal, with the agreement of Hunt AJA and Latham J, I said with respect to accumulation, concurrence and totality (at 203-204 [133]-[136]):

""133 I accept the Crown submission that the learned sentencing Judge's approach to accumulation and totality has led to the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences. With respect to a number of the offences, there is, in reality, virtually no penalty at all imposed upon the Respondent. Where there is a series of offences, some committed on one victim, others committed on another victim, there is a special need to ensure that concurrency of sentence does not gloss over that feature: R v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65 at paragraph 56. 

134 In R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252, the following was said, at 272 [112], concerning questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality:

'It is necessary to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. The total effective sentence must represent a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved: R v AEM Snr at para 70; R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at 184. The mechanism of making some sentences cumulative and others concurrent (or partly so) may be used where the aggregate of sentences imposed in respect of each count exceeds the appropriate total sentence: R v Myers [2002] NSWCCA 162 at para 34. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by imposing sentences which do not suggest that multiple offences will be punished in the same way as one or two offences: R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at paras 36-37.'

135 A paramount principle for the law of sentencing is that the aggregate sentence should fairly and justly reflect the total criminality of the offender's conduct. This principle applies in all cases, including those where punishment is imposed for multiple offences: R v Weldon (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at 62 [46]. I am satisfied that the sentences imposed upon the Respondent, in their overall effect, fail to reflect the totality of the Respondent's criminality.

136 I am satisfied that the sentences imposed upon the Respondent were manifestly inadequate. The sentences imposed, and in particular the total effective sentence, lay outside the proper range of sentence for offences of the objective criminality that was here involved.""

108The decision of this Court in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim 41 is referred to frequently with respect to the statement of principle concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality (at 47-48 [27]-[29]). It should be kept in mind that the offences in Cahyadi v R involved dishonesty, money laundering and passport offences, and not crimes of violence or sexual assault. There were no individual victims in that case to whom reference needed to be made. 

109This observation is not intended to dilute the statement of principle in Cahyadi v R. Rather, it is to provide a reminder that other considerations will be brought into play as well when issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality arise with respect to crimes of violence, including domestic violence (Vaovasa v R; Jeffries v R; R v Hamid) and sexual assault offences involving several victims (R v Brown; Doyle v R; R v Doyle). The observations in R v PFC at [58]-[63] should be read with these considerations in mind. 

110The sentencing Judge considered, in the context of totality, the avoidance of a sentence which would be crushing for the Respondent. Courts are not unfamiliar with descriptions of sentences as ""crushing"", but that does not articulate some applicable test: Ta'ala v R [2008] NSWCCA 132 at [42]. 

111In Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; 219 A Crim R 104 at 132 [215], with the concurrence of Tobias AJA and Hall J, I said:

""An assessment whether a particular sentence is a 'crushing sentence' must have regard to the offence or offences committed by the offender, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods relevant to those offences, and all objective and subjective factors which should be appropriately brought into account on sentence, together with principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality. As Grove J observed in Ta'ala v R at [42], 'justice is individual and each offence and each offender requires assessment'.""

112It will be noted from the description of sentences set out earlier that:

(a) one year of imprisonment only related solely to offences against JH;

(b) the sentences with respect to BW and JW were entirely concurrent;

(c) there was no period of imprisonment referable solely to JK or LW;

(d) the non-parole periods with respect to KG were entirely absorbed within the non-parole periods fixed with respect to offences against JG.

113Application of relevant principle, of course, allows for partial accumulation of sentences for offences against different victims of sexual abuse. However, this Court has stated repeatedly that it is necessary to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by the imposition of sentences which do not suggest that multiple offences will be punished in the same way as one or two offences: R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37]; R v Hamid at 204 [134]. 

114Where there are several victims, there is a special need to ensure a proper level of accumulation to guard against a view that, in reality, there is virtually no penalty at all imposed for sexual offences committed against one or more of the victims: R v Hamid at 203 [133].

115Those considerations must, of course, be balanced against the statement of principle in R v PFC at [62], that it is necessary to arrive at an ultimate aggregate sentence that does not exceed what is called for in all the circumstances.

116I am satisfied that the approach taken by the sentencing Judge led to an inadequate level of accumulation which did not pay proper and appropriate regard to the serious crimes committed against seven separate young victims. Error has been demonstrated in this case of the type established in Doyle v R; R v Doyle and R v Brown. As a result, manifest inadequacy has been demonstrated in the total effective non-parole period and the total effective head sentence.

117I would uphold the second ground of appeal.

The Residual Discretion and Resentencing

118In determining a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. This discretion may be exercised for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 24-25 [92], [95] and at 33 [150].

119It is for the Court to determine whether the residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal ought be exercised, in all the circumstances of the case, and by reference to the material placed before the Court which bears upon the exercise of this discretion.

120If error was demonstrated, an affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 3 June 2014 was read on the appeal. 

121The affidavit of the Respondent refers to his placement in the correctional system, and work which he has been undertaking since sentence was imposed in the District Court. He states that the currency of the Crown appeal has worried him and he has wondered if he may die in custody if his sentence was increased. He remains prepared to undertake a custodial sex offender program. The Respondent is on blood pressure and cholesterol medication as well as analgesics to assist with pain arising from osteoarthritis in both knees. 

122If error was demonstrated, Mr Smith submitted that this Court should decline to intervene in exercise of the residual discretion. He submitted that the effective sentence actually imposed upon the Respondent was undoubtedly a long one, and that the Court should decline to intervene having regard to the evidence before the Court on appeal.

123The Crown submitted that there was no discretionary basis for declining to intervene to resentence the Respondent and that this Court should move to resentence the Respondent in circumstances where manifestly inadequate sentences had been imposed. 

Decision

124I am satisfied that the interests of justice require the imposition of appropriate sentences for the Respondent's crimes committed against multiple victims. His offences are patently serious and there is a corresponding propriety in imposing sentences upon the Respondent that reflect this: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [109]; R v Gavel at [126]. 

125In forming this view, I have had regard to the sentences actually imposed at first instance and the evidence before the District Court, together with the additional evidence before this Court. 

126Whilst the Respondent's age and health are undoubtedly relevant to the exercise of discretion, it should be kept in mind that he committed these serious offences over a period of years up to 2011. He was an active predatory offender despite his years, and there was no sign that the offending conduct was likely to cease. But for his arrest in 2012, it may be inferred that this conduct would have continued as long as he was able to obtain access to victims, utilising the means which had worked with some success for several years. 

127I am satisfied that it is appropriate to proceed to resentence the Respondent. In this respect, it is necessary to have regard to the objective gravity of his offences and his subjective circumstances, which have been addressed in some detail earlier in this judgment. The approach to be taken with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality is that mentioned in consideration of the second ground of appeal.

128I have regard, as well, to the Respondent's absence of prior convictions, keeping in mind the limited use that can be made of evidence of this type in sentencing for this class of offence. Given that the Respondent is a paedophile who was actively committing serious offences as recently as 2011, the evidence does not permit any finding in his favour concerning his prospects of reoffending and rehabilitation. No expert evidence or other material was placed before the sentencing court or this Court bearing upon the Respondent's prospects of rehabilitation. A guarded approach is required.

129The age of the Respondent must be kept in mind, including his age at the time of possible release on parole.

130The level of accumulation to be applied will have regard to the multiple victims, whilst at the same time ensuring that the total effective sentence does not exceed that which is called for, in all the circumstances of the case, applying the totality principle.

131As the first ground of appeal has not succeeded, the sentences for offences against JH will stand. However, as the second ground of appeal ought be upheld, a significantly greater level of accumulation will be applied as between the various sentences imposed in the District Court.

132A finding of special circumstances will be made on account of the level of accumulation to be applied, and to allow for an appropriate period of conditional liberty at the conclusion of what will be a lengthy custodial sentence.

133The total effective sentence will involve a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 15 July 2012 and expiring on 14 July 2024 with a balance of term of five years commencing on 15 July 2024 and expiring on 14 July 2029. I am satisfied that an effective non-parole period of 12 years is the minimum period that the Respondent should spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in his offences, and having regard to all the principles of sentencing: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 718 [63]-[65]. 

134I propose the following orders:

(a) Crown appeal allowed;

(b) confirm the sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court upon the Respondent on 11 October 2013 with respect to the offence against JH of attempt aggravated sexual assault of a child contrary to s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 49), and the offence against JH of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child contrary to s.66C(4) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 29) (taking into account an offence of aggravated indecent assault under s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 on a Form 1 (Sequence 61));

(c) quash all other sentences of imprisonment passed on 11 October 2013 and, in their place, sentence the Respondent to the following terms of imprisonment:

(viii) for offences against KG, for each of four offences of aggravated sexual intercourse under s.66C(4) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequences 13, 16, 46 and 48), concurrent terms of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 15 July 2020 and expiring on 14 July 2024, with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 15 July 2025 and expiring on 14 October 2026;

136HARRISON J: I agree with Johnson J.

137GARLING J: I agree with Johnson J.

138THE COURT: Following the delivery of judgment by the Court in this matter on 15 August 2014, it was brought to the Court's attention that there was a misdescription of dates in sub-order (viii) of Order 3 made on that date. The order made on 15 August 2014 read (emphasis added): 

""(viii) for offences against KG, for each of four offences of aggravated sexual intercourse under s.66C(4) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequences 13, 16, 46 and 48), concurrent terms of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 15 July 2020 and expiring on 14 July 2024, with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 15 July 2025 and expiring on 14 October 2026;"" 


139As would be clear from the terms of the sentences passed, the order that should in fact have been made is (emphasis added):

(viii) for offences against KG, for each of four offences of aggravated sexual intercourse under s.66C(4) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequences 13, 16, 46 and 48), concurrent terms of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 15 July 2020 and expiring on 14 July 2024, with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 15 July 2024 and expiring on 14 October 2025;""


140The Court therefore directs that the orders made on 15 August 2014 be varied by substituting the words ""commencing on 15 July 2024 and expiring on 14 October 2025"" for the words ""commencing on 15 July 2025 and expiring on 14 October 2026"". The correction of this misdescription in no way affects the substantive issues determined in this appeal or the overall period of imprisonment which the Respondent must serve.

2764571,R v Salcedo [2014] NSWSC 1099,"Headnote (not to be read as part of the judgment)

Dakhota Salcedo has been sentenced to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years for the manslaughter of Holly Francis-Burroughs in the early hours of the morning on 7 June 2012. The jury convicted him of manslaughter having acquitted him of murder. The unusual circumstances made this one of the least culpable cases of manslaughter in the judge's experience.

Having happily spent the evening together, Ms Francis-Burroughs attempted to stop Mr Salcedo from going home. He grabbed the scarf she was wearing around her neck and pulled and twisted it for a few seconds when she suddenly fell to the ground. The cause of death was not strangulation but the blockage of the blood vessels in the neck. Although the scarf had been pulled more tightly than a tight shirt collar, not enough force was used to cause bruising or any other injury. 

Ms Francis-Burroughs was a long-term heavy drug user, mainly of amphetamines, and had been seen by a neighbour taking this drug before Mr Salcedo arrived. At the time of her death she a toxic quantity of amphetamines was found in her blood. It was highly probable that the drugs contributed to her death because of its effect on the heart and that, had not the drugs been present, she would not have died.

Whilst in custody Mr Salcedo, who was 24 years of age at the time of the offence, was examined by a psychiatrist who concluded that he was probably suffering from schizophrenia throughout 2012. This factor probably contributed to the poor judgment displayed by Mr Salcedo in twisting the scarf around Ms Francis-Burroughs' neck and leaving the scene without calling the police or ambulance.

The judge found that Mr Salcedo did not intend to cause Ms Francis-Burroughs any harm but was simply attempting to leave, although his response was unnecessarily violent and constituted an assault. His Honour also found that Mr Salcedo was remorseful for his actions. Since he had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter well before trial, the law provided that the sentence which otherwise should have been imposed was to be reduced by 15%.

Judgment

Introduction

1Dakohta Salcedo was indicted on the charge of murdering Holly Francis-Burroughs on 7 June 2012. On 8 May 2014 he was acquitted of that offence and, instead, convicted of Ms Francis-Burroughs' manslaughter, to which his earlier plea of guilty had been rejected by the Crown. There was no dispute that Mr Salcedo had caused Ms Francis-Burroughs' death. The real question for the jury was whether it was satisfied that he had acted with the intention of causing her death or grievous bodily harm. In light of the evidence as a whole and the medical evidence in particular, the ultimate verdict was inevitable. It is for me, as the judge, to determine the relevant facts for the purpose of sentence but only as consistent with the verdict of the jury. 

2The maximum sentence for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment, reserved of course for the worst cases. There is no dispute that this case is very far from the worst. Mr Salcedo offered to plead guilty to manslaughter on 7 April 2014, three weeks before the trial was due to commence, but this was rejected by the Crown. In these circumstances it is appropriate to discount the sentence which otherwise would be imposed by 15 per cent. The offender was arrested on 6 March 2013 and has been in custody since that date. At that date he was serving a sentence of imprisonment expiring on 16 August 2013, the non-parole period of which expired on 16 March 2013. It is agreed that it is appropriate to commence the present sentence on 17 March 2013. 

The elements of the offence

3Of the available bases for bringing in a verdict of manslaughter, the only one which fits the evidence is that Ms Francis-Burroughs died as a result of the offender's unlawful and dangerous act. The unlawful act was an assault which was dangerous in the sense that a reasonable person in the position of the Mr Salcedo at the time would have realised that what he did exposed the victim to a risk of serious injury. By ""serious injury"", I do not mean grievous bodily harm, let alone life-threatening. It is important also to note that it does not matter whether Mr Salcedo actually realised that what he did might cause serious injury but, rather, whether an ordinary member of the community in his position would have realised or appreciated that it might have done so. By his plea of guilty, Mr Salcedo admitted, inter alia, that he had used more force than was reasonably necessary to escape Ms Francis-Burroughs's attempt to restrain him and, inferentially, that he was guilty of common assault. Although it was not bound to do so, the jury plainly accepted this admission as proof of the unlawful act which was necessary to establish the offence of manslaughter.

4If the offender intended to cause serious injury the crime is obviously more serious that if the death was caused unexpectedly, though by an act which a reasonable person would have realized risked serious injury. In this case, as will become clear, Ms Francis-Burroughs' death was not only unexpected but, I think, would not have been expected by any reasonable person. Nor would reasonable people have thought that grievous (as distinct from serious) harm might have been caused by what Mr Salcedo did. After carefully reviewing the evidence, I am satisfied that he had no intention of causing Ms Francis-Burroughs any serious injury or thought that what he did might do so. 

Objective circumstances 

5Mr Salcedo and Ms Francis-Burroughs had been going out together for some months. They were not living together but occasionally spent the night in Ms Francis-Burroughs' unit. The evidence discloses that that their relationship appeared to be on the whole a happy one. More particularly there is no suggestion that, on the evening of her death, they had argued or that anything untoward had occurred between them. Far from it. Ms Francis-Burroughs told a neighbour with whom she was in the habit of confiding personal details of her life, that earlier in the evening around 7pm or so, she and the offender had sex, about which she was obviously pleased. 

6When the two first met that day is not clear but does not presently matter. It can be accepted that they were together from sometime before 7pm on 6 June 2012 until shortly after 3am on 7 June 2012. At some time, perhaps around 10pm, the power to the premises was cut (due to storm damage), and was rendered safe about 11.30pm but not repaired until the following day. It appears likely that Mr Salcedo left the unit sometime after 3.35am and before 6am. (The first of these of these times is taken from the last SMS message sent from the victim's phone and the latter from the time when the offender arrived at his home.) Be that as it may, at about 8.30am or so on the morning of 7 June 2012, a neighbour went to the victim's unit as had been previously arranged. The backdoor was unlocked so, after knocking, he entered and saw Ms Francis-Burroughs lying on her bed, fully clothed. She was dead. The police were called and arrived at 9.40am. Dr Matthew Orde, then a forensic pathologist working at the Department of Forensic Medicine at Glebe was called to the scene and arrived at about 2.30pm. He described the victim as fully clothed, lying on her back on the bed with her legs crossed. There was a scarf around her neck. 

7It is not necessary for present purposes to set out all the details of the post-mortem examination but some are important, since they cast light on what happened and how Ms Francis-Burroughs came to die. In substance, the cause of death was the compression of the vessels supplying blood to the brain resulting from the scarf being pulled with moderate force around her neck. This was not strangulation or choking. The doctor described the force as ""perhaps moderate ... more than [that of] a tight collar like I am wearing today. This would have been firm force applied around the neck"". There were associated signs that ""would have taken several, possibly many seconds, possibly a couple of minutes or more to develop... [so that] death was likely to have occurred ... not less than at least several seconds [after force was applied]"". Elsewhere in his evidence he described the death as having occurred ""fairly quickly in around or at the same time as the compression of the neck was taking place"". Although Dr Orde had earlier used the term ""like light compression"" he explained it was difficult to know with certainty how much force would have been required but it was a ""quite significant substantial force"". However, the force was not sufficient to cause any bruising or injury. The marks around the victim's neck were caused by the scarf preventing blood flow. There were no other injuries that might have suggested violence.

8Of considerable importance so far as the cause of death is concerned is the tragic fact that Ms Francis-Burroughs had been addicted to illicit drugs for some years. Toxicology testing showed the presence of amphetamine, methylamphetamine, cannabis derived compounds, diazepam and other diazepam related chemicals in her blood at the time of death. Of these, the amphetamine was the most significant because of its toxic stimulant effects. The toxicologist, Dr Allender said that the quantity that he found in the deceased was the highest he had seen in his experience (which went back to 1978) and was certainly at a toxic level. Even allowing for what must have been a substantial level of tolerance, it was nevertheless reasonably possible that, at the levels he found, the amphetamine might have had a significant contribution to the deceased's death. Dr Orde, for his part, added that it was highly probable the drugs which the deceased had ingested would have rendered her more susceptible to succumbing to the compression of her neck because they predispose the heart to go into an unstable rhythm, which was a contributing factor to her death. 

9The medical expert opinion justifies the conclusion, to a high level of probability, that the substantial quantity of drugs ingested by Ms Francis-Burroughs contributed significantly to her death by increasing her vulnerability if there were an interruption to the blood supply to her brain, so that she died much more quickly than otherwise would have been expected, even perhaps only several seconds after compression occurred. 

10The medical evidence provides significant corroboration for Mr Salcedo's description to his mother of what happened. She said - 

""I remember asking Dakohta directly, 'Did you do it?' I was meaning, 'Did you hurt Holly?' Dakohta looked at me and he was very quiet when he spoke back to me, 'Yeah. I didn't mean to do it, it was an accident.' I distinctly remember him saying this to me. He was really quiet. I said, 'Well, how did it happen? What happened?' He said, 'I got up to leave. I was going to come home. I went over to the door. She tried to stop me.' I think I might have said, 'Did you argue?' He said, 'I grabbed her by the scarf. I pulled it and turned it.' I said, 'Oh. What happened next?' He said, 'She just dropped'. I said, 'You must have cut off her airways'. He said, 'I didn't mean it, it was an accident. I didn't mean for her to die.' I said, 'Well, the detective said she was on the bed or someone said she was on the bed'. He didn't say anything about this.""

11Mr Salcedo had given other accounts of what occurred that night which omitted any mention of his use of the scarf and suggested that the victim had simply died from a drug overdose whilst he was asleep in the room. I am satisfied that, as far as it goes, what he ultimately told his mother was the truth, as I said, because it is substantially in accordance with the medical evidence. 

12On 12 June 2012, Mr Salcedo was interviewed by police. He told them he and Ms Francis-Burroughs stayed together overnight from time to time and was with her the evening in question, timing it, however, from about 8.30pm. He denied ever having sex with Ms Francis-Burroughs, I assume because this embarrassed him, since it is clear that there was nothing untoward about this event. He told police he had been lying on the bed and fell asleep, waking at about 3 am to find Ms Francis-Burroughs lying on the floor. I think it very likely that Ms Francis-Burroughs had indeed fallen to the floor when she collapsed and that he picked her up and put her on the bed. He denied seeing her use the phone that night, which is possible but unlikely. He put his hand under her nostrils to see whether she was breathing but felt no air being inhaled or exhaled and said he was certain that she was dead when he left the unit and there was no point in getting help. He said she had taken drugs after she had returned to the unit, which might well have been so but she had been seen by a neighbour taking amphetamine at an earlier stage that evening. Mr Salcedo said that he had left the unit at around 3am, arriving home at 3.20am and that his mother was mistaken in saying that he arrived closer to 6am. I am not in a position to resolve this contradiction. However, particularly in light of the medical evidence, I am satisfied that there would have been no point in calling ""000"".

13As later mentioned, Mr Salcedo told Dr Furst, amongst other things, that Ms Francis-Burroughs had stood in the doorway to stop him from leaving and he had grabbed her by the scarf to stop her from screaming and making an embarrassing scene, which she had done before. (This was supported by the evidence of a witness who saw such an incident in the street a few weeks previously.)

14Accordingly, although it is not possible to resolve all uncertainty, not least because the offender lied to police in his initial accounts of what occurred, I am satisfied that the following brief description is in all likelihood what happened and provides an appropriate factual basis for the purpose of sentence. Mr Salcedo and Ms Francis-Burroughs were happy together, particularly on the night of her death. He had come to the unit some time before 7pm and the couple had made love. After going to a nearby hotel for some drinks and shopping together at a nearby supermarket, they returned to the hotel and then to the unit at around 10pm where they remained together until the offender left, alone, some time after 3.35am and before 6am. There was no motive for Mr Salcedo to commit any real violence and no evidence of any fight. Ms Francis-Burroughs had ingested drugs, certainly amphetamine and probably others. Mr Salcedo had probably taken some drugs also but there is no evidence that he was intoxicated or even significantly affected. Some time shortly before 2am Ms Francis-Burroughs sent a text message to Mr Salcedo's brother trying to obtain other drugs, probably marijuana. Mr Salcedo also probably made calls to and received calls from his brother, possibly trying to obtain drugs but this is speculative. At 3.30am, 3.33am and 3.35am text messages were sent to the Mr Salcedo's brother from the telephone being used by Ms Francis-Burroughs. Whether these messages were actually made by her is unknown but it seems likely that they were. Some time after these messages, to which there was no response, Mr Salcedo got up to leave to go home. When he went over to the door, Ms Francis-Burroughs tried to stop him from leaving by standing in the doorway. He grabbed her by the scarf she was wearing and pulled and turned it with some force but not sufficient to cause any bruising. After several seconds she unexpectedly fell to the ground. Mr Salcedo lifted her onto the bed and checked her breathing, to discover she was dead. He may have stayed in the unit for some little time or, perhaps, walked around before eventually arriving home. 

15I am satisfied that the offender did not himself appreciate the risk of serious injury to which his acts exposed the deceased and that he was simply responding to her attempt to prevent him from leaving. Consistently with the verdict, his response was unnecessarily violent and constituted an assault but I am satisfied that he did not intend to cause her any harm. Certainly what he did was a substantial contributing factor in causing Ms Francis-Burroughs's death, but I am satisfied that it would not have occurred - indeed, nor would any serious injury - had Ms Francis-Burroughs not been so greatly affected by drugs. Accordingly, so far as objective seriousness is concerned, this case should be regarded as well within the lowest range of culpability for offences of manslaughter. Indeed, it is one of the least culpable cases of manslaughter in my experience on the Bench.

Criminal record

16The offender was something over 24 years old at the time of the offence. He had previously been convicted of a number of offences, the first of which occurred in June 2008, when he was 20 years of age and involved the theft of a motor vehicle, possession of a prohibited drug, common assault and intimidation. There followed other offences involving car theft and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty. His first sentence of imprisonment was imposed in August 2009 of 9 months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and concurrently 12 months for stealing from the person and four months later he was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment for the offence of common assault. In August 2008 he was fined for possessing a prohibited drug and placed on a bond for contravening a domestic apprehended violence order, which, however, does not appear to have been associated with any violence. In July 2009 he was convicted of two aggravated break and enter offences for which he was released on parole in April 2010. In January 2011 he was sentenced to a term of 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months for common assault and, in December 2011 of theft and intimidation in respect of which he was given a 10 months suspended sentence for which he was ultimately called up on 17 October 2012 and sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months with a non-parole period of 5 months concluding 16 March 2013. His last offence before the commission of the present offence was committed on 21 April 2012 for which he was sentenced on 17 October 2012 to 3 months imprisonment expiring on 16 January 2013. This record of offences involving violence, although low level, is persistent (and is perhaps partly attributable to Mr Salcedo's psychiatric problems to which I refer below) and requires a greater than usual degree of emphasis to the need for personal, as distinct from general, deterrence. 

Psychiatric issues

17The offender was examined by a very experienced consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, who assessed him first in February 2014 and, following his conviction, in May 2014. At the outset of his report Dr Furst noted that it appeared that all the offender's family members on his mother's side had suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, requiring most of them to have been hospitalised at some time or another. Indeed, his mother was unable to give evidence because she was, at the time the trial, an involuntary patient in a psychiatric unit of a Sydney Hospital. 

18Dr Furst, as is customary, took a history from Mr Salcedo which is not suggested to be unreliable. He grew up in a Sydney suburb and attended school until year 10, being an average student with no indications of a learning disorder or ADHD. There was some domestic violence in his childhood with his father being violent towards his mother. His two older sisters were placed in the care of DOCS. He had problems with substance abuse as a teenager and saw a psychiatrist on a couple of occasions in 2010 although he had never been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. However, when he was incarcerated during 2011 he experienced some psychotic episodes for which he was medicated. His medication ceased when he was released in December 2011. He relapsed into using cannabis and ice although he was on parole. He told Dr Furst that, at the time of the offence, he was living in a community house in North Ryde run by the Salvation Army, but it appears he was also living at home episodically. He was doing some community work. Although he was decreasing his drug use, it continued. 

19As to the offence, Mr Salcedo told Dr Furst that, when he said he was going home, the deceased replied, ""What? Stop, you're going to ditch me?"" and stood in front of the door. He said that he grabbed her scarf and pulled on it and twisted it as he did not want her to follow him down the street and yell at him as she had previously done. The offender told Dr Furst that he had called his brother after this event who had advised him to call an ambulance but he said that he was too scared to do so because he thought ""they would think that I killed her"". However, the telephone records tendered in the trial show calls between the offender and his brother at 2.15am, 2.18am and 2.23am with a somewhat longer conversation at 2.28am, followed by a number of unresponsive calls and SMS messages. If the offender's account about this is reliable, which is somewhat doubtful, the text messages after 3.30am from the deceased's phone must have been made by him. However this may be, this version of events is consistent with what he told his mother. Mr Salcedo said he had shared one joint of cannabis with the deceased during the night and also took two dexamphetamine tablets. 

20The offender told Dr Furst that he had smoked cannabis from the age of 15 which became a regularly daily habit. He stopped using cannabis when arrested at the age of 19 years but lapsed again when released in December 2011, continuing to use cannabis until his arrest in October 2012. He had also used ice, as I understand it smoking it once a week and taking benzodiazepine also perhaps once a week. 

21Mr Salcedo's mental state examination when seen by Dr Furst was unremarkable although, whilst in prison, he had from time to time exhibited psychotic symptoms at first suggestive of schizophrenia and, subsequently, leading to a diagnosis of partially treated schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In summary, he has a history of psychotic symptoms including paranoid thinking, auditory hallucinations, mood disturbance and apparent self-referential thinking. He presented at the assessment with Dr Furst in February 2014 with features of restricted affect and some residual paranoid thinking. His Justice Health files disclosed multiple psychiatric assessments, three admissions to the Long Bay Mental Health Unit between 2009 and 2013 and a history of treatment with anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medication over recent years consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He also has co-morbid substance abuse issues and probably has a personality disorder. Dr Furst found it difficult to form any firm conclusions about his mental state at the time of the offence which was complicated by the effects of substance abuse at the time. However, Dr Furst concluded that (though it is possible he was exaggerating some symptoms and underreporting or minimising others, as he lacked insight) Mr Salcedo was probably suffering from a serious mental illness in the form of schizophrenia throughout 2012,. 

22Of present particular significance, Dr Furst thought that the presence of schizophrenia and its associated symptoms were relevant factors that probably contributed to the poor judgment the offender displayed in twisting the scarf around the deceased's neck and leaving her at the scene without calling police or ambulance. He noted that people with schizophrenia often struggle to think clearly and solve problems, either due to symptoms of psychosis or residual cognitive deficits. 

23Dr Furst noted that Mr Salcedo appeared to have poor insight into the nature of his mental problem and the need for medication and recommended that the offender should remain under the care of a psychiatrist and the mental health nurses working for Justice Health and continue his anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medication. He thought that he was good candidate for a custody based drug and alcohol rehabilitation programme and probably for a psychological treatment program, to address his history of violence. He thought the offender's risk of re-offending would be reduced if he abstained from illicit drugs and engaged in the psychological treatment programs available within the prison system and adhered to the counselling recommendations that might be made. 

Victim Impact Statements

24Victim impact statements were produced to the Court from Ms Francis-Burroughs' godmother, guardian and aunt (also a guardian). They speak eloquently of their love for Holly and their great grief and that of all her family over her tragic death. Nothing the Court can do can assuage their pain. I have dealt with these statements as required by law.

Discussion

25Although the Crown prosecutor submitted to the contrary, there is no proper basis in my view to disregard the opinion of Dr Furst about the effect of the offender's mental illness on Mr Salcedo's judgment at the time of the offence. In my view, this reduces his moral culpability and also, in line with decisions of this Court on the question, also significantly moderates the importance of general deterrence. However, this condition warrants a greater emphasis on the need for personal deterrence, especially in light of his criminal history. The sentence which I impose reflects my view of the importance of this aspect.

26The offender expressed remorse both to his mother when he confessed what he had done and also to Dr Furst. His plea of guilty to manslaughter is also consistent with this attitude. I accept he is remorseful. Given his history of violence, although relatively minor, and the circumstances of this case, where it had catastrophic consequences as well as his psychiatric condition, his prospects for non-offending are guarded but there are grounds for optimism in his now being able to access focused assistance in a structured environment. 

27The offence was impulsive, he was responding, though inappropriately, to Ms Francis-Burroughs' attempt to stop him from leaving, the level of violence was not objectively severe, although the consequences were appalling and, as the jury in effect found, a reasonable person in the offender's position would have realised that he was exposing the deceased to serious injury. 

28As I have already noted, in December 2011 the offender received suspended sentences in the Local Court. The current offence was therefore a breach of the condition of the suspension. He was called up for this breach and returned to custody because of it. It is necessary to avoid any double punishment but this breach has some significance when considering the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. I also note that Mr Salcedo was on bail at the time of the offence for damaging property. 

29When he is released, Mr Salcedo will have a continuing and long term need for supervision to persevere with his rehabilitation. This need is a special circumstance that justifies a variation of the non-parole period from that which would result from the application of the ratio stipulated in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

Conclusion 

30After making an allowance in the order of 15 percent for his plea, Mr Salcedo is sentenced to a total term of four years imprisonment commencing on 17 March 2013 comprising a non-parole period of two years ending on 16 March 2015 and a balance of term of two years commencing on 17 March 2015 and ending on 16 March 2017.

		15 August 2014",2014-08-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764573,Potier v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 157,"Judgment
1There is on foot an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal consequent upon the conviction by a jury in October 2006 of Mr Potier for an offence of soliciting to murder contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900.
2The appeal has been fixed for hearing before the Court of Criminal Appeal on 10 November 2014.  
3In the course of the case management of that appeal by me, Mr Potier has applied to the Court for it to issue a criminal justice stay warrant.  
4For the reasons that follow, I refuse to issue such a warrant.
Relevant Facts
5Mr Potier is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed by Shadbolt DCJ on 13 November 2006 for a period of 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.  This sentence commenced on 7 August 2006, and will conclude on 5 August 2018.
6In 2013, the State Parole Authority initially considered the question of whether Mr Potier ought to be granted parole.  It determined at that time that he was not suitable for parole.  Mr Potier sought a review of that determination.  On 19 July 2013, that application for review was dismissed.  As a consequence, the question of parole was not able to be further determined for at least 12 months. 
7The State Parole Authority has scheduled a further hearing for 13 August 2014, on the question of whether or not Mr Potier ought be granted parole.  I am unaware of the outcome of that scheduled hearing.
8Mr Potier is not an Australian citizen.  He is presently in Australia on a limited visa that, so far as he tells the Court, merely permits his temporary presence in Australia for the purpose of serving the custodial component of his sentence of imprisonment.  The precise visa and its conditions, if any, have not been provided to the Court.
9Mr Potier submits that the probabilities are, that if he is released on parole, he will be initially detained by Commonwealth migration authorities and then deported to the United Kingdom because his visa would no longer be current, and he would be in Australia unlawfully.  
10If deported to the United Kingdom, Mr Potier fears that he would not be permitted by the Commonwealth immigration authorities to return to Australia for the purpose of the conduct of his appeal in this Court.  
11Mr Potier appears for himself in the conduct of the appeal, and he fears that if he is not permitted to return to Australia, he will be unable to prosecute his appeal, it will lapse and he will not have an opportunity to rectify what he asserts is an erroneous conviction and one which constitutes a miscarriage of justice.
Relevant Legislation
12A criminal justice stay warrant is dealt with in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (""the Act"").  The control of arrival in Australia and presence of non-citizens in Australia for the purposes of the criminal justice system is dealt with in Div 4 of Pt 2 of that Act.  The purpose of the Division is to permit the presence in Australia of a non-citizen for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice.  Mr Potier is a non-citizen within the meaning of the Act.
13Section 148 of the Act permits an authorised official for a State, which means the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions (or an official holding a like office) and the highest ranking member of the police force of that State, to give a certificate that the stay of a non-citizen's removal or deportation is required for the administration of criminal justice by the State.  Although there is a similar provision with respect to Commonwealth officials and Commonwealth offences, that is irrelevant in this case because Mr Potier was convicted of a State offence.
14The prerequisite conditions for the issue of such a stay certificate are dealt with in s 148 of the Act.  If a stay certificate is issued, and so long as it is in force, s 150 of the Act prohibits the removal or deportation of the non-citizen.  
15The terms of s 151 of the Act are of importance to Mr Potier's application.  The section is in these terms:
""151 Certain warrants stay removal or deportation
(1) If an unlawful non-citizen is to be, or is likely to be, removed or deported, this Act does not prevent a court issuing for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law a warrant to stay the removal or deportation.
(2) If a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen is in force, the non-citizen is not to be removed or deported.
(3) If a court issues a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen, the applicant for the warrant is responsible for the costs of any maintenance or accommodation (other than immigration detention) of the non-citizen while the warrant is in force.""
16Section 153 of the Act is also of importance.  It is in the following terms:
""153 Removal or deportation not contempt etc. if no stay certificate or warrant
(1) Subject to subsection (2), if:
(a) this Act requires the removal or deportation of a non-citizen; and
(b) there is no criminal justice stay certificate or criminal justice stay warrant about the non-citizen;
any other law, or anything done under any other law, of the Commonwealth or a State (whether passed or made before or after the commencement of this section), not being an Act passed after that commencement expressed to be exempt from this section, does not prevent the removal or deportation.
(2) Subsection (1) does not permit the removal or deportation of a non-citizen if that removal or deportation would be in breach of an order of the High Court, the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court.""
17Subdivision D of Div 4 deals with criminal justice visas.  Those sections make it plain that one of the criteria for a criminal justice stay visa for a non-citizen is that a criminal justice stay warrant in respect of that non-citizen is in force.
18Section 159 of the Act provides that the Minister may ""... in his or her absolute discretion ..."" grant a criminal justice visa if satisfied that the criteria for it have been met.  A criminal justice visa provides permission for the non-citizen to travel to, and, enter and remain in Australia while it is in effect.  If that non-citizen is in immigration detention, such a visa entitles the non-citizen to be released from that detention.  A criminal justice visa does not prevent the non-citizen leaving Australia: see s 161 of the Act.
19Section 163 of the Act provides that a stay warrant may be cancelled.  It is in the following terms:
""163 Stay warrant to be cancelled
(1) If:
(a) the presence in Australia of a non-citizen in respect of whom a criminal justice stay warrant has been given is no longer required for the purposes for which it was given; and
(b) if the warrant is to expire at a certain time - that time has not been reached;
a person entitled to apply for the warrant's cancellation must apply to the court for the cancellation ...""
20Section 164 of the Act provides that if a criminal justice stay warrant is cancelled or expires, any criminal justice visa granted because of the warrant is cancelled.
Applicable Legal Principles
21Nathan J, when dealing with a similar application made to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1995, held that it was not open to a person in the position of Mr Potier, namely the non-citizen, to apply for the issue of a criminal justice stay warrant.  He said:
""In the State jurisdiction, if an unlawful citizen is to be or is likely to be removed, an authorised official, in this instance, the Director of Public Prosecutions, may give a certificate.  Under s 149 a criminal justice stay certificate may be given even though an application for a visa has been made but not finalised.  Section 150 in effect stays removal if a certificate has been issued.  It can be seen that the certification which stays the deportation is a certification by the Attorney or an authorised official.  The warrant, which is the instrument affecting the stay, can have no greater power than the person entitled to obtain it, and, again, the words of s 151 reflect the format of the preceding sections in the subdivision.  If an unlawful citizen is likely to be removed, the Act does not prevent a court issuing, for the purposes of the administration of justice, a warrant to stay the removal ...""
See Application by Solomon Barudea [1995] VSC 55 at [24].
22In 2002, French J (as he then was), considered the provisions of the Act which are relevant here in Goldie v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 261.  At [36], he said:
""36. The provisions are enacted in the public interest in the administration of criminal justice.  They are, on the face of it, not intended to create any rights or privileges on the part of the unlawful non-citizen.""
23In 2008, Lindgren J considered whether he ought grant a criminal justice stay warrant in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1023.  
24Application was made to the Federal Court of Australia by Mr Lee for an order that a warrant be issued staying his removal from Australia, pending the hearing of an appeal to the District Court of New South Wales in the course of a prosecution brought in the Local Court of New South Wales against him.  Mr Lee was an unlawful non-citizen who was to be, or was likely to be, removed or deported from Australia, unless a stay warrant was issued.  
25At [5], his Honour held that the provisions of s 151(1) of the Act did not confer a power upon the Federal Court to issue a criminal justice stay warrant.  As well, his Honour held that Mr Lee was not a person who was entitled to apply for a criminal justice stay warrant.  His Honour said:
""16 I return now to the terms of s 151.  The reference to a 'court' in that section has an ambulatory operation and refers to any court otherwise seized of power to issue a warrant to stay a removal or deportation for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in the particular jurisdiction, Commonwealth or State as the case may be.
17 The picture that emerges from the above provisions is that they are concerned with investigation, enforcement and punishment within the criminal justice system of the Commonwealth or of a State respectively.  Although I was not directed to any other provision of Commonwealth or State legislation, it seems reasonable to expect that it will be a court invested with jurisdiction in respect of Commonwealth or State investigation, prosecution or punishment that will have power to issue a criminal justice stay warrant in relation to it - in the present case a court of the State of New South Wales.
18 There are at least two other considerations suggesting that s 151 does not give this Court the power to issue a criminal justice warrant on the present application.  The first is found in definitions contained in s 142.  A 'criminal justice entry certificate' is a certificate 'given under' one or other of various specified sections, and a 'criminal justice stay certificate' is a certificate 'given under' ss 147 or 148.  In contrast a 'criminal justice stay warrant' is simply a warrant 'described in' s 151.  That is to say, the words 'given under' are absent in the latter case.  The reason is that a criminal justice stay warrant is not 'given under' s 151.""
26His Honour went on to consider the effect of the statute in the context of its legislative history.  At [20], his Honour said:
""20 In the explanatory memorandum for the Migration Reform Bill 1992, para 182 stated of the then proposed s 54G (see now s 151) that the purpose of the section was to ensure that the powers created by Div 3 (see now Div 4) did not interfere with the power of a court to issue a warrant requiring that a non-citizen not be removed or deported.  That paragraph of the explanatory memorandum also stated:
'The section [s 54G] also makes it clear that the applicant to the court for the warrant (ie the relevant law enforcement agency) is responsible for any accommodation, maintenance, or migration detention costs associated with requiring that non-citizen to remain in Australia. [my emphasis]'
This statement is consistent with my statement earlier that the perspective that permeates Div 4 is that of the administrators of the criminal justice system.  In sum, the applicant does not have standing to apply for a criminal justice stay warrant under s 151.""
Lindgren J declined to grant the relief sought.
27In 2009, the Full Court of the Federal Court considered the relevant provisions of the Act, to which I have drawn attention, in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Zhang [2009] FCAFC 129.  The Full Court held that the entire focus and object of Div 4 of the Act is to 
""... facilitate the administration of criminal justice by securing the temporary presence in Australia of persons who would not otherwise be permitted to enter or remain in Australia.""
28The Court expressed the view that the provisions of Div 4 were enacted in the public interest in the administration of criminal justice, and were not intended on their face to create any rights or privileges on the part of the unlawful non-citizen.  Their Honours also noted that there was no specific provision in the legislation for a person whose presence is required in Australia to apply for the grant of a criminal justice certificate.  
29Their Honours referred to the decision of Lindgren J in Lee, and the earlier decision of French J in Goldie and said:
""102. Lindgren J also observed at [9] that the references to investigation, prosecution and punishment in the definition of the 'administration of criminal justice' in s 142 make it clear that the relevant perspective is that of the administrators of the criminal justice system.
103. It follows from Lindgren J's remarks that the relevant perspective for the exercise of the power to issue or cancel a criminal justice certificate is that of the administrators of the system, not that of the person whose interests may in a broad sense be thought to be affected by the decision: see Lindgren J at [9] and [20].
104. In our view, the observations of French J in Goldie and Lindgren J in Lee are plainly correct and we adopt them.  In Lindgren J's words at [20], the perspective that permeates Div 4 is that of the administrators of the criminal justice system.'
Discernment
30The decisions to which I have made reference offer an analysis of the statutory provisions, which I find compelling and with which I agree.  
31In particular, I agree that the provisions upon which Mr Potier relies are not intended to, and do not, create any rights or privileges for an individual non-citizen.  This means that here, Mr Potier does not have any standing to make an application for a criminal justice stay warrant.  
32He is in no different position to Mr Lee with respect to whom Lindgren J made a similar finding.  
33I am also of the view, as Lindgren J said in Lee at [5]-[6], that the proper interpretation of this legislation means that s 151 does not on its terms give the Court a power to grant a warrant, but rather assumes the existence of courts that are otherwise invested with the power to issue criminal justice warrants.  The Act has no provision that specifically invests this Court with the power to issue a warrant.  
34It is a nice question as to whether s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 is a sufficient jurisdictional base for the existence of a power in this Court to issue the warrant.  It is unnecessary for me to decide that question, and it is appropriate that it be reserved to an occasion when the Court has the benefit of considered submissions on the issue.  
35I am prepared to proceed upon the assumption that this Court has the power to issue a criminal justice stay warrant.  On that assumption, I would not be prepared to exercise my discretion so to do.  That is because the material before me does not persuade me of two essential matters.  
36First, that there is any real or imminent risk of deportation of Mr Potier or, that if deported, that he would not be permitted to return to Australia for the conduct of his appeal.  All I am informed of is that there is a hearing of the State Parole Authority on 13 August 2014.  I have no knowledge of the material being put before the Authority, nor its attitude.  Even if a decision were to be made about granting parole to Mr Potier, the administrative process would take some time to complete.  Secondly, another matter upon which evidence would be necessary, and none is provided, is the identification of who would be responsible to pay for the expenses for Mr Potier's stay in Australia until his appeal is heard, and how that responsibility would be secured and discharged.  Section 151(3) requires attention to be given to those questions.
37However, it is sufficient for the purpose of finally determining this application that I am satisfied that the applicant, Mr Potier, does not have the standing to seek the warrant.  The purpose of Div 4 of Pt 2 of the Act is fulfilled when an application is made to the Court for a stay warrant by a person appropriately representing the public interest in the administration of justice.  No such application has been made.  
38Accordingly, I decline to issue the criminal justice stay warrant as the applicant, Mr Potier, seeks.
Vexatious Litigant
39I note that on 25 February 2014, McCallum J made an order prohibiting Mr Potier from instituting proceedings in New South Wales ""... except in the appeal proceedings instituted by him in the Court of Criminal Appeal, being proceedings numbered 2005/14700"" and staying any proceedings instituted by him except that appeal and any interlocutory proceedings in that appeal.
40In her judgment, Attorney-General in and for the State of NSW v Potier [2014] NSWSC 118, McCallum J said at [220]:
""220. I do not know what other kind of interlocutory proceedings in connection with or incidental to his appeal against conviction might be pursued by Mr Potier. I am not persuaded that it is appropriate to prohibit the institution of any such proceedings by the mechanism of a vexatious proceedings order. Any interlocutory proceedings in connection with his appeal against conviction, which is currently pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal, should more properly be managed by that Court, rather than seeing the appeal process truncated and probably delayed by the interposition of a requirement to obtain leave under the Vexatious Proceedings Act from a judge of the Court sitting in this Division.""
41I have taken the view that the application made by Mr Potier was a kind of interlocutory proceedings in connection with or incidental to his appeal, and accordingly excluded from the order made by McCallum J under the Vexatious Proceedings Act.  
42Whether any further application made by Mr Potier would properly fall within that description must necessarily depend upon the nature and content of the application.  
Orders
43I make the following order:
(1)Application for the Court to issue a criminal justice stay warrant pursuant to s 151 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) is dismissed.

2764574,TU v R [2014] NSWCCA 155,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
2BEECH-JONES J:   This is an application for leave to appeal from sentences imposed by the District Court on the applicant for sexually assaulting his daughter.  At the outset it should be noted that s 578A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) precludes the publication of any matter which identifies or is likely to lead to the identification of the victim.  To avoid the identity of the victim being ascertainable, the electronically available versions of this judgment will refer to the applicant as ""TU"".
3On 25 October 2013 the applicant was convicted of one offence of having sexual intercourse between 1 September 2005 and 11 March 2007 with a person under the age of ten years, contrary to s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the ""first offence""). He was also convicted of an offence of having sexual intercourse between 1 December 2012 and 25 December 2012 with a person under the age of ten years in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the victim was under his authority, contrary to s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the ""second offence"").  The maximum penalty for these offences was 25 years imprisonment and imprisonment for life respectively.  For both offences a standard non-parole period of fifteen years has been prescribed (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the ""Sentencing Act"", ss 54A to 54D).
4Associated with the second offence were two additional charges which were dealt with in accordance with the procedure specified in Division 3 of Part 3 of the Sentencing Act (ie a ""Form 1"").  They consisted of another charge under s 66A(2), and a charge of committing an act of indecency towards a person under the age of sixteen years contrary to s 61N(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for the latter offence was two years imprisonment.  Each of the Form 1 charges arose out of the same incident as the second offence.
5For the first offence the applicant was sentenced to two years imprisonment commencing 25 October 2013 and expiring 24 October 2015 with a non-parole period of sixteen months.  For the second offence the applicant was sentenced to eight years imprisonment commencing 25 October 2014 expiring 24 October 2022 with a non-parole period of five years.  The combined effect of the sentences was that the applicant is to serve a non-parole period of six years commencing 25 October 2013 and expiring 24 October 2019, with an additional term of three years.
The offences
6The victim was born in 2004. She was two years old at the time of the commission of the first offence, and eight years old at the time of the commission of the second offence.  The victim's mother separated from the applicant between the time of the two offences.  After they separated, the applicant lived nearby and would assist the victim's mother with babysitting and child care generally.
7The circumstances in which the first and second offences came to be discovered is of significance to ground 3. They are outlined in detail below.  However in summary in February 2013 the applicant disclosed to the victim's mother that he had committed the first offence. This set in train inquiries which led to the victim disclosing that he had committed the second offence.  The applicant initially denied, but then later admitted the second offence.
8As already noted, the first offence was committed between September 2005 and March 2007.  The applicant was at home with the victim. His mother was not in the house.  The applicant showered with the victim. After the shower he wrapped a towel around himself and one around the victim.  They both went to the bedroom.  The victim was standing on the bed and the applicant rubbed moisturiser over her body.  At one point whilst she was lying on the bed the applicant used his finger to rub the victim's clitoris as he was applying the moisturiser.  The applicant said he touched her clitoris for about five to ten seconds. He said he stopped ""because his conscience got the better of him"".
9The second offence occurred some seven years later in December 2012.  The applicant was minding the victim and her sibling while their mother was away.  While the sibling was occupied, the applicant took the victim to her mother's bedroom. He closed the bedroom door.  He took off the victim's swimming costume and undressed himself.  He put some moisturiser on his hand and rubbed the cream onto the genital area of the victim outside of her labia and on her clitoris.  This conduct was the basis for the charge under s 66A(2) that was dealt with on the Form 1 in relation to the second offence.  
10The applicant then put moisturiser on his penis and masturbated himself while the victim lay on the bed nearby.  This conduct constituted the basis for the other charge dealt with on the Form 1.  
11The applicant then rubbed his penis up and down on the victim's vaginal area, including her clitoris for about half a minute.  He ejaculated into a T-shirt.  Both he and the victim got dressed and left the room.  This conduct constituted the second offence.
The sentencing judgment
12In the sentencing judgment his Honour described the facts of the offences, as well as their maximum penalties.  His Honour then addressed the sentencing task as follows.
13First, his Honour addressed the circumstances surrounding the commission of the first offence.  His Honour considered the very young age of the victim, and the fact that the applicant was in a position of trust, as significant matters affecting his culpability.  His Honour noted that the nature of the sexual contact was a serious example of the offence, notwithstanding that it did not ""amount to full penetration"".  His Honour noted the significant circumstance that the offence only came to light as a result of the admission of the applicant.  This warranted a discount in accordance with the principle stated in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 (""Ellis"").  That principle is discussed further below, but it suffices to note that no complaint is made in relation to his Honour's application of Ellis in determining the sentence for the first offence.  
14Second, his Honour addressed the circumstances of the second offence.  Not surprisingly his Honour described it as ""plainly very serious"".  His Honour also stated that the ""offence cannot be viewed as an isolated one"", a ""finding"" which forms the basis of the complaint under ground 1.  His Honour identified a number of circumstances of the offence which his Honour considered rendered it serious, namely the form of sexual contact, the age of the victim and the fact that the applicant ejaculated.  His Honour concluded that ""the offending [in relation to the second offence] can be gauged as falling within the middle of range of seriousness"" for offences of its kind.
15Third, his Honour noted the applicant's plea and the fact that it relieved the victim of having to confront her own father in court.  His Honour noted that the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity and that the applicant was entitled to the maximum discount, namely 25 percent.
16Fourth, his Honour noted that although there was no victim impact statement, it could be ""assumed that the offender's mistreatment of the victim will leave real psychological scars on her that may take years to resolve"".  His Honour correctly noted that, as that is the type of harm that is often caused by offending of this nature, it does not strictly amount to an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing.
17Fifth, his Honour noted the applicant had no prior convictions. His Honour accepted that he was entitled to some leniency by reason of his prior good character, but found that it was not a matter that attracted great weight in sentencing for these offences.
18Sixth, the sentencing judge referred to a psychiatrist's report and a report from a counsellor.  I will return to address these reports when considering ground 4.
19Seventh, the sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act because it was the applicant's first time in custody and he would spend much of his custody in isolation.   The applicant was thirty-four years old at the time of sentencing.
Ground 1:  Error in finding that the second offence was ""not isolated""
20Ground 1 contends that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the second offence was ""not isolated"".  
21The relevant part of the sentencing judgment that contains this ""finding"" is as follows:
""The second offence, however, is plainly very serious.  It is true, as counsel for the offender submitted, that it only came to light when the offender made his initial admission [concerning the first offence] that led to further investigations being carried out and the victim's ultimate disclosure. She disclosed that the events happened regularly and consequently the offence cannot be viewed as an isolated one."" (emphasis added)
22The applicant's sentence proceedings commenced on 24 October 2013.  At the outset the Crown tendered, without objection, a statement of facts.  The statement of facts included the following:
""The [victim] said in her second interview that 'he does it every time mum goes out' and that it had happened lots of times.  It had happened in her bedroom and her mother's room, she was unable to recall any details of any other occasions.""
23Later Counsel for the applicant submitted that the ""offending occurred over a very brief period of time"".  The sentencing judge then referred Counsel to the above passage from the statement of facts.  The exchange continued as follows:
""His Honour: I don't think that supports a conclusion that it happened on one occasion or that it's isolated.
[Counsel for the Applicant]:  Well in my submission your Honour it would be an aggravating feature of the offence or the sets of offences that form count 2 and for your Honour to find it an aggravating feature your Honour would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt -
His Honour:  This is in the agreed facts, 'He does it every time mum goes out'.  Now that's obviously more than once.
[Counsel for the Applicant]:  Your Honour that's what the victim complained of.  He doesn't -
His Honour:  - shouldn't have put it in the facts, if it's going to be an issue it's going to be an issue that's going to have to be decided beyond reasonable doubt because I can tell you now I'm not going to treat it as an isolated incident.  You'll have to have the victim called if you want to pursue it.
[Counsel for the Applicant]:  Well we certainly don't want that your Honour.  But on the point -
His Honour:  I obviously have no evidence of these other occasions outside what she say -
[Counsel for the Applicant ]:  Yes.
His Honour:  The extent of my finding would be that it wasn't an isolated incident.
[Counsel for the Applicant ]:  Well we certainly -
His Honour:  Which I'm not sure is an aggravating feature, I'd have to check.  It takes away from a mitigating factor that it was an isolated - if it's an isolated incident it could be a mitigating factor.  If I don't make that finding it doesn't necessarily aggravate the offence but it's certainly something that doesn't mitigate it but I'd have to go and check sentencing books about that.
[Crown]:  As I understand the authorities your Honour is required to sentence him for the matters before the court on the basis of the factual circumstances of the matters before the court, but as I understand the agreed facts, well I just rose to agree entirely with what your Honour just said, so I don't think I should repeat it.  It takes - it's not the situation on the agreed facts where he's entitled to a discount because they were isolated incidents.  But your Honour must sentence him for the count on the - the count that he was committed for sentence for and take into account the two matters on the form 1. I just rose to agree with what your Honour was saying.
[Counsel for the Applicant ]:  The solution is your Honour that we don't propose to ask the victim to come to give evidence and so that being the case then your Honour -
His Honour:  You've heard what I've had to say -
[Counsel for the Applicant]:  Yes I have.""  (emphasis added)
24On behalf of the applicant it was submitted (correctly) that a sentencing judge may not take into account facts adverse to the interests of an offence unless those facts are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (citing R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270) (""Olbrich""). It was contended that his Honour made such a finding and did so without sufficient evidence to enable it to be proved beyond reasonable doubt because his Honour was advised that part of the statement of facts was in dispute.
25I do not agree.  First, this ground misconstrues the finding of the sentencing judge.  His Honour did not make a positive finding adverse to the interests of the applicant to the effect that he had committed sexual offences against his daughter on occasions other than those the subject of the first and second offences.  Instead his Honour only declined to make a finding favourable to the applicant, namely that the offence was ""an isolated one"". This distinction was explained in Olbrich at [25] to [26]:
""... Nonetheless, it may be accepted that if the prosecution seeks to have the sentencing judge take a matter into account in passing sentence it will be for the prosecution to bring that matter to the attention of the judge and, if necessary, call evidence about it. Similarly, it will be for the offender who seeks to bring a matter to the attention of the judge to do so and, again, if necessary, call evidence about it. (We say ""if necessary"" because the calling of evidence would be required only if the asserted fact was controverted or if the judge was not prepared to act on the assertion.) In the proceedings before the primary judge in this case, the prosecution did not submit that the sentence to be imposed on the respondent (a 58 year old first offender who pleaded guilty to importing more than 1.1 kilograms of heroin) should be increased beyond what otherwise would be called for by those facts because the appellation ""principal"" could be attached to him.  Rather, the respondent submitted that the sentence otherwise to be imposed on him should be mitigated because he was 'a courier'.  The respondent bore the burden of proving this fact. The judge was not persuaded of it.""  (emphasis added)
26In this case it was the applicant who, in the passage extracted at [23] above, sought to bring a ""a matter to the attention"" of the sentencing judge, namely that the ""offending occurred over a very brief period of time"". It follows that the applicant ""bore the burden of proving"" that fact. However the sentencing judge was not persuaded.  The approach foreshadowed by the sentencing judge in the extract set out above was reflected in his findings in the sentencing judgment.  It was consistent with Olbrich.
27Second, there was evidence which justified his Honour rejecting the finding that was sought on behalf of the applicant.  Arguably the agreed facts could have supported a positive finding that he sexually assaulted the complainant on other occasions, but it is not necessary to consider that.  As I have stated, the facts were tendered without objection.  When Counsel for the applicant queried the use to which they might be put, he was offered the opportunity for the victim to be called, which he declined.  Even if the passage in [23] above could be construed as the raising of a late objection to the admission of part of the statement of facts, that objection was subsequently withdrawn.
28I reject ground 1.
Ground 2:  Alleged error in taking into account sentencing statistics tendered by the Crown
29Ground 2 complains that the Crown tendered statistics from the Judicial Commission's database recording sentences imposed for ""multiple offences"" under s 66A(2).  The applicant submitted that he was only being sentenced for one offence under s 66A(2) with another such offence being included on a Form 1, and that his Honour ""appears to have relied"" on those statistics.
30The Crown noted that the statistics also related to ""[a]ll offenders"" and contended that statistics relating to multiple offenders were relevant in that the applicant was sentenced for multiple offences, albeit the first offence was a contravention of  s 66A(1).
31I consider this ground untenable.  Statistics concerning multiple offending under s 66A(2) could be of some assistance to a sentencing judge in ascertaining general sentencing patterns relevant to the sentencing of an offender for an offence under s 66A(1) and an offence under s 66A(2).  In any event it is unnecessary to consider this further because there is nothing to suggest that his Honour made any use of the statistics.  They were not referred to in the sentencing judgment.  Given the limited significance of statistics concerning the sentences imposed for offences (Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54] to [55]), this is not surprising.  Instead, as is to be expected, his Honour noted the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole periods for these offences.
32I reject ground 2.
Ground 3:  Alleged insufficient discount given to the applicant for his assistance to the authorities
33Ground 3 alleges that an insufficient discount was given to the applicant for his ""assistance to the authorities"".  As framed, this ground is potentially confusing in that the relevant assistance being referred to was his disclosure of his own criminality (and not any assistance he gave to an investigation of the criminality of others).  The essence of the complaint is that he was proffered either no, or an insufficient, ""Ellis discount"" for the second offence.
34In Ellis at 604 Street CJ held that a ""considerable"" or ""significant added"" element of leniency is required in sentencing an offender in respect of offences disclosed that were otherwise unknown to the authorities, and that the extent of any such discount will ""vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered ... [and] guilt being established"" against the offender.  The principle in Ellis is well recognised (see Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267).  It is a ""rule of law"" for the purposes of s 21A(1) of the Sentencing Act.
35To address this ground it is necessary to outline the course of events that led to the charging of the applicant. They are partly taken from the police facts and partly taken from the submissions of Counsel for the applicant before the sentencing judge which were not disputed.
36In February 2013 the applicant made a disclosure to his former wife that he had touched their daughter in the vaginal area when she was about two years old.  His former wife reported this to the authorities.  
37The victim was interviewed at 9:17am on 19 February 2013 by an officer from the Department of Community Services (""DOCS"").  She did not disclose any offences by the applicant.  However when the victim returned home after the interview she disclosed the offences to her mother.  The victim's mother advised police of this when they attended the home on that day. 
38At 3:30pm on 19 February 2013 a DOCS officer spoke to the applicant.  He admitted the conduct the subject of the first offence.
39The applicant was interviewed by police at midday on 20 February 2013.  He again admitted the conduct the subject of the first offence, but also denied any subsequent offending.  The victim was interviewed by police at 5.28pm on 20 February 2013.  She disclosed the facts giving rise to the second offence and the charges on the Form 1.  The applicant was arrested later that evening and reinterviewed.  He then admitted the second offence and the conduct the subject of the charges on the Form 1.
40The end result is that the applicant first disclosed the conduct the subject of the first offence.  His disclosure led to an investigation that ultimately led to the victim disclosing the conduct of the second offence and the Form 1 charges.  The applicant initially denied committing any offence other than the first offence, but after his arrest admitted the conduct the subject of the second offence and the charges on the Form 1.
41Before the sentencing judge, Counsel for the applicant placed reliance on Ellis in relation to the first offence.  However, in relation to the second offence Counsel conceded that ""[i]t is accepted that the Ellis principle has little application to the 2012 offences because the offender initially denied this offending when interviewed by police"" and the ""victim had already made disclosures to police"".
42As noted above, the sentencing judge referred to Ellis in addressing the circumstances of the first offence.  His Honour concluded that ""... given the nature of the offence and the fact that the victim, being so young, was never likely to report it, the offender is entitled to a very substantial discount on the sentence"". This discount is reflected in the comparatively low sentence imposed on the applicant for the first offence.
43As noted, the substance of the applicant's complaint concerns the absence of any or any sufficient Ellis discount for the second offence.  In the passage set out in [21] above the sentencing judge accepted the connection between the initial disclosure and the second offence, but otherwise did not further advert to whether any discount was warranted for the second offence.
44In my view the proper construction of the extract from the sentencing judgment set out in [21] is that his Honour accepted that there was bare causal connection between the applicant's initial disclosure of the first offence and his prosecution for the second offence, but did not consider that was sufficient to warrant any Ellis discount.  In light of the concession made on the applicant's behalf, that conclusion is not surprising.  Moreover I do not consider that it was erroneous. The applicant's initial disclosure of the first offence may have been the occasion for interviewing the victim, but it was her bravery that led to the disclosure of the second offence.  If she had not disclosed it, then no doubt the applicant would have maintained his denial that he committed any offence against the victim other than the first offence.
45I reject ground 3.
Ground 4:  Failure to make findings in relation to the applicant's remorse, risk of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation
46Ground 4 complains that the sentencing judge failed to make any findings in relation to the applicant's remorse, risk of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation.  The applicant submitted that there was ""ample evidence"" in support of those factors and they were of great significance to the sentencing process, yet his Honour did not make any findings concerning these factors.  
47The Crown submitted that there was no evidence of remorse on the part of the applicant and, to the extent there was material concerning his prospects of re-offending and rehabilitation, it was adverse to the applicant. The Crown contended that the evidentiary burden on the applicant was not discharged with the result that ""his Honour left the matters neutral in his sentencing judgment"".
48Before the sentencing judge the applicant's Counsel referred to s 21A(3) of the Sentencing Act and submitted that the applicant was ""unlikely to re-offend"" (s 21A(3)(g) and had ""good prospects of rehabilitation"" (s 21A(3)(h)).  It was also submitted that he had shown remorse (s 21A(3)(i)).
49The applicant did not give evidence before the sentencing judge.  However, two reports were tendered, one from a psychiatrist, Dr Ellis, and another from a ""sexologist"", Vanessa Thompson.  Ms Thompson's qualifications and report suggest that she counsels sex offenders.
50Dr Ellis' report contains a lengthy section addressing the applicant's recidivism. Dr Ellis applied the ""STATIC-99R"" actuarial assessment methodology to the applicant.  It yielded a score in the low risk category which was said to be similar to other ""incest offenders"".  Dr Ellis also stated:
""Risk factors particular to this case have been identified according to the Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol.  This instrument identifies factors associated with future risk of sexual offending, but does not place persons in categories.  The offending in this case has been sporadic, rather than frequent or persistent.  The offending shows little diversity in regards to behaviour and similarity of the victims.  The behaviour has escalated from curiosity in viewing images, to touching, to intercourse like activity. The effect of the behaviour on victims was minimised, and continues to be.  Typical distorted thinking supportive of offending was displayed at the time of the offences, but no longer endorsed. There is potential evidence for sexual deviance in the form of paraphilia as having driven the behaviour.  Mr [TU] has displayed relatively unstable or absent interpersonal relationships during the two periods of offending.  He currently displays attitudes that are favourable for progress in rehabilitation.  He has never been tested under supervision.
...
Overall his profile shows concern centred around potential sexual deviance, which places him at similar concern to other incest offenders (who tend as a group to be low risk of repeat behaviour, reflected in his score in the STATIC-99R). His lack of understanding about his behaviour is of concern, as is likely ongoing instability in the relationship with his ex-partner. A program of rehabilitation should address the identified factors, primarily his potential deviant sexual arousal pattern, and associated attitudes plus relationship skills and put supervisory mechanisms in place to reduce risk to children.""  (emphasis added)
51In her report Ms Thompson described conducting 27 counselling sessions with the applicant between March and October 2013. She reported his progress as ""positive"" and stated that he expressed a willingness to continue. Ms Thompson also stated that ""[TU] has been assessed by Dr Ellis (and my results concur) as being of low risk of reoffending ..."".  The report from Dr Ellis that was tendered did not support this assertion.  The reference to ""low risk"" in Dr Ellis' report only concerned the outcome of the STATIC-99R assessment.
52In the sentencing judgment this material was referred to as follows:
""The offender has been undertaking counselling with respect to his sexual behaviour. His psychiatrist is concerned that the offender does not appear to understand why he behaves in the way he does. However, he is also of the view that he would benefit from some ongoing counselling to address the issue.""
53Beyond this his Honour did not make any finding as to the applicant's prospects of re-offending and his prospects of rehabilitation.
54In Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [50], Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreed) stated:
""Although it may be said that the longer the minimum term under consideration, the greater the difficulty in making a satisfactory prediction about the future progress of an offender and the danger which the offender would present to the community, it remains the responsibility of a sentencing Judge to take account of the need to protect the community, and to make an assessment of the material before the Court, including an assessment of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation (Bugmy v R [(1990 169 CLR 525] at 532 (Mason CJ and McHugh J)).""  (emphasis added)
55In this case it was submitted to the sentencing judge that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and low prospects of reoffending. There was a body of material addressing that topic although it may not have had the persuasive force that the applicant contended. It is an important aspect of the sentencing judge's task to ascertain the risk posed by the applicant especially in cases of child sexual assault. In my view it was incumbent on the sentencing judge to address the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and reoffending.  
56The Crown's submissions appeared to implicitly accept that the sentencing judge was so obliged.  However, it contended that the passage at [52] above reveals that the sentencing judge addressed the matter but was simply unable to make a favourable finding for the applicant. I do not accept that submission.  Given the submissions made on behalf of the applicant to the sentencing judge, the significance of the topic of the applicant's prospects of re-offending to the sentencing exercise and the body of material that was tendered concerning it, one would expect further discussion than the extract set out above if the matter was truly addressed.  If the sentencing judgment was unsatisfied by the material as to whether any finding in relation the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation could be made then it can be expected that his Honour would have so stated. 
57The position is different with remorse.  Section 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act provides that a mitigating factor in sentencing is:
""the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if: 
 (i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 
 (ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both), 
58The applicant did not give evidence before the sentencing judge. The only material that the sentencing judge was referred to as demonstrating remorse on the part of the applicant was an answer he gave in his interview with the police. However neither the interview nor the specific answer was tendered so that there was no evidentiary basis for the submission.
59In this Court, Counsel for the applicant referred to other material as supposedly demonstrating the applicant's remorse, namely the applicant's initial disclosure to the victim's mother, his plea of guilty and a suggestion in the material that at some point he was suicidal. However the disclosure to the victim's mother was only made in circumstances that she told him he had to be honest if they wanted to reconcile.  As noted, he later denied the second offence to the police. The plea of guilty of itself does not satisfy s 21A(3)(i) and any suicidal thoughts or actions are equivocal at best.  They could be a manifestation of despair at his own predicament.
60In addition Counsel referred to a passage in Dr Ellis' report which recounts the applicant describing his actions as ""silly and stupid"".  This does not assist.  To the contrary, those comments and other observations by Dr Ellis in his report reveal the applicant had very little insight, if any, into his own offending and the damage he has caused.  In the passage from Dr Ellis' report set out above, the author refers to the applicant's ""lack of understanding about his behaviour"" as a matter of concern. 
61The applicant had sex with his eight year old daughter. Not much insight is required to understand how appalling and damaging that conduct was. The  material before the sentencing judge was eloquent in its silence as to the applicant's remorse. In those circumstances there is no basis for suggesting that the sentencing judge erred in failing to address the topic of the applicant's remorse.  
62I would uphold ground 4 of the appeal but only so far as it concerns the failure of the sentencing judge's failure to address the applicant's prospects of re-offending and rehabilitation. 
63As it will be necessary to consider whether any lesser sentence is warranted in law and, if so, re-sentence the applicant, this Court should consider what finding, if any, should be made as to the applicant's prospects of re-offending and rehabilitation.  As neither the applicant nor the authors of the above reports gave evidence before the sentencing judge, this Court is in as good a position as the sentencing judge to address this topic.
64In Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [19] Basten JA stated
""In assessing prospects of rehabilitation, the Court will generally have access to material falling within one or more of the following categories:
 (a) evidence of past conduct and behaviour of the offender;
 (b) professional opinions, taking into account past conduct and behaviour and expressing views as to future prospects, and
 (c) at least in some cases, the opinions and expressions of intention of the offender himself or herself.""
65In relation to (c), there was no evidence from the applicant direct but his engagement with Ms Thompson's program was a positive step. Against this his lack of insight as revealed by Dr Ellis' report does not assist him.  Dr Ellis' assessment falls within (b).  It is guarded but generally positive as to the applicant's prospects. Ms Thompson's report is more positive. As for (a), the first and second offence spanned a period of seven years and there is no finding in the applicant's favour that the offences were ""isolated"".  However, given that he will inevitably  serve a significant period in custody, it seems very unlikely that he will ever care for his daughter again.  His offending to date has been confined to girls in his care, but it cannot be definitively stated that he will not have access to girls in similar circumstances in the future. In these circumstances I accept that it is ""unlikely"" that he will ever commit an offence of the same seriousness again, but would not make any finding in his favour beyond that.  For that reason I regard the applicant as having ""good"" but certainly not excellent prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)).
Ground 5:  Manifest excess and whether lesser sentence is warranted in law
66Ground 5 contends that the sentence is manifestly excessive.  In light of the applicant's success on ground 4, it is not necessary to address this ground. Instead the next question that arises is whether any ""less severe [sentence] is warranted in law"" (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3)). A finding against the applicant on that issue would also resolve ground 5 adversely to him.
67I have already described the offences, the applicant's subjective circumstances and summarised the sentencing judge's findings, including his assessment of the relative seriousness of the offence.  That assessment has not been challenged. In addition I have made supplementary findings concerning the applicant's prospects of re-offending and rehabilitation which are generally favourable to the applicant.  Despite those findings I do not consider that any less severe sentence is warranted.  The attitude of the legislature to these offences is revealed by the maximum sentence of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of fifteen years.  Only murder has a longer standard non-parole period and its maximum penalty is the same.  The applicant's breach of trust was shocking.  It is likely that it will profoundly affect his daughter for the rest of her life.  The ripples of affectation of such conduct can travel through generations.
68The penalty imposed on the applicant included a non-parole period which was one third of the standard non-parole period.  I am satisfied that any penalty for the second offence which is less severe than what was imposed is not warranted, even having regard to the applicant's plea of guilty and his subjective case.  Similarly his conduct in committing the first offence warrants extra punishment even allowing for those matters and an Ellis discount.  His victim was his daughter and she was two years old.  In those circumstances, to describe her as vulnerable is a gross understatement.
69I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
70The orders I propose are:
(1)leave to appeal be granted;
(2)the appeal be dismissed.
71HAMILL J:  I agree with Beech-Jones J.

2764583,Khamis v R [2014] NSWCCA 152,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Nature of ApplicationOn 9 November 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to s 61I Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  On that occasion the applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months.  The applicant had previously served this time in prison and was on bail after a successful appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Accordingly, he was released to parole on the day of the sentence.
2The applicant relies upon the following ground of appeal.
1. The applicant's plea of guilty is not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt and was entered without a full understanding by the applicant of the implications and consequences of his doing so.
3The applicant seeks the following orders:
(i) that an extension of time be granted within which to apply for leave to appeal.
(ii) That leave to appeal be granted.
(iii) That leave to adduce new evidence be granted.
(iv) That the applicant be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty.
Factual background
4The offence, which forms the basis of the matter before the Court, occurred on 28 October 2007.  The applicant was arrested on that date and was charged the following day.  He was released on bail and remained on bail until he was convicted on 9 October 2008.
5The prosecution case can be summarised as follows.  The complainant, who was 16 at the time, lived with her family on a property in the western suburbs of Sydney.  They were of Sudanese origin.  The complainant had arrived in Australia in 2006 with her mother and siblings.  These included her older brother, Kamal, who played something of a parental role towards his younger sister.  The applicant, who was aged 31, became a friend of the complainant's family through community connections and ultimately formed a friendship with the complainant and Kamal.  Sometimes he would have a meal with her family and sometimes he would stay overnight.
6On Saturday, 27 October 2007 the complainant was at home with her mother, her two brothers and a young lady who was in a relationship with Kamal.  Her name was Angelina.  Early the next morning at about 5am, the applicant called the complainant on her mobile phone.  He said that he had finished work and he asked her to open the front door of the house.  The applicant was let into the house by the complainant and after that,  she went back to her bedroom and fell asleep.
7Some time later, the complainant woke up to find the applicant lying on her and kissing her.  Her under garments had been removed and the applicant was trying to (and did) put his penis into her vagina.  She tried to call for help and pushed the applicant away.  He left the room and the complainant then went back to sleep.  When she woke, she went to the bathroom and saw what appeared to be semen in her underpants, as well as in her vagina.  
8The complainant went immediately to her brother's room and spoke to Angelina about what had happened.  There was an agreement between the two young women that Angelina should tell Kamal what had happened.  After that occurred, Kamal spoke to the complainant about the incident.
9Shortly afterwards Kamal initially, and later others, confronted the applicant in the younger brother's room where he had been asleep.  The applicant denied that he had done anything wrong but Kamal persisted.  He threatened that he would get a knife.  The applicant then admitted that he had been in the complainant's room but said that he would marry her.  
10The defence case was that the applicant had entered the complainant's bedroom and spoke of marriage.  The complainant was pleased with the prospect and that it was the complainant who initiated intimate contact.  The complainant touched his penis until he ejaculated, but there was no penetration and whatever occurred, it occurred consensually.  It was his case that the complainant's family sought to extract money from him but that when he refused, the police were contacted.  He denied admitting to Kamal or the family that he wished to ""correct the wrong"" that he had done by offering to marry the complainant.
ERISP
11Following his arrest, the applicant participated in an ERISP, dated 28 October 2007.  In the ERISP the applicant was assisted by a support person from the Sudanese community, but did not have an interpreter.  The applicant indicated that he understood that he did not have to participate in the ERISP unless he wished to and that he had not been threatened, or offered any inducement, to participate.
12Relevant parts of the ERISP are:
""Q158  So when you got there about 6.10 this morning, did you use this mobile to ring S?A Yes.
Q159 - to open the front door for you?A Yes.
Q160 And did you ring her mobile?A Yeah. Yeah, I for her mobile.
Q161  Can you tell me what happened after she answered the front door? Just tell me everything that happened after that.A I tell her, you know.  Like, just, I reach now and, Are you still awake, up?  And she said, Yes, and I'm coming, you know, like, to open the door for you.   I get down from the car she come and open the door.

And I said to him, I said to her, you know, like, I want to you know the Come and marry you, if like, you agree with that, and something like that.  She was, you know, like, not answering you know, like very you know, like, when I ask her, in the time of the answer.

And after, you know, like, I also, you know, like, I tried to give it to her, you know, like, again, like, when he was you know, like, facing me.  And after, you know, like, we been hugging each other, she was, you know, like, very interesting, you know, because that what, you know, like, I was been thinking, she was want to, you know, like, we have sex and something like that. But, you know, like, I didn't putting, you know, like, anything you know, like, about that in my mind, yeah, just, you know, like, couple of, you know, like, kissing and hugging.  After, I don't know exactly, and when I stop, I just, you know, like, for a while, after a while, she said to me, you know, like, Get out of my room, and I said to her, Why? And she didn't answer to me. And just, I went out.

13In answer to Q213 the applicant said on three occasions that nothing happened between him and the complainant ...
""Q220 Did you tell Kamal you had sex with S?A No, no, because I, we didn't having any sex, I know.

The first trial
14The applicant was first brought to trial on this charge on 29 September 2008 in the District Court of New South Wales at Penrith before Murrell DCJ SC and a jury of twelve.  The trial lasted 8 days with the applicant being convicted on 9 October 2008 and taken into custody on that date.
15The applicant gave evidence at trial with the assistance of an interpreter.  Relevant evidence was as follows:
""Q.  And did something happen then?A. INTERPRETER: We were kissing and then we reached the state that it was hot kisses. She had in mind maybe we have intercourse, sexual intercourse, I don't know and I just found her, she's getting her hand and playing around my genital and I was so panic because I haven't done sexual intercourse before. That's why I ejaculated straight away because it was the first time for me to experience this.
...
Q. You mentioned that she was doing something with your genitals, can you tell us what that was?A. INTERPRETER: She held my genital and she was doing that until I ejaculated."" (7.10.08 - T.308.27 - .33, .44 - .47)
""Q. And did you ejaculate on the bed?A. INTERPRETER: Yeah because we were not doing sex actually so half of it it was on my pants, sorry my underwear and the other half it was on the bed."" (7.10.08 - T.309.40)
""Q. And what happened next?A. INTERPRETER: When I found myself ejaculated she was still trying to continue on kissing and then I said to her, ""That's enough."" because anyway I'm coming tired, I want to go onto sleep."" (7.10.08 - T.310.20)
""""Q.  On Sunday did you agree that Kamal accused you of having sex with S?A.  INTERPRETER:  Kamal was threatening me to write down that I had sex with S.
Q.  Kamal accused you of having sex with S, he said to you ""Why did you do this to my sister or why did you have sex with my sister?"" or some words like that.  He accused you of having sex with his sister?A. INTERPRETER:  According to the language I understand Kamal was threatening me to write the paper that I had sex with S.
Q.  And was he also saying to you ""Write the truth on the paper""?A. INTERPRETER:  After i wrote the truth he said to me ""This is not the truth"".
Q.  So do you agree that he was saying to you ""The truth is you had sex with S and that's what I want you to write""?A. INTERPRETER:  He was asking me to write down, because he wanted me to pay some money and to be responsible for S for two years.""  (7.10.08 - T.337.14 - .32)
Q. Then she was - you were wearing your under shorts, she started playing with your genitals? A. INTERPRETER: Yes.
Q. She was pulling on your penis until you ejaculated?A. INTERPRETER: Yes.
Q. Then she wanted to continue but you said ""That's enough I'm tired.""? A. INTERPRETER: Yes.
Q. She continued kissing you after you ejaculated?A. INTERPRETER: After I ejaculated I told her ""That's enough I am tired, I want to go and sleep."" and then I just left.
Q. Well when you said she wanted to continue then did she say something or do something that made you give that evidence? A. INTERPRETER: She asked me to stay.
Q. But you said I'm tired I'm going to sleep elsewhere? A. INTERPRETER: Yes.
Q. And that's what happened, is it? A. INTERPRETER: Yes.
Q. You'd agree that that story is not at all the same story that you told the police about what happened in the bedroom? A. INTERPRETER: Where are we?
...
Q. Okay. Do you agree with me that the story that you just told in court before the jury is very different from the story that you told police?A. INTERPRETER: How would you expect me to talk to the police, I was in shock ..."" (7.10.08 - T.339.35 - 340.13, T.340.44 - .47)
""Q. So I'm going to ask you about some parts of that interview. Do you agree that you told police that what happened between you and S in the bedroom was only kissing and hugging?A. INTERPRETER: I was not able to explain that because of the language.  The other thing it was a shame like to talk about her like she was playing in my genital until I ejaculated.  I thought like no need to talk about these embarrassing things.
Q. So you agree that you didn't tell the police anything at all about S touching your penis? A. INTERPRETER: Because there was no interpreter I was not able to convey that.
Q. That's the reason that you didn't tell them?A. INTERPRETER: Yeah that was - that was the main reason. The other thing because the whole thing is embarrassing and it's a shame.  I don't want to talk about it because otherwise Kamal would have hurted his sister.""  (7.10.08 - T.341.15 - .31)
16At the trial, Dr David Bruce, senior forensic biologist at the Division of Analytical Laboratories (DAL) gave expert evidence in relation to a DNA certificate.  He explained that DNA testing was carried out on the seminal stain on a bedsheet and the DNA recovered was overwhelmingly likely to be that of the applicant.  Dr Bruce carried out screening tests for semen in relation to the high vaginal swab, the low vaginal swab and the vulval swab with a positive result for semen.  Dr Bruce agreed that if there were penetration but no ejaculation there could still be seminal fluid in the vagina if the ejaculation took place outside the vagina; with penetration there could be pre-ejaculatory fluid present in the vagina.  Dr Bruce was not able to extract a DNA profile from this pre-ejaculatory fluid on the tests available to him at that stage.
17Following the applicant's conviction, a Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report was obtained dated 29 January 2009.  Under the heading ""Attitude to the Offence"" the following was recorded:
""Mr Khamis disagrees with the Police facts and the finding by the jury with respect to their assignment of guilt in relation to these charges.  The offender denied sexual intercourse occurring on the offence night, as well as emphasising his perception of consent in the kissing acts by the victim.  Mr Khamis portrayed himself as the victim of a conspiracy of the alleged victim's family aimed at ""bringing him down"", due to his known success of assimilation into the Australian culture.  The offender appeared to rationalise his conspiracy theory by drawing on cultural and tribal feuds of his native country often tangently diverting the direction of the interview and focus away from answering direct closed questions.""
18The Justice Health records note a consultation which the applicant had with a psychiatrist, Dr Elliot, on 12 November 2009.  He told Dr Elliot that he was worried about his appeal and felt that his lawyer was ignoring him.  There was a further entry in the Justice Health records for 28 August 2010:
""He was seen after he had come back from court.  Court was adjourned.  He said he was hoping to get bail and reported that his solicitor was arranging for a psychiatric report for court.  He had a blunted affect, fixed eye contact, monosyllabic responses and paucity of speech.  He felt stressed and continued to hear voices and believed that people were after him.  He denied command hallucinations.""
Successful appeal and retrial ordered
19The applicant appealed against his conviction in the Court of Criminal Appeal (Khamis v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 179).  The appeal was successful on the basis of a denial of procedural fairness.  The trial judge had rejected evidence from the applicant on the basis that the matters raised in this evidence had not been put to key Crown witnesses.  The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the correct procedure should have been to admit the evidence, but recall the Crown witnesses so that those matters could be put to them.
20Significantly, during submissions to the Court during the hearing of the appeal counsel then appearing for the applicant said:
""The accused said he went back to the bedroom with the complainant and there was physical contact between the two kissing and hugging and sexual intimacy but there was no penetration; he has always maintained that there was no penetration.""  (CCA transcript 21.7.10 - p3, line 4)
21The Court of Criminal Appeal handed down its decision on 19 August 2010.  The applicant was released to bail shortly thereafter, having served a period of imprisonment of 1 year and 11 months. 
Retrial
22On 8 November 2010 the applicant's matter was listed for retrial at the Sydney District Court.  The applicant was represented by Ms Kathy Hunter, solicitor, and Mr Paul Johnson of counsel.  The Crown indicated that while the matter was ready for trial, there was an ""outstanding DNA testing issue"" and he asked that the matter be stood over until the following day.  That course was not opposed by the defence.
23On the morning of 9 November 2010, the Crown indicated to the court that ""this will be a short matter as a result of the new DNA material that was received late yesterday.  My friend needs a little more time to confer with his client.  But I think that's definitely the direction we're heading this morning.""
24There is a dispute as to what happened in discussions between the applicant and his legal advisers at that time.  I will deal with that issue in due course.
25Agreed Facts were placed before the judge, Blanch J, and the applicant was thereupon arraigned on one count of sexual intercourse without consent, to which he pleaded guilty.  Defence counsel indicated to the court that it would be convenient if the matter proceeded to sentence straight away.  He outlined the previous history of conviction, sentence, time served and that the Crown was not seeking that the applicant serve any more time.  The Crown tendered the previous remarks on sentence, criminal history, victim impact statement and the pre-sentence report.
26Defence counsel tendered a letter from the applicant's treating doctor, Dr Bashar Mahmood, which indicated that the applicant was ""now being treated for schizophrenia"".  This letter was dated 3 November 2010.  The letter stated that the applicant was suffering from ""thought disorders and auditory hallucinations and preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia made.  He commenced treatment two months ago and awaiting response and adjusting dose currently to reach to optimum dose"".  Defence counsel made no submissions in relation to this report.
27The Crown submitted that the period which the applicant had spent in custody was sufficient punishment for the offence and Blanch J accepted that submission.  Blanch J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 1 month.  The sentence was to date from 10 December 2008.  His Honour then ordered the immediate release to parole of the applicant.
Discussions between the applicant and his legal advisors on 9 November 2010.
28The applicant swore an affidavit in these proceedings on 13 January 2014.  In that affidavit, he deposed as follows:
""3 I suffered persecution and violence at the hands of security officers [in Sudan].
4. I escaped Sudan in about 2000 and travelled to Egypt for protection.
5. While in Egypt I was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  I did not get any treatment at that time.
6. In about 2004 I migrated to Australia as a refugee.  
...
10. In 2008 I went to court.  I was represented by a solicitor and barrister from Legal Aid.  They were both women.  I do not remember their names.
11. At the end of the case the jury said I was guilty.  I was sent to gaol.
12. I remember I spent some time in gaol before I was sentenced.  I don't remember how long the Judge sentenced me for.
13. At that time I was not totally aware of what was going on.
14. I know that I appealed the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  My lawyers did everything for me.
...
16. In about 2010 my appeal was successful and the matter was re-listed for trial at the Sydney District Court.
17. I was represented again by Legal Aid.  I've been told by my current lawyer and agree that Legal Aid appointed Catherine Hunter to be my solicitor, Scott Corish was my barrister.  
18. I remember meeting with Ms Hunter and Mr Corish in an office in Goulburn Street Sydney about a week before my trial was to start.
19. At the meeting I remember we discussed my case.  I explained to Ms Hunter and Mr Corish about my condition and gave my instructions in the case.  I believed my girlfriend had consented to the sexual intercourse.  We had had sex on previous occasions.
20. I next met with Ms Hunter and Mr Corish at court.  We had a meeting in a private room for about 10 minutes.
21. During the meeting Mr Corish said words to me to the effect ""This is a very good judge.  I advise you to plead guilty and you will go home today.""
22. I gave instructions to plead guilty and on 9 November 2010 I was sentenced by Judge Blanch.
23. At the time I entered the plea of guilty I did not understand that pleading guilty meant that I was admitting to commission of the offence.
24. I always believed that my girlfriend had consented to have sex with me.
25. At the time I entered the plea of guilty I was taking Seroquel.  I was very confused and was ""out of my head"".
26. I did not understand what was going on.
27. After court I was let out of gaol.
28. I was put with Probation and Parole.  I remember speaking to somewhere there and saying ""Why am I here?""  I was told ""Your name is on the computer.  You have committed a crime.  You are a criminal.  We have to supervise you.""
29. I was upset when I heard this.  I did not believe I was a criminal.  
30. After meeting with Probation and Parole, I remember speaking to a few friends who explained to me that if I had sex with my girlfriend without her consent, then I was guilty.  They explained to me that if I had sex with my girlfriend with her consent, then I was not guilty.
31. This was the first time I understood what being ""guilty"" meant.""
(It was common ground that the applicant's barrister was Mr Johnson not Mr Corish.)
29The applicant was cross-examined by the Crown on his affidavit in these proceedings.  He was asked to explain inconsistencies between what he said in his affidavit and what he had told the police in his ERISP and the evidence he had given in his first trial.  With the aid of an interpreter, he said that what was stated in his affidavit was correct.  His explanation for inconsistencies with earlier statements was that he did not have an interpreter, he did not remember what was said, and that he was ""out of my head"".  When asked questions about whether he understood what he was doing when he gave instructions to plead guilty on 9 October 2010 he said that he was ""out of his head"".  
30In this appeal the applicant relied upon new evidence being two reports of a psychiatrist, Dr Adams, dated 12 September 2013 and 24 July 2014 and a report from a psychologist, Mr Nielsen, dated 11 October 2012.  The Crown did not object to that new evidence, provided it was limited to establishing the ground of appeal.
31Dr Adams in the report of 12 September 2013, recorded what the applicant told him of his understanding of the legal proceedings with which he had been involved.
""I attempted to explore Mr Kharmis' understanding of the legal proceeding following the initial charge.  He stated ""I lost my memory after 2007, my memory's been affected severely after 2007"" and he frequently referred to his inability to recall the exact details.  He recalled initially pleading not guilty and being found guilty at trial.  I asked him about the initial appeal to which he responded ""I don't know what happened at that time"".  He commented ""People asked me to appeal against the decision ... say you guilty and you will go home ... my memory was 100 percent destroyed"".  With regards the appeal process Mr Kharmis commented ""I only understood that I would be free to go home ... he [referring to his legal representation at this time] didn't explain to me what would happen if I pleaded guilty.  Even if he did, I didn't understand because of my memory ...""."" (Report p5)
32In response to the report from Dr Adams, the Crown had the applicant seen by Dr Allnutt.  Dr Allnutt interviewed the applicant on 1 June, 3 July and 13 July 2014 and provided a report dated 16 July 2014.  An interpreter was present at all of the interviews.  Dr Allnutt recorded that the applicant told him the following:
""In the time leading up to 9 November 2010 he had been locked up in gaol and he lost his memory, meaning he felt ""comatose and unconscious"".  He had problems with concentration and memory he said and he was not sure what was going on.  He took five kinds of medication in gaol; he was not sure of their names.  He saw mental health professionals but was not sure if they were psychologists or psychiatrists.  He saw a lot of them.
On 9 November 2010 he was living in a boarding house in Redfern.  He had been released from gaol two weeks prior.  He woke up and went to court that morning in Liverpool Street.  He met with his lawyers and a colleague in front of the court.  They took him to some chairs and he sat with the lawyer and a colleague.  At the time they seemed to be in a hurry.  They told him that the judge was a good man and if he wanted to go home, he must say that he was guilty.  He then went with them up some stairs to the court.  The lawyer spoke to the judge and the solicitor then asked him to say 'guilty'.  He recalled he was not in the dock.  The solicitor told him to say 'guilty' and he said this.  He said it because the solicitor had told him if he said this word in front of the judge, there would be ""no problem"" and nothing would happen after this.  He could not recall the judges being read out, but he did recall the solicitor speaking to the judge and saying that he had schizophrenia.  After he'd pleaded, he went home.  He recalled at that stage feeling as if he was in a coma and unconscious.  
When I inquired about his understanding of the reason he went to court he stated he had gone to court that day because he had been asked to come by the solicitor over the phone.  At the time he said he had a ""feeling"" that someone was planning to put him in trouble and that this was ""the girl"" (S).  He said that at the time he did not know why he was going to court but he knew there were allegations that he had had sex with this girl.  
When I inquired whether or not there was an interpreter at the time he spoke to his lawyers on 9 November 2010, he said there was no interpreter and they spoke to him in English and that there was no interpreter in court.""
33On 9 October 2010 a Statement of Agreed Facts was placed before Blanch J.  That document was signed by the applicant and was also signed by a Sudanese interpreter who endorsed the document as follows:  ""Has been read to Mr Khamis"".  Included in the Statement of Facts was the following:
""11 The matter came for trial at Penrith District Court in September 2008.  The offender gave evidence at trial.  He asserted that he and the complainant were effectively engaged and that he had gone to her room that morning with her agreement to discuss their impending marriage.  He said that there was sexual conduct between them initiated by the complainant.  He said that she rubbed his penis until he ejaculated but there was no intercourse.  He asserted that the family wished to obtain money from him and when he refused to agree to this, they contacted the police ...
13 Additional testing using the Y-filer System was completed by DAL in November of this year.  This testing showed that the Y-filer profile recovered from the high vaginal, low vaginal and vulval swabs of the victim matched the Y-filed profile of the offender with the result that the offender could not be excluded as the source of the male DNA on these swabs.""
34Affidavits were filed on behalf of the Crown.  Victoria Engel was a solicitor in the employ of the ODPP and had the carriage of the prosecution of the applicant.  She was able to refresh her memory by accessing electronic file notes and email correspondence kept by the ODPP.
35In her affidavit she described how on 3 November 2010 she contacted Dr Bruce from DAL and arranged for him to carry out the more advanced Y-filer testing of the vaginal swabs taken from the complainant.  When she received those results, she sent an email to the applicant's counsel, Mr Johnson, advising him of the test results which were as set out in the statement of facts above.  Subsequently, there was a discussion between counsel for the Crown (Mr Bowers) and Mr Johnson, during which the updated DNA test results from DAL were provided to Mr Johnson.  It was the recollection of Ms Engel that the statement of facts handed up in court was signed by the applicant.
36Mr Johnson affirmed an affidavit on 1 July 2014.  It was necessary for him to rely upon his memory because he no longer possessed a copy of his brief or any notes relating to the matter.  He spoke to Ms Hunter, his instructing solicitor, in order to refresh his memory.  Mr Johnson was able to say:
""5 I do recall attending the Downing Centre District Court to appear for Mr Khamis.  I recall that a supplementary report from the Department of Analytical Laboratories was served very late (by the date of Mr Bruce's report of 8 November 2010 and the FAX transmission time of 1600 shown on it, it must have been either late on the Monday or early Tuesday the 9th that it was served on the defence by the Crown).  
6 I do not recall Mr Khamis's specific instructions to me as to the allegations he faced (i.e. whether he was denying intercourse took place (as he did in the first trial) or whether he was saying consensual intercourse took place (as he asserts he told us in his affidavit).  I do recall that having received the additional DNA report the matter was stood in the list in the morning (which must have been on Tuesday the 9th) so that its contents could be discussed with Mr Khamis.  I believe an interpreter was also present.  I do recall that before Ms Hunter and I had this conference at court with Mr Khamis the Crown had advised me (whether by phone or in person I cannot recall) that if Mr Khamis pleaded guilty to the charge, the Crown would not submit that he needed to serve any additional gaol time.
7 I vaguely recall having a conference in a conference room at the Downing Centre.  Although I cannot recall what conversation then occurred with Mr Khamis, I believe he was advised of this new evidence.  It is also my belief that the new evidence did not assist his case and that was why the matter was stood in the list.  (While I do not recall what his instructions were for his second trial, assuming (as he asserts) that ""consensual intercourse"" were his instructions, the new DNA report - confirming for the first time the presence of male DNA and which, using the Y-filer System matched Mr Khamis and hence did not exclude him as the source of the male DNA - would have assumed no importance whatsoever to his case as he was now running it).  If I did advise him to plead guilty, I can only believe I did so in the light of the new DNA report not assisting his case at trial.  I do recall he was advised as to the Crown's attitude on sentence if he pleaded guilty and I do agree that I advised him to the effect that if he pleaded guilty before Blanch CJ with the Crown's concession as to time served, that he would in all probability not serve any additional time in custody.  I further believe Ms Hunter obtained signed instructions from Mr Khamis that he would plead to the offence.  I can't recall how long the conference lasted.
8 I cannot recall anything else about the conference at which he gave signed instructions to plead guilty.
9. I note Mr Khamis states in his affidavit that he was suffering from a mental illness and was ""out of my head"" when he pleaded guilty.  I have been asked by the Crown to comment on my experience with clients who have a mental illness and my ability to understand their instructions.  Over my 25 years of practice I have had innumerable clients with mental health issues to varying degrees.  I do endeavour to ensure that all my clients understand what I am saying to them that they understand the consequences of their instructions/decisions and that I understand their instructions.  In relation to Mr Khamis I have no specific recollection of his demeanour of that day.""
37Ms Hunter, the applicant's solicitor, affirmed an affidavit on 3 June 2014.  She said that she had been unable to find her file and could not discount the possibility that it had been destroyed.  She had a recollection that there was new DNA evidence but she could not recall its significance.
38She said:
""4 Mr Paul Johnson and I met with the applicant in conference prior to the trial date and on the day of trial.  I have no recollection of the demeanour of the applicant being unusual.  I recall that an interpreter was used during conferences.  
5. I do recall that both Mr Johnson and I advised the applicant that if he was convicted after trial, he would in all likelihood be returned to custody.  I recall that there was a concession by the Crown prior to the trial commencing that were a plea of guilty to be entered to the charge of sexual intercourse without consent that the applicant had served sufficient time in custody.
6 On the day that the matter was listed for trial Mr Johnson and I conferred with the applicant in the court precincts.  Whilst I have not had access to the legal file in the matter, it is my usual practice to obtain written instructions at the time of entering a plea of guilty which acknowledges advice given and received.""
Medical reportsDr Adams, 12 September 2013
39In reaching his conclusions, Dr Adams relied upon his own observations and examination of the applicant, the history given to him by the applicant and medical reports from other doctors who had treated the applicant, including the records of Justice Health while the applicant was in custody.  Based on that material, Dr Adams diagnosed the applicant as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time when he was examined.  In answer to specific questions, Dr Adams said that the applicant was suffering from psychotic symptoms between mid 2009 and August 2010 when he was released from custody.  He noted that Dr Khan, psychiatrist, deemed him to be suffering from psychotic symptoms in January 2011.  Dr Adams concluded that it was reasonably likely that the applicant continued to experience symptoms of psychosis between August 2010 and January 2011.
40In relation to medication, Dr Adams concluded that it was possible that the applicant was compliant with anti-psychotic medication on or about 9 November 2010 but he was not able to confirm this.
41At the conclusion of the report, Dr Adams answered a specific question as to the applicant's mental health on 9 November 2010 as follows:
""4. Based upon the preceding answers, in your opinion, if our client was suffering from a mental illness on or about 9 November 2010, could that illness have had any impact on our client's ability to properly receive legal advice and give instructions to his legal practitioners?
As discussed above, in my view it is reasonably likely that Mr Khamis continued to experience symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia on or about 9 November 2010.  Unfortunately, as discussed above there is no collateral information currently available pertaining to Mr Khamis' exact mental state at this time or his capacity to properly receive legal advice and provide instructions to his legal practitioners.
Broadly speaking, people suffering psychotic symptoms such as Mr Khamis, in the form of delusions and hallucinations, might suffer a reduced capacity to adequately receive legal advice and provide appropriate instructions.  I am unable to provide any definitive comment, however, as to whether this was the case for Mr Khamis' case on or about 9 November 2010.""
42Mr Nielsen, psychologist, provided a report dated 11 October 2012.  In that report he said that the applicant had undertaken counselling from 3 April 2008 until October 2008 and from 14 January 2011 up to the date of the report.  The purpose of the consultations was to enable the applicant to learn coping mechanisms for his paranoid schizophrenia, being a diagnosis made by Dr Khan, his treating psychiatrist.
43Mr Nielsen said that culturally the applicant had found it extremely difficult to adjust to Australian culture and that as of the date of the report was taking 900mg Seroquel (an anti-psychotic medication) and 15 mg of Avanza (an anti depressant medication) on a daily basis.  Mr Nielsen said ""It is my opinion that Mr Khamis' condition of paranoid schizophrenia impacted his cognitive processes"".  It was agreed by counsel for the applicant that such an opinion was outside the expertise of Mr Nielsen and should be ignored.
Dr Allnutt
44The opinion of Dr Allnutt, in his report of 16 July 2014 was based on three consultations with the applicant together with an examination of medical reports from treating doctors, including the records of Justice Health.
45In the third consultation of 13 July 2014, the applicant told Dr Allnutt on a number of occasions that when he went to the court on 9 November 2010, he did not understand what the word ""guilty"" meant and did not understand the implications of pleading guilty.  Dr Allnutt recorded the following exchange:
""At this stage of the interview I asked him what he understood by the term not guilty and he. said, ""Now I know the word means you are a criminal"". I put to him, ""Does not guilty mean you did it or you didn't do it?"" and he said, ""I don't know"".
...
I asked him what the word guilty meant and he said, ""You need to explain to me what does this word mean""."" (Report p 8)
46Dr Allnutt made the following observations in relation to the applicant:
""The defendant in my view appeared to be evasive when answering certain questions but this was difficult to determine because of the language barrier. He seemed at times not to answer the question put to him and it needed to be put to him repeatedly. His affect was flat."" (p 13)
""Given his history and the numerous opinions of a variety of experienced clinicians I would agree that he has schizophrenia.However, at the time I saw the defendant I thought the manner in which he reported his symptoms to me was atypical in a number of ways. Reporting auditory hallucinations as unilateral, such as occurring predominantly on one side rather than in stereo is unusual.  His visual hallucinations, were atypical, in that he described them being generally black, white and red (visual hallucinations are normally full colour), being of miniature and giant sizes (visual hallucinations are generally of a normal size), with a bizarre appearance (the quality of visual hallucinations is normally more realistic) and presenting as talking figures (this is relatively uncommon). Further, his descriptions of referential thoughts on the TV, that is that the figures he visualised ""jumped"" in the TV banging sticks and jumping around (referential thoughts generally relate to media communicating to the patient or about the patient). He reported significant periods of memory loss, such as his recollection of the trial and his incarceration.  I find this to be unlikely even in a person who was experiencing active symptoms of schizophrenia at those times.
At times I thought he was evasive and reluctant to engage in discussion of his legal experiences. He did not perform well on testing of Presser Criteria when I saw him, in particular his misunderstanding of the term Not Guilty, which I found surprising given that by the time he saw me, he had gone through a trial and launched an appeal (there are references in his file of his awareness of the appeal while in prison and concern that his lawyer was not paying enough attention to him).
Thus I have concern that at least at the time that he saw me, there was some embellishment of psychotic symptoms, exaggeration of memory disturbance and amotivation to engage in discussion of court processes when he saw me.
On the other hand the interview was difficult and slow, he seemed have difficulty with the chronology of events. This could have been due to active symptoms of mental illness and an example of his communication problems. It was difficult to assess his flow of thought due to the language barrier (notably however Dr Adams did not note thought disorder when he spoke to him in English) and regard needs to be given to potential confounding by cultural factors. The interview was shortened when he suggested the interpreter of misinterpreting saying that something was telling him this.
Embellishment does not rule out mental illness. If he is embellishing, this could be motivated by a need to exaggerate in order to be believed, in a situation where he might perceive others as doubting him."" (Report, pp 14-15)
47In relation to the medication he was taking, Dr Allnutt said:
""According to his self-report he was taking the medication Seroquel. But the details of this remain unclear to me. Seroquel can affect a person's cognitive ability but only at very high doses, which does not appear to be the case here. I note that in his report dated 28 January 2011, Dr Khan noted he was taking Seroquel 300 mg daily for the prior 6 months - this would be insufficient to cause cognitive impairment due to medication. However, I would regard such a dose as possibly sub-therapeutic and thus not necessarily sufficient to treat his symptoms."" (Report, p 15)
""On 9 November 2010, to enter a plea, he essentially required capacity to instruct his legal representatives on the nature of his plea. To do this, he would have at least needed to know the nature of the charges, the purpose of the hearing, know that his lawyers represented him, that the prosecution put the case against him, the judge made the determination and sentenced him, be able to understand the meaning of the terms guilty and not guilty, the consequences, and be able to communicate his choice of plea to his legal representatives.
...
His legal representative gave an affidavit that they did not observe unusual behaviour around 9 November 2010, in the context of the hearing and his plea of guilty. I assume that they would have engaged him in a discussion in this regard and felt satisfied with  the quality of his instructions.  ...  Given he had gone through a trial, been imprisoned, pursued and appeal and attended court with an expectation, I believe that he likely had capacity to know the nature of the charges.  I also believe it likely that he had capacity to know the role of the judge (his lawyers told him this was a reasonable judge and my impression was that he understood the judge determined the consequence).  Given he was consulting lawyers he likely understood their role as his legal representatives and thus had capacity to understand the roles of legal professionals (the judge and his lawyers) and on this basis probably had capacity to know the role of the prosecution. This also suggests he knew the purpose of the hearing.  His legal representatives appear to have been satisfied with his instruction to plead guilty.  At the least it appears he understood that if he pleaded guilty he would ""go home"".  That is that the plea would result in a consequence that was to some degree favourable (that is, not gaol but home).  This suggests capacity to understand a consequence arising from a plea.
I am however unable to be definitive about his understanding of the plea itself, that is that it was an admission of doing the offence. But given he had been through a trial had appealed his conviction and had previously made a plea; it seems unlikely that he would not have known the meaning of the term guilty.  He seems to have understood that the judge was regarded as sympathetic to his case and if he pleads guilty he would go home.  This suggests understanding that it was worth taking the risk and making a plea with potential negative consequence but in this case positive (going home).  He communicated his choice at the time of the hearing on November 2010 and thus had capacity to communicate a plea.
However that he reports surprise at being a ""criminal"" after the plea also suggests that he might have expected to be found to have not committed and offence and this would support the view that he did not understand the plea at the material time.  But in this he demonstrates an understanding of conviction as opposed to acquittal.
It also possible that he was not expecting further criminal justice involvement if he pleaded guilty, and that he was surprised, when after being told he could ""go home"" if he pleaded guilty (demonstrating a capacity to understand consequence), he still had criminal justice obligations and thus has pursued his current course.  That he was unaware of the potential consequences does not necessarily equate to incapacity to receive legal advice at the material time but is consistent with a misunderstanding of the outcome possibly due to poor communication.
Despite the difficulties in determining the issue in this case my preference would be to fall, on the side of fitness to plead on 9 November 2010 based on current information - that is, he had capacity.""
Dr Adams - Report 24 July 2014
48The report of Dr Allnutt was sent to Dr Adams who upon receipt, prepared a supplementary psychiatric report.  Dr Adams said:
""· I was not concerned at the time of my assessment about the possibility of symptom embellishment.
· I do not concur with Dr Allnutt's conclusion, ""Despite the difficulties in determining the issue in this case my preference would be to fall, on the side of fitness to plead on 9 November 2010 based on current information - that is, he had capacity.""
Following on from the above point, in my view there are too many unknown factors surrounding Mr Khamis' presentation on or about 9 November 2010 to offer a reliable and valid opinion from a psychiatric perspective regarding Mr Khamis' fitness or capacity to plead.  The significant unknown factors include, but are not limited to:  The exact detail of Mr Khamis' symptoms of psychosis; the potential impact of Mr Khamis' symptoms of psychosis upon his thought processes and cognitive capacity; and the issues of language, communication, and cultural understanding.  These unknown variables in my opinion prevent clinically reliable inferences regarding Mr Khamis' capacity to engage with his legal representatives, given the series of assumptions that must be made to compensate for them.
...
In my opinion it is possible that Mr Khamis' legal representatives may not have been aware that he was suffering from symptoms of schizophrenia in the process of giving legal advice and receiving instructions. Symptoms of mental illness are not always overt. There are several reasons for this, which differ case by case. One reason for them remaining undetected is if specific probing questions are not asked.  For example, when I initially briefly met with Mr Khamis on 17 July 2013 we discussed the benefits of an interpreter and postponing the assessment.  I did not explore specific aspects of his mental state during this brief meeting and I did not elicit any features to suggest he was suffering symptoms of psychosis.  This contrasted with my findings during my more comprehensive examination with an interpreter.  I am not aware if Mr Khamis' legal representatives asked specific questions to explore his mental state on or about 9 November 2010.
Correspondingly, on the basis of the information currently available, in my opinion it is also possible that Mr Khamis' legal representatives may not have been aware that his capacity to comprehend any advice given may have been affected.  In my opinion this remains a possibility in light of the unknown factors discussed above, and the absence of any contemporaneous documentation surrounding Mr Khamis' mental state, cognitive capacity, comprehension, and retention of information on or about 9 November 2010.""
Application for extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal.
49The applicant acknowledged that 3 years and 8 months have now passed since he pleaded guilty in the District Court and was sentenced by Blanch J.  He sought to explain that delay on the basis that he did not know that any Appeal or Notice of Intention to Appeal against Conviction was required to be lodged within 28 days of his sentence being imposed.  The applicant submitted that he did not become aware of the consequences of his plea of guilty until some time after his plea of guilty.  He submitted that this ignorance is partly explained by his mental state during the period.
50The applicant submitted that many of the reasons for the delay were beyond his control.  An important part of his application for leave to appeal was the availability of medical evidence to support his contention that he has been suffering from a mental illness for a long time.  He submitted that this difficulty was exacerbated by the need to obtain funding from time to time from Legal Aid in order to retain a psychiatrist to provide a report to support his claim.  In that regard, the applicant relied upon the affidavit of Emad Younan, sworn 28 October 2013.
51Mr Younan deposed that legal aid to obtain a merit advice was granted on 21 June 2011.  A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 3 August 2011 but subsequently rejected because an extension of time was needed.  An Application for Extension of Time was refused by the court on 19 October 2011.  Between 19 October 2011 and March 2012 documents relating to the applicant's case and what happened on 9 November 2010 were obtained.
52On 27 April and 10 July 2012 counsel for the applicant provided advice to the solicitors concerning the collection of evidence.  Thereafter, a considerable time was spent in collecting or attempting to collect evidence in support of the applicant's appeal.  Further delays were caused by the need to apply to Legal Aid from time to time for further funds.  Counsel provided a final merit advice on 26 September 2013.  The Notice of Application for Extension of Time or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 6 February 2014.
Consideration
53Apart from the considerable amount of time which elapsed between 9 November 2010 and when the applicant first consulted solicitors, this matter has proceeded at what could only be described as a steady, rather than quick pace.  In making that observation, I am not being critical of either counsel or the solicitors for the applicant.  In some cases the delay was beyond the control of the applicant's legal advisors, particularly where extra grants of Legal Aid had to be obtained or where recipients of correspondence did not respond or provide requested documents or information.  That having been said, the fact remains that 3 years and 8 months have passed since the applicant's plea of guilty and conviction.  Moreover, almost 7 years have now passed since the date of the offence.  The importance of appeals being dealt with promptly has been repeatedly emphasised by this Court. 
54In Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 this Court (McClellan CJ at CL; James and Johnson JJ) said in relation to an application under s10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for an extension of time to appeal against conviction:
""38 There is a clear public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court against conviction and sentence. The time limit for the bringing of an appeal to this Court under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 reflects the principle of finality in litigation: R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 at 995-996; R v Gregory at [39]-[41]. There is provision for extension of time to appeal and this power should be exercised with the interests of justice in mind, given the usual consequences of conviction following trial on indictment. However, the longer time passes without an appeal being filed, the more solid ought be the expectation of the community, witnesses, victims and the families of victims that the criminal proceedings are over. This is a significant consideration to be taken into account on a leave application. Should an appeal against conviction succeed and a retrial is ordered, witnesses will be required to testify once again, with the further passage of time resulting from a delayed appeal having the potential to affect detrimentally the administration of justice.
39 This Court has recently refused an extension of time to appeal against conviction for murder because of the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the delay and the lack of merit in the proposed grounds of appeal: McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174. When considering the interests of justice in relation to an application for leave to appeal, regard should be had to the interests of the Crown (representing the community) and the administration of justice generally, as well as the interests of the applicant for leave: R v Gregory at [41]; McCall v R at [6].""
55Similar sentiments were expressed in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 by the Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Johnson and Bellew JJ) at [31] - [53].  The Court summed up its conclusions at [53] as follows:
""53 ... all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result. This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.""
56In this case, apart from there being some justification in the reasons for delay, and leaving aside for the moment whether substantial injustice would result, all of the other considerations identified in Abdul point strongly towards a refusal of the application for an extension of time within which to bring an appeal.  Accordingly, this leaves for consideration the question of whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  It is that question to which I now turn.
Legal principles in relation to a conviction appeal after a plea of guilty
57It was common ground that the relevant principles were set out in Regina v Van  [2002] NSWCCA 148; 129 A Crim R 229 by Greg James J (with whom Hodgson JA and Kirby J agreed) where his Honour said:
""48  What is necessary to be shown before an appeal might be successful from a conviction entered up as a consequence of a plea of guilty, has been variously expressed. See Regina v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35; Regina v Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132; 80 A Crim R 308; Regina v Maxwell (1995) 184 CLR 501; 87 A Crim R 180; Regina v Ross (NSWCCA, unreported 20 February 1994); Regina v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 and the cases referred to by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Houra [2001] NSWCCA 61; 121 A Crim R 472 at 477-478 [32] - [33]. The principles have been conveniently summarised in the applicant's submissions taken from Houra (supra) as follows:- 
""·  Where the appellant ""did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered"" (Regina v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 233).
·  Where the plea was not ""a free and voluntary confession"" (Regina v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E).
·  The ""plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"" (Regina v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191).
·  Where there was ""mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt"" (Regina v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 80).
·  Where the ""plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the appellant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty ... some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"" (Regina v Concotta (NSWCCA, 1 November 1995, unreported)).
·  The ""plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt"" (Maxwell v The Queen (supra) at 511).
·  If ""the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt"" (Regina v Davies (NSWCCA, 16 December 1993, unreported)). See also Regina v Ganderton (NSWCCA, 17 September 1998, unreported) and Regina v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320.""
49  To the cases cited should be added reference to Regina v Iral [1999] NSWCCA 368 in which the failure of the appellant to appreciate the nature of the charge and difficulties with an interpreter lead to the appeal being upheld; Regina v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97; 122 A Crim R 310 where the advice of trial counsel to enter the plea was held to be imprudent and inappropriate thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice; Regina v McLean [2001] NSWCCA 58; 121 A Crim R 484 in which senior counsel's inappropriate advice on the applicant's ability to challenge a relevant matter of fact occasioned a miscarriage of injustice; Regina v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273; 124 A Crim R 233 involving improper pressure by counsel and Regina v Becheru [2001] NSWCCA 102 and Regina v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533.
50  In Liberti (supra) at 122, Kirby P referred to the court's approach to a proposed change of plea or to an asserted want of understanding of what was involved in a plea of guilty as with ""caution bordering on circumspection"", since such a plea in law is an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: see Lee J in Sagiv (supra). In Meissner (supra) Brennan, Toohey and McHugh, JJ said at 141; 313:
""A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in the exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if the court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not indeed guilty of the offence.""""
58Howie J considered the issue in Wong v The Director of Public Prosecutions (2005)155 A Crim R 37 at [33] where his Honour said:
""33 A court is entitled to accept a plea of guilty that is given in the exercise of a free choice in a defendant's own interests and there will be no miscarriage resulting from reliance on the plea even though the person entering the plea ""is not in truth guilty of the offence"": Meissner (at 141; 313). Justice Dawson stated the following (at 157; 326-327) (footnotes omitted):

""It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside. For example, he may show that his plea was induced by intimidation of one kind or another, or by an improper inducement or by fraud.""
...
36 If, on the other hand, the advice was concerned with whether he should plead guilty despite his denial of the offence in order, for example, to obtain some advantage for himself then the focus of the proceedings might be different. Simply because a defendant is induced to plead guilty because of legal advice given to him, it does not follow that he should be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty even if others might disagree with the advice. This is because there will be no miscarriage of justice arising. The issue in such a case might focus on whether the plea of guilty was entered in the exercise of a free choice in the defendant's own interests. Of course the fact that a person is induced into taking a course of action does not mean the person in acting on that inducement is not acting from a free choice. It is not every threat, inducement or pressure applied to a defendant that either requires or justifies a court in permitting the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty: Sewell (at [34]).
37 But if the plaintiff by taking the advice proffered to him, entered the plea of guilty as a result of the exercise of a free choice in what he believed to be his best interests at the time, and if, when he entered the plea, he understood that he was admitting his guilt of the offence to the court, it does not follow that a miscarriage of justice would arise by refusing the application simply because he maintains his innocence of the charge and has always done so, or because he now regrets taking the advice. As Dawson J stated in Meissner in the passage quoted above, a miscarriage of justice will normally only arise in that situation where the defendant did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it.""
59What emerges from those statements of principle is that any miscarriage of justice is to be found in the circumstances in which the applicant came to enter his plea.  Ordinarily, this task is not an investigation of the applicant's guilt or innocence, rather it is an examination of the integrity of the plea of guilty itself (R v Stephen J Ray (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 380 at [20]; Sabapathy v R [2008] NSWCCA 82).  The onus lies upon the applicant to demonstrate that leave should be granted.
Applicant's submissions
60The applicant submitted that he had always maintained his innocence in respect of the offence and that he did not understand that by pleading guilty he was admitting that he committed the offence.  The applicant submitted that he did not understand the implications that would flow from a plea of guilty, such as his name being placed on the computer data base as a sex offender.  The applicant accepted that if his primary consideration at the time the plea was entered was that a plea of guilty would almost certainly remove any possibility that he would be returned to custody, and if he then understood the consequences of such a plea, he would be bound by it.  The applicant submitted, however, that he did not have such an understanding.
61In order to make out that argument, the applicant relied on his own testimony that he was ""off his head"" at the relevant time, was suffering from memory problems and did not understand what was happening.  He also relied on the evidence of Dr Adams in both his reports to the effect that it was ""reasonably likely that Mr Khamis continued to experience symptoms of psychosis between August 2010 and January 2011"".  The applicant submitted that in those circumstances it would not matter what advice he might have received from his lawyers as he was unlikely to have been able to fully comprehend it.
Consideration
62There are a number of difficulties which the applicant has to overcome in order to succeed.  As Dr Adams fairly conceded, having examined the applicant almost 3 years after the plea of guilty was entered, he was not in a position to say any more than that it was ""reasonably likely that the applicant was experiencing symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia in November 2010"".  What he could not say was that such symptoms were active on 9 November 2010.  Even if they were active, he could not say that they would have prevented him from understanding what he was being told by his legal advisors.  Just because a person suffers from a mental disease, such as schizophrenia, does not mean that the person is unable to function and in particular is unable to understand what is being said to him or her.  
63It also needs to be kept in mind that the qualified opinion of Dr Adams is balanced by the assessment of Dr Allnutt, albeit also qualified to the effect that although he was probably suffering from schizophrenia, his complaints of symptoms were atypical in a number of respects and were suggestive of embellishment or exaggeration.   Moreover, Dr Allnutt reached a different conclusion to that of Dr Adams and found that taking into account the circumstances in which the plea was entered and in particular the applicant's experience of the legal system over the preceding 3 years leading up to the plea, it was likely that the applicant fully understood what was going on.
64When the reports of both doctors are read, each has tried to be fair and to accurately review the material which they had before them.  Each doctor considered the same material, in particular the entries which were made by doctors employed by Justice Health.  Each doctor was very much dependent upon the history give to him by the applicant.  Despite examining the same material, the doctors arrived at different conclusions.  In that sense, the medical opinions are equally balanced, both for and against the applicant, and do not tip the scales either way.
65It is therefore necessary to look at the applicant to assess, as best one can, his reliability as an historian.  The conclusion I have arrived at is that the applicant is an unreliable historian and this must affect significantly the validity of the conclusions arrived at by Dr Adams.
66In his ERISP the applicant told the police that other than hugging and kissing, no sexual activity took place.  This is clear from the ERISP despite the absence of an interpreter.  The sworn testimony of the applicant at trial was significantly different to that which he told the police.  At trial his evidence was that the complainant aggressively made sexual advances towards him which culminated in him ejaculating onto his underwear and then leaving the room.  That evidence was confirmed by what he told the author of the pre-sentence report.
67The explanation for this change in history is apparent when one has regard to the 2008 DNA reports which showed that his semen was present on the complainant's bed.  If at trial he had adhered to what he told the police, he was unlikely to have been believed because of the DNA evidence.
68Looked at in that way, the change in evidence between what the applicant said in the ERISP and what he said at trial, shows an awareness of the proceedings and their purpose.  Because of the DNA evidence, the applicant needed to provide an explanation which was consistent with the presence of his semen in the complainant's bed but which did not involve an offence on his part.
69By the time of the retrial on 9 November 2010, further DNA evidence was available which made it very likely that there had been sexual penetration by him of the complainant's vagina and that he had not been telling the truth to the police in the ERISP and that he had not been telling the truth when he gave evidence in the first trial.  The only way the applicant could reconcile the new DNA evidence with an absence of offending on his part was to say that penile intercourse had taken place but that it had been consensual.  The difficulty with giving that evidence was that he would have to explain why it was that he gave different evidence in the first trial and yet another different narrative to the police when arrested.  There was a real likelihood that his credit would be substantially damaged.
70In those circumstances, a strong inference exists that these matters were explained to him by his legal advisors on 9 November 2010, together with the advantages of pleading guilty, and that that is why he entered a plea of guilty at that time.  That inference is supported by the recollection of his solicitor and barrister at the time, even though because of delay their notes of what happened no longer exist.  The inference is also supported by the affidavit of Ms Engel, the solicitor for the Crown, at the time.
71Against that background, the content of the applicant's affidavit prepared for these proceedings is readily explicable.  Because of the further DNA evidence which became available in November 2010, it is now necessary for the applicant if he were successful in having his plea of guilty set aside and if he went to a retrial, to explain how penile intercourse took place in such a way as to not involve an offence on his part.  Once again that change of position on the part of the applicant demonstrates an awareness of the charge which he is facing and of the substance of the proceedings to which he pleaded guilty in November 2010.
72It is also against that background that his oral evidence in these proceedings needs to be considered.  Apart from that evidence being quite inconsistent with his previous evidence as to what happened between him and the complainant on 28 October 2007, it was unconvincing in the extreme.  The applicant was evasive and made no genuine effort to answer the questions which were put to him.  His protestations that he had no memory of significant events, or that he was ""out of his mind"" on particular occasions, was incredible.  I do not accept as accurate the evidence of the applicant in these proceedings.
73Even on the issue of whether an interpreter was present on 9 November 2010, the applicant's evidence in his affidavit is unreliable.  The statement of facts signed by him and by the interpreter, with the interpreter's endorsement upon it, together with the evidence of his solicitor and counsel, demonstrate the inaccuracy of that evidence.
74Even allowing for the loss of their notes due to the effluxion of time, the affidavits of the applicant's counsel and solicitor point strongly to him understanding what happened on 9 November 2010.  Mr Johnson is a very experienced counsel, who has acted for many persons with mental illness for over 25 years.  He always made a point of endeavouring to ensure that all his clients understood what he was saying to them and that he understood their instructions.  
75Similarly, Ms Hunter had no recollection of the applicant's demeanour being unusual and it was her usual practice to obtain written instructions where a plea of guilty was to be entered.  I accept that she did so on this occasion, that such instructions were signed by the applicant but that her file has now been lost or destroyed.  
76Two of the notes in the Justice Health medical records support the inference that the applicant was well aware of the nature of the proceedings and of his situation as a convicted criminal.  Those notes were made on 12 November 2009 when he saw Dr Elliot and told him that he was worried about his appeal and felt that his lawyer was ignoring him.  The other note, dated 28 August 2010, described an occasion when the applicant had come back from court after his matter had been adjourned when he was hoping to get bail.  The note recorded that his solicitor was arranging for a psychiatric report for the court.  These notes are strongly suggestive of reasonable knowledge by the applicant of the court processes.
77What is also of significance is that on the occasion of the plea of guilty, a short report from Dr Mahmood, dated 3 November 2010, was placed before Blanch J.  It indicated that the applicant was suffering from ""thought disorders and auditory hallucinations and preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia made.  He has been commenced treatment two months ago and awaiting response and adjusting dose currently to reach optimum dose"".  Defence counsel made no submissions in relation to this report and the Crown submitted that it was of ""little weight"".  The presiding judge made no reference to it in his remarks on sentence.  It can be inferred from this absence of comment that if the applicant were behaving in a way consistent with an active schizophrenic episode, something would have been said by his counsel.
78The short report from Dr Mahmood serves another useful purpose.  It is the only medical material which is reasonably contemporaneous with the plea of guilty on 9 November 2010.  The report supports the diagnosis of Drs Adams and Allnutt that the applicant was probably suffering from schizophrenia at the time, although this was only a preliminary diagnosis by Dr Mahmood.  Importantly, however, the report confirms that the applicant was receiving treatment for his condition at the time of the hearing on 9 November 2010 and had been for two months.
79Although it can be accepted that the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia on 9 November 2010, there is no evidence that the condition was active at that time.  The evidence of Ms Engel, Mr Johnson and Ms Hunter is to the contrary.  The applicant's evidence, given in the appeal as to his state of mind at the time, is unreliable.  His evidence also needs to be considered against the reservations expressed by Dr Allnutt as to embellishment.
80The most likely explanation for the applicant's plea of guilty on 9 November was the receipt of the new DNA evidence.  This evidence gave the lie to the position which he had adopted up to that point in time, i.e. that no sexual penetration had occurred between him and the complainant.  As already indicated, the admission of the new DNA evidence in the retrial would have been catastrophic insofar as the applicant's credit was concerned.  In a case such as this, his credit was of fundamental importance if he were to have any real hope of avoiding conviction.
81The new DNA evidence, coupled with the Crown's concession that it would not ask that he be returned to custody to serve the balance of his sentence, provide a complete and logical explanation for his plea of guilty.  In those circumstances, the making of a plea of guilty was very much to the applicant's advantage.  As Mr Johnson and Ms Hunter made clear in their affidavits, the advantages and disadvantages of entering a plea of guilty would likely have been explained by them to him.
82Accordingly, it matters not that the applicant may not have fully appreciated that he still had some obligations under the criminal justice system, i.e. reporting on a regular basis to the Probation and Parole Service.
83I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage of justice associated with the entry of the plea of guilty.  These were the set of circumstances described in Van and Wong.  There was nothing irrational in the entry of the plea of guilty by the applicant on 9 November 2010.
84Dr Adams' report, although thorough in detail, lacks contemporaneity.  It was very much based upon an acceptance of what the applicant told him which for the reasons already given, was unreliable.  Putting Dr Adams' opinion at its highest, it went no further than that the applicant was ""reasonably likely to continue to experience symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia on or about 9 November 2010"".  That is an opinion expressed in relation to the overall condition.  It says nothing about whether the condition was active on 9 November 2010.  Although Dr Adams said that people who suffer psychotic symptoms in the form of delusions and hallucinations might suffer a reduced capacity to adequately receive legal advice and proper instructions, he was unable to say whether this was the case with the applicant on 9 November 2010.
85The evidence of Dr Adams is not sufficient to discharge the onus which the applicant carries in this appeal.  On the contrary, the evidence from other persons who were present on 9 November, the applicant's unreliability as an historian generally, and the strong motivation which the applicant had to enter a plea of guilty rather than undergo a retrial, satisfy me that he did have a full understanding of the implications of entering a plea of guilty when he did so on 9 November.
86This ground of appeal has not been made out.  It follows that no useful purpose would be served in granting an extension of time.
87I propose the following order:
(1) That the application for an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal is refused.
88McCALLUM J:  I agree that the application for an extension of time should be refused, for the reasons stated by Hoeben CJ at CL.  The interests of justice often demand that the time for bringing an appeal be extended, notwithstanding the public interest in finality, but I do not think this is such a case.  As noted by the Chief Judge, leaving aside the question of substantial injustice to the applicant, the circumstances of this case point strongly in favour of refusing an extension of time.  The unhappy prospect of the complainant having to make a choice as to whether to give her evidence again, or else leave the prosecution to rely upon the record of her evidence given at the first trial, is particularly compelling.  The Chief Judge has explained that the question whether refusal of the application would entail substantial injustice to the applicant requires this Court to focus on the integrity of the plea at the time it was entered.  The psychiatric evidence on that issue, which rests heavily on the histories obtained by each psychiatrist from the applicant, ultimately goes little higher than to establish the existence of a possibility that the applicant did not fully understand that a plea of guilty meant that he was admitting his guilt of the offence.  Having regard to the context in which the plea was entered, the careful evidence of the two lawyers who were advising the applicant at that time and the unconvincing evidence of the applicant himself, I have not been persuaded that it is more than a very remote possibility.
89GARLING J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL, and with the reasons which he gives.
90In particular, I concur with his Honour's assessment of the credibility of the oral evidence of Mr Khamis in the course of the hearing of the appeal.
91I am of the opinion that when Mr Khamis entered a plea of guilty before Blanch J, the Chief Judge of the District Court, he did so in the full knowledge of what it meant, and what the immediate (and beneficial) consequence of that plea would be.
92I agree that an extension of time for the lodging of an appeal should be refused.

		15 August 2014",2014-08-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764586,R v Gareth Mullaya LEWIS [2014] NSWSC 1127,"JUDGMENT

Remarks on Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: The Court must impose a sentence on Gareth Mullaya Lewis, who murdered David Mitchell on 1 July 2012 in unusual circumstances. 

The Offence

2Mr Lewis (the offender) had been released from prison in Queensland and attended the residence of Leigh Moon in Tweed Heads, where Mr Moon resided with his girlfriend. A third person, Leonard Noter, lived in a detached converted garage at the rear of the premises. 

3The offender contacted Mr Moon because the offender had met Mr Moon's son in gaol. The offender had stayed at the premises prior to this occasion. On 30 June 2012, the offender, Mr Moon and Mr Moon's girlfriend consumed amounts of alcohol and drugs. The effect of the cannabis on the offender (and the effect of the alcohol) was manifest. He had been in prison and had not consumed drugs or alcohol for some time.

4The next morning, the offender was completely affected by alcohol and drugs. The offender and Mr Moon recommenced drinking Bourbon and smoking cannabis. This started early. 

5At approximately 10.30am on 1 July 2012, Mr Mitchell walked into the room having been sleeping in the lounge room. An argument occurred between the deceased and Mr Moon, with the deceased accusing Mr Moon of failing to wake him in sufficient time to collect his methadone that day. (The deceased and Mr Moon were each on the methadone program.)

6The argument intensified. It had not involved the offender or any allegation against him or discussion about him. 

7Nevertheless, the offender stood from his seated position at the kitchen table; walked towards the deceased, who was still standing in the kitchen; and punched him to the head, causing the deceased to stumble to the ground. 

8The offender then punched the deceased on the top of the head, seemingly to halt the deceased's attempt to get up, whereupon the offender stomped on the deceased's head with his foot at least three times. Others sought to intervene. The deceased was unresponsive and bleeding from the head. An attempt was made to stem the bleeding and the deceased was immediately transported to Tweed Heads Hospital. 

9When the police arrived at the house, as a result of contact from the hospital, Mr Moon was so intoxicated as to be of no assistance and the offender was found lying face down asleep in the backyard. That was two hours' later.

10A further two hours' later, that is, approximately 2.20pm, the police returned and arrested the offender on outstanding warrants. The offender told police he did not know the deceased or have any knowledge of what happened. The offender was released only to be re-arrested at approximately 2.55pm that day, after witness statements had been obtained from others. 

11The offender was charged, at that time with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. The deceased passed away on 16 July 2012 and the offender was charged with the current offence. The cause of death was a cerebral haemorrhage caused by the stomping.

12Two further issues are of note. Eyewitnesses described the conduct of the offender as ""out of the blue"". The only contemporaneous expression by the offender to the comment, ""you've killed him"", was to the effect ""no one disrespects me..."".

13Consistent with what occurred at the police station is the evidence of the offender's solicitor, who, in relation to the timing of the plea, attested to the fact that the offender could not (and cannot) offer any assistance as to the events on 1 July 2012. I accept that the effect of the drugs and alcohol was so profound that the offender has no memory of the events, his conduct, or his motivation.

The Process of Sentencing 

14I deal with the process of sentencing. To those unfamiliar with the process of sentencing, some aspects of the task may seem difficult to understand. The Court is required to assess the objective seriousness of an offence within the range of conduct with which offences of that kind are concerned. Thus, even as here, where one is speaking of murder as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar, it is necessary to assess the conduct of the offender to determine where, in the range of seriousness, this offence fits.

15It is only for the worst category of offences that one imposes the maximum sentence fixed by the Parliament. A sentence of life imprisonment is the maximum sentence for murder. Whether a particular offence is in that category is not ascertained by imagining conduct that could be worse. Unfortunately one can always imagine a worse scenario. Nevertheless, the Court must assess objectively the features of the offence and the circumstances of its commission in order to determine whether it is in the category of a worst case or lower down the scale of seriousness within a notional range between the lowest level of culpability and the worst category of case.

16The purpose in sentencing any offender is to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting sentencing objectives. In serious crimes such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform.

17Each of these objectives, but particularly the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, punishment and the need for rehabilitation must be assessed having regard to the gravity of the circumstances, viewed objectively within the range of offending comprehended by the offence charged. These point, most obviously, to the protection of society, deterrence of the offender and the deterrence of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution. 

18Considerations of reform or rehabilitation of the offender may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offence but they are more directly affected by the subjective circumstances of the offender and the capacity of the offender to be rehabilitated. The capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of rehabilitation in turn impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed, which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. 

19This process is one that involves what has been described as ""intuitive synthesis"". It takes each of the objective circumstances of the offence and each of the subjective circumstances of the offender and synthesises them to achieve the purpose of sentencing already described. 

20Every murder is serious. Every murder involves the taking of human life by a person who has a state of mind that elevates the seriousness of the offence to that which is the most serious of crimes in the criminal calendar. As I have already stated, the maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment, which penalty is imposed in the worst category of murder. The standard non-parole period for murder is twenty years' imprisonment in the hypothetical mid-range offence. The standard non-parole period does not apply here because of the plea of guilty for which due allowance must and will be given.

Additional Issues Relating to the Offence 

21I have read the victim impact statements. It is against the natural order of things for a parent to lose a child and particularly sad when that loss of a child occurs in circumstances, or as a result, of a violent act of this kind. 

22Similarly, a young child denied a parent, even one with whom he is not in constant contact, is extremely sad. Nothing in the victim impact statements is either unexpected or unusual. Murder has obvious and tragic consequences on the victim and the family of the victim. No matter what sentence the Court imposes, it cannot undo the consequences of the offender's conduct. 

23That conduct must be assessed as already stated objectively, as earlier described. I earlier described the murder as unusual. It is not unusual for offenders to be affected by alcohol or drugs. It is unusual for an offender to be so affected as to be unable, genuinely, to remember anything of the incident. It is also unusual for there to be no pre-existing relationship of any kind and no seeming motive whatsoever.

24The factors to which the Court has regard in that assessment, arising from the facts outlined above, are that: the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offence, being liberty for matters in the Local Court, or its equivalent; while in murder there is generally a level of violence, there was no gratuitous violence or cruelty beyond that necessary to effect the crime; there was no weapon used, although the offender in stomping on the deceased's head in effect used his legs as weapons; the offence was a lone act, committed without any planning and without being part of any wider criminal activity.

Subjective Circumstances 

25The offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing and testified to the truth of his history as provided to experts and also testified as to his remorse. I will deal with remorse slightly later, and set out his subjective circumstances from the report of Lia McInnes, Psychologist, of Duffy Robilliard Psychologists (Exhibit 1). 

26The offender, who is of Aboriginal descent and obviously so, was adopted by Caucasian parents, at six weeks of age. There is no evidence that this was part of any social policy. Rather it was an adoption in the ordinary course. Not that the latter aspect would, of itself, have any substantial impact on sentencing.

27Until nine years of age, his upbringing and early childhood was ""normal"" and supportive. The young Mr Lewis was not cognisant of differences in his colour from that of his parents. At nine, his colour was the subject of comment in the schoolyard, including the difference in colour between Mr Lewis and his parents. On relaying this issue, his parents, for the first time, informed him of his adoption and of the process thereof. 

28In 1994, whilst in prison at approximately eighteen years of age, Mr Lewis met his birth mother. She died in 1997. Mr Lewis has met his biological father only once. The biological father seemed disinterested in him and the family. He considers his adoptive parents as his mother and father. Mr Lewis did, however, after gaining information from his biological father, make contact with his five siblings with whom he has had semi-regular contact. 

29After the schoolyard incident at age nine, Mr Lewis commenced a rebellious period. He was unaware of any other Aboriginal youth in his area. While he acknowledges the acceptance and love of his parents, he searched for other Aboriginal people, thinking he would ""fit in"" with them. He formed negative associates and negative lifestyle practices. 

30Mr Lewis was thereafter easily influenced by other Aboriginal youth and commenced antisocial behaviour. To the extent he continued school, he was the only ""non-white"" student and was called names referring to his colour, which became nasty as he aged. His early education was successful in primary school but the above circumstances eventually took a toll on him; schooling suffered; and he dropped out at Year 9.

31The new associations formed in Mr Lewis' quest for inclusion exposed him to a life hitherto foreign to him of drugs, alcohol, violence, abuse and criminal activity, which led, it seems, to his downfall. 

32Mr Lewis has had limited involvement in employment and has had one significant relationship, which Mr Lewis regards as generally positive, punctuated as it was, with periods of incarceration. He has two children with this person and considers, subject to prison, the prospects of a continuing relationship with his children and their mother relatively positive.

33Subject to what may follow, there are no substantial issues relating to mental health, except as to the effect of alcohol and drug abuse and dependence. Mr Lewis is of average intelligence, measured since his latest imprisonment.

34Lastly I deal with remorse and rehabilitation. Mr Lewis has completed Years 10 and 11 of his schooling while in prison. He describes his children, and the possibility of a positive relationship with them, as his motivation to progress. His prison history discloses a positive effect of cultural programs providing him with role models from within the Aboriginal community. 

35In his evidence, he referred to the shame he felt at his conduct and, in particular, that he could not put his parents through the shame of attending the court hearing. His expression of remorse during evidence was profound and genuine, bringing Mr Lewis to tears or almost to tears. 

36Prior to this offence, and despite a criminal history bearing the hallmarks of drugs, Mr Lewis had been violence free for some thirteen years. I consider he has positive prospects for rehabilitation. That assessment is guarded, as was the assessment of the psychologist. In my view, his prospects improve markedly if he is treated appropriately in custody and supervised appropriately for an extended period in the community.

37The offender (or more accurately his counsel) seeks to rely on the principles summarised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. See the High Court judgment in R v Bugmy [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [18] and [36]-[43]. This is not a traditional Fernando case. Those principles are well known and I will not now repeat them. They largely deal with persons, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, from a deprived background where abuse of alcohol and physical abuse are accepted norms of conduct. 

38The offender's exposure to such an environment really results, as earlier stated, from his attempt to find a peer group arising from his exclusion from social groups at school and in his neighbourhood. It does not reflect his home environment. Nevertheless, there are analogies. 

39More to the point seem to be the factors of social exclusion referred to by Professor Baumeister and on which the offender relied in his further supplementary submission. 

40In a most helpful submission, aided by an equally helpful Crown submission, Mr Bruce SC cited some passages from the Baumeister studies. The Crown acknowledged its possible application, at page 7 of its supplementary Crown submissions, in the following terms:

""It is accepted that the evidentiary material provides the court with some bases to conclude that the offender did suffer social exclusion in his formative years. From the Baumeister Study it would appear that the offender's reaction to social exclusion by connecting with his cultural peers and resorting to an antisocial lifestyle marked by alcohol and drug abuse, violence and criminality was expected and possibly inevitable."" 


41The thesis of Professor Baumeister can be summarised in the following passage and I apologise for citing it at length. In R.F. Baumeister & C.N DeWall, ""The Inner Dimension of Social Exclusion: Intelligent Thought and Self-Regulation Among Rejected Persons"" (2005) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 888, 589-504, the authors remarked:

""It is easy to propose how people ideally or optimally would respond to social exclusion. They ought to redouble their efforts to secure acceptance. Toward that end, they should reduce their aggressive and antisocial tendencies and increase prosocial behaviour. They should improve at self-regulation so as to perform more socially desirable actions. And even if improved social acceptance is not a promising option, they ought at least to become more thoughtful and intelligent and should avoid self-defeating behaviours, so as to fare better on their own if necessary. Yet our laboratory studies have found the opposite of all of these to be closer to the truth. 

Initially we thought that emotional distress would be the central feature of the impact of social rejection, and all behavioural consequences would flow from this distress. This too has been disconfirmed. Across many studies we have found large behavioural effects but small and inconsistent emotional effects, and even when we did find significant differences in emotion these have failed to mediate the behaviours. Indeed, the sweeping failure of our emotion mediation theories has led us to question the role of emotion in causing behaviour generally (but that is another story). 

Self-regulation and cognition, instead of emotion, have emerged from our most recent data as the most important inner processes to change in response to social exclusion. Rejected or excluded people exhibit poorer self-regulation in many spheres. They also show impairments in intelligent thought, though these are limited to forms of thought that are linked to self-regulation (that is, thinking processes that depend on effortful control by the self's executive functioning).

Nonetheless, the findings from this work have helped shed light on both the inner and outer responses to exclusion. They help illuminate why many troubled individuals may engage in maladaptive or seemingly self-destructive behaviours. They may also have relevance to the responses of groups to perceived exclusion from society as a whole. Although there are some exceptions, such as the intellectually vigorous culture maintained by Jews during the centuries of discrimination and ghettoization, many groups who felt excluded or rejected by society have shown patterns similar to those we find in our laboratory studies: High aggression, self-defeating behaviours, reduced prosocial contributions to society as a whole, poor performance in intellectual spheres, and impaired self-regulation. Our findings suggest that if modern societies can become more inclusive and tolerant, so that all groups feel they are welcome to belong, many broad social patterns of pathological and unhealthy behaviour could be reduced.""

42See also, J.M Twenge, Baumeister, C.N DeWall, N Ciarocco, J.M Bartels, ""Social Exclusion Decreases Social Behaviour"" (2007) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92, 56-66. 

43It seems, in a similar manner to Fernando, such a factor, as that espoused by Professor Baumeister, may be used to mitigate or fashion an appropriate sentence, but not so as to impose a sentence that does not reflect the seriousness of the offence.

Conclusion 

44Murder is the most serious of offences and causes the most serious of consequences. This particular crime is objectively below mid-range of the range of criminal conduct within that offence. The maximum sentence is, as I have said, life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is twenty years' imprisonment. A full-time custodial sentence must be imposed, plus something less than the standard non-parole period is appropriate. The sentence will commence on 1 July 2012. On that date Mr Lewis was arrested and he has since that date remained in custody.

45I have indicated the matters that I consider significant and relevant. Most of them are dealt with in the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have taken account of the Judicial Commission statistics and of the number of cases that have been provided to me by both the Crown and the defence. I am particularly taking into account the spontaneous nature of the crime, the spontaneous nature of the circumstances, and the subjective elements already mentioned, including the profound degree of remorse.

46I find special circumstances. I allow approximately 15% reduction in sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 

47One last matter: it is not the function of the court to dictate the administrative arrangements of the Department of Corrective Services. Nevertheless, I recite from Exhibit 1, being, as earlier stated, the report of the psychologist, the following statement:

""Mr Lewis has a paucity of work related experience and skills. Assistance to find a suitable work placement within the Department of Corrections would be of benefit to assist him to prepare for meaningful employment. Further case management assistance addressing educational and vocational needs would be of further benefit to Mr Lewis to develop work interests and skills necessary to function independently upon release. Mr Lewis reports that he has functioned well in custodial sentences, identifying work programs giving him a sense of purpose."" (Exhibit 1, Lia McInnes, Duffy Robilliard Psychologists, at page 19). 

48It is the following that I particularly emphasise:

""Specific programs offered within the Department of Corrections that can begin to address Mr Lewis' varied and complex needs may include but are not limited to The Impact of Dependence Program, Criminal Conduct and Substance Abuse Treatment Program, Getting Smart and SMART Recovery which specifically addressed alcohol and drug use at preparation, change and maintenance phases of recovery, The Violent Offender Treatment Program (VOTP) and the Ngara Nura Program (a culturally sensitive pre-release program)."" (Exhibit 1, Lia McInnes, Duffy Robilliard Psychologists, at page 19).

49I raise that for the reasons already stated relating to the cultural awareness issues and the need for that to be the subject of specific address by Corrective Services. Mr Lewis is not historically a violent offender. If he were eligible for a programme or detention similar to Balund-a (Tabulam) that would be optimal. Otherwise location near the NSW North Coast so the positive influence of his children can be continued and programmes directed to cultural awareness are highly recommended. I direct that these remarks be sent to Corrective Services and placed on his file. 

Conviction and Sentence

50Mr Lewis, please rise. 

51Gareth Mullaya Lewis, you are convicted of murder in that on 1 July 2012, at Tweed Heads, in the State of New South Wales, you did murder David Mitchell. 

52I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 13 years, commencing 1 July 2012 and concluding 30 June 2025, the balance of term being a further five years expiring on 30 June 2030. 

53You are eligible for release on 1 July 2025.

2764592,R v CM [2014] NSWSC 1168,"ex tempore Judgment
1The applicant for bail is a juvenile to be referred to as CM; the solicitor for the applicant has sought a short adjournment of the hearing of his bail application.
2He has explained that some of the applicant's pending matters will be resolved shortly, on 26 August 2014.  He has submitted that it would be more useful to see, with regard to the bail application, what the situation is generally after that resolution occurs.  He also submitted that the application would benefit from further investigations and evidence about what can be proposed, in terms of a bail application succeeding.
3Mr Curran, who appears for the DPP, is open to the suggestion of adjourning and seeing how various pending allegations resolve, but he has noted that the vast majority of the applicant's matters will be resolved by 30 September 2014, and he submitted that the matter should be stood over to a date after that later date.
4I originally expressed to the solicitor for the applicant my deep reluctance about adjourning matters in this situation.  Once a matter is listed for hearing in this list, it blocks other prisoners from seeking bail on that day.  Generally, I do not consider applicants should be able to adjourn their applications for bail simply to see how their other proceedings work out.  Nor do I consider that an adjournment should be granted with regard to matters listed for hearing simply because an application could be improved or better prepared.
5Finally, I also expressed the fact I am very loath to impose upon another judge with extra matters, above and beyond what is already a very long and demanding list.
6Having said that, inquiries confirm that the last issue does not arise because, as I understand it, if an adjournment is granted that would lead to another application not being listed.
7Secondly, the simple fact is that the applicant is an Aboriginal boy of only 14 years of age who has been in custody since 31 July 2014.  In particular, I do not think that a bail application that is not fully prepared should be forced on in those circumstances.
8On the other hand, nor do I consider that matter should be stood over for well over a month.
9As an exceptional matter, I am prepared to adjourn this matter until a date shortly after 26 August 2014, on which date some matters at least will have been resolved.
10In order to build in a margin for error with regard to logistical matters and in order to ensure the matter is able to be fully prepared on the next occasion, I will not list the matter in this Court before 8 September 2014.
11I make the following orders:
(1)The hearing of the applicant's bail application is adjourned until 8 September 2014.
(2)The matter is not part-heard before me.
(3)The applicant is bail refused in the meantime.

2764594,Lazaris v R [2014] NSWCCA 163,"Judgment1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.
2ADAMSON J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Bellew J. I agree with the orders proposed. As to the first ground of appeal, I have reviewed the whole of the evidence and considered the respects in which there was competing evidence. I agree that it was open on the whole of that evidence for the trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the three counts of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, to Mr Poliopoulos contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 (NSW).
3As to the second ground, I agree for the reasons given by Bellew J that leave ought be refused under Rule 4 to rely on this ground. 
4BELLEW J:  On 2 May 2013, following a three day trial before her Honour Judge Huggett sitting without a jury, the applicant was found guilty of three counts of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, to Steve Poliopoulos (""Poliopoulos"") contrary to s. 25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985.  5Having been found guilty, the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months imprisonment commencing on 16 August 2013 and expiring on 15 April 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months imprisonment expiring on 15 June 2016. 
6On 17 December 2013 the applicant was granted bail in this Court pending the hearing of his appeal.  He was released on 17 December 2013 and has remained on bail until the present time.    
7The Crown case at trial was based upon a large volume of documentary evidence which was tendered without objection, along with short oral evidence from the officer in charge of the investigation.  At the close of the Crown case her Honour rejected what was, in effect, an application for a verdict by direction, following which three witnesses were called in the defence case, namely the applicant's wife, Athanasia Lazaris, Janet Liu and John Raglione.  I have referred to that evidence in more detail below.
8The applicant now appeals against his conviction, on two grounds, namely that:
(i)the verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1 to 3 were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence;  and 
(ii)a miscarriage of justice arose as a result of her Honour taking into account the truth of the following representations, notwithstanding that those representations were hearsay, and thus inadmissible to prove the truth of their contents:
(a)""Peter"" is, or was, living around the corner from Steve;(b)""Peter"" was married; and(c)""Peter"" previously operated an establishment called Touch of Class.
9There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.
10The first ground of appeal does not involve a question of law alone.  Accordingly, having regard to the provisions of s. 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, leave to appeal is required:  Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12] per Johnson J, Basten JA and R A Hulme J agreeing.   
11The evidence referred to in the second ground was not the subject of any objection at trial.  Accordingly, leave to rely upon that ground is required having regard to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
THE CROWN CASEThe Thai City brothel12The applicant and his wife lived at an address in Kingsgrove (T30 L5-9).  They each spoke Greek (T45 L21-35).  In about 2004, the applicant began working at a brothel known as ""Touch of Class"" (T30 L23).  When that brothel closed down, the applicant and his wife decided to purchase the premises at 43 Albion Street, Surry Hills along with the business which operated from those premises which was known as ""Thai City Brothel"" (""Thai City"").  The premises were a terrace house with a reception area and some rooms (T56 L27-37).  They were purchased in the name of Acapulco Holdings Pty Limited (""Acapulco""), the secretary and sole director of which was the applicant (T31 L5; AB 342).  The applicant's residential address was nominated as Acapulco's principal place of business (AB 342).  
13Thai City was managed by Janet Liu (""Liu"") (T31 L10) who lived in a room at the premises (T32 L4-8; T54 L19-24; T55 L21-28).  Liu was a director of Shicane Pty Limited (""Shicane"") (T31 L10-30; T34 L32-50). 
14Shicane received the income generated by the business and paid rent for the premises to Acapulco (T55 L30-32).  Liu was solely responsible for disbursing the income which was received (T31 L22-24; T55 L17-18).   Each week, the applicant's wife would cash a cheque in the sum of $2000.00 drawn against Shicane's bank account, from which Liu, the applicant and the applicant's wife were each paid $500.00 (T34 L45 - T35 L21; T56 L4-18).  According to the applicant's wife (T35 L23-26) the remaining $500.00 ""was for the driver, paying him $100.00 per week during the week and then on the weekend because there would be more, obviously more cash, he'd be paid out of the cash from the weekend takings"".  Liu gave a similar account (T56 L20-25).
15The applicant's wife worked at Thai City on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays as an ""office clerk' or ""bookkeeper"" (T30 L11-12; T51 L19-20; T51 L44-48; T55 L48-50). Depending on the amount of work to be done, she would leave the premises no later than 1.00 pm each day (T70 L5-6).
16The applicant worked at Thai City on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays (T35 L28-32; T55 L41-45). His role was described by his wife (T34 L34-36) as ""the handyman"" who ""did the paperwork .... ordering stock and things like that"".  Liu described the applicant's role as one of general maintenance (T55 L43-46).  
17Notwithstanding these descriptions, police discovered business records and documents in the name of the applicant when they executed a search warrant at the premises (AB 147).  Further, the business of Thai City extended to making accommodation arrangements for employees who had arrived from overseas to work (T40 L10-29).  There was evidence of a booking made on 5 January 2011 which recorded the name of the applicant as the relevant contact, along with a telephone number 0450228673 (AB 338).  The same telephone number was provided as the contact for a quotation for furniture to be provided to the Thai City premises (AB339; T41 L18). I have made further reference to that telephone number below.  
18In addition, space advertising Thai City was reserved in a publication called ""Thai-Oz"", giving the applicant's name and Thai City's address as the relevant contacts (AB340-341).  
The employment of drivers at Thai City19Liu gave evidence (T59 L46) that apart from the applicant and his wife, ""a driver"" also worked at Thai City.  In particular, she said (T59 L17-43):
A: Okay I have Zoran as a driver early 2011 and I know him from 2010 maybe the there's - around ...not transcribable..time actually around 2008 should be around the time I know him and then 2011 early he came to Thai City as a customer and I met him up and at the time I'm actually needing someone as a night manager because there's a pub just - its hard to say, there's a pub just near us that every afternoon the black guys are coming around the shop and they're making trouble for us. At the moment I cannot control it because there were all girls there so I approached Peter if he knows someone to be acting as a night manager for being security as well. And then at the very moment as well I come across Zoran, he press - he came to the door as a customer and I said you're here and knowing that he was the driver like the supervisor for the girl in Touch of Class I know that he's more than capable to do the job so I offered him to be around Thai City and that's when I had a drive and night manager.
20Liu described Zoran's role as ""the boss for the working girls"" (T60 L49) and explained (T61 L2) ""that he actually runs the girls for me"".  When asked whether she had ever heard Zoran called by any other name, Liu said (T61 L17-20):
""His other name is Peter, like everyone - everyone in Thai City uses another name. No one in Thai City uses their real name when they introduce themselves everyone that works there is using another name and Zoran uses Peter as his name. 
21When cross-examined about Zoran's hours of work, Liu explained (commencing at T65 L7) that he would come to the Thai City premises at about midday and would be there for about four hours (T66 L20-22).   Having originally described Zoran as (inter alia) ""the boss for the working girls"" (T60 L49) Liu later described him variously as the ""driver"", ""night manager"", ""security officer"" (T66 L36-37) and ""all rounder"" (T67 L6).  According to Liu, Zoran ""disappeared"" immediately following the execution of the search warrant on the Thai City premises (T63 L43).
22Liu agreed (T68 L36) that the applicant's wife worked three days each week at Thai City.  She also said (T68 L40) that the applicant's wife was present at the premises when Zoran was there on occasions.  It is noteworthy that when giving evidence as to who worked at Thai City, the applicant's wife made reference to a ""driver"" (T32 L47).  However, she was not asked, and gave no evidence, about a person called Zoran.  
23John Raglione (""Raglione"") had been a friend of Poliopoulos for 40 years (T85 L45).  He gave evidence that in 2011 when looking for work he went to Thai City where a person called ""Zoran"" employed him as a driver (T83 L11-13) and told him what his duties were (T83 L19-21).  Raglione also gave evidence (T84 L26-37) that during the 6 months up to June 2011 Zoran supplied him with amphetamine for his own personal use.  
24When asked whether he had ever had a conversation with Zoran about his (i.e. Zoran's) name Raglione said (T85 L15-23): 
""A: I don't know why but he wanted to be called something else over the phone even though - whenever he answered the phone he goes ""Yes, it's me, Pete"". So that's - he wanted to be called that so that's fine by me. I have no problems with that.
Q: Did he say anything to you about the name Pete?A: Not really but most security people do have - tend to have different names or nicknames or reputation, whatever they call it.""
25Raglione also said (T86 L6-10) that he heard Zoran speak ""a little bit of Greek"" and ""a little bit of Yugoslav"".  
The evidence of mobile telephones26The applicant was the subscriber of telephone service 0414700220 (""the 220 phone"") (AB 155).  Evidence was given by the applicant's wife (T43 L43 and following) that this phone had ""come across"" from the ""Touch of Class"" brothel at which the applicant previously worked.  
27Both the applicant's wife (T33 L15 and following; T44 L1-6; T48 L29-46) and Liu (commencing at T 56 L39) gave evidence that the 220 phone was one of three phones at the front desk of Thai City which were available for use by anyone at the premises, the other two being services which ended in the numbers 673 (""the 673 phone"") and 888 (""the 888 phone"").  The handsets referable to each of these numbers were not seized by police (T16 L1-3).  Both the applicant's wife and Liu gave evidence that the handsets went missing following the execution of a search warrant (T52 L39 - T53 L1; T62 L30-39).  
28Poliopoulos subscribed to telephone service 0478034826 (""the 826 phone"").  The ""contacts"" in Poliopoulos' phone recorded:
(i)the 673 phone under the name ""Peter 2 Thai City"";(ii)the 888 phone under the name ""Peter 1 Thai City new"";(iii)the number 928111098 (sic) under the name ""Peter Thai office"" (AB 352).  
29The telephone service 92811098 was the landline at Thai City.  
The evidence of the Holden motor vehicle30Once the business of the brothel had been established following its purchase, there was a discussion between the applicant, his wife and Liu about buying a vehicle to provide transport for customers and staff (commencing at T36 L6; T58 L31-33).  Subsequently, the applicant and his wife attended Suttons Motors (""Suttons"") to purchase a Holden Caprice vehicle (""the Caprice"") (T36 L45-49).  
31The nominated purchaser of the Caprice was Acapulco.  Both the applicant's residential address, as well as the address of Thai City, were nominated on the purchase order (T37 L29-31).  The 673 phone, along with the landline of Thai City and the landline connected to the applicant's residence, were also nominated as contacts (T37 L40-42; T30 L20; T38 L39).  Insurance effected with Allianz Australia Insurance Limited nominated Acapulco as the insured party and Thai City's address was given as the contact address (AB 349 - 345).
32The service history for the vehicle establishes that it was serviced at Suttons on various dates, including 16 June 2011 (AB 391).   
Count 133On 14 June 2011, a police undercover operative (""UCO"") telephoned Poliopoulos and organised to purchase a quantity of methylamphetamine (AB 164-167).  At 1.09 am on 15 June 2011, Poliopoulos (using the 826 phone) telephoned the 220 phone and spoke to a person who responded to the name ""Peter"".  A conversation in the Greek language followed, in which Poliopoulos and Peter discussed ""two bags"" and their weight (AB 168-167).  In the absence of any evidence of voice identification, the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence to establish that the person Peter in that conversation (as well as a number of others) was the applicant.  
34The recording of the conversation was played to the applicant's wife in the course of her evidence in chief (T44 L26).  She said that neither voice was that of the applicant (T44 L30 - T45 L2; T45 L6-35).  It was also played to Liu (T63 L31) who said that the voice attributed to Peter was that of Zoran (T63 L33 - T64 L10).  The recording was also played to Raglione who said that the voices were those of Zoran and Poliopoulos (T86 L38-42).  
35There were a number of other recordings between Poliopoulos and Peter.  It was the Crown case that in each of those conversations the person nominated as Peter was in fact the applicant.  
36At 1:14am on 15 June 2011, Poliopoulos (using the 826 phone) telephoned the 220 phone and spoke with Peter.  They discussed a white envelope and whether it contained any money, and again discussed the two bags and their weight. Later in the conversation, Peter said ""my car will be inside Holden...at Rosebery"" early the following day (AB 179).  As noted at [31] there was evidence that the Caprice was serviced at Suttons on 16 June 2011, which was the day following this conversation (AB 391).
37At 9:26am on 15 June 2011, Poliopoulos called the UCO on the 826 phone (AB 183).  A short time later they met outside Poliopoulos' home before entering the garage where Poliopoulos gave the UCO 3.31 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $1,500.00 in cash.
38At 6:37pm SMS messages were exchanged between the 826 phone and the 220 phone, in which Poliopoulos informed Peter that he had ""some papers"" for him.  Peter responded by asking how long Poliopoulos would be, explaining that he had ""waited all day .... office"" (AB 185-187).  At 6:44pm Poliopoulos (using the 826 phone) telephoned the 888 phone and spoke to Peter (AB 188-191).   Because of difficulties with the reception Poliopoulos called again at 6:46pm and told Peter that he ""had the money"" and would ""come by and give (him) that"".  Peter replied by telling Poliopoulos that he was ""in the office"" (AB195).  
39At 6:53pm Poliopoulos (using the 826 phone) called again and spoke with Peter.  They discussed leaving something in an envelope, the applicant suggesting that it be left ""with the, the lady.. .whoever's at reception"" (AB 198-199).
Count 240At 10:55am on 16 June 2011, the UCO telephoned Poliopoulos and arranged to purchase a further quantity of methylamphetamine (AB 217-226).
41At 2:58am on 17 June 2011, the UCO received a SMS from mobile telephone number 0450634556 (the 556 phone) in which Poliopoulos advised that he had a ""new number"".  42During the late morning of 17 June 2011, Poliopoulos sent a number of SMS messages to the 220 phone and the 826 phone attempting to make arrangements to meet with Peter.  Responses were received from the 220 phone from ""Cindy"" (a person who was otherwise unidentified) advising Poliopoulos that Peter was asleep (AB 227-231).
43Poliopoulos then called the UCO advising that he did not have the drugs and asking the UCO to meet with him so that they could travel to Surry Hills and collect them.  The UCO collected Poliopoulos from his home at approximately 12:20pm on 17 June 2011. They arrived at Thai City at approximately 12:55pm.  Poliopoulos entered the premises but returned soon afterwards, telling the UCO that his ""associate"" was not there and that he did not have the drugs.  
44At 2:04pm, a message was sent from the 888 phone to the 826 phone stating:
""Sorry mate i just wake"".
45At 2:14pm Poliopoulos (using the 826 phone) telephoned the 673 phone and spoke with Peter.  Peter told Poliopoulos that he was ""in the city"".  Poliopoulos responded by saying that they ""went looking but couldn't find (him)"".  Poliopoulos then telephoned the UCO and organised to meet him at Ultimo.  
46At 2:19pm Poliopoulos (using the 826 phone) called the 673 phone.  He spoke with Peter and they arranged to meet (at Peter's suggestion) at ""the office"" (AB 238-240).  The UCO and Poliopoulos then met and drove together to the Thai City premises. Upon their arrival, the UCO gave Poliopoulos $4,500.00 in cash which Poliopoulos took with him into the premises.  A short time later Poliopoulos returned and handed the UCO 10.5g of methylamphetamine.   

Count 347On 21 June 2011, the UCO contacted Poliopoulos and requested the supply of a further quantity of methylamphetamine.  Poliopoulos then contacted Peter by SMS message and made arrangements to meet with him.  
48At 12:05pm on 22 June 2011, the UCO received an SMS message from the 556 phone advising that it was ""all good for Friday"".  
49At 1:35pm on 23 June 2011, the UCO sent an SMS to the 556 phone seeking to confirm the arrangements.  A response was received from the 556 phone advising that it would be necessary to ""meet at my place"".  
50On the afternoon of 23 June 2011 a series of SMS messages passed between the 826 phone and the 220 phone in which Poliopoulos and Peter made arrangements to meet.  At 6:02pm Poliopoulos used the 826 phone to call Peter on the 888 phone.  Poliopoulos told Peter that he was ""almost there"" and that he wouldn't ""be long"".  At approximately 6:25pm Poliopoulos entered Thai City and left at approximately 6:40pm.  On both occasions he carried a backpack.  
51On the morning of the following day, 24 June 2011, the UCO and Poliopoulos arranged to meet.  The UCO arrived at Poliopoulos' residence at 11:10am and went inside.  He handed Poliopoulos an envelope which contained $10,500.00 in cash, in return for which Poliopoulos gave the UCO 28.1g of methylamphetamine.  
The defence case52I have already noted aspects of the evidence given by the three witnesses who were called in the defence case.  
53Also tendered in the defence case was part of the transcript of the sentence proceedings of Poliopoulos (at AB 11 and following).  It was evident from that transcript that a statement of agreed facts had been tendered following Poliopoulos entering a plea of guilty to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis.  That statement of facts included references to ""Peter Lazaris"" as the person responsible for supplying Poliopoulos with amounts of methylamphetamine, which were then supplied to the UCO (at AB 21).  
54Notwithstanding the agreed facts, Poliopoulos asserted when giving evidence at his sentence proceedings (commencing at AB 47) that the methylamphetamine he supplied to the UCO had been provided to him ""by a person called Zoron who went by the name of alias as Peter"" and that Peter and Zoran were the same person (commencing at AB 21 L15).   The existence of Zoran was not pursued in cross-examination.  In light of the plea of guilty, it was not an issue in the sentence proceedings.  
Her Honour's reasons55There was no dispute before her Honour that Poliopoulos had supplied the UCO with methylamphetamine on the three occasions in question, nor was there any dispute that Poliopoulos had obtained that methylamphetamine from a person who had identified himself as ""Pete"" or ""Peter"".  Against that background, her Honour identified (at ROS 2-3 and again at ROS 11) the principal issue in the trial as being whether the Crown had established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person Peter was in fact the applicant.  
56Ultimately, having undertaken (commencing at ROS 17) a lengthy review of the evidence, her Honour (commencing at ROS 32) made reference to 14 separate circumstances established by the evidence.  She concluded that when taken together, those circumstances were capable of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person Peter was in fact the applicant.  In reaching her conclusions, her Honour rejected the evidence of the applicant's wife, Liu and Raglione as to the identification of the voices in the recorded conversation of 15 June 2011.  
57The circumstances which were identified by her Honour as being capable of establishing the applicant's guilty were as follows (commencing at ROS 32):
(i)Poliopoulos obtained the methylamphetamine from a man called Peter and then supplied it to the UCO;(ii)the same person supplied Poliopoulos on each occasion;(iii)the person referred to as ""Pete"" or ""Peter"" in the communications was the same person, irrespective of what particular telephone service was being used;(iv)the applicant had access to each of the 673, 888 and 220 phones;(v)the applicant worked at Thai City on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, which corresponded with two of the days (17 and 23 June) on which Poliopoulos attended Thai City to obtain quantities of methylamphetamine which were then supplied to the UCO;(vi)the applicant spoke Greek, and the recorded conversations between Peter and Poliopoulos were partly in Greek;(vii)Peter referred to himself as ""the boss"";(viii)Peter referred to being in the ""office"", which was to be construed as a reference to the Thai City premises;(ix)Peter had referred to his car being serviced, in circumstances where the Caprice, which was owned by Acapulco, had been serviced at the relevant time;(x)the applicant lived in the same suburb as Poliopoulos and Poliopoulos had referred, in a conversation with the UCO, to his supplier living around the corner from him and going home to his wife;(xi)Poliopoulos had also referred, when speaking with the UCO, to his supplier previously operating a Touch of Class;(xii)it was implausible that the applicant's wife would not have seen or met Zoran, given that she worked at Thai City several days each week;(xiii)various contact entries in Poliopoulos' phone referred to Pete connected with Thai City; and(xiv)Liu's evidence that she directed Zoran to take the Caprice to be serviced on the morning of 16 June 2011 should not be accepted.
58It should be noted that the matters in (x) and (xi) above are the subject of ground 2.
Ground 1 The verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1 to 3 were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidenceSubmissions of the applicant59In support of this ground, counsel for the applicant before this Court relied upon the written submissions previously filed by trial counsel.  The fundamental proposition advanced in those written submissions was that the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown at trial was insufficient to exclude a rational hypothesis consistent with the applicant's innocence.  That hypothesis was expressed in the following terms:
""... that the person Peter whose voice is recorded in the recorded conversations is not that of the Appellant (sic) but is the voice of the man named Zoran who used the alias Peter"".  
60In advancing that proposition, the written submissions canvassed each of the individual circumstances relied upon by her Honour, and sought to advance, in each case, a competing inference.  The competing inferences, and the propositions advanced, included the following:
(i)the role of the driver at Thai City fell to Zoran who was the ""boss"" of the employees of Thai City and had access to the 220 etc phones;(ii)Zoran used the alias Peter when speaking on the telephone;(iii)the fact that the 220 phone could be traced directly to the applicant, along with the fact that the 673 phone could be traced indirectly to him, was inconsistent with the activities of a drug dealer who would be expected to disguise his tracks;(iv)Zoran also spoke Greek;(v)there was no established motive for Raglione to give evidence which was untruthful;(vi)Poliopoulos gave evidence on his sentence proceedings that he had been supplied by Zoran;(vii)no drug related material was found when the applicant's premises were searched by police.  
61It will be apparent that the approach taken in the written submissions, at least in part, incorporated what was effectively an attempt to explain away every individual circumstance relied upon by the Crown. That approach is, in my view, an erroneous one.  In Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Fullerton and Garling JJ) made reference (at [466]) to the necessity to consider a circumstantial case holistically, and said:
""Tortuous reasoning in order to explain away every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence should not be engaged in: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA).""
Submissions of the Crown62The Crown submitted that her Honour's decision to reject the evidence of the applicant's wife, Liu and Raglione was soundly based, as was her decision to afford little weight to the evidence given by Poliopoulos in his sentence proceedings concerning the existence of the person Zoran.    
63The Crown submitted that when the evidence was viewed overall, it established a strong circumstantial case against the applicant.  It was submitted that the hypothesis advanced on behalf of the applicant, apart from being based upon an erroneous approach, was not reasonable because it (inter alia):
(i)ignored, or was not consistent with available documentary evidence;(ii)relied upon the evidence of Liu who was not credible; and(iii)was advanced in the absence of any truly independent evidence of the existence of Zoran.
Consideration and conclusion64In considering this ground, this Court must undertake its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence.  In M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487, the task of the court was expressed in this way (at 493):
""Where, notwithstanding as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, the Court of Criminal Appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.""
65These principles were recently reaffirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400.  Further, in order for a verdict to be unreasonable, it is not enough that a review of the evidence demonstrates that it was possible for tribunal of fact to reach a different conclusion: Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113] per Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing.
66These principles apply equally to an appeal following a trial before a judge sitting without a jury:  W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [151] per Bathurst CJ (Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing). 
67As I have previously outlined, the case against the applicant was a circumstantial one.  In Gilham (supra) this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Fullerton and Garling JJ) said (at [466]):
""The case against the applicant is a circumstantial one. As McClellan CJ at CL discussed in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [50]-[53], where a case is circumstantial ""the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused"": quoting Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ), citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252..""
68However, the Court went onto say (at [466]):
""However, a circumstantial case must be considered holistically. The court must weigh and consider the totality of the admissible evidence before reaching a conclusion, on the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of guilt or, in the alternative, that a doubt persists such that it would be dangerous to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ).""
69In my view, for a number of reasons, the totality of the evidence established a strong circumstantial case against the applicant.  There is no basis upon which to conclude that it would be dangerous to allow the verdict to stand.  
70There was no evidence, other than that of Liu and Raglione, of Zoran's existence.  In my view, and having had the benefit of seeing and hearing each of them give evidence, it was well open to her Honour to reject their evidence (as well as that of the applicant's wife) that it was not the applicant who was speaking to Poliopoulos in the conversation of 15 June 2011.  
71Liu's evidence was unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  She initially gave evidence that Zoran was employed as a ""driver"" and ""night manager"" (T59 L32).  She then described him (T60 L49) as ""the boss for the working girls"", a curious description given that her earlier evidence (T54 L23) was that she was the manager at Thai City. She later described Zoran (T67 L6) as ""an all rounder"" before describing him (T66 L41) as the ""night manager"" and (T67 L21) as the ""security manager"".  Notwithstanding these various positions of responsibility which Zoran is said to have held at Thai City, Liu's evidence was that she could not remember his surname (T70 L23).72Liu also maintained that Zoran used the name, and was generally known as, Peter (T61 L17).  This was explained on the basis that ""no one at Thai City uses their real name"" (T61 L18).  Leaving aside the fact that Liu did not suggest that she was known by some other name, the inherent implausibility of her evidence in this regard is best demonstrated by her response to being asked about what would occur in the event that someone called Thai City asking for ""Peter"" (T61 L22 and following):
""... there was some moments that someone is calling the phone and when this particular person calls the phone the business phone they were looking for Peter.  If Peter is not Peter the man sitting here if he's not around I will tell the people on the phone, I said he's not here and then - and then at the moment also that if he's around, if Peter Lazaris is around, and then I get a phone call looking for Peter I will pass the phone to him and as I pass the phone to him he will tell me that no, this person on the other line is not after him and after Peter told me that it's not him straight away Zoran will come on the phone and said, That's for me"".   
73Liu also gave evidence about the hours which Zoran worked (commencing at T65 L6).  She said (inter alia) that he would arrive at around lunchtime or earlier (T65 L29) but ""only for a short time"" (T65 L46) which she later clarified was ""about four hours"" (T66 L21).  Such evidence would seem somewhat inconsistent with the level of attendance which might be expected from a ""security manager"", much less a ""night manager"".    
74It is also significant that according to Liu, there were occasions on which the applicant's wife was at Thai City at the same time as Zoran.  The applicant's wife gave no evidence of knowing any such person.  Her evidence was limited to the fact that ""there was a driver"" (T32 L48).    
75Liu also attempted to minimise the applicant's role at Thai City.  Her description of him as essentially a ""maintenance man"" (T55 L41-46) was completely inconsistent with (inter alia) the evidence of his purchase of the Caprice, as well as other evidence from which an inference was available that he involved himself in aspects of the management of the business such as arranging accommodation for employees (AB 338) and arranging advertising (AB 340-341). 
76Like Liu, the applicant's wife also sought to downplay the role of the applicant at Thai City, describing him (T34 L34-36) as ""just the handyman"" .. who ""did the paper work as well"".  For the reasons already expressed, such a description is inconsistent with other evidence of the applicant's role in the business.  For obvious reasons, the applicant's wife had a motive to be untruthful in her evidence.
77Raglione's evidence was that he was employed by Zoran as a driver at Thai City, but that he had also spoken to Liu about the position (T83 L1-5).  Liu gave no evidence of ever having met Raglione, nor did she give any evidence about any driver other than Zoran.
78According to Raglione he had been a friend of Poliopoulos for 40 years.  They had lived together for some period.  As previously noted, Poliopoulos gave evidence at his sentence proceedings that he was supplied the three quantities of methylamphetamine by a person called Zoran.  Notwithstanding the obvious connection between himself, Poliopoulos and Zoran, Raglione claimed (T87 L20-22) that he was not aware of how it was that Poliopoulos and Zoran met.  That evidence was, in my view, wholly implausible.     
79As the Crown pointed out in its submissions, the remaining evidence established that the person referred to as Peter whose voice was heard in the various recorded conversations:
(i)worked at Thai City;(ii)referred to the Thai City premises as ""the office"";(iii)told Poliopoulos when speaking to him on 15 June 2011 that he was taking ""his car"" to be serviced on the following day;(iv)provided quantities of methylamphetamine at the Thai City premises on Friday 17 June and Thursday 23 June;(v)used the 220, 888 and 673 phones to speak with Poliopoulos regarding the supply of prohibited drugs;(vi)spoke Greek.
80There is evidence that the applicant:  
(i)was named Peter;(ii)not only worked at Thai City, but owned it, along with the premises from which it operated; (iii)was involved in various aspects of the conduct of the business of Thai City;(iv)attended the Thai City premises each Thursday, Friday and Saturday;(v)was the nominated subscriber of the 220 phone;(vi)had access to the 888 and 673 phones;(vii)owned, through Acapulco, the Caprice which was serviced at Suttons on 16 June 2011, that being consistent with the reference made in the conversation with Poliopoulos on 15 June 2011;(viii)spoke Greek.
81In my view all of these circumstances, along with those to which her Honour referred, were more than sufficient to exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the applicant's innocence.
82Ground 1 should be dismissed.
Ground 2A miscarriage arose as a result of her Honour taking into account the truth of the following representations, notwithstanding that those representations were hearsay, and thus inadmissible to prove the truth of the contents:""Peter"" is or was living around the corner from (Poliopoulos);""Peter"" was married; and""Peter"" previously operated an establishment called Touch of Class.The evidence83On 17 June 2011 a conversation was recorded between Poliopoulos and the UCO which included the following (AB 263):
""Poliopoulos: ""Cause, I put it away here last night. He said to me I'll take it in the car and I'm going home to my wife tonight.UCO: Yeah.Poliopoulos: He lives around the corner from me. You understand?UCO: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.""
84On 17 June 2011 a further conversation was recorded between Poliopoulos and the UCO which included the following (AB 271-272):
""Poliopoulos: Your (sic) not going past Sydenham or Marrickville?UCO: Nar. I'm going that way.Poliopoulos: Alright.UCO: Sorry. A bit of a rush. How long have you had that? That place?Poliopoulos: Um. I've had it for about nine months.UCO: Nine months.Poliopoulos: Since I've been back. He use (sic) to run the touch of class. My partner.
85The highlighted passages in each case are those relevant to this ground.
Her Honour's reasons86In respect of the first conversation, her Honour concluded (at ROS 26):
""The evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused Peter Lazaras' (sic) home was at .... Kingsgrove, Steve lived at ...  Kingsgrove. Those addresses are close to one another in that they are in the same suburb. The evidence further establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had a wife. The evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the arrangement Steve had with the undercover was that the undercover was to collect the methylamphetamine from Steve's home address that day around noon. The evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that this was not able to occur because the person Peter had not attended Steve's home to provide him with the methylamphetamine for the on supply to the undercover.""
87In respect of the second conversation her Honour concluded (at ROS 27):
""In this recording Steve refers to his partner and says he used to run the Touch of Class (at page 7). I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what Steve was referring to here was his partner in the drug supply business and significantly he identifies that person as previously running Touch of Class. The evidence before me establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused previously ran a Touch of Class.""Submissions of the applicant88The applicant submitted that although the statements in question were hearsay and thus inadmissible to prove the truth of their contents, her Honour had used their truth to support her conclusion that the Crown had established its case.  It was submitted, by reference to particular passages of her Honour's reasons, that her Honour had placed considerable significance on this evidence in reaching her conclusions.
89 Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that no objection had been taken to the evidence when it was tendered.  However, he pointed out that it had not been submitted by the Crown at trial that the evidence should be used in the way in which her Honour did.  
90Counsel also relied upon the fact that her Honour did not indicate that she intended to use the evidence in that way.  It was submitted that had her Honour so indicated, counsel for the applicant would have been in position to deal with the issue, and make submissions as to how the evidence could be used.  
Submissions of the Crown91The Crown submitted that because the issue raised by this ground was not raised at the trial, the applicant required leave pursuant to r. 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  The Crown also submitted that the evidence was, in any event, admissible on one of two bases.  
92Firstly, the Crown submitted that the evidence was admissible on the basis that the statements in question were made by Poliopoulos in furtherance of a joint criminal enterprise between he and the applicant to supply drugs.  I should say immediately that I am unable to accept that submission.  In order for evidence to be admissible on that basis, the relevant statement(s) must be made in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise, as opposed to being in the nature of a narrative of some fact or event:  R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 461.  In my view, each of the statements in question clearly fell into the latter category.    
93Alternatively, it was submitted that had objection been taken it would have been open to the Crown to rely upon s. 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 NSW (""the Act"") in support of the admissibility of the evidence.  
Consideration and conclusion94Because no issue was raised at trial concerning the evidence which is the subject of this ground, leave is required having regard to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  The principles governing a grant of leave under that rule are well established:  Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297; ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148] per Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ agreeing.  
95For the reasons set out below, I would refuse leave to rely on this ground.     96Section 59 of the Act is in the following terms:
59 The hearsay rule--exclusion of hearsay evidence (1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation
97The statements in question were clearly hearsay.  However, the words ""not admissible"" in s. 59(1) mean ""not admissible over objection"": Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 32; (2007) 178 A Crim R 321 at [22] per Giles JA, Howie and Fullerton JJ agreeing.  In the present case, no objection was taken to the evidence when it was tendered, and counsel for the applicant before this Court made it clear that he did not wish to amend the grounds of appeal to assert incompetence of trial counsel on the basis of the failure to object to the evidence.    
98Further, in light of the other evidence which was available for her Honour to consider, this was not a case where the admission of the evidence gave rise to a manifest danger of unfair prejudice.  Accordingly, this was not a case where there was any obligation on the trial judge to reject the evidence of her own motion:  Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 at [39]-[50] per Macfarlan JA, Adamson and Bellew JJ agreeing.  
99In any event, even if objection had been taken, it would have been open to the Crown to call the UCO to give evidence of the relevant conversations with Poliopoulos.  In that event, the statements in question (all of which were made by Poliopoulos) would have been admissible pursuant to s. 65(2)(c) of the Act which creates an exception to the hearsay rule which is in the following terms:
65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available 
This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.
(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: (a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or(d) was: (i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.
100Bearing in mind the provisions of s. 65(2)(c):
(i)Poliopoulos was the person who made the representations and was not available (s. 65(1));(ii)the UCO heard the representations, and was thus in a position to give evidence of them (s. 65(2)); and (iii)the representations were made in circumstances which made it highly probable that they were reliable (s. 65(2)(c)).  
101Finally, even if it were concluded that the evidence was wrongly admitted and ought not to have been considered by her Honour, I am not satisfied in the circumstances that any miscarriage of justice arose which resulting in the applicant losing a real chance of acquittal.  
102When the reasons of the trial judge are read as a whole, it is evident that her Honour did not ascribe the degree of primacy to the evidence which counsel for the applicant suggested was the case.  The evidence formed what was a relatively small part of a far greater circumstantial case, which was considered by her Honour in some considerable detail.  
103Even in the absence of the evidence which is the subject of this ground, there remained a considerable body of evidence which, in my view, was sufficient to exclude any reasonable alternative hypothesis, and thus establish the applicant's guilt.  In particular, the evidence which is the subject of this ground does not bear on my analysis in [79]-[80] above.
ORDERS104The applicant spent a short period in custody between being arrested and granted bail in respect of the charges which are the subject of this appeal.  The applicant was sentenced as set out in [5] above and was taken into custody on 16 August 2013.  Her Honour expressly had regard to the earlier period of custody 
105The applicant was then released on bail on 17 December 2013 pending his appeal, and he has remained on bail since that time.  It follows that between 16 August 2013 and 17 December 2013, the applicant served 4 months and 1 day of the non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months which was imposed. That must be reflected in the orders of this Court.
106In these circumstances I propose the following orders:
(i)Leave to rely upon ground 2 is refused.
(ii)Leave to appeal on ground 1 is granted.
(iii)The appeal is dismissed.
(iv)The applicant is to be returned to custody forthwith.
(v)Having regard to the period of custody served by the applicant between 16 August 2013 and 17 December 2013 the applicant's non-parole period will expire on 17 December 2015.  
(vi)He will be eligible for parole on 18 December 2015 and his sentence will expire on 17 February 2017.

2764601,R v Garnett; R v Goodfellow [2014] NSWDC 355,"SENTENCE

MAXWELL DEREK GARNETT


	
	On 12 February 2014, Maxwell Derek Garnett was committed for sentence following a plea of guilty to one offence. That offence is as follows: that he, on 4 May 2013, at Hazelbrook in the State of New South Wales, did rob employee Sharon Snelling of certain property, to wit, $10,070 in assorted Australian currency the property of Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club, whilst being then armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a shortened .22 calibre pump action Winchester rifle.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). A maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years is prescribed.
	
	
	I convict Mr Garnett of this offence.
	


PLEA OF GUILTY


	
	The plea was entered in the Local Court and the prisoner is entitled to a 25 percent reduction for utilitarian considerations only.
	
	
	In addition, I am of the view he is entitled to the mitigating factor of remorse found in s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). I am satisfied of both limbs.
	
	
	I find this because of what is in the psychiatric report at p 3 [5] and p 6 [5], in his affidavit dated 12 July 2014 at [7] and [9], and some comments in the pre-sentence report and his mother’s evidence on 14 July 2014, transcript p 33 line 33 ff.
	


FACTS


	
	The factual context of the offence is found in a statement of agreed facts which is follows:
	


“Robbery whilst armed - 4 May 2013

About 6.00am on Saturday 4 May 2013, the offender, Garnett, and the co-accused, Goodfellow, attended the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club.

Garnett and Goodfellow were recorded on closed circuit television (CCTV) footage to loiter in the car park area before continuing through the car park and out of view.

At about 7.00am that morning, the greens keeper, Les Brett, arrived at the location. A short time later, Goodfellow approached Brett whilst wearing a blue and black coloured balaclava and armed with a sawn off pump action rifle. He forced Brett to unlock the front doors to the club. Goodfellow threatened to shoot Brett if he did not comply. Around that time, Garnett emerged from shrubs which surround the car park and walked to the front doors of the club whilst wearing a black coloured balaclava.

Goodfellow then removed the green coloured ‘Turf Care’ brand baseball cap which Brett had been wearing and put it on his own head.

Goodfellow directed Brett to the office area. Once inside, Goodfellow removed the cap and put a balaclava on.

At that time Garnett had entered the club. He was armed with a yellow coloured axe. Goodfellow was wearing a black and blue coloured balaclava, a maroon and blue coloured wind jacket with the word ‘Glorious’ written across the back in white writing, grey tracksuit pants with two white stripes running down each leg, beige coloured gloves and white coloured sneakers with blue accents.

Garnett was wearing a black coloured balaclava, a blue chequered flannelette shirt, dark coloured jacket, grey tracksuit pants with three white stripes running down each leg, black and blue coloured gloves and white coloured ‘Adidas’ sneakers.

A number of these items of clothing were later recovered by police in bushland at Warragamba. Police also located a number of other exhibits including the CCTV footage from the Hazelbrook Bowling Club.

Whilst in the office area, Goodfellow demanded Brett open the safe. Brett stated that he was unable to access the safe as he did not have the key. Goodfellow asked how long it would be before someone with keys to the safe arrived, to which Brett replied that it would not be until 11.00am.

Brett was told to wait in the bar area while both offenders searched through the club for cash. Goodfellow emptied a garbage bin and proceeded to place items which he had stolen from the club inside it.

At about 8.00am, Goodfellow escorted Brett from the club to the car park area where he directed Brett to drive his white coloured Toyota Prado four wheel drive to the loading dock area of the club. Goodfellow then forced Brett back inside the club where they waited for the other employees to arrive.

At about 8.29am, Goodfellow walked to the bar area and removed cans of ‘Coke’. He handed one to Garnett and also to Brett. Goodfellow and Garnett are recorded on CCTV drinking from the cans.

Throughout the proceeding two hours, Goodfellow and Garnett are seen to remove what appears to be mobile telephones from their pockets and look at the screen. Goodfellow is also seen to spray a cleaning liquid over items that he or Garnett had previously touched, including the cash register and safe area.

At about 11.05am, several other employees attended the club and were confronted by the two offenders. All of the victims, except Sharon Snelling, were forced to crawl to the poker machine area where they were told to lie down on the floor where Garnett stood guard over them with the yellow axe.

Snelling was forced by Goodfellow to open the safe located within the office area. Brett and Snelling were directed by Goodfellow to place the money into a silver metal bin. $5,000 was removed from the safe. Snelling was visibly upset during this time, crying openly.

Goodfellow directed Brett to take the silver metal bin and a crate full of poker machine note acceptors to the back door area. Goodfellow also directed Snelling to open the Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) located within the club. Snelling was forced to remove the cash canisters and hand them to Goodfellow. $5,000 was removed from the ATM.

At about 11.20am, Goodfellow removed the CCTV hard drive from the office area, causing no further recording of the movements within the club. Goodfellow directed Brett to assist him to carry all of the cash and other items stolen from the club to Brett’s Toyota Prado. Once all the items were loaded into the vehicle, Goodfellow and Garnett drove from the area in Brett’s Toyota Prado and continued out of sight.

At 11.28am, Brett telephoned the police and reported the incident. Police arrived and the area was secured for a subsequent crime scene examination. All witnesses were interviewed and a description of the offender was obtained.

At about 6.30pm that evening, Brett’s stolen Toyota Prado four wheel drive was located parked and unattended in Clearview Parade, Hazelbrook, by member of Brett’s family, who had been driving through the streets in Hazelbrook looking for the vehicle. They reported finding the vehicle to police, who arrived and secured the vehicle for subsequent forensic examination.

Identification of Goodfellow and Garnett

The first offender, Goodfellow, is described as having a tattoo on his neck, being similar in shape to two ‘half moons’ or a ‘wreath’ by the victims. CCTV footage also depicts a similar shaped tattoo on the neck of the first offender, as the balaclava he was wearing rode up his neck slightly. Police charge photographs of Goodfellow taken on 25 April 2012 depict a tattoo on both the left and right side of his neck. The tattoos are words which resemble a wreath shape as described by Brett.

Goodfellow was released from Corrective Services custody on 23 April 2013 after serving a 12 month imprisonment for unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. On 24 April 2013, Goodfellow connected telecommunication service ending in 067 which is one day after he was released from prison. This mobile service is turned off the day before the offence and only turned on at 17:53 the afternoon of the offence, in the Vincentia area.

The second offender, Garnett, is recorded on police holdings as being 160-170 centimetres tall and between 60-70 kilograms with a medium build and blue eyes. Garnett fits the general height and build of the second offender.

Garnett is subject to a current parole order in which he provided his contact phone number ending in 578. This mobile service is turned off at 08:18 the morning of the offence and turned on again at 11:53 that morning. When this mobile service is turned on at 11:53, it indicates that the mobile service was in the Springwood area. The mobile service is then tracked via cell site locations to the Springwood, Glossodia, North Richmond, Warragamba and Wallacia areas before travelling back to the South Coast where it is in the South Nowra area at 17:49. Police allege that Garnett was in possession of this mobile service during the day of the offence. This is supported by CCTV footage.

Recovery of exhibits

On 9 May 2013, a member of the public located property stolen from the robbery at a fire trail off Farnsworth Avenue, Warragamba. Located items include 14 cash boxes, a metal bucket the offender placed the ATM cash canisters in, a grey plastic crate used by the offenders, the CCTV hard drive from the club, a blue cash tin from the club, items of clothing matching that worn by offender two during the robbery, that being grey tracksuit pants with white stripes down one side, flannelette shirt and grey jacket. Clothing matching that worn by the male, being a purple jacket and grey track pants, along with two balaclavas, was also located. Amongst these items were two receipts which were located by crime scene examiners.

Purchase of fuel after the offence

One receipt was for a purchase of petrol at 12.01pm on 4 May 2013 at Prime Fuel, 281 Hawkesbury Road, Winmalee, for motor vehicle BS42YV (white coloured Holden Commodore station wagon). Police subsequently reviewed CCTV footage from the Prime Fuel Service Station for that specific time, and it depicted Garnett attending the counter area and paying for the fuel. The CCTV footage also depicts a second male standing beside vehicle BS42YV. That male strongly resembles Goodfellow. Prime Fuel at Winmalee is 17.9 kilometres east of the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club. The fuel purchase took place approximately 30 minutes after the offenders left the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club.

The second receipt was for an Optus mobile telephone recharge voucher for $10, which was purchased about 2.20am on 3 May 2013 at the Mobil Service Station, Bomaderry. Police have reviewed the CCTV footage from that date and time and it depicts Garnett purchasing the recharge voucher.

Vehicle BS42YV

Vehicle BS42YV is registered to Martina Lee Craig of xx Way, Nowra. Craig is a known associate of Goodfellow and is currently in a relationship with Garnett.

On 2 May 2013, police spoke with Craig at her current residence, xx Street, Vincentia. Also present at the location was Goodfellow and Damien Pratt. Vehicle BS42YV was parked at the residence.

On 3 May 2013, Garnett was stopped by police for a traffic offence in vehicle BS42YV at Railway Street, Bomaderry. Damien Pratt was with [her] at the time.

Forensic examination of exhibits seized

A subsequent forensic examination of a number of exhibits were conducted, including:

Blue glove: DNA profile recovered - Paul Goodfellow

Black glove: DNA profile recovered - Paul Goodfellow

Black and blue balaclava: DNA profile recovered - Paul Goodfellow

White running shoe: DNA profile recovered - Paul Goodfellow

Green ‘Turf Care’ baseball cap: DNA profile recovered - Paul Goodfellow

‘Coke’ can: DNA profile recovered - the DNA recovered is a mixture that originates from at least three individuals. The major component of this mixture has the same DNA profile as Maxwell Garnett.

Black beanie with eyeholes: DNA profile recovered - Maxwell Garnett

Flannelette shirt: DNA profile recovered - the major component of this mixture has the same DNA profile as Maxwell Garnett

Mouth rim of ‘Jack Daniels’ can: DNA profile recovered - Maxwell Garnett

The abovementioned exhibits were seized from the crime scene and also from bushland at Warragamba.

Arrest of Goodfellow and Garnett

Maxwell Garnett, the offender, resides with Paul Goodfellow, the co-accused, at xx Street, Vincentia.

On 6 June 2013, Goodfellow and Garnett were arrested at xx Street, Vincentia. They were conveyed to Nowra Police Station where they were interviewed and then charged with the matters now before the Court.

A search warrant was also executed at xx Street, Vincentia. A number of items were seized, including a sawn off pump action .22 calibre rifle which was located in the granny flat under a mattress. Goodfellow’s wallet was also located on a table in that room. Police allege that this firearm is the weapon used in the armed robbery at the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sports Club on 4 May 2013.”

OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE AND THE HENRY GUIDELINE JUDGMENT


	
	From a recitation of the facts, it is clear this offence, being the s 97(2) offence, is objectively very serious: Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [25]-[27] (Hoeben CJ at CL). Put another way, it is a very serious example or a very serious instance of the behaviour made criminal by s 97(2): R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27]-[33] (Simpson J).
	
	
	The parties made submissions as to where the offence fell in a range of objective gravity.
	
	
	Defence counsel submitted the offence falls within the lower end of the middle range.
	
	
	The Crown submitted the offence fell within the upper level or upper end (see transcript 14 July 2014 p 62 line 36 ff and p 66 line 6 ff, 15 July 2014 p 29 line 43 ff, and 18 July 2014 p 31 line 11 ff).
	
	
	Before I consider their submissions, it is important to note the Crown does not rely on the taking of the motor vehicle of Mr Brett in relation to this prisoner, or his being in the vehicle. His criminality ceases when the armed robbery is complete and they leave the club. I put that completely to one side in relation to this prisoner.
	
	
	By way of comparison with the co-offender, Mr Goodfellow, he has this offence contrary to s 154C(2) being on a Form. Mr Goodfellow, on the other hand, does not have the detaining of Mr Brett as part of the s 97(2) offence. Mr Givorshner emphasised the shortened rifle was not discharged, there is no evidence it was loaded, no gratuitous application of violence, nobody physically hurt, no tying up and no substantial planning.
	
	
	The Crown compared the present case to the Henry guideline. This is of course not a s 97(1) offence, rather a s 97(2). But as noted in Hamze v R [2006] NSWCCA 36, s 97(2) builds on s 97(1). The Crown also emphasised the length of time the offence took.
	
	
	I accept what defence counsel say as to the absence of those features.
	
	
	As against that, the offence was committed in company and that is not an element of the offence charged: Hamze at [37] (Giles JA). This is a feature of aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Turning then to the Henry guideline, the prisoner cannot be described as young. He was born on 3 July 1985. He is now aged 29 years and one and a half months. He was aged 27 years and 10 months at the time of the offence. Nor could it be said he has no or little criminal history.
	
	
	Reference has just been made to the prisoner’s record in relation to factor (i) in Henry: “young offender with no or little criminal history”.
	
	
	I wish to make it quite clear that I have not taken into account the prisoner’s record in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence: R v McNaughton (2006) NSWLR 566; 163 A Crim R 381. The reference to it at this point in the remarks is only in respect of the comparison of the present case with the guideline.
	
	
	The offence involved more than a limited degree of planning as stated in Henry. There was, in my view, considerable planning. Certainly in this respect, the present offence is more serious than an offence of the character identified in the guideline. Although I do not, nor did the Crown, elevate this to a feature of aggravation under s 21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	A balaclava and gloves were used. Each turned off their mobile phones. They sprayed cleaning liquid over touched items. A different vehicle, one with a connection to the offenders, was used to get the offenders from the South Coast to the Blue Mountains and back again. That vehicle was not at the club and accordingly not driven from the club. They travelled a considerable distance to the location. The offence was certainly not opportunistic or spur of the moment. The CCTV hard drive was removed. Other items were taken, as noted in the facts, and dumped a considerable distance away. Clothing was abandoned.
	
	
	As against that, defence note the DNA of Mr Garnett was the major component of a mixture of DNA which originates from at least three individuals found on a can of Coke. This demonstrates, the defence say, a lack of professionalism. Also, the items left at the fire trailer were not destroyed, only dumped.
	
	
	The armed robbery lasted for in the order of four hours to four hours and 20 minutes, from 7.00am to about 11.20am.
	
	
	Mr Brett was detained in the course of the robbery and subject to the robbers the whole time.
	
	
	The victim noted in the charge is Ms Snelling. She only arrived at 11.05am and therefore was only subjected to detention and the armed robbery for in the order of 20 minutes.
	
	
	Mr Brett was not named as a victim and the Crown stated a number of times during the submissions there was only one victim, Ms Snelling. However, others were involved in the armed robbery. Several employees, including Ms Snelling, attended the club at 11.05am. What they were told to do and had to do is noted in the facts.
	
	
	This is not an aggravating feature pursuant to s 21A(2)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts”): see Campbell. In my view though, the offence is made somewhat more serious because of others being caught up in and subject to the armed robbery.
	
	
	As to the length, the 20 minutes or so is a significant period of time. Ms Snelling is the victim noted and that is the amount of time she was subjected to the armed robbery. She was ordered to do things during this time. She was visibly upset and openly crying.
	
	
	Mr Garnett had both an axe - a frightening weapon itself - and is liable for the shortened rifle, he being part of a joint enterprise.
	
	
	Accordingly, there were two weapons utilised during the armed robbery.
	
	
	I do not consider the victim was vulnerable in the sense used in Henry.
	
	
	There was not a small amount taken.
	
	
	All of these features (putting completely to one side the criminal history) in my view place the offence in the bottom band of the upper range, which is slightly above the band that is the middle range.
	
	
	This must have been a terrifying experience for Ms Snelling.
	


DETERRENCE


	
	General deterrence must be a significant feature of this sentencing exercise. Specific deterrence has only limited importance in this case. I say this because of the prisoner’s prior record. It remains, though, a consideration.
	


PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD


	
	The prisoner’s record is not one which in my view disentitles him completely to leniency. He has nothing on his record nearly as serious as the present offence.
	
	
	He has previously been sentenced to periodic detention, although the order was revoked and he spent some time in full-time custody, and has been ordered to undertake community service. He received suspended sentences in October 2011. He was subsequently called up and sentenced, on 18 July 2012, at age 27, to an effective 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. The offending though dated back to October 2010. The 18 months commenced on 20 January 2012, expiring on 19 July 2013. He was released to parole on 19 January 2013.
	
	
	He has had short periods of being in custody bail refused. The sentence though he was still serving on parole at the time of the present matter is the first full-time custodial sentence imposed upon him.
	
	
	He was arrested on 6 June 2013 and has been in continuous custody from that date. The balance of parole concluded on 21 August 2013, being a period of two months six days. The pre-sentence report says the parole was revoked because of the present offending.
	
	
	The sentence I intend to impose will commence on 6 July 2013, allowing one month for the balance of parole.
	
	
	It is a feature of aggravation the offence was committed on parole.
	


DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS AND SUBJECTIVE MATTERS


	
	As already noted, the prisoner was born on 3 July 1985. He is now aged 29 years and one and a half months, and was aged 27 years and 10 months at the time of the offence.
	
	
	I have taken into account the following material tendered in the defence case and the pre-sentence report:
	


the pre-sentence report under the hand of Gordon Schuberg, dated 10 June 2014, part of Exhibit A;

the psychiatric report under the hand of Dr Stephen Allnutt, dated 5 June 2014, part of Exhibit 1;

affidavits sworn by the prisoner, dated 12 July 2014, and Derek Roy Garnett, dated 14 July 2014, part of Exhibit 1;

Consultation Report under the hand of Dr Toby Greenacre, Consultant Physician in Diseases of Childhood, dated 5 September 1997, part of Exhibit 1;

TAFE New South Wales certificates, all part of Exhibit 1, being Certificate III in Metal Roofing Trade, August 2004; Statement of Attainment in Responsible Service of Alcohol, December 2003; Statement of Attainment in Responsible Conduct of Gambling, December 2003; and Statement of Attainment in Course in Bonded Asbestos Removal (Construction), 17 October 2012;

Certificate of Completion of Twelve Session Alcohol and Other Drug Program ‘Getting Smart’, Goulburn Correctional Centre, November 2012, part of Exhibit 1;

letter from the Opioid Substitution Treatment Program, Drug and Alcohol Services, Justice Health, dated 8 January 2014, Exhibit 2; and

the sworn evidence of his mother.


	
	Mr Givorshner made extensive oral submissions on his client’s behalf.
	
	
	The reason for committing the offence was the debt he had accumulated to maintain his drug use. He has a long history of abusing drugs.
	
	
	He came into custody addicted to drugs and unfortunately there was a considerable delay in his being able to enter the methadone program. That delay was no fault of his.
	
	
	He has skills and has previously been a hard and talented qualified tradesman. He has two children.
	
	
	He has significant and real family support.
	
	
	In the light of R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105; 121 A Crim R 426, Bichar v R [2006] NSWCCA 1, and Thewlis v R [2008] NSWCCA 176; 186 A Crim R 279, Mr Givorshner abandoned his original argument. He did then submit the words said, “Are you all OK” (transcript p 5, 15 July 2014), I would take into account on the issue of contrition. I reject this submission.
	
	
	In my view, the matter cannot and should not be used in any way in the prisoner’s favour.
	
	
	Section 21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies to this case. It provides:
	


“In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the self-induced intoxication of the offender at the time the offence was committed is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor.”

The provision commenced on 31 January 2014 and the prisoner only pleaded guilty on 12 February 2014.


	
	Mr Givorshner submitted his client had good prospects of making something of his life. I accept that he has reasonable prospects for rehabilitation. So much will depend on his ability to control his illegal drug use and because of that I am only prepared to find reasonable prospects, rather than good prospects.
	


PARITY


	
	The prisoner’s co-offender in the s 97(2) offence also is before me for sentence. Parity principles are only relevant to a very limited extent. This is because the other offender has other charges arising out of the same armed robbery and different criminality even within the armed robbery. That is, the detention of Mr Brett does not form any part of the s 97(2) offence. On the other hand, he has the s 154C offence on the Form and the Crown does not rely upon this at all in relation to Mr Garnett. He is much older and he has an extensive criminal record for offences of armed robbery and prior firearm offences.
	
	
	In my view, neither of the prisoners has any basis for a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentences imposed on each.
	
	
	Mr Givorshner submitted, and the Crown conceded, there were special circumstances in this case. The prisoner will need assistance upon his release from custody to reintegrate back into the community and treatment in relation to his drug abuse. This treatment can be better provided in the community.
	


SENTENCE TO BE IMPOSED


	
	The Court in every case must bear in mind the maximum penalty prescribed and the particular facts and circumstances, both objective and subjective, of the case, and the requirement for general deterrence.
	
	
	The non-parole period imposed in this case is the one which in my view appropriately reflects the objective seriousness of the offending, the requirement for general deterrence, and the subjective matters.
	
	
	In my view, there are special circumstances in this case, they being those referred to in my remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The sentence I would have imposed prior to a reduction of 25 percent for utilitarian considerations only is 7 years and 3 months. That reduced by 25 percent is 5 years, 5 months, 1 week, rounded to 5 years, 5 months.
	
	
	I impose the following sentence: A non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months, commencing on 6 July 2013 and expiring on 5 September 2016. The total term is a period of 5 years and 5 months, commencing on 6 July 2013 and expiring on 5 December 2018.
	
	
	You will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on 5 September 2016.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total effective term, including the one month allowed for the balance of parole, is 5 years 6 months. The total effective non-parole period is 3 years and 3 months.
	


PAUL GOODFELLOW


	
	On 8 May 2014, Paul Goodfellow pleaded guilty to three offences in an indictment. Those offences are as follows:
	



	
	On 4 May 2013 at Hazelbrook in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of Max Garnett, detained Les Brett with the intention of committing a serious indictable offence, namely armed robbery.
	
	
	On 4 May 2013 at Hazelbrook in the State of New South Wales, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened pump action .22 calibre Winchester rifle, robbed Sharon Snelling of $10,070 in Australian currency, cash drawers and a CCTV recording device, the property of Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club.
	
	
	On 6 June 2013 at Vincentia in the State of New South Wales, possessed a prohibited firearm, namely a shortened pump action .22 calibre Winchester rifle, without being authorised to do so by a licence or permit.
	



	
	Count one is an offence contrary to s 86(2)(a) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	Count two is an offence contrary to s 97(2) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	Count three is an offence contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period of three years is prescribed.
	
	
	I convict Mr Goodfellow of each of these three offences.
	
	
	In addition, he asks that two offences on a Form 1 be taken into account in respect of count two. The first offence is one of possess means of disguising face with intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s 114(1)(c) Crimes Act: on 4 May 2013 at Hazelbrook in the State of New South Wales, had his face disguised with intent to commit the indictable offence of armed robbery. The second offence on the Form is an aggravated assault with intent to take / drive motor vehicle contrary to s 154C(2) Crimes Act: on 4 May 2013 at Hazelbrook in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of Max Garnett, assaulted Les Brett with intent to take a motor vehicle and took and drove a motor vehicle, namely a Toyota Prado four wheel drive bearing registration number LB-005 without the consent of Les Brett, the owner of the motor vehicle.
	
	
	Further, there are two related offences on the s 166 certificate, to which he has today pleaded guilty. Those offences are as follows:
	



	
	H51246825, Sequence 6, not keep firearm safe, s 39(1)(a) Firearms Act: between 11.30am and 3.30pm on 6 June 2013 at Vincentia did not take all reasonable precautions to ensure that a firearm was safely kept, the said Paul Goodfellow being the person who possessed the said firearm. The maximum penalty for this offence is two years or 50 penalty units, or both.
	
	
	H51246825, Sequence 7, possess ammunition without holding licence / permit / authority, s 65(3) Firearms Act: between 11.30am and 3.30pm on 6 June 2013 at Vincentia did possess ammunition for a firearm without holding a licence or permit for a firearm which takes that ammunition / without being authorised to possess that ammunition by a licence or permit. The maximum penalty for this offence is 50 penalty units.
	


H51246825, Sequence 9, possess shortened firearm (not pistol) without authority, s 62(1)(b) Firearms Act, is withdrawn.


	
	I convict the prisoner of each of these two offences.
	


PLEAS OF GUILTY


	
	The offences all took place on 4 May 2013. The prisoner was committed for trial in relation to counts two and three on the indictment on 27 March 2014. He pleaded guilty on arraignment in the District Court on 8 May 2014 to counts one, two and three on the indictment, count one coming forward as an ex officio indictment.
	
	
	In my view, the appropriate reduction for utilitarian considerations only in relation to counts two and three is 15 percent. In relation though to count one, it being an offence first made available to him to plead to in the District Court, the appropriate reduction is 25 percent. This was defence counsel’s submission and the Crown’s submission.
	
	
	In relation to remorse, the only reference to it is in the psychological report. He said he regretted committing the offences and he said he understood the victims would have been terrified and they could develop long-term psychological distress as a result of his action. He could not though feel empathy and this is a matter which concerns him. Section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:
	


“the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i)    the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)    the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)”.

This being a matter of mitigation, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities this is made out.


	
	The prisoner has been in custody, bail refused, since the date of his arrest, being 6 June 2013. Accordingly, the effective sentence I impose will commence from that date.
	


FACTS


	
	The factual context of the offences are found in a statement of agreed facts which is as follows:
	


“At approximately 6.00am, 4 May 2013, the accused, Paul Goodfellow, and the co-accused, Maxwell Garnett, were recorded on closed circuit television (CCTV) footage to loiter in the car park area of the Hazelbrook Bowling Club before continuing through the car park and out of view.

At about 7.00am that same morning, Les Brett, greenkeeper of the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club, was approached in the shed by the accused who was wearing a black balaclava and was pointing a sawn off rifle at him. He was told to get on the ground.

The accused is described as a large / solid guy, about five foot 10 inches to six foot with an Australian accent. He has blue eyes, was about 35 to 40 years old and was wearing a dark black / grey bomber jacket, dark Adidas type track pants, white shoes with blue trim and beige gardening gloves. He had a tattoo on his neck on the left side like a sheaf.

CCTV footage also depicts a similar shaped tattoo on the neck of the accused, as the balaclava he was wearing rode up his neck slightly. Police charge photographs of the accused taken on 25 April 2012 depict a tattoo on both the left and right side of his neck. The tattoos are words which resemble a wreath shape as described by Mr Brett.

The co-accused, Maxwell Garnett, was behind the accused wearing a black balaclava and holding a yellow tomahawk. He was described as having a shorter, lighter build and was about five foot seven inches with an Australian access and blue eyes. He was about 30 years old. He was wearing grey tracksuit pants, a dark jacket and a flannelette shirt with black and blue gloves.

The accused walked Mr Brett to the clubhouse and threatened Mr Brett that he would be shot if he turned around to look at him and didn’t act normal. He was told to turn off the alarm. Mr Brett then opened up the bar and back room.

The accused was asking a number of questions including inquiries about exits to the club and the back dock.

The accused removed the green coloured ‘Turf Care’ brand baseball cap which Mr Brett had been wearing and put it on his head.

Whilst in the office area, the accused demanded Mr Brett open the safe. Mr Brett stated that he was unable to access the safe as he did not have the keys and informed the accused that Sharon Snelling had the keys to the safe and she would not arrive until 11.00am.

Mr Brett was told to wait in the back room whilst both offenders searched through the club. Whilst they were searching, Mr Brett heard a noise and saw that they were spraying something similar to Windex. This is also seen on the CCTV footage.

The accused emptied a garbage bin and proceeded to place items which he had stolen from the club inside it.

At about 8.00am, the accused escorted Mr Brett from the club to the car park where he directed Mr Brett to drive his white coloured Toyota Prado four wheel drive to the loading dock area of the club. The accused then forced Mr Brett back inside the club where they waited for the other employees to arrive.

At about 11.05am, a number of people arrived at the club, including Sharon Snelling.

Mr Brett was taken to the bar area and the employees and patrons were confronted by the two offenders.

All of the victims, except Sharon Snelling, were forced to crawl to the poker machine area where they were told to lie down on the floor where the co-accused stood guard over them with the yellow axe.

Ms Snelling was told by the accused to follow him to the back room where Mr Brett was standing and to open the safe located within the office area.

Mr Brett and Ms Snelling were directed by the accused to place the money into a silver metal bin. Ms Snelling was visibly upset during this time, crying openly.

During this time the co-accused was walking between the office and the poker machine area.

The accused directed Mr Brett to take the silver metal bin and a crate full of poker machine note acceptors to the back dock area. The accused also directed Ms Snelling to open the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) located within the club.

Ms Snelling was forced to remove the cash canisters and hand them to the accused.

At about 11.20am, the accused removed the CCTV hard drive from the office area, causing no further recording of the movements within the club.

The accused directed Brett to assist him to carry all of the cash and other items stolen from the club to Brett’s Toyota Prado.

Once all the items were loaded into the vehicle, the accused and co-accused drove from the area in Mr Brett’s Toyota Prado and continued out of sight.

At 11.28am, Mr Brett telephoned police and reported the incident.

Police arrived and the area was secured for subsequent crime scene examination. All witnesses were interviewed and descriptions of the offenders were obtained.

The Office Manager of Hazelbrook Bowling Club confirmed that the following items were stolen during the robbery:

Keno - $536;

Bar - $1,523;

Dollar coin float - $691;

Till - $1,910;

Rear poker machines - $1,780;

Blue tin - $750;

ATM - $2,720;

Tip jar - $160;

Total = $10,070.

Costs to replace 14 cash boxes and keys = $700.

CCTV hard drive = $1,000.

At about 6.30pm that evening, Brett’s stolen Toyota Prado four wheel drive was located parked and unattended in Clearview Parade, Hazelbrook, by members of Brett’s family.

Garnett is subject to a current parole order in which he provided his contact phone number ending in 578. This mobile service is turned off at 08:18 the morning of the offence and turned on again at 11.53am that morning. When this mobile service is turned on at 11:53, it indicates that the mobile service was in the Springwood area. The mobile service is then tracked via cell site locations to the Springwood, Glossodia, North Richmond, Warragamba and Wallacia areas before travelling back to the South Coast where it is in the South Nowra area at 17:49. Police allege that Garnett was in possession of this mobile service during the day of the offence. This is supported by CCTV footage.

On 9 May 2013, a member of the public located property stolen from the robbery at a fire trail off Farnsworth Avenue, Warragamba. He handed the following items to police:

Leilou brand shoes;

Jacket;

Check shirt;

White / grey track pants;

Cleveland Golf baseball cap;

Turf Care cap.

Police were then taken to the fire trail and the following items were located:

Eastern side of the track

Small cash box (‘5’ handwritten on it);

Small cash box (‘9’ handwritten on it);

Plastic bag with raffle tickets, paperwork and drinks cans;

Green lighter (‘Hazelbrook Bowling Club’ inscribed);

Blue money box;

Blue enviro bag on top of rolled up newspaper;

White plastic bags containing white plastic bags;

Brown metal bin;

Black cash box (‘11’ handwritten on it);

White and blue left shoe - size nine ‘Leilou’ brand;

Powerpack;

NZ keyring and seven keys;

White and blue right shoe - size nine ‘Leilou’ brand;

Plastic resealable bag with blue ‘Nowra Show Society Inc’ wrist band;

Bundled clothing - purple and blue jacket, check flannelette shirt, white cap ‘Cleveland Golf’, grey track pants with light stripe;

Various lighters scattered throughout the bush with ‘Hazelbrook Bowling Club’ print;

Biscuit tin;

Garrison remote on silver tin lid / yellow key tag;

Cash box (‘10’ handwritten on it);

‘Heaven’ brand biscuit tin;

Various receipts, drink bottles and food wrappers.

Western side of the track

375ml Coke can;

Cardboard box with straws and stationery;

Black sunglasses;

PACOM digital video recorder;

Grey milk crate with orange bar mat;

Black cash box (‘7 handwritten on it);

Black cash box (‘6’ handwritten on it);

Four cash boxes, marked ‘3’;

Black picnic blanket plus cloth ANZ bag;

Black cash box (‘14’ handwritten on it);

Powershield surge protector unit;

Two cash boxes (‘1’ and ‘2’ handwritten on them);

375ml Coke Zero can;

Pair of silver scissors;

Yellow and black handled side cutter pliers;

Three cash boxes (‘4’, ‘8’ and ‘12’ handwritten on them).

Amongst these items were two receipts which were located by crime scene examiners.

One receipt was for a purchase of petrol at 12.01pm on 4 May 2013 at Prime Fuel, 281 Hawkesbury Road, Winmalee, for motor vehicle BS42YV (white coloured Holden Commodore station wagon).

Police subsequently reviewed CCTV footage from the Prime Fuel Service Station for that specific time, and it depicted the co-accused attending the counter area and paying for the fuel. The CCTV footage also depicts a second male standing beside vehicle BS42YV. That male strongly resembles the accused. Prime Fuel at Winmalee is 17.9 kilometres east of the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club. The fuel purchase took place approximately 30 minutes after the offenders left the Hazelbrook Bowling and Sporting Club.

The second receipt was for an Optus mobile telephone recharge voucher for $10, which was purchased about 2.20am on 3 May 2013 at the Mobil Service Station, Bomaderry. Police have reviewed the CCTV footage from that date and time and it depicts co-accused purchasing the recharge voucher.

Vehicle BS42YV is registered to Martina Lee Craig of xx Way, Nowra. Craig is a known associate of the accused and is currently in a relationship with Garnett.

On 2 May 2013, police spoke with Craig at her current residence, xx Street, Vincentia. Also present at the location was the accused and Damien Pratt. Vehicle BS42YV was parked at the residence.

On 3 May 2013, the co-accused was stopped by police for a traffic offence in vehicle BS42YV at Railway Street, Bomaderry. Damien Pratt was with him at the time.

A subsequent forensic examination of a number of exhibits were conducted with the following results:

‘Coke’ can on bar (R1) - Garnett is the major component;

Inside blue trim glove (R8) - Goodfellow is the major component;

Inside black trim glove (R9) - Goodfellow can’t be excluded;

Inside black beanie with eyeholes (R10) – Garnett;

Inside black and blue beanie with eyeholes (R11) – Goodfellow;

Right ‘Leilou’ shoe (R13) - Goodfellow was the major contributor;

‘Turf Care’ cap (R14) - Goodfellow can’t be excluded;

Jacket (R15) - Goodfellow and Garnett can’t be excluded;

Tracksuit pants (R17) - Goodfellow the major contributor;

Flannelette shirt (R18) - Goodfellow the major contributor;

Mouth rim on ‘Jack Daniels’ can (R19) – Garnett;

Mouth rim on ‘Jack Daniels’ can (R20) – Garnett.

Item one was found on the bar at the Bowling Club. Items two to 10 were found at Warragamba. Items 11 and 12 were located and seized as part of an operation to obtain DNA from Garnett to compare to DNA from the crime scene.

On 6 June 2013, the accused and co-accused were arrested at xx Street, Vincentia. They were conveyed to Nowra Police Station where they were interviewed and then charged with the matters now before the Court.

During the interview, the accused made a number of statements including:

That he disclosed to police searching his house knowledge of a .22 rifle in the back of the house where he lived but it was not his;

That he was previously convicted of armed robbery twice in relation to the Hazelbrook Bowling Club.;

He claims he was set up;

He said the mattress on the floor (where the rifle was located) is not his.

A search warrant was also executed at xx Street, Vincentia. A numbers of items were seized, including a sawn off pump action .22 calibre rifle which was located in the granny flat under a mattress. The accused’s wallet was also located on a table in that room.”

OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES AND THE HENRY GUIDELINE JUDGMENT


	
	From a recitation of the facts, it is clear that the s 97(2) offence is objectively very serious: Simpson v R at [25]-[27] (Hoeben CJ at CL). Put another way, it is a very serious example or a very serious instance of the behaviour made criminal by s 97(2): Campbell at [27]-[33] (Simpson J).
	
	
	There are though three offences the prisoner has pleaded guilty to.
	
	
	Mr Guirguis made submissions as to where the s 97(2) offence fell in a range of objective gravity. He did not in terms address each of the offences separately. Defence counsel submitted the offence fell within the lower end of the middle range. Because of this, a submission was requested to be made by him about this matter.
	
	
	The Crown submitted the s 97(2) offence fell within the upper level or upper end (see transcript 14 July 2014 p 62 line 36 ff and p 66 line 6 ff, 15 July 2014 p 29 line 43 ff, and 18 July 2014 p 31 line 11 ff). He equally did not make a separate assessment in relation to each of the three offences. Because of this, a submission was requested to be made by the Crown about this matter.
	
	
	Before I consider these submissions, it is important to note the Crown does not rely on the detention of Mr Brett in relation to the s 97(2) offence. This is because there is a separate charge in respect of this, being count one.
	
	
	The disguising of the face in respect of planning of the s 97(2) offence cannot be taken into account because it is a separate offence on the Form.
	
	
	The taking of the vehicle cannot be seen as a continuation of the armed robbery because it is a separate offence on the Form. This must be put completely to one side in relation to the armed robbery.
	
	
	In terms of parity with the co-offender in relation to the s 97(2) offence only, weight must be given to the offence on the Form, being the s 154C offence. Mr Garnett was not charged with this and the Crown in this case accepted his criminality was complete after they left the club.
	
	
	As against that, in relation to Mr Garnett, the detention of Mr Brett is part of the s 97(2) offence and because of that his criminality is heightened.
	
	
	Returning to the s 97(2) offence only, Mr Guirguis emphasised the shortened rifle was not discharged, there is no evidence it was loaded, no gratuitous application of violence, nobody physically hurt, no tying up and no substantial planning.
	
	
	The Crown compared the present case to the Henry guideline. This is of course not a s 97(1) offence, rather a s 97(2). But as noted in Hamze, s 97(2) builds on s 97(1). The Crown also emphasised the length of the time the offence took.
	
	
	I accept what defence counsel say as to the absence of those features.
	
	
	As against that, the offence was committed in company and that is not an element of the offence charged: Hamze at [37] (Giles JA). This is a feature of aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Turning then to the Henry guideline, the prisoner certainly cannot be described as young. He was born on 24 May 1969. He is now aged 45 years and about three months. The offences (with the exception of the firearms offence) were committed just three weeks prior to his 44th birthday. Nor could it be said he has no or little criminal history. He has a very poor history of committing armed robberies and also he has a criminal history for firearms offences.
	
	
	Reference has just been made to the prisoner’s record in relation to factor (i) in Henry: “young offender with no or little criminal history”. I wish to make it quite clear that I have not taken into account the prisoner’s record in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence: McNaughton. The reference to it at this point in the remarks is only in respect of the comparison of the present case with the guideline.
	
	
	The offence involved more than a limited degree of planning, as stated in Henry. There was, in my view, considerable planning. Certainly in this respect the present offence is more serious than an offence of the character identified in the guideline. Although I do not, nor did the Crown, elevate this to a feature of aggravation under s 21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Gloves were used. Each turned off their mobile phones. They sprayed cleaning liquid over touched items. A different vehicle, one with a connection to the offenders, was used to get the offenders from the South Coast to the Blue Mountains and back again. That vehicle was not at the club and accordingly not driven from the club. They travelled a considerable distance to the location. The offence was certainly not opportunistic or spur of the moment. The CCTV hard drive was removed. Other items were taken, as noted in the facts, and dumped a considerable distance away. Clothing was abandoned.
	
	
	As against that, defence note the items left at the fire trail were dumped and not destroyed. The prisoner was a major contributor to the DNA recovered on certain items found there. This demonstrates, the defence say, a lack of professionalism.
	
	
	Because of the separate offence found in count one, the length of the s 97(2) offence must be only from when Ms Snelling and, as stated in the facts, “a number of people arrived at the club”.
	
	
	Ms Snelling is the victim noted in the charge which is count two. She only arrived at 11.05am and was therefore only subject to detention and the armed robbery for in the order of twenty minutes. Mr Crown said on a number of occasions during submissions there was only one victim, Ms Snelling. However, others were involved in the armed robbery. Several employees, including Ms Snelling, attended the club at 11.05. What they were told to do and had to do is noted in the facts.
	
	
	This is not an aggravating feature pursuant to s 21A(2)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts”): see Campbell. In my view though, the offence is made somewhat more serious because of others being caught up in and subject to the armed robbery.
	
	
	As to the length, the 20 minutes or so is a significant period of time. Ms Snelling is the victim noted and that is the amount of time she was subjected to the armed robbery. She was ordered to do things during this time. She was visibly upset and openly crying.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a Victim Impact Statement from Ms Snelling. The terrible impact upon her of this terrifying experience is clear. Having said that, in my view the impact is no greater than one would expect. I do not take this into account as a feature of aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. There was no submission by the Crown that I should.
	
	
	Two weapons were used. The co-offender had an axe - a frightening weapon itself.
	
	
	I do not consider the victim was vulnerable in the sense used in Henry.
	
	
	There was not a small amount taken.
	
	
	All of these features (putting completely to one side the criminal history), in my view place the offence in the bottom band of the upper range, which is slightly above the band which is the middle range.
	
	
	I turn now to count one. The length of the detention is in the order of four hours to four hours and 20 minutes, from 7.00am to about 11.20am.
	
	
	The Court in R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 at [32] identified factors relevant to the seriousness of the given offence under s 86 which include:
	



	
	the period of the detention - already noted;
	
	
	the circumstances of the detention - being told what to do to assist in the armed robbery;
	
	
	the person being detained - an employee of the club;
	
	
	the purpose of the detention - to enable an armed robbery to be carried out.
	


None of these though are conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence.


	
	Mr Guirguis submitted that in relation to the s 86(2) offence, it was not a ransom-type situation. The victim was not tied up or blindfolded. The victim was not physically assaulted. This was not a vigilante or gang-related attack, and the duration was relatively limited.
	
	
	In this case, the offender “walked Mr Brett to the clubhouse and threatened Mr Brett that he would be shot if he turned around to look at him and didn’t act normal.”
	
	
	Mr Guirguis submitted:
	


“given that the actual and threatened use of the firearm will be taken into account in respect of the s 97(2) offence, it would be double counting for this aggravating factor to be taken into account again for the s 86(2) offence. The actual use of the firearm, and all threats, implied or otherwise, can be, in my submission, properly characterised as forming part of the robbery offence.”


	
	The Crown submitted it is aggravated pursuant to s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I am of the view, this being a separate offence, it is not double counting in the circumstances of this case to take this feature of aggravation, being the threatened use of a weapon found in s 21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, into account in relation to the s 86(2)(a) offence. In any event, this earlier part of the detention when he first confronted Mr Brett at about 7.00am was not taken into account in respect of the armed robbery, as already noted.
	
	
	Mr Guirguis submitted this offence fell within the lower end of the middle range. The Crown submitted it is in the upper end or towards the higher end. The two relevant passages of the transcript which Mr Crown adopted is found at 14 July 2014 at about line 47, p 62 continuing to p 63, line 1 and 18 July 2014, p 31, line 11.
	
	
	The offence in my view falls well into the middle range.
	
	
	Finally, the possess prohibited firearm. The firearm in respect of this offence is the same as the firearm identified in count one as being used in the armed robbery. Mr Guirguis submitted that relevant considerations are it was not loaded, there was no child in the granny flat, it was located underneath the mattress and again this offence fell within the lower end of the middle range.
	
	
	The Crown submitted the offence fell within the middle range.
	
	
	In my view this offence falls just into the middle range.
	
	
	The offence has a standard non-parole period and I take it into account in terms of the case of Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120; 212 A Crim R 254.
	


OFFENCES ON THE FORM


	
	The criminality in the Form 1 offence, being the s 154C(2) offence, must be given weight to. The usual purpose of the Form 1 process is to impose a greater sentence than if the principal offence stood alone. A court can take into account the criminality of the Form 1 offence to increase the penalty for the principal offence: Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. The other offence is part of the s 97(2) offence.
	


GENERAL DETERRENCE AND SPECIFIC DETERRENCE


	
	Both of these must be a significant feature of this sentencing exercise.
	


PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD


	
	In the circumstances of this case, it will suffice to say the prisoner has a very poor record in relation to committing armed robberies. He has committed a very substantial number of them. He has had two prior episodes, putting to one side the offence when he was a juvenile. Also, he has a history in respect of firearms offences.
	
	
	I repeat again, in the circumstances of this case, it will suffice to say what I have said in relation to those matters.
	
	
	He has a record of more recent times which has had him serve a fifteen month term from 15 February 2010, expiring on 14 May 2011. He was then imprisoned for offences including a number of offences involving a firearm committed on 25 April 2012. The effective sentence was 12 months imprisonment. He was released full-time on 23 April 2013, only some 11 days prior to the present offending.
	
	
	His record is one which in my view evidences his continuing attitude of disobedience to the law and indicates that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community: McNaughton at [11]-[12] and [30] (Spigelman CJ), [63] (McClellan CJ at CL) and [83] (Barr and Bell JJ).
	


DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS AND SUBJECTIVE MATTERS


	
	As noted above, the prisoner is now aged 45 years and about three months, having been born on 24 May 1969.
	
	
	I have read and take into account the psychological report of Barbara Panagiotopoulos, dated 10 June 2014, and also the Corrective Services Case Note Report, both of which form Exhibit 1.
	
	
	The prisoner had a sad, disruptive and deprived early life. His background is a relevant consideration affording some mitigation.
	
	
	He has had a long history of abusing drugs, in more recent times methamphetamines.
	
	
	He has worked when out of gaol and when in gaol.
	
	
	The prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded. Indeed, I would say they are only poor to fair.
	


PARITY


	
	The prisoner’s co-offender in the s 97(2) offence also is before me for sentence. Parity principles are only relevant to a very limited extent. This is because the other offender has no other charges arising out of the same armed robbery and different criminality even within the armed robbery.
	
	
	Mr Garnett has the detention of Mr Brett as part of his armed robbery but the s 154C offence has no relevance to him at all.
	
	
	The subjective features are very different, in particular, he is much younger and has a much less serious criminal record.
	
	
	In my view, neither of the prisoners has any basis for a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentences imposed on each.
	
	
	Defence counsel submitted there were special circumstances in this case. The Crown said there were not.
	
	
	In relation to accumulation, the defence conceded there must be some accumulation in relation to counts one and two but count three should be served wholly concurrently. In my view, as the Crown submitted, there should be partial accumulation in respect of each of the offences.
	
	
	The special accumulation is a special circumstance in this case. Further, given what is contained in the psychological report, the treatment required by the prisoner can be better received by him in the community. Further, institutionalisation is a real concern in this case: Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24]. The allowance, however, will only be moderate.
	


SENTENCES TO BE IMPOSED


	
	Totality is an important consideration in this case.
	
	
	The effective non parole period imposed is the one which in my view is the least period in custody required to properly reflect the objective seriousness of the offending, the requirement for general deterrence, and the subjective matters.
	
	
	In my view there are special circumstances in this case, they being those referred to in my remarks on sentence.
	


Count 3 - s 7(1) Firearms Act


	
	The sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction of 15 percent for utilitarian considerations only is 4 years and 3 months, reduced to 3 years, 7 months, 11 days, rounded to 3 years, 7 months.
	
	
	The formal order I make is as follows: There is a non parole period of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 6 June 2013, expiring on 5 September 2015. The total term is 3 years and 7 months, commencing on 6 June 2013, expiring on 5 January 2017.
	


Count 2 - s 97(2) Crimes Act and the offences on the Form


	
	Taking into account the offences on the Form, the sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction of 15 percent for utilitarian considerations only is 8 year 6 months, reduced to 7 years 2 months 2 weeks 5 days, rounded to 7 years 2 months.
	
	
	The formal order I make is as follows: There is a non-parole period of 4 years 8 months, commencing on 6 June 2014, expiring on 5 February 2019. The total term is 7 years 2 months, commencing on 6 June 2014, expiring on 5 August 2021.
	


Count 1 - s 86(2)(a) Crimes Act


	
	The sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction of 25 percent for utilitarian considerations only is 5 years 9 months, reduced to 4 years 3 months 3 weeks, rounded to 4 years 3 months.
	
	
	The formal order I make is as follows: There is a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing on 6 December 2017 and expiring on 5 June 2019. The total term is 4 years 3 months, commencing on 6 December 2017, expiring on 5 March 2022.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total effective non-parole period is 6 years and the total effective term is 8 years and 9 months.
	
	
	The allowance for special circumstances is 6.75 months.
	
	
	You will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on 5 June 2019. In relation to each of the two offences on the s 166 certificate, the provisions of s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act will be utilised. So there is a conviction but no further penalty.
	
	
	I make an order for the destruction of the firearm and the ammunition.

2764621,Mehajer v R [2014] NSWCCA 167,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: On 11 June 2013 Mohammed Mehajer (the appellant), was arraigned on two charges, the first with a co-accused, Hiba Cornell. The charges were in the following terms:

""HIBA CORNELLMOHAMED MEHAJER

1. Between 1 July 2008 and 22 December 2008 at Yagoona and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did conspire with each other and with Mohamed Diab to cheat and defraud the National Australia Bank Ltd of a large sum of money.

Common LawLaw Part Code: 40439

AND the Director of Public Prosecutions FURTHER CHARGES that MOHAMED MEHAJER

2. On 3 December 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did corruptly give Mohamad Sowaid, an agent of the National Australia Bank Ltd, a benefit, namely $2,000, as an inducement for Mohamad Sowaid to do something in relation to the business of the principal of Mohamad Sowaid, namely process a loan application through the National Australia Bank Ltd.

Section 249B(2) Crimes Act 1900Law Pard Code: 16709.""

2Section 249B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Act) provides as follows:

""249B(1) If any agent corruptly receives or solicits (or corruptly agrees to receive or solicit) from another person for the agent or for anyone else any benefit:

(a) as an inducement or reward for or otherwise on account of:

(i) doing or not doing something, or having done or not having done something, or

(ii) showing or not showing, or having shown or not having shown, favour or disfavour to any person,

in relation to the affairs or business of the agent's principal, or

(b) the receipt or any expectation of which would in any way tend to influence the agent to show, or not to show, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the affairs or business of the agent's principal,

the agent is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

(2) If any person corruptly gives or offers to give to an agent, or to any other person with the consent or at the request of any agent, any benefit:

(a) as an inducement or reward for or otherwise on account of the agent's:

(i) doing or not doing something, or having done or not having done something, or

(ii) showing or not showing, or having shown or not having shown, favour or disfavour to any person,

in relation to the affairs or business of the agent's principal, or

(b) the receipt or any expectation of which would in any way tend to influence the agent to show, or not to show, favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the affairs or business of the agent's principal,

the firstmentioned person is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.""

3Although the indictment did not refer to the particular paragraph of s 249B(2) of the Act relied upon in respect of Count 2, it is evident from the terms of the charge that it alleged a contravention of s 249B(2)(a)(i).

4Following a trial before Berman DCJ (the trial judge) and a jury, the appellant was convicted on both counts. 

5On Count 2 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to date from 18 December 2013. On Count 1 he was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months with a head sentence of 3 years to date from 18 June 2014. The result was that he is to be released to parole on 17 December 2015.

6The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against his sentence.

Factual background

7The appellant was a property developer who had financed a development proposal at Lidcombe by way of a loan with Westpac Banking Corporation. In 2004 the loan with Westpac Banking Corporation was refinanced with a loan of $18,239,000.00 from Suncorp-Metway Ltd, taken out in his name and that of his wife (the Suncorp loan).

8By the end of February 2008 the Suncorp loan had not been repaid, was in arrears and interest was accruing. The outstanding balance at that time was $4,514,087.98.

9In July 2008 the appellant was introduced to Hiba Cornell (Ms Cornell) by Mr Mohamed Diab (Mr Diab). Each of Ms Cornell and Mr Diab worked at the Bank of Queensland and assisted the appellant to make a refinance application through that bank. The loan application was rejected for several reasons, including doubts concerning the appellant's ability to service the loan.

10Following that rejection Ms Cornell and Mr Diab met a mortgage broker, Mr Khoury and discussed a proposal for them to assist the appellant to apply for finance through Westpac Banking Corporation. The proposal ended up going to the National Australian Bank (NAB), not Westpac Banking Corporation. Mr Khoury introduced Ms Cornell and Mr Diab to Mr Sowaid, an employee of NAB.

11An application for finance was made to NAB. For the purpose of the application Ms Cornell and Mr Diab obtained bank statements and other financial documents from the appellant and sent them either to Mr Khoury, who forwarded them to Mr Sowaid, or sent them to Mr Sowaid directly.

12The Crown's case was that the documentation given to NAB was different to that supplied to the Bank of Queensland and falsely inflated the appellant's financial position. Mr Diab gave evidence that he observed that the financial records were very different to those given to the Bank of Queensland, describing them as substantially higher. He said he asked the appellant the reason for the difference and he was told the ones to be supplied to NAB were interim financial statements.

13The financial statements were significantly different. The first set for the year ended 30 June 1998 showed a gross profit from trading of $112,408.00, profit before tax of $23,161.14 and shareholder's equity of $1,092,348.32. By contrast the other set showed gross profit on trading of $1,352,502.55, profit before tax of $752,331.56 and shareholder's equity of $2,494,701.34.

14It should be noted that Mr Diab pleaded guilty to being a co-conspirator with the appellant and Ms Cornell. He received a reduction in penalty for giving evidence. Mr Sowaid had also pleaded guilty to an offence and had received a reduction in penalty for giving evidence.

15A number of telephone calls were intercepted in which Ms Cornell, Mr Diab and the appellant discussed the NAB loan application. In one call made on 20 October 2008 there was a discussion between Ms Cornell and the appellant in which the appellant is recorded as saying that Mr Sowaid is scared he will not receive his bonus. In another conversation between the same parties on 4 November 2008 Ms Cornell is recorded as saying in Arabic, ""Sowaid; Sowaid is on the side; we give him the money on the side"". The appellant replied in a mixture of Arabic and English ,""I understand, but is he convinced and will he continue on the same road with us and not play games"".

16The critical events concerning Count 2 took place in early December 2008. Mr Diab gave evidence that he and the appellant met with Mr Sowaid and that the appellant expressed his frustration that the loan had not been approved. Mr Diab then said that the appellant asked to speak to Mr Sowaid alone and they went to another room.

17Mr Sowaid acknowledged he went to the meeting and went to another room with the appellant separately. He gave the following evidence:

""Q. Sorry I interrupted you, what happened when this is yourself and the accused Mehajer in this room?A. Correct.

Q. What happened please?A. Mohamad Mehajer started telling me that he knows my father, that they used to work together in Arnotts and that you know there's a close you know like they knew each other. He then took out an envelope and advised me that it was --

Q. As best you can remember what he said?A. The best I can remember this is a gift of $2,000 for you yeah.

Q. And did you say anything?A. I said look I don't want any money. He said you have to take it it's a gift. I said I don't want any money, I don't want any money. He kept ranting and raving about I had to take the money and then shoved it in my pants pocket.

Q. How did he do that?A. He just leaned over and put it in my pants pocket yeah.

Q. Can you describe this envelope at that point?A. It was just a normal white mail envelope.

Q. Could you see into the envelope?A. I didn't see into the envelope until later on.

Q. And what happened after that please?A. After that we walked back out of the office.""

18In cross-examination on this issue the following interchange took place:

""Q. You've given an account of what was said in that room, I'm going to put to you that a slightly different conversation occurred. Mr Mehajer said that he wanted to know if you could - would approve - would hurry up the process of approving the loan. You said you'd do what you can, 'I have too much work to do, I'll try to do it as soon as I can. But it will come at a price as the bank doesn't pay me for my overtime work', is that what you said?A. I was on a lot more than $2,000 a week, I can tell you that.

Q. It wasn't the question.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Hold on. Forget about how much you get paid and maybe there'll be questions about that later, all Mr McKeand wants to know is was there any conversation along those lines.
A. No, there was no conversation along those lines.

MCKEAND

Q. All right, well, I'm putting it to you that it was. That Mr Mehajer went on to say 'Here's a present for you to work overtime in processing my application. Please process my application as soon as possible and just let me yes or no, if my application is approved'. Do you agree with that?A. No.""

19The appellant's version of the conversation was somewhat different to that of Mr Sowaid. He was asked these questions and gave the following answers:

""Q. What happened there?A. INTERPRETER: So that was the first time I met him, and Mohamed Diab said he's going to get the loan through him. What I've asked him then, 'Why haven't you processed the application, my application?

Q. Who was it you asked that question of?A. INTERPRETER: Mr Sowaid, the bank manager.

Q. And was Mr Diab present in this conversation?A. INTERPRETER: Yes, he was.

Q. And what was the answer to the question?A. INTERPRETER: So Mohamad Sowaid he said, 'Have you paid for the valuation?' I responded by saying, 'Yes'. And I said, 'Why haven't you more or less finalised the application because I want to go to Lebanon?'

Q. What was next?A. INTERPRETER: I said, 'I'm too busy, I've got a lot of work'. I told him, 'I'm going to Lebanon. I've got some properties, I'm going to sell them. And all the loan I've requested for is for one year'.

Q. What happened then?

HIS HONOUR

Q. Sorry, who said they were too busy?A. INTERPRETER: Mohamad Sowaid.

MCKEAND

Q. Were you alone with him at this stage, or was Mr Diab there?A. INTERPRETER: So Mohamed Diab was more or less in the waiting room, and I got inside and I showed him the project.

Q. You showed Mr Sowaid the project?A. INTERPRETER: Yeah, telling him that project I want to sell it, and I want to go to Lebanon to say that I'm bona fide in what I'm saying.

Q. What happened then?A. INTERPRETER: He said, 'I'm too busy now, and this work needs working over the weekend, and the bank does not pay me for working on the weekend'. So 'If the bank doesn't pay you on the weekend', I responded by saying, 'Here's $2,000, and this is $2,000, it's not a bribe, it is just to work on it and tell me if there was a deal or there's no deal'. And I was very precise - sorry.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Did you say the words, 'It's not a bribe' to Mr Sowaid?A. INTERPRETER: Yes, I swear by God. I said, 'Regard it as a present from me because I'm wanted to go to Lebanon and I'm not getting clear information from you'.

MCKEAND

Q. Just tell me what else was said?A. INTERPRETER: And I showed him the project that I've got, and I'm going to bring some money in January, and that's what has happened, I brought some money from Lebanon.

Q. What did he do with the $2,000?A. INTERPRETER: So he took the $2,000, and the meeting lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then he went to his work.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Where did he put the $2,000 - I missed that?A. INTERPRETER: In his pocket.

Q. Was the $2,000 in an envelope when you gave it to him?A. INTERPRETER: So I had my wallet, I took the $2,000, I put it in an envelope and gave it to him, and the room was not closed, Mohamed Diab could see actually what's going on.""

20He adhered to this version in cross-examination:

""Q. Sir, on 3 December you wanted an answer from Sowaid about how long it was going to take to get an approval, didn't you?A. INTERPRETER: You can put the tape and listen to it. All I said to him, I want to deal with him without the broker. Directly.

Q. That was on 17 December you said to him sir?A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. You said that to him on 3 December?A. INTERPRETER: On the third of the 12th, what I said to him, I told him why you haven't working on the process, or why aren't you finishing the processing of mine. He said that he's got too much work and if he wants to work on it he will work on it on the weekend?A. WITNESS: I continue?

Q. Sure.A. INTERPRETER: And he said the bank does not pay him for the weekend. I said 'okay'. When he came to the office there was an office in another room with the door open, not as describing the handles. I told him I'm going to Lebanon. And I told him I've got project in there, let me show you it, and I want to bring money in January. So I showed him the plans for Lebanon. And this is $2,000 I told him, and this $2,000 is not a bribe, and I know that you can't get approval yourself, it has to go through the credit people. And I insisted this is not a bribe, this is a present for you. And I hope that you give me an answer, yes or no, by next week.

...

Q. Because your version about him doing overtime is complete rubbish, that's why sir.A. INTERPRETER: Thank you.

Q. Once you knew that he had accepted the bribe, you were then in a more certain position about the submission of the dodgy financials.A. INTERPRETER: That's not correct.""

21The Crown case was that subsequently Mr Diab falsified lists of properties to be developed by the appellant in the appellant's resume to give the impression that the appellant was developing a property at Hurstville worth millions of dollars. Mr Diab gave evidence he prepared the list in question, knowing it to be incorrect and told the appellant he had done so. He said in cross-examination that the falsified version of the appellant's resume was sent to Mr Sowaid. 

22Ultimately Mr Sowaid declined to process the application and told Ms Cornell and Mr Diab that he was concerned primarily with the appellant's ability to meet his repayments. An intercepted telephone conversation of 18 December 2008 records Mr Sowaid telling Mr Diab the appellant could have his money back and that he did not want to go on with the application.

23NAB made no advance to the appellant. The appellant refinanced the Suncorp loan from offshore funds.

The directions of the trial judge

24As will be seen subsequently a number of the grounds of appeal relate to the directions given in respect of Count 2 in the context of the way in which the parties put their respective cases. In these circumstances it is necessary to have regard to the manner in which the parties opened their respective cases on that count.

25In opening address the Crown stated that its case on Count 2 was that at the meeting of 3 December between the appellant and Mr Sowaid $2,000.00 was handed over as an inducement to Mr Sowaid to process the loan. Subsequently in opening, the Crown described what it had to prove to establish the offences in the following terms:

""In relation to conspiracy, that is, we have to prove that two or more persons - and we say that this conspiracy involved three persons, that is, these two accused and a third person Mohamad Diab who by his own evidence will say I am the person that made up the resume. I am not the person who made up the financials. We have to prove two or more persons. If you were satisfied that, for example, beyond reasonable doubt you would have to be so satisfied that there were only two persons involved but they were different persons. So for example if you said you found beyond reasonable doubt Diab and Cornell so conspired, but Mehajer wasn't part of that conspiracy, then you would be able to deliver a verdict in relation to Cornell; or if you were satisfied that it was only Cornell and Mehajer that were involved in the conspiracy, then you would be able to deliver a verdict. But I will just make you aware of that, but we say it's a three person - as long as you were satisfied in relation to each of these accused, and you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were involved in a conspiracy, that is, two person, then you can so deliver a verdict.

So essentially we have to prove that they agreed to use dishonest means, in this case the documents with the falsities, to prejudice another person's economic right or interest in this case; that is, to make the NAB hand over money which they wouldn't have handed over if they knew of the falsities.

In relation to the corrupt commission offences, we have to prove that the accused Mehajer corruptly - that is, with the relevant intention of influencing Mr Sowaid in the performance of his duties, gave to Sowaid who we have to prove technically is an agent of the National Australia Bank - agent includes employee - that he gave him a benefit, in this case the $2,000 as an inducement, it's another element; and that the inducement was to do something in relation to his principal's business, namely, process the loan.""

26The appellant's case was opened briefly. Senior counsel for the appellant put his client's case as follows:

""The two major issues that you will hear ventilated at least for my client relate, firstly, to the false documents that were alleged to be part of the conspiracy. What is in dispute with the Crown case, the way it was put to you in opening, is the authorship and participation of Mr Mehajer in those documents. It was put to you that Mehajer had given Diab false documents and they were passed on to the National Bank. That is in dispute. The fact that the documents were passed on to the National Bank by Diab is not in dispute. The fact that they were false when they were given to him is in dispute.

The second point is the payment of the corrupt commission that is alleged. Mr Mehajer does not dispute that he made the payment of $2,000. What is in dispute is the purpose of it. What I would hope that you would do is keep those two areas of dispute in your mind because it will, apart from anything else, explain to you why I'm asking some of the questions of witnesses that I do ask and know the reason for it. That's all I have to say for you at this stage.""

27In his closing address the prosecutor put the case against the appellant in the following terms:

""So ladies and gentlemen we have the meeting on 3 December 2008 and this goes to both the second count in relation to Mr. Mehajer and the conspiracy count in relation to each of the accused. We know from Mr. Sowaid and Mr. Diab that Mr. Sowaid and Mr. Mehajer go into another office and Mr. Mehajer closes the door. He thrusts a white envelope into Sowaid's pocket. It was put to Mr Sowaid that it was an overtime payment yet in no call is such a topic mentioned. Mr Sowaid denies it. He's pleaded guilty to it on the basis that he received it in those circumstances and Ms. Cornell says there was a commitment fee yet she does not use that word to describe the payment in the calls to Mr. Diab on the 8th or Mr. Mehajer on 7 December.""

28Thereafter the following interchange took place in the absence of the jury:

""HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, do I understand you to be saying that if the jury thinks it's reasonably possible that Mr Mehajer intended the money to be as an overtime payment, that the jury would find Mr Mehajer not guilty on count 2?CROWN PROSECUTOR: No.

HIS HONOUR: I must have misunderstood then.CROWN PROSECUTOR: Sorry, no all I'd say is on the evidence that -

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Do you push for the possibility being, for a possibility being that the jury might find beyond reasonable doubt that the payment was described as for overtime but nevertheless Mr Mehajer could be found guilty?CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Right, okay.""

29Following that interchange the Crown addressed the jury in the following fashion:

""I will just summarise the Crown's position about the events of 3 December. To determine whether you can infer that there was a corrupt intent, look at all the circumstances of what happened in the lead up to and on 3 December. But I want to make the Crown's position quite clear, ladies and gentlemen. It's the intent that's important in the tendency as outlined; that is, that the receipt of the money would in any way tend to influence Mr. Sowaid and in that sense it doesn't matter what the money handed over may or may not have been called. That is, even if you were satisfied that Mr. Mehajer did call it overtime, you can still be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a - that the offence is proven, because of the elements. So I'll want to make that quite clear to you, ladies and gentlemen, but we rely on inference. Mr. Mehajer says he had no such corrupt intent. We would ask you to reject his evidence about this, except the evidence about Mr. Sowaid and the telephone intercept material on the 8th in particular, and to infer that he had the relevant corrupt intent.""

30The trial judge supplied the jury with written directions. As they are relatively brief it is convenient to set them out in full:

""Count 1

Before you can convict Mohamad Mehajer you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:

1. Mr Mehajer entered into an agreement with at least one other person (either Mr Diab, or Ms Cornell, or both), to cheat and defraud the National Australia Bank Ltd of a sum of money and

2. At the time he entered into the agreement he intended that the National Australia Bank Limited would be cheated and defrauded.

Notes:

To cheat and defraud someone is to intentionally use dishonest methods to deprive another person of their property,

In deciding whether something is dishonest you should apply the current standards of ordinary decent people.

The offence can still be committed even if those involved in it intended that the National Australia Bank Limited would get the loan repaid.

Count 2

Before you can convict Mr Mehajer you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:

1. Mr Mehajer gave Mohamad Sowaid $2,000, and

2. at the time, Mr Sowaid was an employee of the National Australia Bank Limited, and

3. the receipt of the money would in any way tend to influence Mr Sowaid to show favour to Mr Mehajer in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank Limited, and

4. the payment was made corruptly which means that Mr Mehajer intended that it would influence Mr Sowaid to show favour to Mr Mehajer in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank Limited.

Notes

The Crown does not need to prove that the receipt of the money actually influenced Mr Sowaid to show favour to Mr Mehajer, only that receipt of the money would tend to influence him to show favour.""

31Early in his summing-up the trial judge gave the following directions concerning Count 2:

""One of the very big areas of dispute is the purpose of the payment to Mr Sowaid. The reason that Mr Mehajer gave that money to Mr Sowaid is disputed. The Crown says that Mr Mehajer did that because he wanted Mr Sowaid to show favour to him in considering what to do with his loan. Mr Mehajer said it is just a gift, because Mr Mehajer would have to work overtime, over the weekend, that was the reason he gave him that gift, and he said that as he handed it over he said, 'This is not a bribe', so there is that dispute. What was the purpose of that $2,000 payment?

When you look at the elements that go to make up count 2 on the indictment you might say to yourself, it does not matter. You do not need to look at it now, members of the jury, but you might say to yourself it does not matter whose version is correct. You might decide that even on Mr Mehajer's version the Crown has proved that he is guilty on count 2; or, you might decide that even on the Crown version, he is not guilty. So you might say, I do not need to resolve that dispute, because whichever side I accept the verdict is either guilty or not guilty. Do you understand that? Even though it is a very big area of dispute as to what the purpose of that payment was when you look at the elements it might be that you say to yourselves, I do not need to decide that, I do not need to resolve that dispute because even if I accept the Crown's version he is not guilty or, even if I accept Mr Mehajer's version he is guilty.""

32Shortly thereafter he dealt with the character evidence called by the accused:

""But let's get back to Mr Mehajer. His character is a matter which you should take into account in determining your verdict. How? How do you take it into account? Well you are entitled to take it into account in a couple of ways. The first way is this. You might think that a person who has not done this sort of thing in the past, and is described as honest by those who know him, is less likely to have committed this offence or either of these offences than a person who has a history of such conduct. That is a matter of common sense really. The fact that Mr Mehajer who is a person who has no history of offending of this kind, or of any kind for that matter, that entitled you to consider the improbability of him having committed those offences the Crown alleges against him. So you are entitled to take the character of Mr Mehajer into account in deciding whether he is guilty or not of the offences he is charged with. Now the second way you can take Mr Mehajer's character into account is this. Mr Mehajer has given evidence in this trial, and the fact that he has not been convicted of any criminal offence and the fact that people are prepared to come along to court and say that they regard him as honest, and he has a reputation for honesty, well that evidence supports his credibility. In other words, people of good character that have never been convicted of a criminal offence, there are people that describe them as honest, are generally less likely to lie in court than people of bad character who do have criminal convictions. So Mr Mehajer's character should be taken into account by you in deciding whether or not you accept the evidence he gave in court. Of course he denied committing the offences and so when you say to yourselves do I accept what he said, you take into account that he is a man with no previous convictions who is described as honest by those people who know him.

Now, or [sic] course, the character of Mr Mehajer is just one of the many matters you take into account in deciding your verdict. People without criminal convictions are not incapable of committing offences. After all everyone that has ever been convicted of a criminal offence has at some stage been able to say I have no previous convictions. Nor are people with no convictions, nor are people who are described as honest incapable of lying. And I have just suggested to you - the Crown says that even on Mr Mehajer's version when he handed over that $2,000 he was doing it dishonestly. But, of course, I do not want to undermine in any way the direction I have given you.""

33On the second day of the summing-up the following direction was given in respect of Count 1:

""So there is that first element, Mr Mehajer entered into an agreement with at least one other person, either Mr Diab, Ms Cornell or both to cheat and defraud the National Australia Bank of a sum of money. And under the notes there I have got to cheat and defraud someone is to intentionally use dishonest means to deprive another person of their property. And of course in this case the Crown says that the dishonest means that the people had agreed to use was that NAB was to be deceived into thinking that Mr Mehajer was a better loan risk than he really was by the use of those two false documents, false financials or the false resume or both of those.""

34His Honour then directed the jury that in considering Count 1 it was not necessary to find that the appellant did not intend to repay NAB:

""And of course the Crown does not suggest that Mr Mehajer was going to take the $3 million and never pay it back but I remind you it does not matter. Everyone seems to have had the view that Mr Mehajer was going to be able to service the loan and ultimately of course no money was lent. So ultimately the NAB did not suffer any loss. And if the loan had been granted and Mr Mehajer had paid the interest and paid the principal back at the end, it would not have suffered any loss either.

But the offence can still be committed even if those involved in it intended that the National Australia Bank would get the loan repaid.""

35The trial judge then proceeded to give detailed directions on Count 2:

""Well once again there are elements that have to be proved in count 2 before the Crown can prove Mr Mehajer's guilt to your satisfaction and I have written them down for you there. The first is that Mr Mehajer gave Mohamad Sowaid $2,000. The second is that at the time Mr Sowaid was an employee of the National Australia Bank Limited. Now I do not think you will have much trouble with those. Both Mr Mehajer and Mr Sowaid say that Mr Mehajer gave Mr Sowaid $2,000. So I think you will find that proved beyond reasonable doubt fairly quickly. Mr Sowaid told you he was employed by the National Australia Bank and it was never suggested to him that he was not and so I think you would tick that one off as well. And move onto the third one.

The third thing the Crown has got to prove is that the receipt of the money would in any way tend to influence Mr Sowaid to show favour in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank Limited. Well once again members of the jury, I do not think it was suggested by Mr McKeand that you would not find that proved. It appears that Mr McKeand accepts on behalf of his client the receipt and [sic] the money would tend in some way to influence Mr Sowaid to show favour to Mr Mehajer in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank. And as I have made clear in that note underneath the elements members of the jury, the Crown does not have to prove that the receipt of the money would actually influence Mr Sowaid, that the receipt of the money actually influenced him to show favour to Mr Mehajer. Only that the receipt of the money would tend to influence him to show favour. And I say I might be wrong but I did not get the impression that Mr McKeand was asking you to find in favour of his client as regards that element. The focus of his submissions on this count was the fourth element and that is what I will look at now.

The fourth element requires that the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt that the payment was made corruptly. And what that means is that Mr Mehajer intended that it would influence Mr Sowaid to show favour to Mr Mehajer in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank Limited. So the real issue as far as count 2 is concerned requires you to look at what Mr Mehajer intended at the time he handed over that $2,000. What did he intend? What did Mr Mehajer intend? Not what would someone else intend who had done that. Not what a reasonable person would intend who did that. The question is what did Mr Mehajer intend when he handed over the $2,000? Did he intend to influence Mr Sowaid to show favour to Mr Mehajer in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank?

Now I want you to understand that the idea of showing favour does not only mean approve the loan or process the loan application. Look it can mean that but it can mean other things too. It may be and this is for you to decide and not me. It may be that by getting Mr Sowaid to do his work on the loan application faster than he would otherwise, Mr Sowaid would be showing favour to Mr Mehajer in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank Limited. Remember yesterday I said that it may be that even on Mr Mehajer's version you could find him guilty of this charge, well that is because the idea of showing favour does not only mean show favour in processing the loan application, show favour in getting me the loan. It can also mean perhaps, this is for you to decide, working on the loan application faster than you would otherwise have done.""

36His Honour then gave the example of paying a motor registry employee a fee to jump a queue. He said in these circumstances it would be up to the jury to determine whether this was done to show a favour to the person in relation to the business of the Roads and Maritime Services. He then proceeded as follows:

""You are deciding whether Mr Mehajer committed an offence. And I am not telling you that you would find Mr Mehajer guilty even on his version of events. I am not telling you that at all. All I am telling you is what the elements of the offence are and that one argument of the Crown that you may need to evaluate is that Mr Mehajer is guilty if you accept the version of events that he put forward in his evidence to you. And that is because showing favour, a thing referred to in element 4 there, showing favour does not only mean processing a loan application or having the loan granted. It might, subject to what you decide, it might mean other things as well.""

37The trial judge emphasised that the payment of $2,000.00 was relevant to both charges:

""The Crown said that that meeting where the money is handed over of course is directly relevant to the charge that Mr Mehajer faces alone, the second count on the indictment, but the Crown says it is also relevant to the conspiracy charges that each face. So you do not just - because it is relevant particularly to one particular charge, you do not ignore it when you look at the other charge. The Crown then said, well this was not an overtime payment - it was suggested it was a payment for overtime, but it was not said the Crown in his submission and he had a number of reasons for that. It was not discussed like that on the phone. There was no suggestion that it was a payment for overtime on any telephone intercept. It was not described as a consultant fee on any calls despite that being what Ms Cornell thought the payment was all about.

And of course you have got to remember Mr Sowaid's evidence. He has denied that it had been referred to as an overtime payment when he gave evidence and later calls between Mr Diab and Ms Cornell show that they both knew about this $2,000 payment and they both knew that more money was to be paid to Mr Sowaid. The Crown said that in a call on 8 December that payment is not described as a consultant's fee, it is described as a present and that, says the Crown, is very significant. If it was a consultant fee he would have been described as a consultant. Then the Crown said it does not matter really what the money was called, even if it was called overtime then you could still be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the charge that Mr Mehajer faces alone is proved beyond reasonable doubt.""

38Subsequently an objection was taken to part of the directions on Count 2:

""MCKEAND: And the second point relating to the same charge is a technical one really. The particulars that the Crown has got in terms of the inducement in relation to the business of the principal are namely process a loan application through the National Australia Bank and your Honour focused on the fact that, even if the payment was to work overtime it would still come within - in relation to the business of the principal of Mohamad Sowaid.

HIS HONOUR: I didn't say it would, I said they'd have to decide. I didn't say it would.

MCKEAND: No, no, all right, well sorry I didn't mean to misquote you.

...

MCKEAND: But nevertheless that is not within the particulars which was the processing of the loan application and the way I put it to the jury was processing a loan application means to complete that task.

HIS HONOUR: Well as you point out they're mere particulars, so particulars in a charge are not elements of the offence. Mr Crown - I mean sometimes Mr Crown might agree with you, I'll just check.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, no this is a classic case of the Crown, as a matter of fairness, has to provide particulars it has. If the defence provides a different set of particulars in their own case which results in a conviction, then so be it.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, Mr McKeand do you want to say anything else?

MCKEAND: Nothing further your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I don't propose to amend what I said in this regard.""

The grounds of appeal against conviction

39The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal:

""1. His Honour erred in directing the jury, impermissibly, that it could convict the appellant of count 2 on a basis, other than that contended for by the Crown;

2. His Honour erred in directing the jury that the appellant would be guilty of count 2, without proof that the receipt of the money would actually influence Mr. Sowaid to show favour to the appellant in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank;

3. His Honour erred in directing the jury that it would be open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant had acted corruptly, even if, as he stated in his evidence, his intent was only to compensate Mr. Sowaid for working overtime on the loan application, and thereby impermissibly discounting the possibility that it would be open to the jury to find that Mr. Sowaid's role in so doing was not something done in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank;

4. His Honour erred in directing the jury in relation to both counts 1 and 2 that it was immaterial that the appellant might have had no intent to deprive corruptly the National Australia Bank of property or place the bank's economic interests in jeopardy, thereby on count 1 equating the Crown case to one of making false and misleading statements with the intent to obtain a financial advantage and on count 2 impermissibly widening the effect of his Honour's directions on the meaning of the expression 'in relation to the affairs or business of the agent's principal';

5. In erroneously directing the jury that it could convict the appellant on count 2 even on his own 'version', his Honour further erred in undermining the character direction otherwise given in relation to the appellant; and

6. When directing the jury that it could return a majority verdict, his Honour erred:

(a) in failing to direct the jury that it should continue to strive for a unanimous verdict; and

(b) by telling the jury that the Court would be surprised, if the jury would not indicate well before 4 o'clock, that is to say, in well under 30 minutes, that it could not reach a majority verdict.

7. His Honour erred in directing the jury as to the elements of count 2 in that such elements related to a different offence to the actual offence charged as count 2 on the indictment.""

The construction of s 249B of the Act

40Because a number of the grounds of appeal depend on the construction of s 249B of the Act it is convenient to deal with that question at the outset.

41As is apparent from the submissions in the present case s 249B of the Act gives rise to a number of difficulties of construction. It is important to bear in mind in those circumstances the approach which should be adopted in construing the legislation.

42The task of construing the section must begin with a consideration of the text itself, taking into account the context including the general purpose and policy of the provision: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (Northern Territory) [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at [47]. Context is important as statutory construction requires deciding what is the legal meaning of a provision by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole: Certain Lloyd's Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; (2012) 248 CLR 378 at [23], [24], [68] and [88] and Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355.

43The first issue is what is meant by the expressions ""corruptly receives or solicits"" and ""corruptly gives or offers"" in the chapeaus of each of s 249B(1) and (2) of the Act. 

44Section 249B of the Act substantially re-enacted s 3 of the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1919 (NSW), adding s 249B(1)(a)(ii) and s 249B(2)(a)(ii). Section 249B was introduced by the Crimes (Secret Commissions) Amendment Bill 1987 (NSW) (the Bill). The Explanatory Note stated that the object of the Bill was to re-enact, with modifications, the provisions of the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act (NSW). The Second Reading Speech of the Bill added the following remarks:

""The target of the bill ... is the corrupt activities of those agents who either accept bribes in relation to their principals' affairs, or who do not make full disclosure to their principals of matters which may affect the carrying out of the agents' duties ... Because these offences are very broad in their scope, and could cover activity which it is not intended to cover, and which few people would consider criminal, the present provision, which allows a court to dismiss a charge which is trivial or purely technical, has been retained ... This bill brings the offences covered by this legislation into line with other comparable offences of dishonesty ... The aim...is to ensure that corrupt practices by agents, such as the receiving or the soliciting of bribes, are dealt with...""

45In Cooper v Slade (1858) 6 H L Cas 746; (1858) 10 ER 1488 the House of Lords considered the provisions of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854 (UK), which made it an offence to corruptly do any act of a certain class on account of any voter having voted or refrained from voting. Willes J who delivered the opinion of the majority of their Lordships stated that ""corruptly"" in that statute ""means not 'dishonestly', but in purposely doing an act which the law forbids as tending to corrupt voters whether it be to give a pecuniary inducement to vote, or a reward for having voted in any particular manner ... The word 'corruptly' seems to be used as a designation of the act of rewarding a man for having voted in a particular way as being corrupt, rather than as part of the definition of the offence"". 

46The adoption of this approach to offences equivalent to s 249B of the Act has been the subject of some controversy. In C v Johnson [1967] SASR 279 an issue arose as to whether a land agent was disqualified from acting as such by virtue of a conviction for an offence under s 5(a) of the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1920 (SA), the equivalent to s 249B(1) of the Act. The question was whether an offence under that section was an offence involving dishonesty.

47Bray CJ (at 289) pointed to the fact that in Cooper v Slade supra the word ""corruptly"" was construed as not necessarily importing the notion of dishonesty and that the decision had been followed in later cases dealing with elections. His Honour however concluded that a narrower view of s 5(a) of the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act (SA) was appropriate. He made the following comments:

""On the whole, however, I think that in relation to the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1920, the narrower meaning of the word 'corruptly' is to be preferred. On normal legal principles one would expect that word to add something to the meaning of the section. If it were not there, for example, it might be an offence for an agent to solicit a commission from a party with whom the principal was dealing or expected to deal, even with the consent and approval of the principal. I think in this statute it does import that the defendant was acting mala fide, to use the words of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Gross's case, and with wrongful intention, to use the words of Hood J. in Stevenson's case. If so, I fail to see how that bad faith or wrongful intention could be honest. One of the meanings of dishonest given in Murray's New English Dictionary is 'discreditable, as being at variance with straightforward or honourable dealing, underhand'. My view is that the commission of an offence against s. 5(a) of the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1920 necessarily involves dishonesty, and that a man who acts corruptly within the meaning of that section necessarily acts dishonestly. Of course, I use the word 'dishonesty' to mean dishonesty according to normally received standards of honest conduct. If a defendant charged with an offence against this section believed that to be honest which, according to standards of conduct generally held, was dishonest, that fact would not, in my view, prevent him from acting corruptly, or prevent his offence being described as one involving dishonesty.""

48Chamberlain J (at 301) reached a somewhat similar conclusion. He stated that ""[t]he corrupt or wrongful intention contemplated by the provision is to my mind the intention of an agent to take advantage of his relationship with his principal to secure some benefit to himself or some other person, without the knowledge of his principal. This as I think, and as I believe most people would think, involves dishonesty"".

49Both Bray CJ and Chamberlain J thus found the giving of a secret commission contains within it the necessary element of dishonesty to make the payment (and its receipt) corrupt. 

50R v Dillon and Riach [1982] VR 434 was a case involving an offence under the then Victorian equivalent of s 249B of the Act. Brooking J, in giving his reasons for the directions he proposed to make to the jury, made the following comments (at 436):

""In my view, an agent does act corruptly if he receives a benefit in the belief that the giver intends that it shall influence him to show favour in relation to the principal's affairs. If he accepts a benefit which he believes is being given to him because the donor hopes for an act of favouritism in return, even though he does not intend to perform that act, he is, by the mere act of receiving the benefit with his belief as to the intention with which it is given, knowingly encouraging the donor in an act of bribery or attempted bribery, knowingly profiting from his position of agent by reason of his supposed ability and willingness, in return for some reward, to show favouritism in his principal's affairs and knowingly putting himself in a position of temptation as regards the impartial discharge of his duties in consequence of the acceptance of a benefit.""

51That direction was approved by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Gallagher [1986] VR 219 at 231. The Court stated (at 230) that the direction was consistent with the weight of authority founded upon Cooper v Slade supra. Although the Full Court stated that the conclusion of Bray CJ in C v Johnson supra was not inconsistent with that line of authority, it suggested (at 231) that dishonesty was not a necessary ingredient of the offence but the necessary mental element was to give or receive a gift or consideration to show favour or refrain from showing favour.

52In R v Jamieson [1988] VR 879 the majority of the Full Court of Victoria followed R v Gallagher supra. Young CJ, with whom Fullagar J agreed, stated (at 883-884) that the trial judge was correct in telling the jury that a person acted corruptly if he made a payment intending the payment should influence the agent to show favour in relation to the affairs of his principal. He stated it was not possible to import a requirement that it be established that it was intended to conceal the true nature of the payment from the agent's principal. Although he stated it would be difficult to imagine a case where an agent could be found to have acted corruptly when he had informed his or her principal of the payment.

53Both the Court of Appeal in England and the Privy Council have applied the dictum in Cooper v Slade supra in dealing with equivalent legislation to s 249B of the Act: R v Wellburn (1979) 69 Cr App R 254, Regina v Smith [1960] 2 QB 423, Regina v Robert Harrington (Unreported, 28 September 2000, English Court of Appeal Criminal Division) and Jagdeo Singh v State of Trinidad and Tobago [2006] 1 WLR 146.

54If this line of authority is correct it follows that all that is needed to establish the payment was corrupt is that the person who made the payment did so deliberately with the intention that the person to whom it was addressed should enter into a corrupt bargain: Regina v Smith supra at 428 and Jagdeo Singh v State of Trinidad and Tobago supra at [15] and [16]. In Regina v Smith it was accepted by Lord Parker CJ (at 428) that this interpretation to a large extent means that the inclusion of the word corruption added nothing to the meaning of the section. To that it might be added that the reference to an intention to enter into a corrupt bargain is not reflected in the language of s 249B of the Act or for that matter in the language of the section under consideration in Regina v Smith (s 1(2) of the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 (UK)).

55By contrast in R v Turner [2001] WASCA 344; (2001) 25 WAR 258, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, in considering the Western Australian equivalent of s 249B of the Act, emphasised (Burchett AUJ at [10], Malcolm CJ and Wheeler J agreeing) that the section was not concerned with the whole universe of corruption as distinct from that which is related to the performance of the duties of an agent. Burchett AUJ considered the corruption in that sense involved the betrayal of trust or at least a debasement of the disinterestedness a principal is entitled to expect of an agent. He said that corruption so understood did not sit with openness or true assent by the principal. In the result he reached the following conclusion:

""[13] In my opinion, these authorities confirm that the sections are directed at the specified conduct done with the intention (properly described as corrupt) of seducing an agent from the duty owed to their principal or of rewarding the forsaking of that duty in favour of another. Consistently with this view of the sections, they will not apply where the principal is known or believed to have assented.""

56In R v Kelly (1992) 92 DLR (4th) 643 the Supreme Court of Canada considered the equivalent section of the Canadian Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46) to s 249B of the Act. The majority, Cory J, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Iacobucci JJ agreeing, rejected the approach in Cooper v Slade supra to the particular section in question. Cory J stated the purpose of the section in the following terms (at 658):

""There can be no doubt that s. 426 acknowledges both the importance of the agency relationship and the necessity of preserving the integrity of that relationship. It confirms that an agent should not be placed in a position which is in conflict with that of the principal. It recognizes that a benefit taken by an agent from a third party will place that agent in a conflict of interest position with the principal unless the benefit is promptly and adequately disclosed. No one should provide an agent with a benefit, knowing the benefit to be secret, in order to influence the agent with regard to the affairs of the principal. To do so corrupts and destroys the agency relationship. The secret benefit renders the advice and services of an agent so suspect that they cannot be accepted.""

In relation to the meaning of corruption he made the following remarks (at 660):

""What meaning should be given to the word 'corruptly' in the context of this section? It is argued that the offence is complete as soon as the agent takes the benefit as consideration for influencing the affairs of the principal. This is based upon decisions such as Cooper v. Slade (1858), 6 H.L.C. 746, 10 E.R. 1488, and R. v. Gallagher (1985), 16 Aust. Crim. R. 215 (Vict. C.C.A.). I cannot accept this position. It stems from the old jurisprudence on the corruption of voters. It is true these cases together with those which deal with the bribery of officials are concerned with the interpretation of 'corruption'. However, they are readily distinguishable from the secret commissions cases. In bribery cases there is no prerequisite that an agency relationship exists. Yet the whole aim and object of s. 426 is the protection of the vulnerable principal and the preservation of the integrity of the agent-principal relationship. Furthermore, the nature of a commission is very different from that of a bribe.

The interpretation of the word corruptly must take place within the context of s. 426 itself. It is a trite rule of statutory interpretation that every word in the statute must be given a meaning. It would be superfluous to include 'corruptly' in the section if the offence were complete upon the taking of the benefit in the circumstances described by the section. The word must add something to the offence.

In my view, 'corruptly', as used in the section, designates secrecy as the corrupting element of the offence. It is the failure to disclose that makes it impossible for the principal to determine whether to act upon the advice of the agent or accept the actions of the agent. It is the non-disclosure which makes the receipt of the commission or reward corrupt. The word 'corruptly', in this context, adds the element of non-disclosure to the actus reus of the offence.""

57McLachlin J (as her Ladyship then was) stated (at 665) that the aspect of mens rea of the offence of taking a secret commission, which is imported by the adverb ""corruptly"", may lie in the awareness of the fact of non-disclosure. She stated (at 668) that if an agent accepts a commission without beforehand or simultaneously advising the principal of the fact, the offence is established. Sopinka J dissented.

58The approach of the Supreme Court of Canada is consistent, in my opinion, with that of the Full Court of South Australia and the Full Court of Western Australia. By contrast the approach of the English and Victorian authorities to which I have referred gives a somewhat wider ambit to the section. Namely, that the requisite mental element is made out if the payment is intentionally given, offered and received for one of the requisite purposes referred to in the subsection.

59Although generally speaking it may make little difference to the result, in my opinion it is an element of the offence that the payment is corrupt. This is so for a number of reasons. First, it can be presumed that the word ""corruptly"" was intended to have some meaning and effect: see for example, Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority supra at 382.

60Second, the mischief to which the section is directed, as was pointed out in R v Turner supra and R v Kelly supra, is to prevent agents from being encouraged to act to the detriment or against the interests of their principals. A construction which gives no meaning to the word ""corruptly"" could in theory catch a payment which was made by a person to another's agent with the consent of the principal. For example where it was agreed between the third party and the principal that the third party would pay the principal's agent for carrying out certain work which would be to the benefit of both the principal and third party.

61Third, care needs to be taken in relying on cases which deal with corrupt or improper payments in different circumstances: see R v Kelly supra at 660. Whilst any payment to influence a voter to vote or to vote in a particular way could be seen to be corrupt, the position may be different in respect of payments made by a third party to another's agent.

62Fourth, the conclusion I have reached is consistent with what was said in the Second Reading Speech to which I have referred in par [44] above.

63In these circumstances it is necessary to demonstrate that the impugned payment was made in circumstances which would be regarded as being corrupt according to standards of conduct generally held. However, as was pointed out in C v Johnson supra, R v Turner supra and R v Kelly supra, a payment to or receipt by an agent without the knowledge or consent of the principal for one or other of the purposes described in s 249B(1)(a) or (2)(a) of the Act or having the tendency to have the effect referred to in s 249B(1)(b) or (2)(b), would generally be regarded as corrupt according to such standards. However, that is a matter for the jury to determine in any particular case.

64Therefore, the requisite mental element for an offence under s 249B(1)(a) or (2)(a) of the Act in my opinion, is that the corrupt benefit is received, in the case of s 249B(1)(a), or given, in the case of (2)(a), as intending it as an inducement or reward on account of one of the purposes referred to in subs (i) and (ii) of s 249B(1)(a) or s 249B(2)(a). Relevantly, in the present case for the charged offence the subject of Count 2 to be established the Crown would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt:

(i)That Mr Sowaid was an agent of NAB.

(ii)That the appellant gave Mr Sowaid a benefit, namely $2,000.00.

(iii)That the appellant gave the benefit intending it as an inducement for Mr Sowaid processing a loan application through NAB.

(iv)That the payment was corrupt according to normally received standards of conduct. The fact of non-disclosure to the principal generally will be sufficient to satisfy this element.

65Although the charge against the appellant was not laid under s 249B(2)(a)(ii) of the Act nor notwithstanding the jury direction under s 249B(2)(b), it is necessary having regard to the grounds of appeal and the submissions to identify the difference in the elements of these offences to the offence under s 249B(2)(a)(i) with which the appellant was charged.

66For the transaction in question to constitute an offence by the appellant under s 249B(2)(a)(ii) of the Act it would have been necessary for the Crown to prove:

(i) That Mr Sowaid was an agent of NAB.

(ii) That the appellant gave Mr Sowaid a benefit, namely $2,000.00.

(iii) That the payment was made by the appellant as an inducement to show favour to the appellant in relation to the processing of the loan application through NAB.

(iv) That the payment was corrupt according to normally received standards of conduct.

67For the transaction to constitute an offence by the appellant under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act it would be necessary for the Crown to prove:

(i) That Mr Sowaid was an agent of NAB.

(ii) That the appellant gave Mr Sowaid a benefit, namely, $2,000.00.

(iii) That the payment was one which objectively speaking would tend to influence the agent, Mr Sowaid, to show favour in relation to the processing of the loan application through NAB.

(iv) That the payment was made by the appellant intending, knowing or believing that it would tend to influence Mr Sowaid to show the appellant favour in relation to the processing of the loan application.

(v) That the payment was corrupt according to normally received standards of conduct.

I have elaborated on the reasons the matter in subpars (iii) and (iv) above are elements of the offence in dealing with Ground 2 below.

68The differences in the elements of each offence can be summarised as follows. For a benefit or offer of a benefit to constitute an offence under s 249B(2)(a)(i) of the Act, it is necessary to establish that the donor of the benefit intended the benefit or offer as an inducement to the agent to do or refrain from doing a particular act in relation to the principal's affairs (or as a reward for doing or refraining from doing such an act).

69By contrast, s 249B(2)(a)(ii) of the Act does not require the payment to be an inducement or reward for doing or not doing a particular act. Rather it requires that the payment was intended by the donor as an inducement or reward for showing or not showing favour to a particular person in relation to the affairs of the principal. 

70The difference between the elements of s 249B(2)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Act with s 249B(2)(b) is that, for the purposes of the latter section, the donor, whilst not offering the payment or benefit as an inducement or reward, must make the payment or offer to make the payment knowing, believing or intending that the payment was one which would tend to influence the agent to show favour or disfavour in relation to the affairs or business of the principal of the agent.

71With that background it is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal.

The parties' submissions and consideration of the grounds of appeal

Ground 1 

""His Honour erred in directing the jury, impermissibly, that it could convict the appellant of Count 2 on a basis, other than that contended for by the Crown""

(a) The appellant's submissions

72The appellant referred to the manner the Crown opened its case to which I have referred in par [25] above and to the conflicting evidence of Mr Sowaid and the appellant as to what was said when the money was handed over (see pars [17]-[20]). He submitted that having regard to the manner in which the Crown had addressed prior to the exchange with the trial judge to which I have referred in par [28] above, the Crown accepted that if the jury found the appellant's account might have been true the appellant was entitled to an acquittal. He submitted it was not the Crown case that if the payment was in fact for overtime, the appellant was still liable to be convicted. 

73In that regard the appellant pointed to the fact that subsequently in his address to the jury the Crown suggested that the purpose of the money being handed over was so Mr Sowaid would turn a blind eye to the financials. 

74In that context the appellant submitted that those portions of the summing-up to which I have referred to in pars [31], [32] and [35] above, in which the trial judge directed the jury in terms that the appellant might be convicted on his own account, was not contended for by the Crown. The appellant also contended that the trial judge incorrectly told the jury that this basis was in fact relied upon by the Crown.

75The appellant submitted that what occurred constituted a miscarriage of justice, pointing to the fact that at a minimum, injustice occurred by reason of the inability of counsel for the appellant to address the issue. He pointed to the fact that objection was taken but the judge refused to say anything more to the jury.

76The appellant also referred to what the judge said was meant by ""showing favour"" in the direction to which I have referred to in par [36] above. He submitted the statement, ""[s]howing favour does not only mean processing a loan application or having the loan granted. It might, subject to what you decide, it might mean other things as well"", allowed the jury to find that payment was corrupt without any reference to the purpose for which it was made and received.

77The appellant also submitted that because what was alleged on Count 2 was relied upon as an overt act in respect to the conspiracy count (Count 1), the misdirection had the potential also to affect that count.

78At the hearing senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the direction had added force as it came directly from the judge rather than through the Crown. He emphasised the procedural unfairness flowing from the fact that there was no opportunity to address on the issue. He submitted that this was the case even if as a matter of law the appellant could be convicted on the basis that his intention was that the payment be a payment for overtime.

79Senior counsel for the appellant accepted that although there was a discussion about particulars, there was no application to have the direction withdrawn, to address the jury on the issue, or to have the jury discharged.

(b) The Crown's submissions

80The Crown submitted that the question of whether the payment was an overtime payment was not opened by the Crown. It was submitted that once it arose in the appellant's case it was permissible for the Crown to rely on it.

81The Crown submitted, relying on R v Lykouras [2005] NSWCCA 8, that the question was whether the trial was rendered unfair. The Crown submitted that this result did not follow.

82The Crown submitted that any error would not affect Count 1.

83At the hearing senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the statement by the prosecutor referred to in par [29] also raised the issue the subject of the complaint in this ground of appeal. She accepted, however, that the primary case at the hearing was that Mr Sowaid's evidence should be accepted. Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the direction did not have greater force coming from the judge rather than from the Crown.

84Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that if the appellant could be convicted on the basis that what he said about the purpose of the payment was true, then the direction given was appropriate. If he could not be so convicted on that basis, she accepted that the direction would have been erroneous but the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the proviso) would apply.

(c) Consideration

85I have set out particulars of the opening and closing remarks of the Crown and the evidence of Mr Sowaid and the appellant as to the circumstances the money came to be handed over in pars [17]-[20], [25], [27] and [29] above. It seems to me that the case put by the Crown at trial was that even if the payment was described as a payment for overtime, the jury should not accept that that was its purpose and it was made with a corrupt intent. The Crown did not seek to mount a case that if the payment was only to encourage Mr Sowaid to process the loan application on the weekend, he could still be convicted of the offence the subject of Count 2.

86The summing-up by the trial judge put the case more widely. In that portion of his direction to the jury to which I have referred in pars [31], [32] and [35] he stated that even if the purpose of the payment was as alleged by the appellant he could be found guilty of the offence.

87For the reasons I have given in dealing with Grounds 2 and 3, it would be open to the jury to conclude that even if the payment was intended to compensate Mr Sowaid for working on the appellant's loan application on the weekend, there was a contravention of at least s 249B(2)(a)(i) of the Act. Such a payment could be found to be a reward for doing something in relation to the affairs of the principal and it would be open to the jury to find that a non-disclosed payment made in the particular circumstances in which it was made was corrupt. As I indicated in dealing with Grounds 2 and 3 below, it is not necessary for there to be an actual showing of favour or that the assets of the principal were in peril.

88The critical concern is whether the raising of the issue by the trial judge resulted in a miscarriage of justice. As was pointed out in R v Lykouras supra (at [22]-[24]), this depends on whether the trial was unfair as a result of the trial judge raising the issue.

89In Robinson v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 192; (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 Johnson J (at [137]-[149]), with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J relevantly agreed, set out in detail the relevant legal principles arising from a trial judge leaving to a jury a possible basis of conviction not relied on by the Crown. I would respectfully adopt what his Honour said in those paragraphs. His Honour explained (at [146]) that even if the prejudice was confined to the inability to address the jury upon that question, that itself is capable of being a most significant area of prejudice.

90Having regard to the manner in which the trial developed it may well be that the evidence led and the approach taken by the defence counsel would not have been different. However, counsel for the appellant was deprived of the opportunity to address on whether the offence was made out if the jury accepted the $2,000.00 was in fact paid by the appellant with the intention that it compensate Mr Sowaid for overtime, and in particular, whether such a payment in the circumstances in which it was made was corrupt according to normally received standards of conduct.

91Whether or not the proviso could apply if this was the only ground of appeal need not be considered. As I have indicated subsequently, Ground 7 is also made out and it is not appropriate to apply the proviso in relation to that ground. The fact that this additional error was made reinforces that conclusion.

92It was submitted that this error also infected the jury's decision on Count 1. I do not agree. I have set out the trial judge's direction on this count in pars [33], [34] and [37] above. The jury was directed that the $2,000.00 payment was relevant to the conspiracy charge. However, it was emphasised by the trial judge that the Crown said it was not an overtime payment. In the concluding part of the direction which I have set out in par [37], the trial judge stated that if the payment was described as overtime, the appellant could be convicted on the charge brought against him alone, namely, Count 2. However, the trial judge did not direct that a payment in fact for overtime could support the conspiracy charge (Count 1).

Grounds 2, 3 and 7

93The submissions on these grounds focus on s 249B(2)(b) of the Act notwithstanding the fact that Count 2 of the indictment alleged a contravention of s 249B(2)(a)(i). As it emerged on appeal it was common ground that the trial judge erroneously directed the jury on the wrong subsection. This is the subject of Ground 7.

94Grounds 2 and 7 overlap to the extent that the outcome of Ground 7 will be affected by the conclusion reached on Ground 2. In these circumstances, it is convenient to deal with these grounds together. Further, Ground 3 raises somewhat similar issues of construction and can be dealt with conveniently in conjunction with Grounds 2 and 7.

(i) Ground 2

""His Honour erred in directing the jury that the appellant would be guilty of Count 2, without proof that the receipt of the money would actually influence Mr Sowaid to show favour to the appellant in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank""

(a) The appellant's submissions

95The appellant submitted that the words ""would in any way tend"" in s 249B(2)(b) of the Act can only be satisfied if the benefit has the capacity to influence the recipient. That is, he submitted the benefit must have the effect of predisposing the recipient to show favour. He emphasised the use of the word ""would"" in the subsection rather than the word ""could"". The appellant, however, submitted that it was not necessary to demonstrate that favour or disfavour in fact was shown but rather that it influenced the recipient to do so.

96The appellant submitted that in these circumstances the note to the written directions would confuse the jury because it contrasted actual or real influence with tendency to influence. He submitted that the jury should have been directed that it was required to find that the benefit actually influenced the recipient to show favour. He further submitted that the statement in the summing-up, to the effect that the Crown did not have to prove the receipt of money would actually influence Mr Sowaid, was incorrect.

(b) The Crown's submissions

97The Crown submitted that as the point was not taken in the Court below leave was required by virtue of the provisions of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) (the Rules).

98The Crown submitted that the construction of s 249B(2) of the Act contended for by the appellant was inconsistent with the words of the subsection. The Crown submitted that if the legislative intention was to require that the recipient actually be influenced, this would have been made clear in the language of the subsection. The Crown also submitted that this construction was inconsistent with what was said by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Gallagher supra concerning the construction of a similar section.

(c) Consideration

99The appellant's contention that it is necessary for the Crown to prove that the recipient was actually influenced to show favour or disfavour, whilst not being required to prove that favour or disfavour was in fact shown, is a fine distinction for which no authority was cited and which, in my opinion, is not justified by the words of the section.

100The words in s 249B(2)(b) of the Act, ""would in any way tend to influence the agent"", invite attention to the question of whether the payment would have that tendency, not that in fact it operated on the agent either pre-disposing him to show favour or in fact causing him to show favour. Rather, the payment has to be one which objectively speaking would have that tendency whether it influenced the agent or not.

101The construction proposed by the appellant would mean that the commission of an offence under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act would depend on the state of mind of the recipient of the payment and not that of the person charged with the offence. It would also mean that in respect of an offence charged under s 249B(1)(a)(ii) an agent would not be liable if he accepted the corrupt payment without having any intention to be influenced by it. Such a construction is unlikely to have been intended by the legislature.

102In R v Gallagher supra the Court emphasised (at 226) that it is the intention of the person charged, whether giving or receiving the payment as the case may be, which is relevant in deciding whether the behaviour charged is corrupt: see also R v Jamieson supra at 883-884. These authorities are inconsistent with the contention relied upon by the appellant. In the latter case, Young CJ stated the mental element of the offence in terms consistent with the manner I have explained it in par [67] above.

103To establish the offence (in the way the trial judge directed the jury) it was necessary for the Crown to prove that objectively speaking the payment would be one which would tend to influence the recipient to show favour. In my opinion this is consistent with the words of the section. A contrary construction involves reading the words ""would in any way tend to influence the agent"" as ""influence the agent"". Neither the language of the section nor its context requires such an interpretation.

104It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

(ii) Ground 3 

""His Honour erred in directing the jury that it would be open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant had acted corruptly, even if, as he stated in his evidence, his intent was only to compensate Mr Sowaid for working overtime on the loan application, and thereby impermissibly discounting the possibility that it would be open to the jury to find that Mr Sowaid's role in so doing was not something done in relation to the affairs or business of the National Australia Bank""

(a) The appellant's submissions

105The appellant submitted that the charge the subject of Count 2 could not be made out simply if the appellant paid Mr Sowaid to work overtime. Rather he submitted the prosecution was required to prove that the person giving him the benefit intended that the recipient show favour by doing an act detrimental to the affairs or business of the principal.

106The appellant submitted that in the present case there was no evidence that NAB would have been harmed in any way had Mr Sowaid worked overtime to complete the processing of the loan application. He submitted the problem was compounded by the analogy with a motor registry queue used by the trial judge to explain this element of the offence.

107Senior counsel for the appellant emphasised the offence was a corruption offence. In answer to a question as to what was the mental element, he submitted the intention ""has got to be that there's something wrong that's to the detriment of the principal"". He submitted that if all that was being asked was that someone work on a weekend when ""you're not bumping someone out of a queue"" (referring to the motor registry example), where favourable treatment by working on a lower loan to equity ratio was not given, then there was no corruption even if there was a side payment. He said there had to be an intention to corrupt the agent and some detriment had to be shown. He accepted there was no requirement to prove actual detriment but said that an intention to cause detriment was necessary.

(b) The Crown's submissions

108The Crown submitted that as no objection was taken to the direction at the trial leave to raise this ground was required by virtue of r 4 of the Rules. It was submitted that there was no requirement in the subsection that there be a detriment to the principal and that the jury were directed correctly in relation to showing favour.

(c) Consideration

109The language of the section does not require that what is done by the agent as a result of the inducement or that any favour or disfavour shown by the agent needs to be to the detriment of the principal.

110As was stated by Burchett AUJ in R v Turner supra (at [10] and [13]) and by Cory J in R v Kelly supra (at 658) the purpose of the section is to avoid an agent being placed in a position of conflict or being induced to breach the trust shown in him or her by the principal. The position was succinctly stated by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R v Wellburn supra (at 265):

""The mischief aimed at by the modern statutes dealing with corruption is to prevent agents and public servants being put in positions of temptation.""

111A construction which required proof beyond reasonable doubt that the principal was in fact imperilled would significantly undermine this objective.

112Further, the proposition the subject of this ground was expressly rejected by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Gallagher v R [1987] VicSC 352; (1987) 29 A Crim R 33. In dealing with a submission similar to that made in the present case the Full Court made the following remarks (at 35-36):

""Grounds 3 and 3A assert misdirection as to the meaning of the words 'would in any way tend to influence him to show or to forbear to show favour or disfavour' in s176(1)(b). It was argued that nothing could be regarded as favour or disfavour for the purposes of the sub-section unless it was something that was at least capable of causing detriment to the principal. It might be said that, where the question is whether the receipt of something by an agent would in any way tend to influence him to show or to forbear to show favour or disfavour in relation to his principal's affairs or business, the very notion that the receipt of the benefit would tend to influence the agent to show or to forbear to show favour or disfavour carries with it a detriment to the principal, in that his agent is being exposed to temptation. There is a danger of the agent's being influenced by an improper motive: this is in a sense detrimental to the principal whether or not the agent yields to the temptation to act or not to act in a certain way and whether or not any resulting act or omission of his causes detriment in a more narrow sense to his principal. It is bad for a principal to have his agents exposed to corrupting influences, whether or not they are corruptible and whether or not any actual damage is occasioned to the principal by acts or omissions resulting from the corrupting influence. One reason for this is that it is difficult to think of any act of favouritism, however small, that could not conceivably do some actual damage, again however small, to the interests of the principal.""

113I respectfully agree.

114It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

(iii) Ground 7

""His Honour erred in directing the jury as to the elements of Count 2 in that such elements related to a different offence to the actual offence charged as Count 2 on the indictment""

(a) The appellant's submissions

115The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in directing the jury on the elements of Count 2, directing them to the elements of an offence under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act rather than s 249B(2)(a)(i), the subject of the charge preferred in the indictment.

116The appellant contended if this was correct it was not appropriate for the Court to exercise its powers under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty for an offence under s 249B(2)(a)(i) of the Act. There is a difficulty with this submission as the appellant was in fact convicted of an offence charged under the latter section. That was why the Crown, in contrast to the appellant, sought by way of substitution a conviction for an offence under s 249B(2)(b) rather than a conviction of an offence under s 249B(2)(a)(i) for which the appellant was convicted.

117Consistently with the submission to which I have just referred, the appellant submitted that if the Crown was correct (and it was not necessary to prove actual influence to establish the offence under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act), it could not be said that the jury were satisfied of all the elements required to establish a charge under s 249B(2)(a)(i). The appellant submitted this was because that subsection required proof of actual inducement.

118In further supplementary submissions filed on 21 May 2014 the appellant pointed out that s 249B formed part of Pt 4A of the Act and replaced the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act (NSW). He pointed to the fact that the equivalent provisions in Victoria have been construed as importing a ""mala fide or wrongful intention"" involving dishonesty and that a benefit had been corruptly given if offered with the intent of influencing an agent in relation to the affairs of the principal.

119The appellant submitted that it was therefore necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender must have provided a benefit with the intention that its receipt would influence an agent in relation to the affairs of that agent's principal. He submitted that as the offence was one of corruption there was an aspect of dishonesty. He submitted that the accused must intend corruptly to seduce the agent to forsake his or her duty. He submitted a payment with a request to work harder would never suffice.

120The appellant again submitted that s 249B(2)(a)(i) of the Act required the benefit to have an actual effect, something not required by s 249B(2)(b). He referred to the fact that s 249B(2)(a) referred to an inducement as distinct from s 249B(2)(b) which referred to a tendency to induce.

121The appellant accepted that most corruptly given benefits which are acted upon and constitute an offence under s 249B(2)(a) of the Act will constitute an offence under s 249B(2)(b). He submitted the converse was not always the case by reason of the fact that on his submission s 249B(2)(b) could apply in circumstances where the benefit may tend to influence the agent to show favour but where no actual steps to show favour or disfavour took place.

122The appellant submitted that the irregularity in the summing-up was so fundamental that a proper trial did not take place with respect to Count 2. He submitted that in these circumstances neither r 4 of the Rules or the proviso had any application.

123In relation to s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the appellant in his further supplementary submissions proceeded on the assumption that what was sought by the Crown was that the power in that subsection be exercised to substitute a conviction under s 249B(2)(a)(i) of the Act for a conviction under s 249B(2)(b). However this ignores the fact that the accused was convicted of a charge alleging a contravention of the former section albeit the jury was directed to the elements of the latter.

124The appellant submitted that as there was insufficient evidence to establish Count 2 and where the Crown might put a fresh case which necessitates a substantial amendment to the indictment it would not be appropriate to order a new trial. Counsel for the appellant pointed out, referring to Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; (2000) 201 CLR 603 at [43], that for the power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to be exercised it was necessary for the Court to be satisfied to the point of certitude that the jury found certain acts and omissions that as a matter of law made the accused guilty of the other offence.

125Counsel for the appellant referred to his submissions on Ground 2. He stated that if his submission that the words ""tend to influence"" in s 249B(2)(b) of the Act required the recipient actually be influenced was incorrect, then s 249B(2)(b) had a much lower factual threshold than s 249B(2)(a)(i). Counsel for the appellant further submitted that the offence under s 249B(2)(b) was not a lesser offence.

(b) The Crown's submissions

126The Crown submitted that the evidence at the trial was equally relevant to both subsections and there was no apparent disadvantage or prejudice. It was submitted that the jury was satisfied that in addition to the appellant acting corruptly the payment would tend to influence the agent to show favour. The Crown submitted that this satisfaction extended to an acceptance that the payment was an inducement for the agent to do something, namely process a loan application.

127The Crown submitted that in these circumstances there was no miscarriage of justice.

128In the alternative the Crown sought a substituted verdict under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, submitting that the jury were satisfied of the elements of the offence under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act. It submitted that the verdict for that offence, being no more serious, could be substituted.

129The Crown submitted that if these submissions were not accepted there should not be a verdict of acquittal but rather the Court should order a new trial.

(c) Consideration

130There was no issue between the parties that the trial judge mistakenly directed the jury as to the elements of Count 2 by giving a direction consistent with an offence involving a contravention of s 249B(2)(b) of the Act rather than an offence under s 249B(2)(a)(i) with which the appellant was charged.

131No objection was taken to the direction by counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial. In these circumstances r 4 of the Rules applies.

132The ground of appeal raises three issues. First, did the misdirection give rise to a miscarriage of justice such that leave should be given to appeal? Second and related to the first issue, was the error of such a fundamental nature to preclude the operation of the proviso? Third, is the case one where it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act and substitute a verdict for a contravention of s 249B(2)(b) of the Act in lieu of the verdict entered on Count 2?

133It is convenient to deal with the second issue first. 

134It is clear that irrespective of the strength of the Crown case there are circumstances where the miscarriage of justice which has occurred means that it is inappropriate to apply the proviso. In Wilde v The Queen [1988] HCA 6; (1988) 164 CLR 365 it was pointed out (at 373) that the proviso has no application where there has been such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that the irregularity goes to the root of the proceedings. However, as has been pointed out subsequently, there is no rigid formula for determining the circumstances in which the particular error or misdirection caused such a miscarriage of justice to render the proviso inapplicable: AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438 at [54], Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; (2008) 236 CLR 293 at [17] and [33]-[34], Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; (2012) 246 CLR 92 at [21]-[24] and Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29; (2012) 247 CLR 531 at [127].

135In the present case the jury was directed as to the wrong offence. The effect was that they were not instructed on the elements they were required to consider before entering a verdict. It is an essential feature of a jury trial that a jury is directed as to the relevant law to the extent necessary, the direction as to the law being given in the context of the facts of the case: Alford v Magee [1952] HCA 3; (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466 and Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; (2013) 87 ALJR 434 at [31]. A direction as to the wrong charge means essentially that the jury did not consider the guilt or innocence of the accused on the charge for which he was indicted: c/f Andrews v The Queen [1968] HCA 84; (1968) 126 CLR 198 at 207. The miscarriage of justice in these circumstances was substantial and it is inappropriate to apply the proviso.

136For the same reasons leave should be granted to raise the ground of appeal notwithstanding the failure to take issue with the directions at the trial.

137That leaves the question of whether it is appropriate to exercise the power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act and substitute for the conviction a conviction under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act.

138Section 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act was considered by the High Court in Spies v The Queen supra. The plurality judgment set out the following principles relating to the operation of the section (at [23], [25]-[26], [27] and [43] and [47] respectively):

(a) The power conferred by s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act is most likely to be exercised where the offence is wholly within the ultimate facts on which the accused has been convicted and which the Court has set aside on appeal. The plurality gave the example of the offence of common assault being wholly encompassed with the offence of assault causing grievous bodily harm.

(b) The offence must be one which was open on the indictment. The Court pointed out that in cases where the other offence was not one which was wholly within the ultimate facts of the first offence, the other offence was included on the indictment as an alternate count.

(c) It must appear to the Court that, having regard to the evidence, the conviction on the charge which is quashed necessarily meant that the accused was guilty of acts or omissions which, as a matter of law, constitute the other offence. Where the ground for setting aside a conviction is a misdirection the section can only apply where the Court holds that the jury must have been satisfied as to facts underlying the conviction which are unaffected by the misdirection and which constitute the other offence.

(d) The power is one which must be exercised with great caution.

139The present case is an unusual one. The jury were directed in a manner generally appropriate to an offence under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act (see the written directions in par [30] above). It will be apparent from what I have said above that the direction should have added that the payment was one which would have been objectively seen as corrupt. However, having regard to the secretive nature and the manner in which it occurred I do not believe there was any miscarriage of justice arising from the absence of that direction.

140Assuming the jury followed the judge's directions (see Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] and HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [52] and [353]) it must follow that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offence set out in the written direction. I am also satisfied that having regard to the circumstance in which the payment was made the jury were satisfied that the payment was corrupt irrespective of whether the version of events given by Mr Sowaid or by the appellant was correct.

141However notwithstanding these factors I would not apply s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act for two reasons. First, having regard to the different elements of the s 249B(2)(b) offence it could not be said the offence was wholly within the ultimate facts needed to prove a charge under s 249B(2)(a)(i) of the Act. Second, unlike the position in Spies v The Queen supra there was no alternative charge on the indictment. For these reasons the second condition on the exercise of the power referred to in Spies v The Queen is not made out.

142In addition as was said in Spies v The Queen supra the section needs to be applied with great caution. I have concluded that the matter arising from this direction, particularly in conjunction with the complaint the subject of Ground 1, meant that this was not a case where it is appropriate to apply the proviso. In particular, where counsel for the appellant did not have an opportunity to either address on the different elements of the alternate verdict or on the question of whether there was corrupt conduct if the payment was for the purpose identified by the appellant, it does not seem to me to be just to exercise the power to amend the offence for which the appellant has been convicted and thereby avoid the consequences which would otherwise arise from the miscarriage of justice which occurred.

143It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out.

Ground 4

""His Honour erred in directing the jury in relation to both Counts 1 and 2 that it was immaterial that the appellant might have had no intent to deprive corruptly the National Australia Bank of property or place the bank's economic interests in jeopardy, thereby on Count 1 equating the Crown case to one of making false and misleading statements with the intent to obtain a financial advantage and on Count 2 impermissibly widening the effect of his Honour's directions on the meaning of the expression 'in relation to the affairs or business of the agent's principal'""

(a) The appellant's submissions

144The appellant submitted the direction given by the trial judge to the jury on Count 1 was deficient in that he failed to direct the jury to consider whether the appellant intended to imperil the assets of NAB. He submitted that absent such an explanation and in light of the statement by the trial judge that the offence can be committed even if no loss is intended, the jury may have considered that the use of dishonest means and an intention to obtain property was sufficient to make out the offence.

145The appellant submitted, referring to Peters v The Queen [1998] HCA 7; (1998) 192 CLR 493, that the mental element of the count of conspiracy to defraud (Count 1) is the intention to prejudice the interest of third parties by the use of means that are dishonest. He submitted that the trial judge failed to explain how a person could use dishonest methods to deprive another person of his property yet at the same time intend to return that property.

146The appellant submitted it was not sufficient to establish a conspiracy to defraud to show the appellant was party to an agreement to provide false information. He submitted that the direction left it open to the jury to find the appellant guilty without being satisfied that the appellant had an intention to prejudice NAB.

147Senior counsel for the appellant accepted that it would be sufficient to make out the offence that the appellant and his co-conspirators intended to imperil the rights and interests of NAB but submitted that the way the case was put was that the requisite intent was to deprive the bank of its property.

(b) The Crown's submissions

148The Crown submitted that the element of intention to imperil the rights and interests of NAB was contained within the jury being satisfied the loan was sought to be obtained through dishonesty. The Crown submitted that the economic interest of NAB would be imperilled if the appellant's financial position had been misrepresented to reflect greater assets.

149The Crown submitted that even if there was a misdirection the appellant did not lose a realistic chance of an acquittal. It was also submitted that as no complaint about the direction was raised at the trial, r 4 of the Rules applied and in effect the appellant did not demonstrate a miscarriage of justice.

(c) Consideration

150This ground, which relates to Count 1, can be dealt with shortly. The trial judge described the expression to ""cheat and defraud"" as intentionally using ""dishonest methods to deprive another person of his or her property"" (par [30] above). The portion of the directions to the jury complained of is the direction referred to in par [34] above where the trial judge said the offence can still be committed even if those involved intended for NAB to be repaid. 

151In Peters v The Queen supra Toohey and Gaudron JJ pointed out (at [33]) that a corresponding Commonwealth offence involved an agreement to bring about a situation prejudicing or imperilling existing legal rights or interests of others. McHugh J summarised the position as follows (at [73]):

""Although most cases of conspiracy to defraud involve an agreement to use dishonest means which has the effect of inflicting economic loss on a third party, the infliction of such loss is not an essential element of the offence. It is sufficient that the conspirators intended to obtain some advantage for themselves by putting another person's property at risk or depriving another person of a lawful opportunity to obtain or protect property. It is also well established that a conspiracy to defraud may be established if the defendants agree to deceive a person into acting or refraining from acting contrary to his or her public duty.""
(Citations omitted).

152The case against the appellant was that he conspired to defraud NAB by obtaining a loan relying on inflated financial statements and other information which were known by him to be false. The result of this would be to put the funds of NAB at risk and deprive it of a lawful opportunity to protect its property. The fact that there may have been an intention to repay does not affect the position.

153In these circumstances the direction was correct. No complaint was made about it at the trial and r 4 of the Rules applies. The appellant has not demonstrated any miscarriage of justice. In those circumstances leave to raise this ground should be refused.

Ground 5

""In erroneously directing the jury that it could convict the appellant on Count 2 even on his own ""version"", his Honour further erred in undermining the character direction otherwise given in relation to the appellant""

(a) The appellant's submissions

154The appellant submitted that the concluding statement in the passage of the summing-up to which I have referred in par [32] above, ""...the Crown says that even on [the appellant's] version when he handed over the $2,000.00 he was doing it dishonestly"", completely undermined the good character direction.

155Senior counsel for the appellant submitted the direction was undermined by effectively linking the question of good character to the offence charged which was not at that stage proved.

(b) The Crown's submissions

156The Crown submitted that all the trial judge had done was to remind the jury that in the Crown case the appellant had acted dishonestly even if his own evidence was accepted. It was submitted that the jury was well instructed on the question of good character and the remarks now complained of did not undermine the direction.

157The appellant submitted that as no complaint was made at the trial r 4 of the Rules applied and the appellant had not demonstrated that there was a miscarriage of justice.

(c) Consideration

158This ground of appeal does not relate to the character direction itself but rather to the remarks which were made immediately after the direction was given. 

159It must be remembered that after the remarks complained of were made the trial judge expressly stated he did not seek to undermine the good character direction he had given.

160It does not seem to me that in those circumstances the direction was undermined. No complaint was made at the trial and the appellant has not demonstrated any miscarriage of justice. Rule 4 of the Rules applies and leave to raise this ground should be refused.

Ground 6

""When directing the jury that it could return a majority verdict, his Honour erred:

(a) In failing to direct the jury that it should continue to strive for a unanimous verdict; and

(b) In telling the jury that the Court would be surprised, if the jury would not indicate well before 4 o'clock, that is to say, in well under 30 minutes, that it could not reach a majority verdict""

(a) The appellant's submissions

161The appellant referred to the fact that the jury retired on 19 July 2013 and informed the trial judge on Friday 26 July 2013 that they were unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy count (Count 1). Accordingly the trial judge gave a Black direction (Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; (1993) 179 CLR 44).

162Later in the day the jury sent a note saying they could not come to an unanimous verdict. The trial judge then questioned the foreman in accordance with s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) and determined that it was very unlikely the jury would reach a unanimous decision. The trial judge then gave the following direction to the jury:

""So what I am going to ask you to do is to go back to the jury room and see if you can reach a verdict on which ten of you agree. Now I am sure over the last 34 hours and 12 minutes you have discussed arguments over and over again, and there is probably not much more that you can discuss. So even after a relatively short period of time it becomes clear to you that you will not be able to reach a majority verdict, that is, one which ten of you agree on, then let me know. Given the length of time you have been deliberating, I would not be surprised if by well before four o'clock you are able to tell me whether there is or is not a possibility of reaching a majority verdict.

So would you go and continue your deliberations to see if you can reach a verdict on which ten of you agree. As I say, given the length of time you have already been deliberating, I expect that you will soon be able to decide whether it is likely you will be able to reach a verdict where ten of you agree or whether it is not. So just see how you get on and let me know.""

163The direction was given at around 3.30pm. A majority verdict was returned at 4.02 pm. 

164It should be noted that the jury at that stage only had 11 members, the 12th having been discharged on 14 July 2013 due to illness.

165The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they should continue to strive to reach a unanimous verdict. He also submitted that the comments of the trial judge, ""...I would not be surprised if by well before four o'clock you are able to tell me whether there is or is not a possibility of reaching a majority verdict"", placed additional pressure on the jury substantially increasing the chance of an ill considered or unwanted verdict.

166The appellant submitted that having regard to the time, late on a Friday afternoon, the trial judge ought to have been scrupulous that no pressure was brought to bear on the jury. He submitted that the majority verdict direction was ""very much productive of a miscarriage of justice"".

(b) The Crown's submissions

167The Crown pointed to the fact that notwithstanding what appears in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book there was no requirement in the Jury Act that a majority verdict direction should encourage the jury to continue to strive for a unanimous verdict.

168The Crown submitted that having regard to the length of time the jury had deliberated it would have been pointless to give such a direction.

169The Crown pointed out that the judge did not indicate that there was any time constraint and merely invited the jury to indicate if a majority verdict was possible or whether continued deliberations were futile.

170The Crown submitted that there was no suggestion that there was a danger of a hasty or unjust verdict and in these circumstances there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.

(c) Consideration

171The appellant in support of this ground placed considerable reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Victoria in R v Muto and Eastey [1996] 1 VR 336, in which the Court of Appeal in Victoria set out certain guidelines to be followed by Courts in that State when giving directions in relation to majority verdicts. The Court suggested (at 342) that the direction to the jury should include the fact that Parliament had given the judge a discretion to take a majority verdict but circumstances in which that discretion could be exercised had not arisen and that until they do the jury should consider that the verdict of guilty or not guilty must be unanimous.

172The Court of Appeal then said that if a perseverance direction (a Black direction) was required before the time for a majority verdict had arrived, the judge should add to the model direction in Black (Black v The Queen supra at 51-52) a statement that ""the circumstances in which I may take a majority verdict have not yet arisen and you should still consider that your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be unanimous"".

173The Court of Appeal also said (at 343) that when the time for a majority verdict had arisen the judge should tell the jury it was preferable to strive to reach a unanimous verdict.

174The trial judge did not mention the possibility of a majority verdict in his initial direction to the jury. In his Black direction he referred to the fact that the time he could take a majority verdict had not arisen. This was consistent with the approach suggested in R v Muto and Eastey supra: c/f RJS v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 241; (2007) 173 A Crim R 100 and R v Hanna [2008] NSWCCA 173; (2008) 73 NSWLR 390, but see Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88. Because no complaint was made concerning the Black direction it is unnecessary to consider the conflicting authorities as to the desirability of including in a Black direction a reference to a possibility of a majority verdict.

175The appellant's complaint is that the concluding direction given by the trial judge did not urge the jury to strive for a unanimous verdict.

176In my opinion in the circumstances of the present case, whilst it would have been desirable to include a direction to that effect, a failure to do so did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. There is no issue that at the time the majority verdict was given it was appropriate to give a majority verdict direction. Further, the jury both before and after the Black direction indicated that they could not come to a unanimous verdict. By the time they had indicated this for the second time, they had been deliberating for 34 hours and 12 minutes. In these circumstances a further direction to strive for a unanimous verdict, although desirable, would in all probability have been futile and the failure to give such a direction did not amount to a miscarriage of justice.

177No objection was taken to the direction at the time it was given.

178The second complaint about the final direction was that it put improper pressure on the jury to reach a verdict. However, that complaint must be considered in the context that not only was a direction of the nature of that given not objected to, it was raised with counsel prior to it being made and agreed to. This appears from the following interchange:

""HIS HONOUR: This note says simply 'We cannot come to a unanimous decision'. What I propose to do is tell the jury I will now accept a majority verdict from them. But given the length of time that they have been deliberating I propose to say to them that unless they can come to a majority verdict fairly quickly, perhaps by four o'clock today, that that would tend to suggest they are not going to reach a majority verdict and I would discharge them. Mr Crown do you want to say anything about that?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr McKeand.

MCKEAND: No, your Honour.""

179In these circumstances r 4 of the Rules applies to this ground and the onus lies on the appellant to show that the direction gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. I do not believe this onus has been discharged. The direction was given after many hours of jury deliberations. It did not pressure the jury to reach a verdict by 4.00pm but rather indicated the belief that they should be shortly able to indicate if a majority verdict was possible. The direction, given with the consent of counsel, did not in my opinion give rise to the danger of a hasty or unjust verdict.

180As I indicated above, the first part of the complaint under this ground also did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. In the circumstances, leave to appeal on this ground should be refused.

Conclusion on conviction appeal

181In the result leave to appeal against the conviction on Count 1 should be refused.

182Grounds 1 and 7 of the appeal against the conviction on Count 2 have been made out. There remains the question of whether there should be a verdict of acquittal on this count, as contended by the appellant, or a new trial.

183In my opinion the miscarriage of justice which has occurred can be more adequately remedied by a new trial than a verdict of acquittal. Even if the Crown did amend the indictment to include as an alternate a count under s 249B(2)(b) of the Act, there is no reason to suggest that the evidence led would be significantly different to that in the present case. Further, having regard to the evidence to which I have referred above, in my opinion it would be open to the jury on that evidence to convict the appellant of an offence either under s 249B(2)(a)(i) or s 249B(2)(b). It is not necessary to go further than to say that the evidence in my opinion establishes a strong case on either offence.

184It follows that the conviction on Count 2 should be quashed and a new trial ordered.

Sentence appeal

185The sentence appeal raised three grounds.

""1. With respect to the sentence imposed for count 2, his Honour erred in finding to the requisite degree that the payment of $2,000 was made by the applicant in an 'attempt to bribe Mr Sowaid to overlook any problems in his loan application"";

2. His Honour erred in not imposing wholly concurrent sentences; and

3. His Honour erred in imposing sentences that were manifestly excessive.""

186As I indicated, the appellant was subjected to a sentence of 3 years on Count 1 with a non-parole period of 18 months, the sentence to date from 18 June 2014. That sentence was partially accumulated on the sentence for a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 18 December 2013 imposed in respect of Count 2.

187Ground 1 of the sentence appeal relates to Count 2 whilst Ground 2 is dependent on the appellant having been convicted for both offences. In those circumstances they are no longer relevant.

188Having regard to the success of the appeal on Count 2 the sentence on Count 1 need at least be varied to commence on 18 December 2013. It remains to be considered whether the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 was manifestly excessive.

Submissions

189The appellant referred to the following findings made by the trial judge:

""a. with respect to count 1, his Honour found that the false resume was prepared by Mohamed Dib [sic] and that the false document setting out the applicant's financial position, was likewise not prepared by the applicant;

b. it was the applicant's intention to repay the money to be borrowed from the bank - it was not the intention to 'take the money and run';

c. no loan was ever granted and so the bank never suffered any loss nor, had the loan been granted, was it likely to have suffered any loss;

d. the fact that the money was to be repaid meant that the conspiracy charge was less culpable than most offences of that type; and

e. until these offences had been committed, the applicant was a man of good character.""
(References omitted).

190The appellant submitted without elaboration that as a consequence of those findings the sentence was manifestly excessive.

Consideration

191It is of course necessary to consider the matter on the basis that it was not proven that the $2,000.00 paid to Mr Sowaid constituted an offence under s 249B(2) of the Act. However, the fact remains that the appellant conspired with at least Mr Diab to cheat and defraud NAB by obtaining a loan in a large sum of money, namely, $3 million. Although in his remarks on sentence the trial judge noted that the appellant did not suggest the manufacture of the false documents, he also found that he warmly embraced the proposal and he stood to benefit from it.

192His Honour took into account the matters referred to in the appellant's submissions and the fact that the appellant was a leader in his community and had done much good work. He referred to the fact the appellant had no previous convictions.

193His Honour also took into account the age of the appellant and the significant delay between the time the offences were committed and the date of sentence.

194Notwithstanding the subjective circumstances referred to by the trial judge, having regard to the amount of money sought to be obtained from NAB and the significant falsification of the financial records (see par [13] above) it does not seem to me that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 and Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59].

195It follows that leave to appeal against sentence should be allowed but apart from varying the sentence to commence on 18 December 2013 no other orders should be made.

Conclusion

196In the result I would make the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal against conviction on Count 1 refused.

(2)Appeal against conviction on Count 2 allowed.

(3)Order that the conviction on Count 2 be quashed.

(4)Order there be a new trial in respect of Count 2.

(5)Grant leave to appeal against sentence.

(6)Order that the sentence imposed on Count 1 be set aside and in lieu thereof the following sentence be imposed:

The appellant be sentenced on Count 1 to a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 18 months, the sentence to date from 18 December 2013. The appellant is to be released to parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 17 June 2015.

		22 August 2014",2014-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764626,R v Chandler [2014] NSWDC 206,"Judgment

Application by Crown to adduce oral testimony of Complainant as to the showing of photographs of suspects to a witness and recording thereof. 

1HIS HONOUR: Objection was taken to the admissibility of evidence of the showing to the victim of the robbery committed upon him in April 2009 a photograph 'identification' process via a computer upon which the witness was invited to comment. My understanding is that the way the Crown would seek to adduce this evidence is by recalling the complainant; presumably asking him questions about the fact that he was involved in such a process and that he made comments about the process and the particular photographs that were shown to him as recorded in the video recording of the exercise. This recording I have seen.

2I do not propose to revisit the detail of what he said in the video which ran for just over 20 minutes, but the witness's statement that was provided as part of the material upon which the Crown relied, given on 15 July 2013 (the day of the attempted photographic identification), at para 7 states:

""During the viewing of the photo array I did not select any males as the person of interest. I did take an extra long look toward the photographs 3 and 5 as they bared (sic) the most resemblance. I would lean more toward photograph 5 being the suspect.""

3The alleged offence being committed on 5 April 2009 and the process of photographic identification occurring on 15 July 2013, is a period, on my calculation, four years three months and ten days after the event. 

4There are a number of factual issues that arise from the material tendered to the Court that need at this stage to be noted: The video of the attempted identification by the witness has been tendered in court, but to assist, in fact at my request, a transcript has been taken out, the reliability of which I entrust to the parties to have checked. Also, the computer program's manipulation or use was produced as a DVD/CD to check the number of times the complainant reviewed the photo array. 

5Although some of the things said by the victim in the course of the 'identification' process are not clearly heard when viewing the video, it is clearly heard at an early stage the following conversation of the process, after some introductory remarks are being made by the Constable who gave evidence today, 

""CONSTABLE WOOD: Thank you very much, and Guyan's here for the purpose of looking at a line-up. So we will commence that now; so just press start for me?

GUYAN: So I can go back?

CONSTABLE WOOD: You go through it all at - to start with ... and then at the end of it if you wish to go back and have a look again you can go back again; over them again. But if you see the guy who you think is that guy, you will press 'select' otherwise just press 'next'.

GUYAN: Sure. ... So that first one I'm not sure.

CONSTABLE WOOD

Q. That's fine, so if you're not sure just press 'next'.

A. Yes, can I go back?

Q. One sec, just for a ...

A. If - if they're available and you select them can you narrow it down the, the search?

Q. It's been narrowed down to these pictures.

A. Yeah - for me; for me, because some of them definitely are not.

Q. That's fine. So you have seen ones that - do you - have you seen one that you know (?) --

A. Three years, my memory's not the best ... but there is about three that may be ...

Would you please confirm you wish to view the photos again, yes. So there you go, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN (emphasis added)""

6I point to that early part of what is recorded in the transcript to note what can be clearly heard is the witness saying that its over three years - in fact over four years- since the relevant events, his memory is not ""the best"". Further he says at a later stage, ""Even on the night...if you'd show me this because I got bashed"". 

7Thus, we have a considerable delay between the relevant events and the attempt at a photographic identification where the identifying witness is complaining about a lack of memory by reason of the effluxion of time, which is a fair enough comment. He suggests, although either interrupted or not finishing his sentence, that even on the night he may have had some difficulty in the context of what he described as the relevant events. 

8The evidence of the witness in the trial before the jury is that he saw the person who attacked him at the boot of his car on one occasion and then subsequently got a ""glimpse"" of his attacker as he was being assaulted in the middle of the road.

9The witness gave a description in general terms of the person who he said had assaulted him. The description he gave in the trial was the subject of cross-examination in this trial, drawing to his attention some inconsistency between the account he gave in this Court and the account he gave when he first had an opportunity, on 13 April 2009, to describe the person who he said assaulted him. 

10His evidence to describe the attacker was:

""Shorter than me, probably a few inches shorter ... I am six foot ... a few inches shorter, say 4 - 5 inches shorter, strongly built, wide shoulders, extremely strong, Caucasian or fair skinned, probably around 40 years or older, ... very short hair or his head was shaven ... some stubble."" (p50)

11He also said by way of introduction to the description: 

""My recollection is very sketchy, because its been a long time and it was a very fast moving event and I was receiving numerous blows to my head. Now I did get a close look at him when he was at the boot of my car ... (p49) ... He was concealing his head because he was wearing a hood ... enough to conceal his head. The hood came off during the struggle on the ground later on"" (p50). 

12He said he got a ""second glimpse"" of the person when on the ground (p48). In his statement to police on 13 April 2009 he described his attacker as ""male, probably about 45 - 50 years old"" ... ""may be older"" (p62). 

13I accept for the purposes of considering the admissibility of this evidence, that the police officer who conducted the process was ""independent from the investigation"". I am prepared to accept that he did not know who the particular person thought to be the suspect by the police was amongst the photographs that were shown to the witness.

14However, in relation to the array shown to the witness there are several features of the matter that further need to be referred to from the evidence available to the Court. I have available to me a document dated September 2008 called the ""Operational Information Agency"" in relation to ""PhotoTrac Suspect Identification System Standard Operating Procedures"". This is an extensive document dealing with a range of situations relating to the use of photographs and other means of identification. In relation to some of the aspects of the 'Operating Procedures' pertinent to the matter with which I am concerned, the Standard Operating Procedures state, at p 19: 

""When creating a photo line-up you must ensure that you adhere to the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 and Evidence Act 1995 (115)"". 

The 115 is a reference I take it to s 115 of the Act. In the course of submissions nobody has particularly drawn my attention to that provision in the context of the witness not having made an ""identification"". 

15The Procedures also state in the next paragraph:

""It is recommended that a photo line-up contain a minimum of 20 photographs of persons wherever possible. The system will allow you to select smaller line-ups of 18, 16, 14 and 12 photographs in the event that you cannot source enough similar photographs to the witness description of the suspect. But you must be aware that the use of smaller line-ups may be questioned in Court."" (emphasis added).

16The requirement of a minimum of 20 photographs is referred to in other documents tendered as procedural guidelines or 'best practice' for photographic identification. 

17In this particular matter the photographic line-up comprised 12 photographs. There is no evidence produced to explain why that number was settled upon as an appropriate number of photographs. I also point out, as was clarified by the Crown when I questioned her upon the matter, the accused is the only one of the 12 people wearing a ""forensic suit"", which is self-evident to anyone with any sort of understanding of that type of garment. It is certainly self-evident in my view on a view of the photographs of the other persons. The other 11 persons are clearly wearing civilian clothing.

18A further matter to be pointed out from the evidence that was presented is the fact that although the video recording shows the witness going through the photographs and, to be fairly said, concentrating largely on photographs 3 and 5 at various times, he goes through the array on at least 19 occasions. 

19The Procedures to which I earlier referred under the heading of ""Witness Presentation Review"" at p 28 state:

""It should be borne in mind that the best evidence results from identification obtained in the first run through. To avoid decreasing the value of the identification process in Court a witness should only view a photo line-up or photo book once. The more times the photo line-up or photo book is reviewed the less reliable the evidence will appear in Court"".

20The paragraph goes on to state:

""If the (witness) does request that the presentation be replayed a second time after a selection has been made, then the ... officer should confirm that the witness wishes to take this action and initiate a second viewing by using the hidden keyboard control (ALT-R). Any previously selected images will be highlighted during the second viewing. After the replay the witness will again be prompted by the system to confirm any selection made.""

21This brings me to further aspects of the evidence of this matter. 

22Constable Wood has provided a statement for this Court which is dated 25 August 2014, today's date. In that statement he states that he had no previous dealings with the identifying witness. He escorted the victim to the office, sat him down at an office computer to commence a photo line-up identification viewing. He says in his statement:

""I explained to Guyan that the photo line-up viewing would consist of 12 images of people who or may not be connected to the investigation and he could view them accordingly. I instructed him on how to use the mouse and keyboard to operate and participate in the photo line-up viewing. I also informed him that this entire photo line-up was going to be recorded.""

23He then commenced the process. In relation to the transcript of that process there is recorded in the transcript, taken from the video of course, what is said by the officer and what is said by the witness in response. There is nothing in the video recording indicating that the witness had previously told the identifying witness that the photo line-up viewing would consist of 12 images of persons who may or may not be connected to the investigation and that he could view them accordingly. Although there are other things said in the course of the video recording which are recorded in the transcript. It emerged in the evidence of Constable Wood in the course of the voir dire examination that the statement of the complainant, of 13 July 2013, was in fact taken from some form of pro forma document which is available on a computer system that provides a package of documents, or a folder of documents, pertinent to the photograph identification process.

24One of the documents in that folder or package which clearly was available to the witness on his own version of events was the Form that has the heading ""Computer Photograph Identification Form Witness View"". This is a form commonly used in the course of identification of witnesses by the use of for example photographs on a computer. The relevant 'Witness View Form' is attached to this judgment and is part of exhibit 10 in these proceedings which comprises most of the relevant documents tendered by the prosecution. 

25The document has a series of questions, which appear in the first three pages, in which the officer conducting the interview goes through a series of matters, addressing them to the identifying witness before the process has even begun. Including statements such as:

""I want you to clearly understand that the persons depicted in the photographs have not necessarily been convicted of a criminal offence. I want you to clearly understand that the persons depicted in the photographs are not necessarily persons in custody. I want you to clearly understand that the person or persons who allegedly committed the offence may or may not be depicted in the photographs. I want you to clearly understand you're in no way obliged to select anyone. I want you to look at all the photographs before you make any comment.""

26There are various instructions as to what is to be done in the case of considering or pondering the importance of a particular photograph. Amongst the instructions before the actual process commences is the instruction, ""If you recognise anyone you believe to be involved in this matter please click on the image displayed on the screen or the 'select' button for the person"". 

27It is quite clear when one reads the Form, and then has regard to the evidence of the Constable, that he understood that he was not to interrupt the identifying witness in the course of the consideration of the photographic array, nor suggest the way he should treat any particular photographs. 

28The Form itself shows after the instructions have been given about the computer presentation, particular questions are to be asked of the witness after the witness has had the opportunity of viewing the photographs uninterrupted. It may be said in part but only in part, some of the instructions that the police officer was required to give the identifying witness were in fact recorded on the video. Although certainly nowhere near the complete series of instructions that are recommended in the Form to which the police officer had access. However, such instruction as was given and that is recorded in the video recording of the process occurs in the course of the witness viewing the particular photographs that can be seen. 

29With regard to comments made in relation to what is shown during this process and the reaction of the witness to what is being shown in the photographs, some of the comments made by the police officer include him saying at Q.26 (of the transcript of the video photo identification), after the witness has said that one of the person's features ""match up"" or that another person ""could have been him too"":

""Q. In the statement you can narrow it down to say you thought it could have been three or five?

A. Yeah, that's what I...

Q. Picture three or five?

A. That's - that's what I had...

Q. Depicting a person that looked very similar but I cannot be sure ... so that's what you can say?"".

30Obviously, those comments by the police witness were comments made in the course of the process which had not yet completed. There are other comments made by the police officer, in response admittedly to what the victim said. For example, at one point the victim said:

""A. Three and five are the ones that narrow it down, I'm more inclined to .... Go with five I think, I think it's five.

Q. Right, if you think it's five you can press 'select' if you think it's three you can press 'select' so it's up to you.

A. If I narrowed it down to two is that still of any use or has it got to be one?

Q. I can't make a determination on that for a court level but if you were to pick, say, two and say ""These two are the most similar or the person"" then it would still say to me, or a jury member that you're not quite sure which one's which, so it's up to you(?)

A. I think it's this guy [which the Court takes to be a reference to number 5].

Q. Are you sure though?

A. No, it's three years.

Q. Is that the guy who looks most like the guy who attacked you?

A. [No audible response.]

Q. See, I can't tell you what to choose"" etc (emphasis added)

31The comments of the police officer involve impermissible qualitative analysis of what he is being told by the identifying witness. 

32In other words what we have here, in the course of the process leading ultimately to the conclusion summarised in para 7 of the victim's statement, is the police officer actively involving himself in the process, giving instruction to the witness, not in accord in anyway with any instruction that appears to be contained within the Witness View Form and doing so in the middle of the process while the witness is trying to make up his mind. In the course of this, as I said earlier, the witness had multiple opportunities to see the photographs. At one stage, perhaps after the eighth viewing, perhaps after the tenth viewing, nobody at the bar table seems to have paid particular attention to the sequence of events, the victim cut out a hole in a piece of paper and holding it up against the face shown on the screen to better concentrate on the face of the person shown on the screen.

33Although the police officer's evidence was a brief in this Court it is clear that several things emerged. He was aware of the Witness View Form but he did not use it. He did not attempt to reflect upon what is required within that Form at a range of levels. He understood from the Form itself that he was not to involve himself in the course of the process of the witness viewing the photographs, but obviously he did so in a range of ways, albeit interspersed with a warning such as, ""you have to be sure of the person you identify"", and the like. 

34It is not without significance in the course of assessing this matter that the evidence the subject of objection is not identification evidence. The evidence of the witness Mr Thambugala is evidence of a circumstantial character relied up by the Crown as evidence from the witness of choosing a photograph of the accused, in company with another person, as reflecting someone ""similar"" to the appearance of the person who assaulted him in the manner that he described. The extent of that similarly has not been defined save for the comments of the police officer. 

35The process that the police officer and the witness undertook on that day was to my mind fatally flawed from the outset in a number of respects. Firstly, asking a witness, who was endeavouring to identify a stranger, from photographs over four years after the event, was a process tinged with the prospect of qualitative failure. Secondly, the witness himself protested that his memory was ""bad"" even before he had had a chance to fully digest all the photographs. Further, the answers of the witness to some of the observations made by the police officer reflect at least a partial misunderstanding of what was required of him, which could have been addressed by the police officer taking the trouble to take him through the Form which has been specifically designed by the Commissioner of Police, or his delegates, to overcome the difficulties that may arise from photographic identification.

36The process was further flawed by the fact that the accused is the only person wearing a forensic jumpsuit, or clothing. This is self-evidently shown in the photograph, although we do not have any evidence one way or the other as to whether the identifying witness understood this. It certainly is clear from the photograph that he is the only person not wearing street clothes. We have the further problem of only 12 photographs as opposed to 20 with no explanation from anybody as to why such a limited array was available at the time. We have the quantitative comments being made by the police officer in the course of the process unfolding of words such as ""very similar"" and the like, not repeating words that were said by the identification witness, but making evaluative interpretations of what he believed had been said to him by the victim.

37The question is not whether the evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution is relevant, nor is it a question of whether the evidence is inadmissible by reason of the operation of s 115 of the Evidence Act, because it is not evidence of identification. What the Court is concerned with, for the purposes of determining the admissibility of the evidence, is the operation of s 137 of the Act which provides in relation to the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings that ""a court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.""

38In my view of the matter, in the context of the assessment of probative value, the evidence could not rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue taking into account the following features: the lack of prior familiarity with a subject, the particular characteristics of the photograph of the accused that is shown in the photo array showing nothing in the character of his face of any particular significance (his haircut and the like may have been relevant matters but there is no identifying scar or anything like that), the lapse of time between the events giving rise to the charge on the indictment and the identification process, the description that the witness gave to police on 13 April 2009 and then the somewhat changed description that the witness volunteered in the course of his evidence in this trial, the self identified limiting circumstances of opportunity to make observations and the procedures adopted in respect of the photographic identification. 

39This last matter includes the failure to comply with what I would suggest are minimum standards to ensure the integrity of the process, the failure to properly identify for the witness before the photographic identification what the process was about and tell him what he could or could not do. 

40Further, in this regard the effect upon the integrity of this process by the failure of the police officer to comply with a requirement that he understood that he was not to make any comment during the course of the process, the number of times that the witness went through the array of photographs with a consequent diminution upon the reliability of what was being observed in the context of what the Procedures themselves set out and the failure to record in conversations that are said to have taken place before the photographic identification occurred. I note in that regard, the police officer, as I pointed out earlier, said that he explained to Mr Guyan Thambugala that ""the photo line-up would consist of 12 images of person who may or may not be connected to the investigation and you can view them accordingly"". That expression does not find its way into the video recording as having been said to the witness. There is nothing in the video recording where the police officer put on the record anything that had been said before the video equipment had been turned on.

41I also take into account the state of mind of the witness expressed by him as being a concern about his memory having regard to the passing of time. It is to my mind a situation where, frankly, the evidence that the Crown seeks to rely upon, being as it is not evidence of identification but evidence of a circumstantial character, has almost no probative value whatsoever. 

42The risk of unfair prejudice to the accused outweighs the probative value because, amongst other things, if the evidence was to be given by the victim and the officer in the context of what we know as to the failings of the police, and the conduct of the photograph line-up, the problems with the manner of the identification process and the difficulties with the failure to properly instruct the identifying witness before the process, could not in my view be cured by appropriate warning. In the way in which the dangers of relying upon identification evidence in other circumstances might more readily identified. Such as, for example, the warnings that the 'Bench Book' might require a Judge to give, if in fact there was ""evidence of identification"" relied upon by the Crown. The warnings required to be given would render the evidence useless to the Crown because it is so tainted. 

43With respect to the police officer this process was fatally flawed from the moment that he failed to do what is quite evident he is required to do. That is to take the witness, before any photographic identification occurred, through a range of questions obviously designed to ensure that before the process the witness understood what is required of him or her, thus necessitating no interference; no comment; no qualification; no observation; no hint of suggestion or encouragement from the police officer. Unless, ultimately, the witness has recorded something upon the computer program which then permits the series of questions to be asked that appear at p 4 and 5 of the Witness View Form.

44In these circumstances, I will not permit the evidence the subject of objection.

		08 December 2014",2014-08-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764636,McGavin v R [2014] NSWCCA 171,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was charged with five counts of break and enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 112(2). The offences covered a period of one month. Each involved breaking into a club or hotel to steal cigarettes and money; the applicant acted as driver and kept a lookout as two of his sons (only one son was involved in the third count) and his nephew carried out the break-ins. The son involved in only four of the offences received a discount of 25% on sentencing for undertaking to provide evidence against the applicant. Failure by the son to fulfil the undertaking would have provided grounds for resentencing: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5DA. 

At trial, counsel for the applicant questioned the reliability of the son's evidence because of the discount; how he considered the prospect of resentencing if he failed to adhere to his evidence, however, was not raised with him. No information was proffered by either the prosecution or defence that quantified the effect of the discount. Warning that the son's evidence may be unreliable, the trial judge mentioned the percentage of discount. No reference was made, however, to the reduction in time that afforded or to the possibility of resentencing. Counsel for the applicant did not request a further warning on unreliability under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which included these details.

The appeal concerned whether the warning on unreliability was insufficient because it failed to specify both the actual reduction in time the discount reflected and the possibility of resentencing the son faced if he departed from his undertaking. 

The Court (Basten JA, Price J and Fullerton J) held, granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal: 

1. There is no unfairness to the applicant simply in failing to quantify the effect of a specific discount in circumstances where neither party called evidence, or even troubled the trial judge with the information, as to the sentence in question: [33] 

R v Privett [2001] NSWCCA 518; R v Sullivan [2003] NSWCCA 100 considered

2. The son was never asked at trial whether he feared resentencing if he failed to give evidence against the applicant. There was thus no testimonial basis at trial for the direction now being mooted on appeal: [42], [47]

Conway v The Queen [2000] FCA 461; 98 FCR 204; R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; 52 NSWLR 301; R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506 considered.
R v Yammine & Chami [2002] NSWCCA 289; 132 A Crim R 44 referred to.




			Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  On 20 May 2013 the applicant was convicted of five counts of break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company.  The offences were committed between 17 February and 17 March 2011 and each involved breaking into a club or hotel and stealing cigarettes and money.  The premises, with the exception of one near Jervis Bay, were in the Illawarra area.  In each case the applicant was said to be in the company of Shane Welland, Steven Welland and Trevor Hanson, except with respect to count 3 involving the Albion Park Hotel, which did not involve Steven Welland.  Steven and Shane Welland were brothers, and sons of the applicant.  Trevor Hanson was their cousin.  Steven Welland gave evidence for the prosecution.  
2The application before this Court challenged the convictions of the applicant on two grounds, each of which concerned the evidence of Steven Welland.  The grounds alleged a miscarriage due to the error of the trial judge in:
(1) not telling the jury that Steven Welland could be resentenced as part of his deal with the authorities to give evidence against the appellant, and(2) not giving a warning to the jury as to the full details of the discount received by Steven Welland.
Neither of these grounds involves a question of law alone and hence the applicant requires leave: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(a).  Each of the grounds was arguable and the applicant should have leave to appeal.  However, for the reasons set out below, the appeal should be dismissed.
3Although the grounds of appeal fall within a reasonably confined compass, it is desirable to set out briefly the nature of the prosecution case and the evidence relied upon in addition to that of Mr Steven Welland.
Background to trial4The places and locations of the premises broken into were as follows:
Count 1: Bulli Bowling and Recreation Club - 1.35am, 17 February 2011Count 2: Scarborough-Wombarra Bowling Club - 1.49am, 17 February 2011Count 3: Albion Park Hotel, Albion Park - 2.40am, 28 February 2011Count 4: Great Southern Hotel, Berry - 3.04am, 9 March 2011Count 5: Cooee Hotel, St Georges Basin - 2.37am, 17 March 2011.
5The applicant was 56 years of age at the time of the offences.  He did not enter any of the premises, but acted as driver and ""cockatoo"", keeping a lookout for police on nearby roads.  Once a target had been identified, the younger men stole a vehicle and carried out the break-ins, removing cigarette vending machines, cash and alcohol.  On some occasions they also attempted (unsuccessfully) to remove ATMs.  The persons involved in the various events communicated by mobile telephone.  An important part of the prosecution case involved records of calls made between mobile phones connected with the various co-offenders and recorded by mobile phone towers (referred to as ""cell towers"") in the vicinity of the target premises.
6A critical link in the records involved the mobile number ""841"".  (It is convenient to identify the telephones by reference to three numbers only, although the records included the standard 10 number identifications.)  On 8 June 2011 police executed a search warrant at a house in Kully Way, Warrawong, south of Wollongong.  The applicant was in an upstairs room at the time the police entered.  The prosecution case was that the applicant lived at that address with Ms Angela Jones and their two young daughters.  The 841 telephone was in the house at the time of the search, being registered in the name of Ms Jones.  The applicant telephoned Ms Jones on a land line while the search was being conducted and then, when going outside the house, picked up the 841 telephone.  The phone was recovered by police; it had five relevant numbers in its memory, including another mobile number identified as ""Ange1"" and its own number (841) against the name ""Bones"", which was the applicant's nickname.  It also contained telephone numbers for ""Shane"", ""Steve"" and ""T"", the last being the mobile number of Trevor Hanson.
7The police also executed search warrants at the homes of Shane Welland, Trevor Hanson and Steven Welland.  A mobile telephone seized from Shane Welland had a contact for ""Dad"", being the 841 number, and one for ""Steve W"".  The telephone seized from Steven Welland had two relevant contacts, ""Shane"" and ""Trev"", being the numbers of Shane Welland and Trevor Hanson respectively.
8It is not necessary to set out in detail the telephone call records and their locations.  Suffice it to say that the records for 17 February placed Trevor Hanson and 841 in the vicinity of the premises broken into on that night at times proximate to the times of the break-ins as recorded by the activation of alarms at each of the premises.  With respect to the Albion Park Hotel (count 3), which was close to the homes of Trevor Hanson and Shane Welland, calls between Trevor Hanson and 841 were identified by a tower in the vicinity of the area where the stolen vehicles used in the robbery were dumped, approximately one hour after the robbery.  Similarly with respect to count 4, involving the Great Southern Hotel at Berry, there were calls between Trevor Hanson and 841 recorded by a cell tower at Moeyan Hill, approximately half way between Berry and the place where the stolen vehicle used in the robbery was dumped.  Similarly with the Cooee Hotel at St Georges Basin, there were seven contacts recorded between Trevor Hanson and Steven Welland's mobile phone at a cell tower some 12 km north of St Georges Basin between 2.53am and 3.18am, the robbery having occurred at 2.37am.  There were numerous further telephone calls and text messages between Trevor Hanson and Steven Welland over the ensuing hour and a half, including between Steven and Shane Welland and Steven Welland and Trevor Hanson between 5am and 6am, recorded through the Nowra cell tower (north of St Georges Basin).
9The second category of evidence linking the applicant and his sons with the break and enters related specifically to the Cooee Hotel offending.  According to the prosecution case, after stealing a vehicle at Sanctuary Point, near St Georges Basin, Shane and Steven Welland and Trevor Hanson broke into the hotel at 2.37am, having arranged for the applicant to wait on the freeway to keep a lookout for police coming south from Nowra.  The three younger men were seen emerging from the hotel and could hear police sirens coming from Nowra as they drove off.  Having reached the freeway, they turned off into the bush, some five or six minutes' drive from the hotel and turned off the vehicle lights.  The applicant was parked on the freeway a short distance from the hiding spot of the stolen vehicle.  Shane and Steven Welland then left the stolen vehicle and ran towards the car with the applicant.  Trevor Hanson stayed with the stolen vehicle, about 30 metres away in the bush.  Some 20 seconds later, a police car, with its lights off, pulled up behind the applicant's car and questioned the applicant and the Wellands as to what they were doing.  Having taken relevant details, the applicant was allowed to drive away.  It was shortly thereafter that a number of calls were made to Trevor Hanson.  Trevor told them that he would walk up to the closed petrol station where the others were waiting, which took him about 30 minutes.  Shane Welland then went back to the stolen vehicle and drove it to Trevor Hanson's house at Albion Park.
10The significance of the encounter with the police was that it independently placed the applicant in the vicinity of the Cooee Hotel shortly after the break and enter.  The excuse for being beside the road in a parked vehicle was that they had been taking the car for a drive ""to see how it goes"" and that they had stopped to allow Steven Welland to get out and urinate, as indeed he pretended to do when the police arrived.
11The third category of evidence involved a third party, Shane Adlington.  The applicant had another son, Luke Andrews, who suffered from a disability as a result of a brain injury.  Shane Adlington acted as his carer and became acquainted with other members of the family.  He knew the applicant as ""Bones"" and visited him on a regular basis at the Kully Way house in Warrawong.  He gave evidence of admissions made by the applicant in relation to the Cooee Hotel offending, including an account of being pulled over by the police when he was with Shane and Steven Welland, whilst Trevor Hanson was hiding in the bushes in the stolen four-wheel drive.  Mr Adlington also described an occasion when he was driving home from Shoalhaven Heads with the applicant, who pointed out where a stolen cigarette machine had been hidden in bushes.  Finally, after the applicant was charged, Mr Adlington saw him reading and highlighting parts of a two or three volume police brief; the applicant said that the charges were true and that he was going to try his best to get out of them.
Evidence of co-offender12Against that background it is convenient next to refer to the evidence of Steven Welland.  He was involved in four of the five break and enters, not including the Albion Park Hotel on 28 February 2011.  He gave evidence at the applicant's trial implicating the applicant in all of the offences.  With respect to the Cooee Hotel at St Georges Basin, he confirmed the account of getting into the car on the freeway, the police pulling up behind them and him getting out of the car and saying he was going to the toilet.  He said that the police noted the identity of all three persons in the car.
13There can be little doubt that, if the jury believed Mr Steven Welland's evidence, conviction of the applicant on all counts was almost inevitable.  The attack on Mr Welland's credibility was twofold: first, there were inconsistencies between his evidence and previous exculpatory statements he had made to the police.  He had clearly told lies to the police; the question for the jury was whether he had lied on earlier occasions or was lying in the witness box.  The second challenge was based upon the fact that he himself had been charged and pleaded guilty to four of the five offences.  The jury were invited to disbelieve his evidence on the basis that he had agreed to implicate his father in return for a significant discount on the sentence he was required to serve.  The grounds of appeal were squarely directed at the alleged failure by the trial judge adequately to direct the jury with respect to the incentives for Steven Welland to give false evidence against his father.
14Before turning to the summing up to the jury, it is convenient to note how the evidence of Mr Welland was dealt with in the course of the trial.  His evidence was referred to by the prosecutor in relation to each offence when he opened the case to the jury.  Counsel for the applicant also addressed the jury by way of an opening statement.  He noted that the prosecutor had made much of the anticipated evidence of Mr Steven Welland and said that ""[o]ne of the most significant issues in this case is going to be your assessment as to the honesty and the reliability of Mr Steven Welland"": Tcpt, 13/05/13, p 18(20).  He then said that Mr Welland had in fact been sentenced for his involvement in a number of the offences and continued (p 18(29)):
""In that regard then you might consider, well what was the deal that Mr Steven Welland struck in relation to his sentence?  There might be some evidence I [anticipate] in relation to that, I'll be clear, I anticipate the evidence to be that he was afforded about a 25% reduction in his sentence for agreeing to give evidence against his father.  He, you might consider the evidence will establish, received a very considerable benefit for merely saying 'Yeah, Dad was involved as well, I'll give evidence against him'.""
He told the jury that they would hear of the ""very poor state of the relationship"" between the applicant and Mr Welland and suggested they would ask whether he, Mr Welland, had an axe to grind with the applicant.
15The evidence began with the objective circumstances of the offences, which was unchallenged.  The officer who spoke to the applicant and Shane and Steven Welland on the freeway near Tomerong, north of the Cooee Hotel on the night of the offence at that hotel, recounted their encounter at the roadside.  The prosecution then called Steven Welland.  He agreed that he was in custody having been sentenced on 18 October 2012 for a number of offences, having entered pleas of guilty to two such offences and having admitted his guilt to seven others, which were taken into account on sentence: Tcpt, 14/05/13, p 37.  The following evidence was then led (p 38):
""Q.  When you were sentenced, were you given a discount of 25% for your undertaking to give evidence?A.  Yes.
Q.  You're aware that if you fail to give evidence in accordance with your undertaking, you could be resentenced?A.  Yes....
HIS HONOUR:  Just before you go on, I should indicate to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when a court has to pass sentence in respect of somebody who has pleaded guilty to offences, as the court did in this case, and in fact I was the presiding judge, following this particular offender giving an undertaking to give evidence in respect of any matters that might arise, being trial matters, this being one of them, it is the obligation of the court to make an assessment of the level of discount that should apply in the particular circumstances of the evidence and assistance that's being offered.  That was done on this occasion and you heard that the assessment of the discount made was one of 25%.""
16In cross-examination, Mr Welland agreed that he was in gaol on 16 May 2012 and had been for almost a year, in relation to the offences for which he was ultimately sentenced.  He said that his first record of interview took place on 7 June 2011, when he was arrested.  He agreed that he was aware that he would get a discount from any sentence if he pleaded guilty and if he provided assistance to the police: Tcpt, p 63.  He agreed that by 16 May 2012 he was aware that he could get a discount for assisting police: p 65(18).  (There was some uncertainty as to when he first learned that he could get a discount for pleading guilty.)  He also agreed that on various occasions he had lied to the police.
17In cross-examination it was suggested to Mr Welland that he was not scared of his father (as he had said to police), but he denied that: Tcpt, pp 115-116.  It was also suggested that his father was a ""very easy person to nominate as being involved in these matters so that you can get your discount, and he really can't do anything to you"", a proposition with which he disagreed.
18In re-examination, Mr Welland agreed that he did not initially tell the truth in relation to some matters because he was trying to minimise his role: Tcpt, p 121(5).  He said that he was seeking to tell the truth in his interview on 16 May 2012.  He was also taken to accounts he had given of other offences in which he did not seek to implicate his father.
19In addressing the jury at the end of the trial, the prosecutor referred to the attacks made on Mr Welland's evidence: Tcpt, 20/05/13, p 6.  He referred to the discount obtained for assistance, noting that there was legislation supporting an entitlement to a reduction in a sentence and that it was a matter for the sentencing judge to determine the level of the reduction.  There was no reference to the risk of being resentenced if he reneged on his undertaking.
20Counsel for the applicant addressed extensively on Mr Welland's evidence, highlighting his willingness to tell lies to protect himself and others to whom he was favourably inclined; the value of obtaining a discount on the sentences he was to receive for the offending; and the ease with which he could nominate a particular individual with whom he had a bad relationship, in order to obtain the discount: see, eg, Tcpt, 20/05/13, p 17(30)-(40).
21It may be noted that nowhere in his opening to the jury, in cross-examination of Mr Welland, or in his final address, did counsel for the accused refer to the actual sentence which Mr Welland had received, nor to the possible pressure to maintain any false statements he had made implicating the applicant, for fear of being resentenced to a lengthier sentence.
Judge's summing up to jury22In the course of summing up to the jury, the trial judge noted that arguments had been put by each counsel with respect to the evidence of Steven Welland: Tcpt, 20/05/13, p 12.  He noted that counsel for the applicant had suggested the jury would have ""some real doubts about the accuracy and reliability of his evidence"".  His warning continued (Tcpt, pp 13-14):
""You also heard evidence that in respect of that interview in May 2012 he indicated that he would be prepared to give evidence in respect of what he had told the police in that interview.  You have also been told that he ultimately pleaded guilty to a whole range of matters and that he has been dealt with in this Court in relation to those matters.  In the course of being sentenced an assessment was made of the assistance that he provided to the authorities and he was given a 25 percent discount on his sentence for that assistance.
A direction that the Courts must give to jurors in respect of witnesses who have received discounts for sentences is as follows and it is in effect a warning to you that you need to exercise considerable caution when making an assessment of the evidence of that witness.  The need arises for these directions because the Courts over the years have experienced in respect of the reliability of evidence given by persons who had been involved in crimes, have been concerned in those crimes and that experience might not be readily known to members of the public.  That experience has shown that on some occasions that evidence can be unreliable.  Now I do not intend to suggest, however, that such evidence is always unreliable.  My purpose in giving you these directions is only to warn you that the evidence of such a witness may be unreliable and for that reason alone you must approach that evidence with considerable caution in the way in which I will outline to you shortly.
There are no doubt a number of reasons why the evidence of such a person may be unreliable.  Possible reasons are that it is only natural you may think that a witness who might have been involved in a particular crime giving rise to these proceedings may want to shift the blame from himself or herself onto others and to justify his conduct.  In the process the witness may construct untruthful stories which tend to play down his part in a crime and play up the part of others of the crime even going so far as to blame quite innocent people.  Persons reasonably supposed to have been involved in the commission of an offence may make false claims as the involvement of others motives of revenge or a feeling of dislike or hostility.  Such a person may be motivated to give false evidence in order to qualify for a reduction in his or her own sentence.  There may be reasons why false evidence has been given by such a witness and it is not for the accused to establish the reason or reasons why that witness was lying.""
23At the end of the summing up the judge invited counsel to indicate if there were any redirections sought, either in relation to law or to any question of fact: Tcpt, p 28.  Neither sought any further direction.
Grounds of appeal24The applicant's challenge (taking both grounds of appeal together for present purposes) relied upon three propositions.  First, the evidence of Steven Welland was evidence of a kind that may be unreliable and hence required a warning to be given to the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 165(1) and (2)(a) and (c).  Secondly, the content of the warning should have included ""full details of the discount"", that is the actual reduction in time to be served and not merely the percentage.  Thirdly, the warning should have included an explanation of the liability to be resentenced if he reneged on his undertaking.
25The applicant's argument relied primarily on judicial exegesis, but it is necessary first to identify the terms of s 165, so far as relevant.
165 Unreliable evidence
(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:...
(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,
...
(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:
(a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and(b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and(c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.
(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.
(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.
(5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.
26There was no dispute that the section potentially applied to the evidence of Steven Welland as he was conceded to be criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charges against the applicant.  Although there was no request in terms, the judge gave a warning as set out at [22] above.  Whilst s 165 is only engaged where a party requests a warning (subs (2)) the warning did not in any sense lack force because it had not been requested.  Rather, the circumstances of the case were such that some form of warning was inevitable.  However, to the extent that the warning was said to be insufficient, it is significant that there was no request for a further warning.  There being no such request, there was no obligation imposed on the trial judge by s 165 to give a further warning.  Nor is the requirement for a request a mere technicality.  The obligation to give a warning is contingent in the sense that the judge has a broad discretion not to give a warning for ""good reasons"": subs (3).  A request would properly focus on the terms of the proposed additional warning and, if the judge were minded not to comply with the request, the reasons for not so doing would no doubt be articulated and debated with counsel.  Where the request is not made, none of that occurs, as it should, in the context of the trial between those involved in conducting the trial.  As with a failure to comply with r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), it will be difficult to establish a miscarriage of justice unless both the requirements of fairness to the accused and the absence of any reasons not to comply with the obligation were manifest.
27Beyond those general considerations, whether a further warning was required in the present case depends on the alleged deficiencies in the content of the warning actually given.  The relevant legal obligation is founded upon the duty of the judge to ensure that the accused gets a fair trial, of which s 165 is a part but not a comprehensive statement: sub-s (5). It is convenient to start with the contention that the statement that a 25% discount had been allowed was not of itself sufficient to demonstrate the benefit obtained by the witness.  Before turning to the authorities, it may be noted that the logic of that contention is by no means self-evident.  The underlying assumption appears to be that, if the sentence were 20 years, the actual discount (namely five years) is so significant that it needs to be spelled out.  Whether the same reasoning applies to a two year sentence is less clear.  
28The early cases focused on the understanding that R v Privett [2001] NSWCCA 518 had held that evidence of actual sentences received by an accomplice was not admissible.  That proposition was rejected by the Court in R v Sullivan [2003] NSWCCA 100: the point has no present relevance.  However, Sullivan also considered whether the jury should have been told of the very substantial discount received by the co-offender who gave evidence against the accused, namely a discount of 50% on a sentence of 15 years.  All members of the Court considered that there had been a failure to comply with s 165, but the Court divided (Hodgson JA in dissent) as to whether a failure to comply with r 4 precluded reliance on that ground.  Hodgson JA dealt somewhat more briefly with what constituted a breach of s 165 in circumstances where there had been no reference to the possibility of resentencing for non-compliance with the undertaking, nor reference to the quantum of the discount.
29Buddin J in Sullivan commenced with a lengthy dissertation on the principles derived from accomplice cases under the common law, which required a warning of the danger of convicting in the absence of corroboration.  In dealing with the operation of s 165, Buddin J addressed the two elements of the inadequate directions relied on by counsel for the applicant, Mr Sullivan.  The principal focus was on the failure to explain to the jury the potential for resentencing.  However, with respect to the quantum of the discount, Buddin J noted that the jury had been told that the sentence of witness had been ""substantially"" reduced, but considered that information inadequate: at [96].  His ultimate conclusion however rested on the failure of the prosecutor to lead relevant evidence.  It appears that it was only in the course of argument that the Court was informed of the sentence in fact imposed on the witness and the level of reduction: at [93]. 
30The third member of the court, Smart AJ, agreed with Buddin J and made ""one additional comment"": at [106].  He was concerned to indicate why Privett did not preclude evidence being given of the reduced gaol sentence for assistance to law enforcement authorities.  Smart AJ stated at [108]:
""Telling a jury that a person has received a significant reduction in his gaol term does not tell them a great deal.  That lacks the impact and conviction which comes with the supply of detail.  To tell a jury that an accomplice or other witness has had his sentence of imprisonment reduced from 15 years to 7½ years for giving evidence against the accused brings home to the jury the extent of the incentive that the witness has to stick to the story he told the Crown, whether true or false.  This is cemented by further telling the jury that if the witness does not give the evidence he promised he will then become liable to lose his discount and to serve the full 15 years sentence.""
31None of these judgments is authority (if there could be authority) for the factual proposition that a warning indicating the proportionate reduction in a gaol sentence is necessarily inadequate.  It is only the statement set out above from the judgment of Smart AJ which could be taken to bear such an implication.  However, as the following paragraph, [109], demonstrated, the purpose of the proposition was to illustrate why there was no justification for withholding from the jury ""full details of the accomplice's situation.""  Further, it might be doubted whether it would be accurate to direct a jury in accordance with the unqualified terms of the last sentence set out in the extract from [108].
32There is a further curiosity about Sullivan's case which suggests that the precise nature of the required direction was not fully articulated in circumstances where there was no evidence of the sentencing of the witness before the trial court.  It is surprising, if not implausible, that a witness who had entered a plea of guilty to the offences with which he was charged had received a 50% discount for assistance to the authorities.  If there were some separate discount for the pleas of guilty (as there usually would be pursuant to s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) it would be wrong to tell the jury that such a discount could be removed for failure to give evidence in accordance with an undertaking.
33The applicant's submissions in the present case have a similar curiosity: they do not identify the effect of the 25% reduction, presumably because there was no evidence at trial of the overall sentence imposed on Mr Steven Welland for which he received the discount.  The Director submitted that the gravamen of the complaint must have been that the prosecutor had failed to adduce that evidence.  However, that was not the ground relied upon and no question of the Director's obligations of disclosure or possible obligations to lead evidence need be further considered.  There is no unfairness to the accused simply in failing to quantify the effect of a specific discount in circumstances where neither party called evidence, or even troubled the trial judge with the information, as to the sentence in question.  This ground of challenge must be rejected.
34There remains the question of the scope of the obligation to tell the jury about the possibility of resentencing for failure to comply with an undertaking.
Warning as to possibility of resentencing35The statutory basis for resentencing an offender whose sentence was reduced because he or she undertook to assist law enforcement authorities, but wholly or partly failed to fulfil the undertaking, is to be found in s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act.  One of the early cases discussing the obligation to include such information in a warning under s 165 was a judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court, Conway v The Queen [2000] FCA 461; 98 FCR 204 (Miles, von Doussa and Weinberg JJ).  After noting that the jury had been informed of the dangers of acting on the ""uncorroborated evidence"" of two accomplices (albeit without reference to s 165 of the Evidence Act), the Court continued at [207]:
""In addition to what his Honour told the jury in the passages set out above, he had, earlier in the trial, used the expression 'Sword of Damocles' when referring to the threat of a Crown appeal against the sentences imposed upon [the accomplices] if they did not adhere to their statements implicating [the accused].  The concept of the 'Sword of Damocles' was canvassed thoroughly in cross-examination of the accomplices.  It was dealt with also in counsel's addresses.  The jury could hardly have failed to understand the danger that an accomplice might adhere to a story implicating others because of the threat of a Crown appeal against sentence.""
36The next important case was R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; 52 NSWLR 301, where this Court dealt with a similar issue, although not speaking with one voice.  In Stewart a warning had been given under s 165 which was described by Spigelman CJ as ""a comprehensive warning which, save in one specific respect, was all that was required"": at [23].  The matter omitted was any reference to s 5DA, being the mechanism by which the witness could lose the benefit obtained by the assistance to law enforcement authorities: at [24].  Spigelman CJ would have upheld the appeal, despite the absence of complaint at trial that the warning given was defective: at [28].  The majority, R S Hulme and Howie JJ, refused leave to raise the issue.
37Hulme J was satisfied that the omission involved a breach of s 165, and did not ultimately resolve a question which he himself raised as to whether a request for ""a direction on accomplices"", with no further request after the warning was given, constituted a sufficient request for the purposes of s 165(2): at [41].  However, because he referred to ""the mandatory requirements of s 165"" he must have assumed that it was sufficient.  Nevertheless, not being satisfied that the failure was significant in respect of the fairness of the trial or the ultimate result, he refused leave to rely upon the ground: at [47].
38Howie J addressed in some detail the requirements of the common law with respect to accomplice evidence, the terms of s 165 and the related but separate issue of obtaining a contingent benefit on sentence for undertaking to give assistance in a forthcoming prosecution.  Noting the importance of determining the adequacy of directions and warnings in the context of a specific case, as explained in Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at 561 - see Stewart at [116] - Howie J considered the course of the trial and reached the following conclusions in terms of principle:
""[158] Provided that the consequences for the witness in failing to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking has been sufficiently placed before the jury so that they would understand the significance of the fact that a witness is still at risk of further punishment when giving evidence in the trial, I do not believe that the trial judge is always required to raise this matter with the jury and inform them of its relevance in order to ensure that a miscarriage of justice did not arise.  Whether or not the failure to refer to the matter in the summing up gives rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice will depend upon the circumstances of the particular trial. In this case the summing up followed immediately after defence counsel's address and there was a single issue before the jury: Braddick's reliability when implicating the appellant in the offence.
[159] I acknowledge that it is important that the jury understands that a witness, who has been given a sentence discount or some other benefit for giving evidence implicating an accused, has at the time of giving evidence before the jury an obligation to give such evidence on pain of further punishment.  The jury should not be left to assume that the witness has no reason to give false evidence implicating the accused at the time of the trial.  They should be made aware that the fact that the witness has been sentenced for his part in the offence did not necessarily diminish the likelihood that his evidence might be unreliable: Conway at [207].""
39Shortly after Stewart was decided, but not in ignorance of it, a differently constituted court gave judgment in R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506.  Heydon JA (with whom Dowd and Bell JJ agreed) gave careful consideration to the principles requiring warnings of unreliability in circumstances where the contingent requirements under s 165 had not been triggered because there had been no request for a relevant direction: at [22].  In the course of that discussion, however, there was continuing reference to ""whether a s 165(1)(d) warning should have been given"": at [52].  Clark had been convicted of murder.  Critical evidence against him was given by an old friend, Mr Brown, to whom he had allegedly confessed.  There was a somewhat vague suggestion that Mr Brown might himself have been implicated in the murder, a matter which was not put to him in cross-examination.  Heydon JA dealt with this issue at [64] in the following terms:
""If the trial judge were to be invited by Mr Stratton [counsel for the accused] to direct the jury that Mr Brown's evidence was of an unreliable kind because he was implicated in the killing and because he had received an indemnity against prosecution, it would have been necessary for Mr Stratton to address the jury along those lines, and nothing in the trial judge's summing up suggests that he did.  More importantly, it would have been necessary for Mr Stratton to have elicited evidence along those lines, or at least put questions, the answers to which, if exculpatory of Mr Brown, could have been disbelieved by the jury.  But ... Mr Stratton put no question suggesting that Mr Brown was guilty.  So far as he put questions suggesting that Mr Brown feared being charged, they were of the briefest kind.  He put no questions about the impact of the indemnity on Mr Brown's truthfulness.  That is a fatal gap in view of the fact that the appellant now relies on R v Chai [(1992) 27 NSWLR 153], because a key element in the reasoning in that case is the question of the 'significance' the 'grant of immunity from prosecution' had in relation to the 'evaluation of the reliability of the witness' testimony'.  For example, it was not suggested to Mr Brown that he would not get the indemnity unless he maintained in the witness box his lying story to the police about the confession, and that was the reason why he was lying about the confession on oath.  The absence of any testimonial exploration of that question in the cross-examination of Mr Brown is extremely damaging to the present argument.""
40These considerations are relevant in the present case.  No doubt it is one thing to tell a false story to police and another to adhere to that story on oath in the witness box.  That the witness has a material incentive to adhere to his story is by no means insignificant in assessing the reliability of his evidence.  Nevertheless, the fact is that he had had an equal incentive to adhere to his account to the police, whether true or false.  The primary challenge to the reliability of the evidence must inevitably have focused on the initial account.  
41The jury in this case knew that Mr Welland had given the police an account implicating the applicant in the offences before he was sentenced.  The question for the jury was whether his evidence was true or false: knowing that self-interest might well have led him to lie or at least exaggerate the involvement of the applicant, the jury had every reason to focus on the extent to which his evidence was consistent with the independent material which supported the conclusion that the applicant was involved in the offending with which he had been charged.
42Nevertheless, and accepting that the possibility of resentencing may have had considerable significance, there would have been a real question as to how that matter should have been dealt with by way of additional directions.  As explained by Heydon JA in Clark, it would have been difficult to formulate an appropriate direction in the absence of a testimonial basis.  If the judge had told the jury that Mr Welland had a strong incentive not to depart from the account he had given to police, for he might otherwise be resentenced and lose some or all of his discount, thus increasing the time he would serve in gaol, should he also have said that how he would have responded to such a suggestion could not be known because he was never asked the question?  Counsel for the accused could not have invited the jury to assume that he would have recanted in the face of cross-examination which did not take place; nor that, if he dismissed the suggestion as unfounded, the jury would necessarily find his response implausible.  Of course, counsel did not ask the jury to take that step, because he lacked the evidential basis to make the submission.  At the very least, there would have been an anxious discussion between counsel and the judge as to what direction could properly have been given.  The absence of a testimonial basis for the direction would have provided a good reason, within the terms of s 165(3), for the judge to decline to give a direction of the kind now mooted.  
43In these circumstances, it should not be concluded that there was a breach of s 165: further, if there were a breach, it was not one which gave rise to a miscarriage based on the unfairness of the trial.  Accordingly, the third limb in the attack on the conviction must be rejected.  For the reasons explained in Domican and articulated in the context of s 165 by Howie J in Stewart, there are significant qualifications on the value of taking what appear to be general statements of principle from previous cases as constituting the basis for inferring error in a later case.  The more closely such statements are bound to the circumstances of the case in which they are expressed, the less likely they are to provide assistance, let alone binding authority, in other circumstances.  To the extent that they are expressed at a high level of generality, such statements must be treated as largely obiter.  
44For completeness, it is appropriate to deal with a passage in the judgment of Buddin J in Sullivan upon which reliance was placed by the applicant.  Thus, at [94] Buddin J stated:
""What was critical in the present case was not just the fact that the witness had been given a discount on sentence by reason of his undertaking to give evidence against the appellant and others.  The magnitude of the discount was also of critical significance because of its potential to bear upon the pivotal issue in the trial, namely the credibility of Mr Evans.  Furthermore, it was only in re-examination that it emerged for the first time that the witness 'could be re-sentenced' in the event that he did not 'keep that undertaking'.  It is far from clear that the jury would have understood precisely what that expression entailed.  The evidence as to the consequence of not fulfilling the undertaking, was confined to the cryptic reference that the witness could be 're-sentenced'.""
45Again, it is critical not to take these statements out of context.  The first part of the paragraph dealt with the fact that the prosecutor had objected to counsel for the accused seeking to adduce evidence of the extent of the benefit the witness had received; the following paragraph (which it is not necessary to extract here) dealt with the duty of the prosecutor to reveal to the jury all matters relevant to the position of such a witness.  Secondly, although the issue of resentencing was said to have emerged for the first time in re-examination, emerge it did.  Thus, unlike the present case, there was some evidence which might have formed the basis of a direction.
46Thirdly, although decided some two years after Clark, there was no reference to Clark in Sullivan, nor to the principles discussed by Heydon JA as to the problems which would arise where the effect of a potential resentencing for failure to comply with an undertaking had not been explored with the witness, nor relied upon in submissions.  
47It may well be a significant error for the jury not to be warned of the possibility of resentencing for failure to comply with an undertaking, in circumstances where such a direction is sought, the matter having been raised in evidence with the witness: but that is not this case.  To the extent that some cases, such as R v Yammine & Chami [2002] NSWCCA 289; 132 A Crim R 44, have upheld such challenges, without discussion of the precise nature of the direction, nor of the testimonial basis for it, they do not contradict the conclusion reached in this case.
Conclusion48The applicant should have leave to raise both of the grounds of appeal identified in the notice of appeal dated 25 February 2014; the appeal must be dismissed.
49PRICE J:  I agree with Basten JA.
50FULLERTON J:  I agree with Basten JA.

		25 August 2014",2014-08-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764645,R v Chandler [2014] NSWDC 148,"Judgment - Admissibility of opinion evidence of Ms Beilby, Forensic Biologist, in s 177 Evidence Act Certificate, dated 5 March 2014

1Objection has been taken to aspects of the proposed opinion evidence concerning aspects of 'DNA' investigations in this matter. Last Thursday 14 August 2014 the Court was advised by the parties of the need for a voir dire examination to determine the admissibility of evidence relating to the testing of a knife found after the robbery of the victim in this matter to ascertain the presence of DNA material which might be consistent with the DNA profile of the accused and/or the victim. I gave a ruling on the objection at the conclusion of the voir dire examination on Tuesday 19 August 2014. 

2The knife was found at the rear of a block of premises a few streets away from the scene of the robbery apparently embedded in a mattress. Nearby were found items that had been removed from the wallet of the victim which were, as I understand it, clearly his property. 

3Objection was made to the admissibility into evidence of an opinion, or opinions, expressed by Vivienne Beilby, a Senior Forensic Biologist with the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service, that a partial DNA profile recovered from the stained area on the right side of the blade of the knife was the same profile as the victim, and that this profile is expected to occur in fewer than one in one hundred billion individuals in the Australian population. This conclusion was reached by the use of the 'Promega Powerplex 21'kit, or system, for developing DNA profiles, introduced nationally in early 2013 to replace the ""less sensitive"" 'Profiler Plus' kit or system. I also understood that the objection related to the chain of possession of the knife from the time it was found by the police to the time it was delivered to the ""DNA laboratory"" of the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service ('FASS'), the chain of possession and testing of the knife, the manner of obtaining results from that testing and as to the factual assumptions upon which the opinion expressed by Ms Beilby in her report of 5 March 2014 was based. 

4The opinion expressed by Ms Beilby was based upon testing that occurred in February 2014, after there had been testing undertaken at an earlier time which was unsuccessful. There was no issue about her study, experience and training.

5Initially (that is on 14 August 2014), I understood that objection was taken to an opinion expressed by another forensic biologist as to a match between the DNA profile of the accused and DNA material obtained from the handle of the same knife as a result of testing conducted between 21 January 2010 and the s 177 Certificate of Forensic Biologist Fiona Rose dated 13 November 2012. 

6After a number of delays and staggered production of material by the prosecution, the voir dire examination was concluded on the afternoon of Tuesday 19 August 2014 with only one issue for the Court to resolve. The one matter left for the Court to determine, having on several occasions endeavoured to ensure that the particulars of the objection were clearly articulated, was the admissibility of the opinion of Ms Beilby in relation to the identification of the DNA profile recovered from the blade of the knife being the same profile as the victim's and the probability of that occurring. 

7Additional statements obtained by the prosecution as well as 'working' documents of the laboratory, apparently all obtained by the prosecution after the trial was listed to start, removed from the Court's consideration the need to consider the chain of possession of the subject knife from the time it was found by police until the time it was delivered to the ""DNA laboratory"", the chain of possession and chain of testing occurring within the DNA laboratory and the results of that testing insofar as it produced relevant ""markers"" at particular 'loci' of DNA material identified from particular chromosomes, to enable a relevant comparison to be made between the DNA sample provided by the victim and the DNA material identified on the blade of the knife. No objection was pressed in respect of the testing for comparison purposes of the DNA sample given by the accused by way of buccal swab and the DNA material developed on the handle of the knife where a 'match' of 'markers' was established. 

8For the purposes of this judgment I note the transcript that has been made available to the Court since the ruling was given relating to the discussion had with the Crown Prosecutor on the morning of 19 August 2014, when I asked her to lead me through the documentary material produced in dribs and drabs to explain to me what the relevant statements and working documents of the laboratory meant in the context of the objection as it was understood by the prosecution. 

9It must be said, without me having to analyse it particularly, that in the context of the character of the objection identified by counsel for the accused, the respective certificates containing the opinion the subject of objection, and the supporting statements of Ms Beilby, did not reveal the factual assumptions upon which her opinion was based, nor identified from other material available in statements and working documents relevant matters taken into account by her in formulating her ultimate opinion. The Court learnt in the course of the discussion had with the Crown Prosecutor that in fact many of the matters submitted by her relating to the material in documentary form that had been tendered, particularly explaining the relevance of specific initials, processes, entries on working papers, computer printouts and the like, which were not self explanatory (some not even revealing dates when particular testing occurred), was based upon information provided to her at least by Ms Beilby in conference at an earlier time. The information provided by Ms Beilby at an earlier time to the Prosecutor in conference should have been provided to the defence, and if needs be to the Court, to inform both in relation to matters in respect of which there were significant self evident gaps or matters left unexplained in the documentary material. 

10This was self evidently so when one has regard to the fact that counsel for the accused had made it quite clear that his objection to any relevant opinion based upon scientific testing (in fairness to the Crown at an early stage this was not isolated to the opinion of Ms Beilby) was concerned with issues that were discussed in two principal judgments: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705, per Heydon JA (particularly at [85]), and R v Sing (2002) 54 NSWLR 31, particularly at [34] - [36] and [38]. 

11The observations of Heydon JA in Makita are further discussed, in the context of the consideration of the admissibility of expert evidence and ss 79-80 Evidence Act 1995, in Keller v R [2006] NSWCCA 204 at [28] - [31]. The Crown referred to the Court to the decision to Sharwood [2006] NSWCCA 157, but the relevant passage cited by the Crown was of little further assistance. 

12The essence of the objection is that the reports in their various forms of Ms Beilby did not reveal the basis upon which she had formed the relevant opinion the subject of objection, or what matters she took into account in coming to the conclusions that she did. It was submitted thus, that the evidence was opinion evidence that ought not be admitted because there was insufficient basis for her to express an opinion wholly or substantially based upon her training, study or experience. Thus, her opinions were not an exception to the rule of exclusion known as the ""opinion rule"" in the Evidence Act, and/or there were lacunae in the evidence such as to require the opinion expressed by Ms Beilby to be excluded pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act, as occurred in Sing (supra). 

13As the matter was finally argued by counsel for the accused, this latter aspect fell away. It was submitted, in a nutshell, that the basis of Ms Beilby's reasoning for expressing the opinions concerning the matching, in a partial sense, of the respective DNA profiles and particularly the probabilities were not revealed. 

14The ""worksheets"" annexed to the statement of Ms Beilby of 18 August 2014 included the documents identified by the Crown as those setting out the ""markers"" at particular ""loci"" (as that expression was explained by Ms Beilby in her oral evidence), represented as 'spikes' in the graphs produced (Exhibits H2 and H3 in the trial) that were located at particular chromosomes of the DNA profiles developed at the laboratory, or on particular parts of a chromosome. The oral evidence of the witness as to the individual characteristics of the markers that were identified sets out, in essence, the basis for the opinion expressed of a ""match"" of the two DNA profiles developed (one partially complete). It must be said that the ""matching"", once the relevant worksheets were explained, was self evident. Whether there were relevant 'mismatches' that excluded the complainant as the donor of the DNA located on the blade of the knife was not explored, explained, or commented upon by counsel for the accused on the issue of admissibility.

15The critical matter that emerged from the voir dire examination was the method of the calculation of probability. It is correct that the evidence of the witness, in conjunction with the documentary material, was dependant upon the use of computer program(s) that developed the data measuring probability of specific markers being identical, and ultimate probability of such a comparison occurring by reference to particular populations identified as ""Aus Cauc"", ""Aus Aborig"" and ""Aus Asian"". Those printouts, called ""Conditional Probability Calculation Sheets"", were annexures E 2/3/4 to Ms Beilby's latest statement (Exhibit H5 in the trial). The evidence of Ms Beilby was that in the context of well accepted statistical mechanisms for calculating probabilities, by reference to the combination of accepted ""frequencies"" for identical alleles or ""markers"" to be identified from two different DNA sources, whether the racial basis for analysis was Australian Caucasian, Australian Aboriginal or Australian Asian (the three accepted populations bases identified for comparison purposes) the mathematical probability in any case, given the character of the matches and the most conservative ""confidence limit"" for such a match to occur, as revealed by the mathematical probability expressed by Ms Beilby in her 'Certificate', was still very conservative. In other words the expression of the probability was not dependant upon the ""racial"" background of the DNA profile. 

16The probability of matches, as were shown by the diagrammatic sheets in the markers for the DNA of the victim and the DNA profile developed from the blade of the knife, was explained by the witness as calculated by accepted statistical models. No suggestion was put that the calculations were in error or that the models were inherently unreliable or false. Nor was any evidence adduced, or suggestion made, that the ""Powerplex 21"" system for extracting and comparing DNA samples was inherently flawed. The revealed relevant facts observed by the expert, or the assumed or accepted facts providing the basis upon which the relevant opinion the subject of objection was expressed, should have been included in the Certificate Ms Beilby made on 5 March 2014. On the basis of that Certificate the point taken as to the admissibility of her opinions was initially well taken, but fell away with the evidence produced on the voir dire. 

17Ms Beilby described in her oral testimony the process of ""lysis"" (the bursting open of cells to release the DNA, and cleaning it up): ""quantification"" identifying how much DNA is in the sample, whether none, too much or the optimum level: ""amplification"" the copying of the DNA developed, or the ""amplifying"" of it to test it, and the process of ""Capillary Electrophoresis"" (CE), which is the process that separates the necessary DNA fragments and permits the production of the graphs to show the ""markers"" upon which or from which comparisons can be made between different samples. The diagrams that were produced, such as D2 in the documents attached to Ms Beilby's statement, represent graphical representations of the results of the CE test. The computer printouts from that test reflect the consequence of the scientific examination of the DNA material, the results of which are analysed within the Powerplex 21 system, to ultimately produce the printouts earlier described (E 2/3/4) that identify both the frequency of particular alleles, within particular racial group profiles, and the mathematical probability of the combination of matches occurring within two separate samples. 

18The actual working of the computer program that developed the ""Conditional Probability Calculation Sheets"", or the graphs for visual comparison, is not explained. But what the working sheets contain is the product of the program's consideration of the identified 'markers' which can clearly be seen in those graphs produced (H2 and H3) after the process referred to in other statements and the relevant ""worksheets"" (such as annexure D1/1 to Ms Beilby's August 2014 statement) as CE, conducted on the relevant samples by Khan Nguyen on 26 February 2014. Nothing has been raised during the voir dire to suggest those probabilities are wrong or misleading other than to say the calculations, or how they are based, are ""opaque"". 

19The 'probability sheet' printouts are a representation of the working of the program, as discussed in the ""Appendix"" to the ""Expert Certificate"" of Ms Beilby of 5 March 2014, particularly at page 1-2 of that document. In relation to Powerplex 21 ""statistics"" the Appendix states: ""they are calculated using a national frequency database specific that can be applied for Caucasians, Aborigines or Asians"", as opposed to the more limited ""Profiler Plus"" statistics. The Appendix explains the manner in which the statistical comparison is undertaken. 

20Having regard to the evidence of the witness as to the method of considering the statistical frequency of a particular combination of circumstances, in the context that there is no evidence that the method of calculating the frequency of particular or specific matches, or identifying particular matches, is unsound or unreliable, the evidence given on the voir dire (taking into account that the witness, if required to a jury, has the qualifications to explain fundamental terminology that was unnecessary in the absence of the jury) provides the relevant basis upon which the respective opinions the subject of objection are founded. I note that there was no dispute as to the expertise of the witness to express the various opinions that she did, or to give particular evidence interpreting the data available to her. 

21As part of the voir dire material, a statement was tendered by the defence from Ms Jae Gerhardt a ""Forensic Biologist"" said to be an expert in relation to DNA extraction and identification. No issue was identified in submissions that arise from that statement. There was no suggestion made that there was material, or evidence, to suggest that the data available to Ms Beilby was inherently unreliable, or that any matter about which she gave oral evidence that formed the basis for her opinion ultimately expressed was not reasonably available for her, relying on the test results and the use of the ""Powerplex 21"" system to extract and compare DNA profiles and to calculate relevant probabilities having regard to different ""racial"" databases. Ms Gerhardt's ultimate opinions turn not upon the data relied upon by Ms Beilby arising from the use of the Powerplex 21 system, but on matters arising from the character of the sample tested on the blade, possible differences or discrepancies arising from the ""low levels of DNA present"", the significance of diminished alleles, and concern as to the characterisation of the staining on the blade (para 7.1, 7.2 Statement Ms Gerhardt 8 May 2014) 

22Thus, I concluded that the evidence sought to be adduced from Ms Beilby is relevant, it is evidence that is admissible pursuant to s 79 as an exception to the opinion rule in the Evidence Act and the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice (ss 135, 137 of the Act). No relevant unfair prejudice was identified in submissions in any event. Appropriate warnings will in due course be given to the jury.

		10 September 2014",2014-08-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764670,R v Thrift [2014] NSWDC 266,"Judgment


	
	This case illustrates why it is important for judges to provide remarks on sentence - that is, to explain the reasons for sentencing persons.
	
	
	I am sentencing a man who has pleaded guilty to possessing child abuse material, in other words child pornography. The material ranges over various categories including the most serious. The man has no fewer than three previous convictions involving child abuse material. Indeed he has spent time in gaol for some of those offences. Not only that, when he was arrested for the offence that I am sentencing him for, he was on an intensive correction order for the last occasion that he committed such an offence.
	
	
	Given these circumstances, it will come as a surprise to anyone reading this man’s criminal record without these reasons, that I am about to give him a good behaviour bond. That is why I need to explain what I am about to do.
	
	
	The man’s name is Scott Anthony Thrift. He is now 37 and had an unstable childhood. He claims that it involved being extensively sexually abused. I do not need to resolve that. I am conscious that I am providing public reasons and the person he accuses is not present or able to respond. That is why I am giving no more detail about that claim.
	
	
	Mr Thrift is a gay man who accepted his sexual orientation as a teenager. It was not so acceptable in the community where he lived so he left home and, in his own words, embraced a lifestyle involving parties and drug taking. This is reflected in his criminal record. The record does not start until he was aged 19 when he was convicted for an offence of larceny as a clerk. Then through the first three or four or five years of this century he has been convicted numerous times of offences involving dishonesty. He explains that during those years his life was out of control and he was taking - and therefore needing to finance - illegal drugs.
	
	
	What happened in this case is important to explain. When Mr A Amaranth opened his case for the prosecution he tendered as exhibit A the Crown sentence summary. This contained the usual documents which are given to a sentencing judge by the prosecution. They included the customary document called a statement of facts. Mr J Hutchinson who appears for Mr Thrift indicated when exhibit A went in that he took exception to some aspects of the statement of facts. I admitted that along with the balance of exhibit A but have kept in the back of my mind Mr Hutchinson’s observations about the statement of facts. Over the luncheon adjournment today I asked Mr Hutchinson to indicate what in the statement of facts his client took issue with. Mr Hutchinson did that and provided me with an annotated copy of the statement of facts.
	


HIS HONOUR: I depart from my remarks on sentence here. Do you tender that Mr Hutchinson?

HUTCHINSON: I do your Honour.

AMARANATH: Is your Honour referring to the amended document?

HIS HONOUR: It’s not amended so much as it’s a commentary. What I should do is mark it for identification rather than take it is a submission.

Mr Hutchinson, that’s what I have in mind.

MFI #2 COMMENTARY


	
	That document I will mark for identification 2 by way of a submission because it is a submission by Mr Hutchinson as to what is in issue and what is not. Many items are not disputed. Some were not within the knowledge of his client and there is one matter which was in dispute and is contained in para 19. I will return to that.
	
	
	What happened is this. In 2012 Mr Thrift was arrested for the offence of possessing child abuse material. This was the third time he had been arrested for that kind of behaviour. He came before the District Court a year later and was given an intensive correction order for two years commencing 12 April 2013 and concluding on 11 April 2015.
	
	
	Within days of receiving that sentence Mr Thrift went to the Surry Hills Police Station to get back the items which were seized from him the previous year when the police arrested him. They included a hard drive and a computer called an Apple mini. He also picked up other items such as his mobile telephone. The statement of facts contained in exhibit A, with commendable frankness, discloses the hard drive which was given back to Mr Thrift “still contained child abuse material (by mistake)”.
	
	
	The next thing that happened, so far as the police were concerned, is they called into Mr Thrift’s place some months later on 24 July 2013 with a search warrant. They confiscated various items and found that the Apple mini computer contained child abuse material. When they had analysed the Apple mini computer the previous year it had contained no child abuse material but the hard drive had. When the police analysed the child abuse material on the Apple mini computer they found almost all of it was the same material which had been present on the hard drive they had confiscated the year before and which they had returned to Mr Thrift.
	
	
	Amongst the items on the Apple mini computer was what is called a zip file which contained some child abuse material. Police could not open the zip file and had to have a specialist open it for them. They found some ninety different video files containing various levels, including the worst, of child abuse material. The statement of facts goes on to record that “73 of the 90 different videos were all previously identified as being on the [hard drive] when previously examined by police.” What police of course did not know is how the material, which was on the hard drive and given back to Mr Thrift, got itself onto his previously empty Apple mini computer.
	
	
	Mr Hutchinson called his client to give evidence. Mr Thrift explained he wanted certain material on the hard drive to be transferred to his Apple mini computer. So he simply transferred it and therefore his Apple mini computer became loaded with all of the material on the hard drive, including the child abuse material. He did not realise the child abuse material was there until about four days before he was arrested. The circumstances were that a stranger had visited him and the stranger was playing around with his computer. When the stranger left Mr Thrift found that the images on the computer included child abuse material. He immediately deleted what he saw but panicked and did not know what to do. He was still in that condition when the police arrived a few days later, seized both computers again and found substantially the same material.
	
	
	A question arises as to the 17 files in the zip folder which could not be identified as being seized by the police on the previous occasion. Mr Amaranath appropriately cross-examined Mr Thrift about that and Mr Thrift suggested the police did not examine all of the material previously seized. When he said that I checked the facts of the previous offence of 2012 (which were part of exhibit A) and indeed I found there were 340 video files seized but only 300 examined. Mr Thrift’s response to the question therefore exposed in the prosecution statement of facts the reasonable possibility that those seventeen unidentifiable files were amongst those previously seized and given back to Mr Thrift by mistake by the police.
	
	
	I mention it in those terms because one of the factors Mr Amaranath points out about the offence is that a significant aspect of Mr Thrift’s criminality is he added the seventeen files as fresh files. It is important in dealing with that submission to appreciate the principles of criminal law that apply and bind me as a judge in assessing such a submission. For me to sentence Mr Thrift on the basis that he has added the seventeen files would significantly aggravate the circumstances of his crime. The High Court of Australia has said that if the prosecution wants to prove against an offender who is being sentenced a fact which is aggravating in nature, it must satisfy the judge beyond reasonable doubt of that fact. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that fact because - just as I would say to a jury in determining the outcome of a trial - there exists a reasonable possibility that there is an innocent explanation for the existence of those seventeen files. That explanation is that they were amongst the 40 unexamined by the police on the previous occasion. I therefore cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Thrift added those seventeen files to those which he already had.
	
	
	Mr Amaranath made an attack on Mr Thrift’s credibility as a witness. He had a sound basis for that attack. There were two principal factors which formed that basis. One is that, as I have already said, Mr Thrift is a person who has a long record involving offences of dishonesty. He has dealt with other people in the past in ways that have been deceptive and dishonest and obtained money to which he is not entitled. That obviously to my mind affects the reliability of him as a witness of the truth.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Amaranath pointed out that what Mr Thrift was saying from the witness box was in some significant ways inconsistent with a history taken by one of the psychologists he had seen, the experienced forensic psychologist Ms Anna Robilliard. Mr Amaranath was right about that too.
	
	
	The question of Mr Thrift’s believability is relevant to a number of factors. It is not relevant to his answer about the seventeen videos. I do not need to accept or reject his evidence about that. His answer simply raises a logical and reasonable possibility which is consistent with the statement of facts about the earlier offence.
	
	
	Mr Thrift’s believability could be relevant to his explanation as to how long he had had the material and what he did with it in the months between 17 April and 24 July 2013. The prosecution would suggest that he had been using it and downloading it. In some ways some of the information taken by Anna Robilliard is consistent with that. But on the other hand, the terms of the offence to which he has pleaded guilty - also contained in exhibit A - are that he “did possess child abuse material, to wit, an Apple mini computer containing a number of videos and pictures depicting child abuse material between 1.15pm and 2.12pm on 24/7/2013”. The charge is therefore very narrow in its compass. It does not allege that he had the material for some months. It alleges in effect that he had the material only for about an hour. His plea of guilty must be, it seems to me - and I acknowledge that I may be wrong - an acceptance of possessing that material only for that time.
	
	
	I am therefore not going to find that, as an aggravating matter, Mr Thrift had knowingly possessed the material for much longer than that. I will sentence him on the basis of the terms of the charge that he has pleaded guilty to.
	
	
	There is a third matter where Mr Thrift’s credibility is important. I made reference to what is called a zip file and the fact that it was not immediately accessible by the police. They had to get a specialist to open it. Mr Amaranath appropriately explored this in cross-examination, suggesting that Mr Thrift had himself secured that zip file and protected it from being opened. Mr Thrift denied that, saying that the facilities he used were very basic and that he did not use any form of encryption to protect those files.
	
	
	Again, I have to take into account the standard of proof required for a judge to be satisfied of a factor in sentencing which is aggravating. The only evidence about the zip files is contained in MFI 2 and it is that assertion in MFI 2 which is specifically put in issue by Mr Thrift. The assertion is the specialist “was able to forensically recover and access video files and picture files from the zip file that initially could not be accessed by police”. The notation on MFI 2 is that Mr Thrift denies zipping in 2013. Given the explanation by Mr Thrift, on balance I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was responsible for protecting those files which were contained in the zipped folder.
	
	
	It is of fundamental importance to a judge in sentencing an offender to commence with an assessment of just how serious an example of the crime the particular case is. An offence could be a technical breach or a trivial breach or a very serious breach of the same law. In this case it seems to me that the breach, although not trivial, is not at all serious. I make that finding because of the circumstances in which Mr Thrift came to possess the material that he has been charged with possessing. He was given back the material by the police. I am satisfied that the material found by the police again some months later was the same as the material which they had confiscated in 2012 and prosecuted him for previously.
	
	
	As I pointed out to Mr Amaranath, the assessment of the seriousness of this offence is analogous to police confiscating a prohibited drug from a drug addict and then mistakenly giving it back to the drug addict and then arresting the drug addict some time later for possessing the same drug. The police, by mistake I accept, put into this serial offender’s hands the very material that he was criminally addicted to. That to my mind affects the culpability of the offender. It renders his degree of culpability very low. He had an acknowledged addiction - which is borne out by his criminal convictions - and was in error provided by the authorities with the very material that he was addicted to. Asked by Mr Amaranath in cross-examination how he came to commence using the material, he frankly acknowledged that when he was addicted to drugs and partying those he was mixing with could get into an “odd headspace”.
	
	
	Let me make clear that that does not justify in any sense anyone possessing child pornography material. It is rightly outlawed by Parliament and regarded as abhorrent by the community. That is reflected in the penalties which Parliament has attached to those sorts of crimes. But some people in the community find that they become addicted to illegal possession of such material. That does not excuse them accessing it, downloading it and possessing it but this case is a significant exception because the offender was provided, again I emphasise mistakenly, by the police with the very same material that they had confiscated from him and that he had been sentenced on before, in the knowledge that he was addicted to it.
	
	
	There is a good amount of material tendered by Mr Hutchinson about his client. His client has evidently built up a good rapport with Anna Robilliard and she has provided a number of reports over the years which support him and his efforts to rehabilitate himself. I will take into account her recommendations in sentencing him. There is also a report from another forensic psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro. I have taken into account the remarks on sentence by his Honour Judge Freeman when sentencing Mr Thrift on 28 June 2010 for the second of his now four episodes of this kind of criminal behaviour.
	
	
	I have significant reservations about the credibility of Mr Thrift. But the principles of the criminal law require me to give him the benefit of the doubt in the circumstances of this case and sentence him on that basis.
	
	
	An independent observer, Ms Robilliard, is impressed by his efforts at rehabilitation and that bodes well. Mr Watson-Munro said that Mr Thrift “impresses as an intelligent man whom I believe would respond positively to treatment should he take this course of action”. They have also made observations about his contrition for this kind of behaviour. It is because of his low culpability in committing the same offence on this occasion that I am going to take the extraordinary course of simply putting Mr Thrift on a good behaviour bond.
	
	
	An arguable alternative would simply be to sentence him to prison and let the time that he has spent over the last year or so serving out the balance of his intensive correction order - but in fulltime custody - count towards the sentence. I do not propose to take that course because it would suggest to another judicial officer sentencing Mr Thrift in the future that I regarded the crime in this case as so serious that it should attract a custodial sentence. That is not the case. I repeat, I regard Mr Thrift’s culpability in the circumstances of this case as exceptionally low. I think a sensible course is to put him on a good behaviour bond for two years and to attach such conditions to that bond which will encourage him in obtaining the help that he clearly needs for his ongoing rehabilitation and dealing with this criminal addiction.
	
	
	Accordingly the sentence which I impose is this. Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, under s 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing Mr Thrift to enter into good behaviour bond for two years. The conditions of the good behaviour bond are these:
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he appears before this Court if called upon to do so at any time.
	
	
	That he advise the registrar of the District Court at Sydney of his residential address on release from custody and of any future change in that residential address.
	
	
	That within seven days of release from custody he report to any office of the Community Corrections Office of the Department of Corrective Services.
	
	
	That he accept supervision from an officer of that service and comply with all reasonable recommendations of any such officer, in particular regarding the following: dealing with sexual offending behaviour; accessing psychotherapy sessions at the Wentworth Clinic associated with the Wentworth Avenue Community Corrections Office; obtaining a mental health treatment plan from a general practitioner for treatment by a registered psychologist; any referral to the pastoral care institute directed by the Reverend Dr Peter Powell; engagement in the positive lifestyle program conducted by the Salvation Army.
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Hutchinson and Mr Amaranath, I’ll explain that to your client in a moment Mr Hutchinson, but any other matters that--

HUTCHINSON: Your Honour it is covered by attendance at any community corrections office. I don’t think attending the city office would--

HIS HONOUR: I've deliberately not specified an office because we don’t know where he's going to live when he's released so I've left that as “an office”. Now it might be sensible to go to Wentworth Avenue, who knows but--

HUTCHINSON: Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I’ll explain that to him in a moment, yes.

HUTCHINSON: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I've deliberately left that.

OFFENDER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Amaranath any suggestions or proposals?

AMARANATH: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Thrift I've taken some time giving these remarks on sentence deliberately because it is an extraordinary low sentence and it’s important that I explain why. You're on a good behaviour bond for two years from today. Somebody will come down and see you in custody with the bond. They’ll come down in the next hour I imagine. The bond contains the usual conditions that you may be familiar with. You’ve got to behave yourself and stay out of trouble, any sort of trouble. If you get a notice to come back to court, you’ve got to turn up without having police or Sheriff’s officers chasing after you. When you get released you’ve got to email this Court or send them a letter telling them where you live so they know where to send someone if need be and if you have to be brought to court. And if you change that address you’ve got to let them know at the Court so that they can send somebody out to get you. Hopefully they won’t need to because you'll be busy getting on with Community Corrections. Within seven days of your release you’ve got to turn up at any corrections office, Community Corrections Office. I've left that open because I don’t know where you'll be. The most important is to accept supervision from an officer of that service and you’ve done that before haven’t you?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That’s what I thought. And I've specified a couple of things from Anna Robilliard’s report, Dr Peter Powell and the Wentworth Clinic, they're two of the things.

OFFENDER: I did actually - if it turns out that for whatever reason an alternative is offered to me do I need to come back to the Court?

HIS HONOUR: No, because I've left it just as you accepting their, that is the officer’s reasonable recommendations and directions and if they think no that’s not reasonable, not Wentworth, we’ll send you somewhere else or we’ll send you to this psychologist or another thing, that’s fine. Provided you do what they say, that’s the important thing.

OFFENDER: Okay.

HIS HONOUR: And that’s why it’s not so much me, it’s a recommendation. I recommend that they get you sorted out for the mental health treatment plan from a GP and this positive lifestyle program you heard Mr Hutchinson talking about that.

OFFENDER: I'm aware of the existence of that program, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, good. It’s now up to you. In a sense you’ve been caught red-handed but in very unfair circumstances and which I've taken into account in sentencing you so leniently but you’ve really got to deal with this issue and it sounds as though you're on the track to deal with it but you’ve really got to deal with it or you'll be back and forwards to gaol which you don’t want.

OFFENDER: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You don’t want to be going into your fortieth year in a couple of years’ time, you want to be out and doing things for the rest of your life and not just going backwards and forwards to gaol. Everybody said how intelligent you are, I'm not being patronising about that, I'm reading it in the reports and you’ve got yourself a degree, you're a librarian, these are all positive things. It’s not going to be easy adjusting in the community again, you know that better than I do but let those people help you. All right anything else?

OFFENDER: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Do you need to see your client whilst he's here? Well he might need you to go down and help him with the bond, I don’t know.

OFFENDER: I have signed one.

HIS HONOUR: You’ve signed one before, you know it, okay.

HUTCHINSON: I’ll go downstairs, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, that’s all. Thanks and good luck Mr Thrift.

OFFENDER: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It’s now right on 4 o’clock and I think you might have missed out Mr Hutchinson.

HUTCHINSON: I have, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I'm sorry about that but I say in my own defence that case needed extended remarks on sentence because of the extraordinary outcome and I’ll just give the exhibits back to my associate.

HUTCHINSON: Your Honour I wonder could I just impose on you that you order that your remarks on sentence be extracted.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, thanks I will. Yes, I would have done that anyway. I'm glad you reminded me. I direct that a transcript of these remarks on sentence be taken out and provided to me for revision and that will happen over the next month or two, it’s not urgent but I’ll see if I can remember to send a copy to you and to you Mr Amaranath as well so that you'll have a record of it. And thank you both for your assistance. It’s not been an easy case at all and it wasn’t the straightforward case we thought it might have been but it’s been satisfactorily resolved so far as I'm concerned.

2764685,R v Bryce (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 1184,"Judgment
1On 28 April 2014 the offender, John Keith Bryce, was arraigned on an indictment that charged him with the murder of Katryn Barton, also known as Catherine Jane Barton, at Waterloo on or about 15 May 2012.
2Mr Bryce pleaded not guilty to murder.  On 19 May 2014 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter.  On the return of their verdict, I convicted Mr Bryce.  The proceedings were adjourned to 8 August 2014 for submissions on sentence.
3The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 24).  There is no standard non-parole period for the purposes of s 54A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the ""Sentencing Act"") for manslaughter.
Discovery of Ms Barton
4At around 9:15pm on 15 May 2012 two police officers attended a Department of Housing apartment complex in Waterloo.  They went to a unit occupied by Mr Bryce and knocked on the door (the ""unit"").  They were seeking to interview Mr Bryce in relation to a complaint that he had assaulted Ms Barton earlier that morning.  After they entered the unit they noticed Ms Barton was lying on top of a mattress in the middle of the lounge room floor.  She appeared to be sleeping very heavily.
5The officers went with Mr Bryce to another room and spoke to him about the earlier incident.  When the officers returned to the lounge room they became concerned about Ms Barton's condition.  They asked Mr Bryce to wake her but he was unable to do so.  The officers called an ambulance.  She was taken to St Vincent's Hospital.  While they were at the apartment the officers asked Mr Bryce: ""How long has she been like that?""  Mr Bryce told them that he went to sleep and when he woke up Ms Barton was next to him.  He said that she had come back to the unit ""three hours ago or something"".
6Ms Barton was seen by a consultant neurosurgeon, Dr Richard Parkinson, at 1:40am on 16 May 2012.  By that stage she was in a deep coma. Dr Parkinson observed her to have fixed and dilated pupils.  He said that was indicative of ""impending death"".  A ""CT"" scan indicated she had suffered a major head injury with intracranial bleeding.  Ms Barton was maintained on a ventilator.  This was withdrawn following consultation with her family.  She passed away at 1:40pm on 17 May 2012. 
Events up to her death
7To understand how Mr Bryce came to be convicted of manslaughter it is first necessary to outline the course of events which led to the police attending that evening.  Most of the evidence concerning the following events was led at the trial, although some of it was supplemented by evidence tendered at the sentence hearing.
8Mr Bryce met Ms Barton in May 2011.  They commenced a relationship. About six weeks prior to Ms Barton's death she moved into the unit, which was in Mr Bryce's name.  At the time of her death Ms Barton was 49 years old.  Mr Bryce was 41 years old.
9As I will explain, both Mr Bryce and Ms Barton had difficult personal histories.  Mr Bryce's counsel described them as dysfunctional people in a dysfunctional relationship.  Harsh as this assessment appears to be, I accept it as accurate.  They both had histories of abusing drugs.  Certainly their relationship appears to have been volatile. The post mortem of Ms Barton's body revealed that she had previously suffered head injuries which appear to date to a time well prior to the events I am about to describe.  There was no satisfactory evidence to suggest that Mr Bryce caused them. Also at the trial there was tendered a body of material which suggested that Ms Barton had a tendency ""to act in a violent [and] aggressive manner in public places and ... a tendency towards self-harm"" (R v Bryce (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 498).
10On 6 April 2012 there was a confrontation between Mr Bryce and Ms Barton.  Mr Bryce provided a statement to the police in which he accused her of punching and scratching him as well as threatening him with a knife.  Ms Barton attended at the hospital on the same day and told the hospital staff that Mr Bryce had injured her face.  In the end result, an interim apprehended violence order (""AVO"") was taken out against Ms Barton, naming Mr Bryce as the protected person.  Whatever its terms were, they continued living together.
11On Wednesday, 9 May 2012, the proceedings concerning the AVO were before the Local Court.  Mr Bryce told the Court that he held no fears from Ms Barton.  The interim order was discharged.
12At around 6:00pm on Sunday, 13 May 2012, Mr Bryce and Ms Barton visited some friends.  During the visit Mr Bryce received a phone call. Ms Barton became very angry.  She chased Mr Bryce out into the hallway of the apartment.  At the end of the hallway he cowered in a corner, holding his hands up to protect his face.  Ms Barton proceeded to hit him. Their friends intervened.
13Very early in the morning of 14 May 2012 Mr Bryce and Ms Barton visited the hospital.  The hospital's records document Ms Barton complaining of chest pains and her being aggressive towards hospital staff.
14Whatever friction there may have been between the two dissipated during 14 May 2012.  At around 12:30pm they left a toy truck at the door of the friends' place.  At around 6:30pm they returned to their friends' residence.  Mr Bryce asked for some cigarettes.  Ms Barton inquired if they had received the present that had been left earlier.
15However, the evening was not peaceful.  Two residents of the unit immediately below Mr Bryce's unit gave evidence at the trial about a commotion they heard in the unit upstairs from late in the evening on 14 May 2012 until early in the morning on 15 May 2012. 
16In a statement that she provided to the police the next day, Ms Barton claimed that there was a prolonged confrontation between her and Mr Bryce that had started at around 1:00am.  She said that at around 5:40am while she was sitting on the toilet he hit her over the head with a toilet brush.  She escaped from the unit and went downstairs.  Mr Bryce denied hitting Ms Barton.  The next day he told police that Ms Barton has ""attacked me, she was off her head last night ..."". 
17A further confrontation took place in the foyer of the unit block on the morning of 15 April 2012.  At around 7:30am Ms Barton approached a security officer at the concierge desk. She was bleeding from her head and requested an ambulance.  She told the officer that Mr Bryce had hit her with a toilet brush.  She repeated this claim to other staff members.  She told them that she had been hit with the toilet brush while she was talking on the phone to her father.  At some point Mr Bryce walked into the concierge area.  He and Ms Barton started yelling at each other. Ms Barton threw a perfume bottle at him, but it missed.  He left.
18Shortly afterwards, police and ambulance officers arrived.  There is some conflict in the evidence about Ms Barton's lucidity at this time.  One of the concierge staff, Georgia Zimonopoulos, recalled Ms Barton being ""very agitated, talking gibberish and moving from one thing to another and that it didn't make sense"".  However, an ambulance officer, Olivia Mitchell, recalled Ms Barton talking sensibly and giving a coherent recollection of events. However she also agreed that, based on her observation of Ms Barton's speech and mannerisms, she suspected Ms Barton may have been ""under the influence of drugs or alcohol"".  Ms Mitchell gave Ms Barton a score of 15 out of 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, a scale that aims to provide an objective assessment of a person's mental functioning.
19Ms Barton was taken to a hospital just after 9:00am.  Sutures where applied to her scalp. She was seen by Dr Rory Donald McKeown.  Dr McKeown also gave her a 15 out of 15 rating on the Glasgow Coma Scale.  Ms Barton was discharged around 10:48am.
20In the meantime police had spoken to Mr Bryce and inspected the unit. They did not find a toilet brush. The police advised Mr Bryce that they would return and take a statement from him after they attended the hospital to see Ms Barton.  At 10:53am two police officers returned to the apartment building in order to arrest Mr Bryce.  They knocked on the unit door, but there was no response.  Mr Bryce's access card records indicate that he returned to the apartment complex at around 12:05pm. Police returned to the unit around 1:00pm.  They knocked on his door, but he did not answer.  Between 1:30 and 2:00pm Mr Bryce rang '000' and asked to speak to the police.  In one of the calls he claimed that he was bashed by Ms Barton.  The police returned to his unit, but again he did not answer.
21After leaving hospital Ms Barton went to Redfern police station.  At about 12:17pm she signed her statement and had photos taken of her injuries.  She left at 12:40pm.  At the trial a police officer stated that he did not experience any difficulties in speaking with Ms Barton while she was at the police station.
22Tendered at the trial was CCTV footage from various locations recording Ms Barton's whereabouts during the afternoon of 15 May 2012.  At around 1:21pm Ms Barton attended a methadone clinic in Enmore.  At 4:28pm she bought a Keno ticket from a hotel in Enmore.  At 4:50pm she attended a pharmacy in Enmore.  Witnesses from the hotel and pharmacy testified that they did not experience any difficulty in interacting with Ms Barton.
23Sometime between 5:04pm and 5:06pm Ms Barton returned to the apartment building.  
24CCTV footage and access card records show Mr Bryce entering and leaving the elevator on his way out of the apartment complex at 6:57pm.  They indicate that he returned between 7:09 and 7:13pm.
25Two witnesses, Luke Stokes and Raci Parlak, gave evidence of seeing a man and a woman in the corridor outside Mr Bryce's unit that evening.  There was no doubt that it was Mr Bryce and Ms Barton.  They both recalled that the woman needed assistance to stand up.  They thought she was affected by drugs.  They assisted the man in taking her into the unit.  They placed the woman on a mattress in the lounge room.  However the recollection of these witnesses as to when this occurred was very unclear.  Mr Stokes stated that it occurred ""just after dark"".  Mr Parlak said that it occurred around 9:00pm, but added that it was just after he finished watching a particular television program.  The evidence demonstrated that the program finished at 7:00pm.  There was evidence that both witnesses had been smoking marijuana for most of the day.
26The resident of the unit below Mr Bryce's said that some time after 7:30pm she heard furniture being moved and a ""drilling noise"" coming from his unit.  She did not, however, hear an argument.
27As noted, at about 9:15pm the police  arrived at the unit.
Mr Bryce's ERISP
28After Ms Barton was conveyed to hospital, Mr Bryce was arrested for the alleged assault on the morning of 15 May 2012.  He was taken to Mascot police station some time after 10:00pm.  He was released shortly afterwards without being interviewed.  After the police learnt of the progress of Ms Barton's condition they returned to Mr Bryce's unit at around 4:20am on 16 May 2012.  Mr Bryce was not there.  They were advised that he had attempted to visit Ms Barton at St Vincent's Hospital.  They arrested him at the hospital at 8:10am on 16 May 2012.
29Later that afternoon Mr Bryce participated in an electronically recorded interview with a suspected person (""ERISP"").  The ERISP occupied a number of hours.  At times Mr Bryce's responses were rambling.  He had difficulty in providing a coherent narrative.  Nevertheless, he denied assaulting Ms Barton at any time. He described Ms Barton as violent towards him and prone to self harm.  At times he expressed animus towards her, but only in the context of the difficulties she had caused him through her allegedly violent behaviour and false accusations.  About half way through the interview Mr Bryce stated that he had entered the unit around 5:30pm and fallen asleep.  He said he was waking up as Ms Barton came into the unit around 6:30pm (A422 to 427).  He said that they spoke briefly and had sex before falling back to sleep.  He said he slept until the police arrived (A 527). 
30Three points should be noted about the balance of the ERISP.  First, after this point in the ERISP Mr Bryce's description of the conversation after Ms Barton returned is less benign.  As he expanded upon the discussion, he mentioned that Ms Barton taunted him about having an AVO against him as he previously had against her.  At one point he stated that Ms Barton said to him ""Don't worry. I got the same as you, hey. That means I can come here but you can't hit me"" (A622). 
31Second, the interviewing detectives raised with Mr Bryce the effect of the evidence of one of the two witnesses that I have noted above (at [25]).  In response Mr Bryce admitted that after Ms Barton returned to the unit ""[they] were actually going to go for a walk down the shop or something"" (A865).  He said Ms Barton appeared to be too tired and he put her back to sleep.
32Third, although Mr Bryce complained about Ms Barton and said that she ""drives me crazy"" (A1024), he said he was still ""in love with her"" (A874).  
Post mortem
33As noted, the cause of Ms Barton's death was a subdural haematoma. A pathological examination of her brain only revealed that it had been caused within three days before her death.  Otherwise, the post mortem examination of Ms Barton revealed a significant amount of external bruising on her body.  However, a photograph was taken of Ms Barton when she attended Redfern police station around midday on 15 May 2012.  It also showed external bruising.  None of the witnesses suggested that any of the external bruising on Ms Barton's body post mortem was not depicted in that photograph.  The post mortem also revealed an area of bruising under her skin just under or near her right ear and an area of bruising under the skin over the left orbital ridge.  This bruising could have related to the incident which caused the subdural haematoma or another incident.
Issues at the trial and findings
34The jury were instructed as to the elements of the crime of murder and manslaughter. Three matters should be noted about the instructions to the jury. 
35First, the instructions to the jury did not refer to provocation and reflected the fact that no question of self defence or other lawful justification for Mr Bryce inflicting harm upon Ms Barton arose in the trial. At all stages Mr Bryce denied assaulting Ms Barton. It follows that the jury's verdict reflects a finding that Mr Bryce committed manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.  In this context, dangerous means that a reasonable person in the position of Mr Bryce would have realised that, by his act, Ms Barton was exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury.
36Second, the jury were specifically instructed that, unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Barton died as a result of an injury inflicted at or after 5:00pm on 15 May 2012 (i.e. after her return to the unit), then Mr Bryce had to be acquitted of murder and manslaughter. 
37This direction reflected the manner in which the Crown ultimately put its case. A significant part of the trial was concerned with whether the subdural haematoma must have been inflicted after Ms Barton returned to Mr Bryce's unit.  To that end, there was competing medical evidence as to the likely progression of the symptoms of her subdural haematoma. The Crown pointed to the various observations of Ms Barton's lucidity that were made throughout 15 May 2012 as negating the suggestion that she was already fatally injured by the time she returned to the unit at around 5:00pm. The defence pointed to uncertainties in that evidence, as well as to the tendency evidence I have noted above, as raising a reasonable possibility that Ms Barton could have sustained her fatal injuries prior to her return to the unit. 
38It follows from their verdict that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Barton died as a result of an injury occasioned after her return to the unit on 15 May 2012.
39Third, the jury were instructed that, although it was necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the voluntary act or acts of Mr Bryce that inflicted the injury that caused Ms Barton's death, the Crown did not have to identify the precise act that caused her death (R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A Crim R 199 at [46] to [49] per Spigelman CJ). 
40In this case there was no direct evidence as to precisely how Ms Barton suffered a subdural haematoma.  The post mortem had only revealed internal bruising that might have been associated with the infliction of the subdural haematoma. There were no obvious signs of a scuffle and struggle in the unit.  There was no witness who described overhearing a violent confrontation.  The post mortem examiner, Dr Johan Duflou, accepted that the type of force that could cause a concussion type injury could have inflicted the subdural haematoma suffered by Ms Barton.  Dr Duflou accepted that ""as a minimum, a fall to the ground [could] do it and a punch, as an example [could] do it"".  Dr Parkinson's evidence was to similar effect, although he stated that ""usually a subdural haematoma would require a reasonably significant force to cause it"".  He agreed that a ""fall against the wall or something like that"" could have caused it.
41The end result is that, other than the facts necessarily found by the jury, there is much uncertainty associated with ascertaining the basis upon which Mr Bryce is to be sentenced.  In R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 (""Olbrich"") at [27] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ confirmed that a sentencing judge may not take into account facts adverse to an offender unless they are established beyond reasonable doubt, and may take into account facts favourable to an offender if they are proved on the balance of probabilities.
42In this case Mr Bryce is to be sentenced on the basis that some time after 5:00pm on 15 May 2012 he engaged in some voluntary act that inflicted a subdural haematoma upon Ms Barton which caused her death.  The nature of his act was such that it was both unlawful and of a kind that a reasonable person in his position would have realised that by that act Ms Barton was exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury.  Beyond this, and consistent with Olbrich, I cannot make any finding as to the nature of the act.  Further, I do not find that at the time he committed the act Mr Bryce realised that his act was dangerous in the requisite sense.
43Three further factual matters should be noted at this point.  First the Crown submitted that Mr Bryce's failure to seek medical assistance for Ms Barton, and his attempt to deflect the police from assisting her when they arrived at the unit on the evening of 15 May 2012, were aggravating circumstances of the offence. 
44I have already referred to the evidence of Mr Parlak and Mr Stokes as to Ms Barton's condition when they observed her in the corridor that evening. It is clear that by this time she was suffering from her subdural haematoma.  Understandably Mr Stokes and Mr Parlak thought she was affected by drugs and alcohol.  However, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Bryce knew at that time that she was affected by her head injury. The evidence of other witnesses in the trial who observed her in the afternoon did not suggest that she was visibly affected by drugs and alcohol.  A blood test taken from Ms Barton after her admission revealed the presence of methadone and cannabis.  A pharmacologist, Dr Judith Perl, testified that Ms Barton's level of impairment during the afternoon of 15 May 2012 due to cannabis was ""not likely to have been high, if at all"".
45In these circumstances I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Bryce knew that Ms Barton needed medical attention. He knew her to be outspoken and tough and that only a reasonably serious injury would have had that effect on her. I am, however, not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew or believed her injuries to be life threatening.  I accept that Mr Bryce cared for Ms Barton. He would not have left her to die. 
46In Dulihanty v R [2013] NSWCCA 275 at [68] Johnson J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) held that the immediate departure of the offender in that case from the premises where the ""clearly injured victim [was] alone with no apparent means of assistance, [could] properly be regarded as a circumstance of aggravation of the offence"".  Those observations apply here.
47Second, the Crown urged the Court to find that the motive for Mr Bryce's actions was Ms Barton telling him that she had obtained an AVO (as revealed in his ERISP).  I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that matter.  While, in the ERISP Mr Bryce referred to Ms Barton making comments to that effect while they were having sex, there is nothing in the ERISP or any other part of the evidence that points to a connection between the imparting of that information and Mr Bryce attacking Ms Barton.
48Third, for the sake of completeness I am also not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Bryce assaulted Ms Barton on the morning of 15 May 2012. Ms Barton claimed that she was assaulted with a toilet brush, yet none was found.  Ms Barton also claimed that she was on the telephone to her father when the attack occurred, yet that was clearly not the case.
Victim Impact
49Victim impact statements from Ms Barton's father, mother and brother were read to the Court.  In addition, a report from a clinical psychologist concerning Ms Barton's parents was provided to the Court by consent.
50In his statement Ms Barton's father, Peter Barton, recounts that he was due to meet his daughter at a shopping mall on the afternoon of 15 May 2012, but she never made it. Instead the next day he found himself at the hospital next to his daughter's bed.  Over the course of that day he and his wife had to consider whether to give permission for the withdrawal of life support.  He explains that that ""took it all out of us and life has never been the same since"".  Mr Barton has been consumed by his daughter's death.  He has lost interest in the activities of life.  He acknowledged his daughter was not perfect.  He still sits in the mall where they were supposed to meet on the day she died.  In his own words he is ""heartbroken"".
51In her statement, Tanya Barton describes the agonising decision to turn off life support at the hospital, and the terrible effect of that decision and the death of their daughter upon her husband.  She is also very concerned  about the effect of her daughter's death on her son. 
52The psychologist's reports describe the difficulties that Mr and Mrs Barton have had in dealing with their grief, especially the decision to terminate their daughter's life support.  It is also clear that they both found the trial difficult.
53In his statement, Ms Barton's brother Geoffrey Barton referred to her children and grandchildren that she will now never see.  He is deeply upset and angry at the treatment of his sister by Mr Bryce, a person whom he considers was supposed to have looked after her.  Geoffrey Barton stated that when he thinks of his sister he cries ""and just nothing makes me happy"".
54The significance of victim impact statements was discussed in MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 (at [61] to [63] per Grove J, Hidden and Kirby JJ agreeing).  I am not to treat them as evidence upon which I can act or material which operates in aggravation of the offence or is otherwise adverse to the offender. 
55However the Court acknowledges that the grief of Ms Barton's family resulted from her death at the hands of Mr Bryce.
Offender's personal history
56Tendered at the sentence hearing was a report concerning Mr Bryce prepared by a psychologist, Mark Milic.  Mr Milic's report sets out Mr Bryce's personal background and circumstances. I accept that description.
57Mr Bryce is now forty three years of age.  He was raised in a coastal town in Victoria.  He was the youngest of three children.  He told Mr Milic that his mother had ""severe alcohol problems"" and he suspected she had ""mental health issues because she had been beaten by his biological father"".  He described his father as violent and as having had a ""severe gambling problem"". 
58Mr Bryce described having behavioural problems at school and being expelled at the age of fourteen.  He said that he was illiterate then and still has poor literacy.  He undertook some manual labour after he left school, but after that he ""has only worked in gaols"". 
59Mr Bryce told Mr Milic that he started using methylamphetamine when he worked on a fishing boat after leaving school. He also consumed marijuana and alcohol.  He told Mr Milic that he became a heroin addict in his mid-twenties, but overcame his addiction while on a methadone program from 2000 to 2002.  He told Mr Milic that he had remained drug and alcohol free since then apart from ""low levels of marijuana use"".
60Mr Bryce told Mr Milic that he met Ms Barton in 2012.  He said she stayed at his home regularly and ""was frequently mentally disorganised and aggressive due to intoxication with crystal methlyamphetamines and other substances"".  This is consistent with what he told the police in his ERISP and the evidence that was led on his behalf at the trial (see [9]).
61Mr Milic assessed Mr Bryce as having average intelligence.  He describes him as being disillusioned that, despite his efforts to rehabilitate himself, he is in gaol again.
62Mr Bryce appears bereft of support. He told Mr Milic that his mother was hit by a car and was being cared for by his sister.  Apparently his brother has had long standing mental health problems.  Other than his legal advisers, no one attended at his trial to support him. 
Prior offences and prospects of reoffending
63Mr Bryce was convicted in Victoria of possessing cannabis when he was fourteen.  From that time until 1996 he acquired a string of convictions in Victoria for drug and dishonesty offences.  He was convicted of assault, but the penalties imposed suggests that the offences were not serious.  He does not appear to have served any period in custody in Victoria.
64Mr Bryce's first conviction in New South Wales was for a charge of goods in custody committed in 1997.  He acquired convictions for shoplifting and the like throughout 1998 and 1999.  On 1 March 2000 he was convicted of break and enter with intention to commit a felony.  He received a minimum term of six months imprisonment.  This was reduced on appeal to a recognisance under former s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900. However in February 2001 he was convicted of receiving stolen goods and sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months.  His conviction also represented a breach of the recognisance. In November 2003 he was convicted of possessing housebreaking implements, and received a sentence of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 months.
65With one significant exception, the balance of Mr Bryce's criminal record in this State consists of various dishonesty offences.  On 13 January 2011 he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment with a non-parole period of five months for breaking and entering a dwelling.  His most recent period in custody expired on 16 March 2012 when he completed a sentence of three months imprisonment for stealing property from a dwelling.  Overall he has spent the better part of this century in custody.
66The one exception concerns a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm that was committed in 2007.  For that offence Mr Bryce was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months. The Crown tendered the statement of facts concerning that offence.  The victim was in a relationship with Mr Bryce, although she was living in a refuge because she was seeking protection from someone else.  She spoke to Mr Bryce outside the refuge.  She asked him to stay away.  Mr Bryce grabbed her and ""flung her over his shoulder"". He put her in a vehicle and drove off.  The relevant part of the statement of facts then states as follows:
""The accused has then pulled the victim from the car by the arm and threw her into the bushes telling her it was a cliff face.  The victim at this time was terrified as the accused told her that he took her there to kill her.  He stated that he would get a knife, which was in the vehicle and stab her (the victim was aware of a knife in the vehicle).  He then threw the victim down on some rocks, causing her to hurt her neck and again threatened to kill her.  He stated that he would have to kill her as she had ruined everything by talking to the police.
At this time the victim was on her hands and knees and the accused was kicking her. The accused kicked her so hard that she defecated in her pants, twice. The accused then allowed her to change her pants, but once again began kicking her, which again cause[d] her to defecate in her second pair of pants.
Whilst driving to the location the accused began punching the victim in the side of the head and was yelling at her as he believed that she was seeing someone else whilst he was in prison.""
The balance of the statements of facts recounts how Mr Bryce continued to verbally abuse the victim while he drove her back to the refuge.
67Needless to say, the level of violence that Mr Bryce displayed towards a female with whom he was in a relationship when he committed this offence resonates with this matter.  It points to a need for specific deterrence.
68Mr Bryce's history of offending does not serve to aggravate the offence for which he has been convicted, or otherwise warrant an increase in his sentence.  However, it does operate to deny him any leniency that might otherwise be afforded on account of prior good character. Most significantly, it informs the Court's assessment of his prospects of reoffending.  One factor in Mr Bryce's favour on that topic is that he has achieved some success in overcoming his dependency on drugs and alcohol, which appears to have been a feature of his offending behaviour until around 2000.  However his offending has continued.  Most worryingly, he has been twice convicted of offences involving serious violence upon women.  As I have noted, he has no family support.  Overall I assess Mr Bryce's prospects of reoffending, including his prospects of committing an offence of violence, as moderate to high.
Aggravating and mitigating factors
69Section 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act lists a series of aggravating factors the Court is to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence.  These factors cannot be considered as aggravating the offence if they are elements of the offence.  Section 21A(3) also lists a series of mitigating factors, but none were said to be relevant.
70In relation to aggravating factors, I have already addressed the finding sought by the Crown concerning Mr Bryce's failure to obtain medical assistance for Ms Barton.  Two further aggravating factors should be noted. 
71First, this offence was committed in ""the home of a victim or any other person"" (s 21A(2)(eb)).  Arguably the unit was Ms Barton's home and it certainly was Mr Bryce's home.  That said, I attribute little weight to this factor in this case.
72Second, the offence was committed while Mr Bryce was ""on conditional liberty"" (s 21A(2)(j)).  On 5 March 2012 he received a bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Act for committing larceny. The bond was of two years duration.
Special circumstances
73For the sake of completeness, I note that nothing in the material warranted the making of any finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act.
Conclusion and sentence 
74Of all crimes, manslaughter is said to ""thro[w] up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability"" (R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1995, unrep) (""Blacklidge"").  Even within the categories of manslaughter, such as unlawful and dangerous act or excessive self defence, the range of circumstances is ""notoriously wide"" and an offence in one category is not necessarily better or worse than one in another (Berrier v R [2009] NSWCCA 40 at [25]). Further, attempts to categorise sentences by reference to a ""single common component relating to the mechanism of death"", or the use of a particular form of weapon such as a knife, face the difficulty that there is no range of sentences for such offences (R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [226]). 
75These statements of principle are apposite to this case. As the above discussion makes clear, little is known about the circumstances in which Ms Barton suffered her fatal injury.  This offence cannot even be categorised as fitting within some well understood pattern of domestic homicides.  I have not been satisfied that Mr Bryce assaulted Ms Barton on the morning of 15 May 2012.  Their relationship was marked by mutual violence, but it was defined by their mutual dysfunction.
76Despite this uncertainty, the starting point is that manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life.  Ms Barton's difficult personal circumstances do not mean that she was any less deserving of the protection of the law than any other citizen.  She did not bring her own death upon herself.  Mr Bryce's voluntary, unlawful and dangerous act killed her.  However, I have not found that he knew his actions were dangerous in the relevant sense, but I have found that his actions were aggravated by his failure to seek medical assistance for Ms Barton.  Further, while not much more is known about this offence, a lot more is known about this offender.  That knowledge disentitles him to leniency.
77As noted, the crime of manslaughter covers a multitude of circumstances. The sentence imposed must respect the sanctity of human life.  However all the other factors in sentencing are engaged in this case.  These include general and specific deterrence, the need for denunciation and for the punishment to properly reflect Mr Bryce's moral culpability.
78In this case, I have assessed the appropriate sentence as imprisonment for a period of eight years constituted by a non-parole period of six years and a balance of term of two years.  As the offender was taken into custody on 16 May 2012, it follows that his custodial sentence should commence from that date.
79Mr Bryce, the offence of manslaughter is a ""serious and violent offence"", as defined in s 5A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).  I am obliged by s 25C of that Act to advise you of the existence of that legislation and of its application to the offence you have committed.
80John Keith Bryce, for the manslaughter of Catherine Barton I note that you have already been convicted.  You are now sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Pursuant to s 44(1) and s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act, I set a non-parole period of six years commencing on 16 May 2012, and an additional term of two years commencing 16 May 2018 and ending on 15 May 2020.
81The sentence will be taken to have commenced on 16 May 2012.  The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 16 May 2018 and the sentence will expire on 15 May 2020.

2764686,"R v Dacey, Ian; R v Dacey, Lee [2014] NSWSC 1201","Judgment
1R A HULME J:  On 11 August 2014 the two accused, Ian Dacey and Lee Dacey, were arraigned before me and pleaded not guilty to both counts in the indictment: murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so.
2They had previously been tried before Button J and a jury but for some reason no verdicts were reached.
3Each of the accused elected that their retrial be conducted by judge-alone.  The Crown agreed to this.  I was satisfied that all of the statutory pre-conditions had been met which left me with no discretion but to make a trial by judge order:  ss 132-132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). 
4At both trials the accused Ian Dacey was represented by Mr Hoyle SC.  Lee Dacey was represented by Ms Yehia SC at the first trial and by Ms Moen at this trial.
Overview of the Crown case
5The incident with which the case is concerned occurred at the unit block where the deceased, Mr Peter Dent, lived.  It was on Glebe Road at Hamilton South and appears to have been one of a number of blocks in a complex.  The accused attended the deceased's home on the afternoon of 9 August 2011.  They then travelled with him in a taxi to the home of the accuseds' mother at Newcastle East in the early evening.  It seems that Mr Dent was on friendly terms with their mother. 
6It was apparent to the taxi driver that the accused were under the influence of something (drugs).  Mr Dent somehow made his way back to his home.  The accused returned by taxi at about 2.30am.  An argument (verbal and physical) developed at about 6.00am.  The accused left the scene.  An ambulance arrived at about 6.30am to find Mr Dent had been stabbed.  He was taken to hospital where he received emergency treatment and was admitted.  He was making a relatively successful recovery but a cardiac event occurred at about 2.35pm on 14 August 2011 and life was pronounced extinct at 3.15pm.
7The Crown alleges that Ian Dacey is liable to be found guilty of murder on the basis that it was he who stabbed Mr Dent; the injury sustained as a consequence of the stabbing caused or substantially contributed to his death; and the act of stabbing was accompanied by an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
8The Crown alleges that Lee Dacey is liable to be found guilty of murder on the basis that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Ian Dacey to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Dent.  Alternatively, the Crown alleges that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Ian Dacey to assault Mr Dent and he contemplated the possibility that Ian Dacey would intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm.
9The Crown contends that if I was not satisfied of the relevant intention I could return a verdict of guilty to manslaughter.  Alternatively, if I was not satisfied that death was caused, or substantially contributed to, by the stabbing, I could return a verdict of guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
Overview of the defence cases
10There is no dispute that Ian Dacey stabbed Mr Dent.  But it is an issue as to whether he did so with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.  There is also an issue about whether he was acting in self-defence; more specifically, in defence of his brother Lee.  
11There is a more fundamental issue in relation to the charge of murder:  whether the injury caused by the stabbing of the deceased was the cause of death.
12In relation to the accused Lee Dacey, there is also a dispute as to whether he was a party to either of the joint criminal enterprises the Crown alleges. And he denies that he was directly involved in any physical assault upon Mr Dent.
Principles of law
13It is a necessary requirement of a judgment such as this to set out the principles of law that are to be applied.  I will do so with as much brevity as is possible.
Onus and standard of proof
14First and foremost, the onus of proof is upon the Crown and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.  The accused are presumed to be innocent.  One aspect of this is that no adverse inference may be drawn from the fact that an accused declines to be interviewed by police or elects not to give evidence at trial.
Causation in homicide
15Homicide in the form of both murder and manslaughter can only be established if it is proved that the act of stabbing Mr Dent caused injuries which ultimately were the cause of his death, or substantially or significantly contributed to his death. This issue is decisive and so there is no need to refer to the other essential elements.
Alternative count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent
16I am only required to return a verdict on the second count in the indictment if I return a verdict of not guilty on the first count.
17The essential elements the Crown is required to prove to establish such a charge are that there was a deliberate act of the accused that caused grievous bodily harm and that when committing that act the accused had an intention to cause such harm.
18The Crown alleges that the accused Ian Dacey was the principal offender in that it was he who stabbed the deceased and he intended thereby to cause grievous bodily harm which in fact resulted.  
19As I have mentioned, the Crown alleges that the liability of the accused Lee Dacey arises on a joint criminal enterprise, or an extended joint criminal enterprise, basis.  He would be liable on the first of those bases if it was established that he was party to an agreement with Ian Dacey that grievous bodily harm be inflicted upon Mr Dent; that such harm was in fact inflicted by Ian Dacey; and that Lee Dacey was present when it occurred.  He would be liable on the second of those bases if it was established that he was a party to an agreement with Ian Dacey that Mr Dent would be assaulted but he foresaw the possibility that grievous bodily harm might be inflicted; such harm was in fact inflicted by Ian Dacey; and that Lee Dacey was present when it occurred. 
20The issue of causation that arises in relation to count one does not arise in relation to count two as it is only concerned with death having occurred.  All that needs to be established for count two is that grievous bodily harm was caused and there does not appear to be any dispute about that.
21The Crown Prosecutor alluded to the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm as being an alternative available where the tribunal of fact is not satisfied of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  I will say more about this if necessary.  Self-defence
22Self-defence is an issue that the Crown must disprove beyond reasonable doubt.  The Crown can prove that an accused's acts were not done in self-defence by establishing either that the accused did not believe that it was necessary to do what was done in defence of him or herself or another person, or that what he or she did was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as they were perceived.
Intoxication
23Intoxication (if it is established) is a relevant matter in considering whether an accused formed an intention to achieve a specific result (in this case, death or grievous bodily harm).  It is also relevant to self-defence in determining whether an accused believed that it was necessary to do what he or she did.  It is also relevant in relation to the second aspect of self-defence in determining what the circumstances were that the accused perceived.  It is not relevant to whether the response was a reasonable one in whatever those circumstances were.
Other legal principles
24I should mention some other legal principles that I am required to apply in my determination of this case.  One is that I must give separate consideration to the cases concerning each accused.  It may be that I could find one accused guilty and the other not; or I could find both guilty; or both not guilty.
25Another matter I must bear in mind relates to the expert evidence I have heard during the course of the trial.  Some of it has not been disputed: for example, the crime scene examiner and the forensic biologist gave expert opinion evidence that was not challenged.  That being the case, I would have to have a very good reason not to accept such undisputed expert evidence.
26On the other hand, there has been a very lively dispute between the expert evidence of Professor Lyons and Dr Cala for the Crown and Dr Baron for the defence on the causation issue.  In resolving that dispute I must bear in mind that it is not simply a matter of choice as to which I prefer.  I must bear very much in mind that the Crown has the onus of proof and that the accused are not required to prove anything.
Causation - the evidence as to the manner and cause of death
27Ambulance officer Kenneth Isles and his partner arrived at the scene at about 6.30am.  Mr Isles found Mr Dent sitting on the bottom landing.  He established that there was a puncture wound to the left side of the chest.  There was decreased air in the left lung and he was concerned that it may have been lacerated, causing it to deflate.  This, coupled with the fact of the proximity to the heart, led to Mr Dent being promptly evacuated to the John Hunter Hospital where he arrived at about 7.00am.
28It was quickly identified in the Emergency Department that Mr Dent was suffering from a left hemopneumothorax as a result of the stab wound.  An intercostal catheter was inserted and about 400ml of blood was drained.  There was concern about the possibility of bleeding in the pericardium (the sac containing the heart).  This condition is referred to as ""pericardial effusion"".  The expert medical evidence in the trial was to the effect that this could be a dangerous condition as if the volume of blood increased it could place pressure on the heart, thereby compromising its ability to function.  A CT scan, and two echocardiograms were carried out whilst Mr Dent was in the Emergency Department but they revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
29Mr Dent was transferred to the High Dependency Unit (HDU) at 3.50pm and then the following day to a general ward.  He was given various medications including analgesics for pain.  The records indicate that he was progressing well in his recovery.  In notes made in the hospital records on 12 August he was described as ambulant, independent and self-caring.  He even walked out of the ward that evening.  On 13 August he was anxious to be permitted to go home.   On the morning of 14 August he again left the ward.  He was noted to be still experiencing pain and was given appropriate medication.  At 2.00pm a nurse noted that his observations remained stable.  Dr Dinesh Sinnaduray, who was involved with the deceased whilst he was in the HDU, was taken through the medical records and he agreed that as at 2.00pm on 14 August Mr Dent appeared to be making ""a very positive recovery from his injury"".
30Mr Dent left the ward sometime after 2.00pm.  At about 2.35pm a buzzer went off alerting nursing staff.  Mr Dent was found on his bed with his left arm jerking and his head tilted back.  There was no pulse and he was not breathing.  Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was commenced and the Rapid Response Team soon arrived.   CPR continued.  At about 3.12pm an Intensive Care Unit consultant attended and carried out an echocardiogram.  No pericardial effusion was seen.  Life was pronounced extinct at 3.15pm.
31In a Report of Death of a Patient to the Coroner (Exh P at p 2), Dr Mohammadi said as to the cause of death: ""Difficult to ascertain as at the time no cause for the pulseless electrical activity was found.  This included echo, looking for tamponade which was negative"". 
32Professor Timothy Lyons, a very experienced forensic pathologist, carried out an autopsy on 16 August 2011.  He identified six stab wounds but only one was serious; the one to the left side of the chest.  There were also some abrasions.  He determined that the serious wound had entered the seventh intercostal space, transected the intercostal artery and intercostal vein and entered the lung causing the initial hemopneumothorax.  It continued into the pericardium and to the surface of the heart where it partially transected a small vessel on the surface of the heart, namely a branch off the left anterior descending coronary artery.
33Of significance, Professor Lyons found that the pericardial sac was distended by 340ml of well-formed blood clot.  This was a pericardial tamponade. The source of the bleeding was the partially severed vessel on the heart surface.
34Professor Lyons said that it was possible for the partial transection of the vessel not to be detected by the x-ray, CT scan or echocardiograms performed upon the deceased's admission to the hospital on 10 August.  This was because Mr Dent's blood pressure would have been reduced as a result of the hemopneumothorax and in such a situation, small blood vessels can clamp so as to prevent bleeding.  He considered that a blood clot would have formed at the site. It was a small defect and he did not consider that the resolution of the CT and echocardiogram would pick it up.
35The next question was why a re-bleed started and resulted in the pericardial effusion, leading to the tamponade. Professor Lyons likened it to the risk of re-bleeding after surgery.  He gave the following evidence in the first trial (and in this, and other transcript extracts, I have taken the liberty of making punctuation corrections): 
""[P]ost-operative bleeding is a very common problem and that may occur for a number of reasons. It may occur ... if blood vessels clamp down and then subsequently when the body is returned ... to normal blood pressure and pulse, the vessels relax and it started bleeding.  But more probably what happens is a small blood clot forms and the body responds to a cut, that you get a degree of inflammation around that cut and you may get some cell and tissue death, so that the clot can just break off. ... [I]n my opinion, you can liken the injury on the surface of the heart to a nick from a surgeon's scalpel.  It's an incised wound which cut into a small blood vessel; [a] clot has formed on it; the body has responded by causing inflammation and some cell death to the heart muscle; and subsequently that clot has broken away and that sac around the heart is filled with blood.  ... [I]n simple terms the heart is a pump, so ... if you increase the pressure by filling the cavity around the heart with blood it will stop pumping, it can't work.
...
Q. Are you able to express an opinion as to what it may have been that caused, if it occurred in the way that you suggested, the blood clot falling away and the bleeding starting? A. I think it's impossible to answer that question. ... A clot can break away like this with someone lying in bed who ... has a normal blood pressure and pulse because the body's natural processes have caused some inflammation and cell death and it's just simply broken away.  ... [In my report] I talked about this man becoming ambulatory so I think by implication I have suggested that if he is up and about and walking about, that that may increase his heart rate and pulse and maybe that's ... a factor that could be involved in this. But I mean ultimately there was an injury [that] occurred on day 1 and on day 4 clot's broken away from the same injury that's led to his death."" (T1 - 382)
36As to the cause of death Professor Lyons said:
""Q. What do you say then was the cause of death of this man?A. Well, ... to be crystal clear, I put the cause of death out as stab wound to chest. 
Q. Did you want to say something else? A. No. And then I chose to elaborate in the body of the report as to the actual pathophysiological mechanism of death so I mean that's why I haven't put cardiac tamponade as the cause of death primarily because I believe the primary - the overall mechanism that led to death was a stab wound to the chest.
Q. What was the mechanism of death? A. Well, I mean ultimately - bleeding around the heart, a pericardial tamponade, stops the heart pumping.  So effectively the mechanism of death is a cardiac arrest because simply the heart can't operate normally. 
Q. How quickly can that happen? A. Well, once you start developing a pericardial tamponade, with reasonable rapidity. 
Q. What do you mean by that, are you able to put a time on it? A. I think once this blood clot's come off even from a blood vessel within, inside the heart, given even a fraction of a ml of - a very small amount of blood coming out of a vessel with the heart pumping, I think this is something that has happened over a number of minutes, but I couldn't say one minute, two minutes or five minutes. That's a - can I say that's as opposed to the situation we commonly see this in which is from someone who has ... had a cardiac infarct where the heart muscle has ruptured, so there's a big hole formed in the heart and that's effectively caused the death immediately.""  (T1 - 382-3)
37Professor Lyons put it more succinctly a little later in his evidence:
""Q. So what do you say was responsible for his collapse at the hospital on 14 August? A. Well I, my opinion is that the original insult led to transection of a small blood vessel that has, that initially became covered with blood clot and that the body's processes have led to inflammation and some cell death and that's led to breaking down of the clot that's broken off leading to bleeding around the heart that's led to death."" (T1 - 398)
38Professor Lyons firmly rejected a proposition that it was the CPR that caused the clot to break off and the bleeding to start:  see, for example, T1 - 398.20; 411.40.
39If it was the formation of the pericardial tamponade that led to the deceased's collapse at around 2.35pm on 14 August 2011, then it can be readily concluded that the stabbing substantially or significantly contributed to his death.  But why was such a relatively large accumulation of blood in the pericardium not seen when the echocardiogram was performed a few minutes before life was pronounced extinct?
40Professor Lyons said ""you would not necessarily expect to see it on an echocardiogram""; but that ""it's possible that it could have been visible"" (T1 - 419.39).  He offered the explanation that there must have been ""diagnostic error"".  He said:
""I'm suggesting that this may have been missed or that because there was - because this man had recently had a reinflated lung, that the appearance - and at the time of the final CPR were misleading and led the ultra-sonographer to think that there wasn't a tamponade, which there clearly was."" (T1 - 419)
41He agreed that there was no evidence of a tamponade having been missed; but he relied upon his findings on autopsy to support an inference that it had been. (T1 - 420)
42Dr Alan Cala was called to give evidence in the trial before me. He was not brought into the case until a second opinion was sought by the Crown after the first trial.  He, like Professor Lyons, is a very well qualified and experienced forensic pathologist.  He reviewed all of the relevant materials in order to formulate his opinion as to the cause of death.  He agreed with Professor Lyons. 
43A significant feature in Dr Cala's consideration was the fact that the bleeding into the pericardium was found by Professor Lyons to have formed a ""well-formed clot"".  If the majority of the bleeding had occurred in the minutes before life was pronounced extinct it would have appeared post mortem as liquid, not as a clot (T2- 99. 40; 112.12; 117.27).  So, for a clot to have formed, it must have occurred not just minutes before life was pronounced extinct.  Dr Cala said that blood coagulates during life to form clots and when it solidifies after death it congeals.  The processes are different and the appearance is different.  
44On a photograph of the ""well-formed clot"" (Exhibit R), Dr Cala identified what seemed to me to be a speckled appearance of some areas on the surface as being the fibrin protein that is involved in the clotting process (T2 - 85-88).  He conceded, however, that there was really no way of testing his opinion on this; that Professor Lyons had not commented about it in his post mortem report; and that the professor would have been in a better position to see it (T2 - 119).  The Crown Prosecutor accepted during his closing address that there was no evidence of Professor Lyons seeing what Dr Cala claimed to have detected on the photographs (T2 - 263).
45Dr Cala did not believe that CPR would have been the cause of the tamponade.  One of his principal reasons for that was his understanding that there would be little if any blood flowing through the coronary arteries during CPR.  In other words, there would not be enough blood flow to cause a collection of 340ml in the pericardium in a relatively short time.  (T2 - 91-93; 147).
46Dr Cala considered that the partially severed artery had commenced to re-bleed but, in contrast to Professor Lyons, he referred to it bleeding slowly (T2 - 95.36).  He considered the time frame for the collection of the 340ml in the pericardium would have been in the order of hours and possibly up to a day, although he conceded that this estimate was in the nature of ""quite a guess"" (T2 - 96.20).  Professor Lyons spoke of it happening rapidly, in a matter of minutes.  In any event, they were both of the view that the tamponade had formed by the time the deceased collapsed at 2.35pm on 14 August 2011.
47Dr Cala was of the view that 340ml of blood in the pericardium should have been picked up on the echocardiogram carried out at about 3.12pm on 14 August, if it was there (T2 - 109.29; 138.40; 141.43; 154.8), but he added:
""I accept that during the activity of resus it may have been the case that the scan wasn't able to pick up that blood for whatever reason."" (T2 - 109)
48He later offered that ""there may well be technical and other reasons as to why it may not have been seen"" (T2 - 141.44).  He agreed, however, that there was ""no evidence that there was any problem with the sonar or the operator"" (T2 - 142.5).
49In re-examination he was asked whether he had any experience of seeing something on autopsy that had not been detected by an echocardiogram:
""I've been involved in several cases over the years not just here but interstate and when I was in Sydney where these types of scans had been done and they have failed to show what's been present at autopsy."" (T155.21)
50Mention should also be made of the evidence of Dr Sinnaduray.  He was involved in the attempt to resuscitate Mr Dent.  He agreed that if Mr Dent had a clot in the vicinity of 340ml of blood inside the pericardial sac then that is something he would expect the echocardiogram to pick up (T278).
51Dr David Baron was called in the defence case at the first trial and again in this trial.   He is an eminent specialist in interventional cardiology.  He is currently a senior staff cardiologist at St Vincent's Hospital.  He had reviewed all of the relevant materials and the evidence that had been given by the other experts with the exception of that of Dr Cala (because of time constraints).
52Dr Baron disagreed with the opinions of both Professor Lyons and Dr Cala as to the cause of death. He also disagreed with various aspects of their reasoning towards their conclusions.  It is unnecessary to deal with each area of dispute. I will confine myself to the two essential aspects:  whether the tamponade was present at the time the deceased collapsed at about 2.35pm on 14 August 2011 and, if it was present, why it was not detected by the echocardiogram carried out at about 3.12pm.
53Before referring to his evidence on those matters I should mention that it was Dr Baron's opinion that the cause of Mr Dent's collapse at 2.35pm was respiratory arrest and then a total cardio-respiratory arrest. (T2 - 204)
54Dr Baron was of the view that the clot on the relevant cardiac artery did not spontaneously dislodge.  He gave a number of reasons for this but, in essence, it was his view that the damage would have been well along the way to healing on the fifth day; the danger period for spontaneous dislodgement would be more in the first day or two.  One factor he took into account in relation to this was that the hospital records showed that Mr Dent's blood pressure had been relatively stable.  He considered that what was more likely was that the CPR, carried out with the necessary vigour for it to be potentially effective, caused the clot to dislodge.  It was possible that this did not occur until after the echocardiogram was conducted at about 3.12pm.  It was possible for 340ml of blood to be ejected into the pericardium during the subsequent few minutes of CPR. 
55In cross-examination he was asked, if the clot was dislodged by CPR, why it was not dislodged until after the echocardiogram was carried out which was about half an hour after the CPR had started.  He replied:
""You can push on a door for 20 minutes, but it may not necessarily open until the last three minutes. There's no doubt in my mind that the vigorous massage dislodged the clot, but it may not have done it on the first compression or indeed the first ten minutes. It may have only been towards the end when it's all a bit squashed if you like, that it became dislodged.""  (T1 - 962)
56Dr Baron was asked about the echocardiogram not detecting any sign of pericardial effusion or tamponade.  In the first trial he said:
""If the tamponade caused the patient to have a cardiac arrest it should be really obvious. The reason I say that is we know the dimensions of the left ventricle from before [namely, from the full echocardiogram carried out on 10 August 2011]. To get a 340 mls tamponade you'd probably have about 2 centimetres or 20 millimetres around the heart. It would be ... really obvious. The whole heart itself was only 30 millimetres. If you can see the heart you would certainly see the pericardium and there was no reported, at that time, pericardial effusion."" (T1 - 957)
57He was asked about Professor Lyons suggesting that ""diagnostic error"" occurred.  His response included:
""I think it occurred post death myself but I suppose you would have to ask the Professor how many echocardiograms he's done and his real life experience. I can't vouch for that but to [me] it is inconceivable that a person could miss something almost as big as the heart."" (T1 - 958)
58A little later in his evidence he said the possibility of the tamponade being there but not being picked up by the echocardiogram was ""very unlikely"" (T1 - 962.50).  To cause death, the tamponade ""would have to be so big that I think you can't miss it"" (T1 - 963.5).  The fact that CPR was being performed would not have impeded the ability of the operator to detect a tamponade if it existed. And if the operator was not getting a clear enough picture the operator would have said so rather than stating unequivocally that there was no pericardial effusion: ""It's inconceivable that a person would say there's no pericardial effusion and have no picture"" (T1 - 963.26).
59The Crown Prosecutor in the first trial cross-examined Dr Baron as to his level of certainty about this:
""Q. But dealing with this particular case you can't be sure can you? A. I'm fairly sure. 
Q. You can't be sure, you can't be positive about it can you? A. Well I am sure. I am positive. I'm as positive that I'm not having a dream at the moment."" (T1 - 963)
60Dr Baron was equally adamant in this trial.  For example:
""It is inconceivable to miss a haematoma or blood in the pericardium which is as big as the heart, that's like saying you can't see the heart.  To me it's - it doesn't ring true."" (T2 - 209.35)
""I think it would have been really obvious [to the sonar operator if Mr Dent's collapse had been due to tamponade]"". (T2 - 211.23)
61He was invited to comment on the opinions of Professor Lyons and Dr Cala about a tamponade being present but not being picked up by the echocardiogram and he said, ""I just don't think that's correct ... that's making the things fit ... the thesis"". (T211.30)
62Dr Baron contradicted one of the bases for Dr Cala's opinion that CPR would not have caused the tamponade, namely that there would be minimal, if any, blood flow through the coronary arteries during CPR.  For example, he gave this evidence:
""Q. ... [G]iven the CPR was going on, you gave evidence last time that blood will find the point of least resistance and in this case do you adhere to the opinion that you gave then that the compressions were sufficient to cause the blood to flow down the LAD [the left anterior descending coronary artery] and into this acute branch of the LAD within that period of a few minutes?A.  Yes.  I mean myocardial blood flow is about 500 mls a minute.  Cardiac massage is meant to simulate that and if it's effective it will and the patient will survive.  40% goes down the LAD so 40% of that volume of 500 mls and where there's a hole it will choose to go there rather than go through the tiny capillaries where the resistance is greater so it's very conceivable with cardiac massage and a hole in the coronary artery that it will dislodge the plug and as long as the massage is going on blood will be squirted out through that hole.""  (T2 - 214-5)
63He also contradicted Dr Cala's evidence about blood clotting before, but not after, death.  He was asked whether he would expect the tamponade to be seen on autopsy as a clot if the blood entered the pericardium ""after he was effectively ... moribund"" and he replied that he would (T2 - 231.25).  Counsel drew my attention to the fact that Professor Lyons had also contradicted Dr Cala on this aspect when he said,  ""are you asking me can blood clot after death, the answer's yes it can"" (T1 - 415.3).
Causation - determination
64There were many issues raised in the medical evidence in this and the first trial. For example, there was much time spent exploring the fact that the deceased had a combination of drugs, including illicit drugs, found in his post mortem blood samples.  It was the defence case that this might provide an explanation for him going into respiratory or cardiac arrest. There is no need to delve into, let alone determine, every one of these issues because I believe the issue of causation can be determined by reference to the two critical issues I have just reviewed. 
65For the prosecution to succeed, it needed to establish that the tamponade was what caused Mr Dent's collapse and to provide an explanation for why it was not detected on the echocardiogram conducted shortly before life was pronounced extinct.  It was accepted that both of these matters require satisfaction to the level of beyond reasonable doubt (T2 - 243). 
66Dr Baron's opinion cannot lightly be dismissed.  He is highly qualified in his field and has very considerable experience.  His work entails regular involvement with patients who develop pericardial effusion and need emergency intervention (T2 - 208.10).  It was his opinion that Mr Dent's demise commenced with his collapse as a result of respiratory arrest and that the tamponade only developed as a result of vigorous CPR in the last few minutes before life was pronounced extinct.  The overall effect of the evidence was that by that stage, death was inevitable in any event.
67The Crown Prosecutor questioned Dr Baron's opinion that 340ml of blood could have accumulated in the pericardium in a short period of time after the clot had been dislodged towards the end of the CPR process. But Dr Baron had said that it depended upon the size of the cut in the artery (something about which there was no evidence).  With that qualification, he estimated that there could be half to one millilitre per compression so with a compression rate of 100 per minute, 340ml could accumulate, he said, in ""probably three to five minutes"" (T1 - 957.10). The doctor's mathematics are obviously inaccurate but he was giving a spontaneous answer in the witness box.  And he did say he was ""speculating a little bit"" and there was the qualification about the size of the cut.  I do not believe that Dr Baron's opinion can be rejected on this account.
68The Crown Prosecutor drew attention to Dr Baron's evidence that he could not provide an unequivocal explanation for why Mr Dent might have suffered a respiratory arrest. He suggested that the recent ingestion of illicit drugs might have been a cause but he hastened to add that he was not a toxicologist (T2 - 219.36 - 220.21).  The Crown referred to the evidence of Dr Allender, a toxicologist, who said that it was the opioid drugs that acted to depress respiration; amphetamine type drugs (the type found in Mr Dent's system) were stimulants, one effect of which was to increase respiration (e.g. T1 - 302.49; T2 - 174.35). (See also Dr Sinnaduray at T2 - 50.50).  Be that as it may, Dr Baron was basing his opinion on what he read in the hospital records: that Mr Dent was found to be not breathing (T2 - 205.2).   The fact that Dr Baron was not able to state a precise reason why there was respiratory arrest does not, in my view, mean it is not a reasonable possibility that there was.
69I accept the Crown's submission that there were various features in the evidence that stood in support of the opinions expressed by Professor Lyons and Dr Cala.  What I am more concerned about is the critical issue as to whether Dr Baron's opinion may be completely rejected, as it must be for the Crown to succeed on the issue of causation.
70The Crown Prosecutor addressed the question of why the tamponade that Professor Lyons and Dr Cala believed caused Mr Dent's collapse at about 2.35pm was not seen on the echocardiogram at about 3.12pm.  Reference was made to Professor Lyons' evidence that ""it is possible that it could have been visible"" but that he had experience of things seen on autopsy that had been missed during radiological investigations.  Reference was also made to Dr Baron accepting that diagnostic tools such as echocardiograms are not infallible (T1 - 960.14).  That concession was made at the beginning of the then Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination at the first trial.  What was not referred to was the subsequent evidence the doctor gave in which he could not accept that a 340ml tamponade was missed. (I have referred to this evidence earlier.)
71Dr Baron has considerable experience with echocardiograms.  Among his many qualifications is a Diploma in Diagnostic Ultrasound.  He was a foundation member of the Australian Society of Ultrasound in Medicine.  Between 1981 and 1987 he was Director of Echocardiography at St Vincent's Hospital. 
72Two of the three experts agreed that if a tamponade did exist at 2.35pm and caused Mr Dent's demise, it should have been seen on the echocardiogram at about 3.12pm.  Professor Lyons said it was ""possible that it could have been visible"".   The best that could be said to explain why it was not seen was that there must have been some form of ""diagnostic error"".  There was no direct evidence that there was such an error.  (The ICU consultant who carried out the echocardiogram was not called.)  It was a theory to explain something that was otherwise inexplicable.  In effect, I am being asked to draw the same inference as Professor Lyons drew.  But on such a critical matter, I can only draw that inference if there is no other rational explanation for a tamponade existing but not being detected.  Another rational inference is to be found in the evidence of Dr Baron.
73I stress that I have not come to the view that the evidence of Professor Lyons and Dr Cala must be rejected.  To the contrary, there are many reasons why it should be accepted.  But Dr Baron's opinions were also logical and evidence based.  They raise a reasonable doubt.  There is a reasonable possibility that the deceased died as a result of respiratory and/or cardiac arrest and that the injuries he sustained as a result of being stabbed did not substantially or significantly contribute to his demise. 
74Both accused must be acquitted of the charge of murder because the Crown is unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt an essential element of both murder and manslaughter.
Issues in relation to count 2 (causing grievous bodily harm with intent)
75The starting point for a consideration of the alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent is to note that it is common ground that the deceased was stabbed by the accused Ian Dacey.  It is also common ground that grievous bodily harm was caused. 
76The issues for determination are:
Did Ian Dacey intend to cause grievous bodily harm?
Was Ian Dacey acting in self-defence?
Was Lee Dacey a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Ian Dacey to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Dent?
Alternatively, was Lee Dacey a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Ian Dacey to assault Mr Dent but with foresight of the possibility that grievous bodily harm might be caused?
77Determination of these issues requires a more detailed review of the other evidence in the trial.  
The crime scene
78Detective Sergeant Kylie Phillips was the crime scene examiner.  She attended at about 7.30am on 10 August 2011.  She found that the block in which Mr Dent lived was comprised of two storeys with six units on each floor and external stairs at either end.  The block was rectangular in shape with the longest sides facing north and south.  The units on the lower level were numbered one to six, with number one at the western end, and the units on the upper level were numbered seven to twelve, with number seven at the western end.  There was a landing with a railing that ran the full length of both the top and bottom levels. Immediately opposite the railing on the bottom landing was a narrow garden bed and then an area of lawn and they were about 0.5m below the level of the landing. 
79The upper and lower level landings were about 1.5m wide.  The garden bed extended out about 1.2m before the grassed area which extended about a further 4.5m before meeting a wall.  The garden bed and lawn ran along the full length of the building. 
80Mr Dent lived in unit number 10.  It was in the nature of a bed-sitter.  No bloodstains were detected inside the unit or on the upper level landing.  A black handled knife (Exh C) was found immediately outside the unit on the landing.  It was later examined and found to be 240mm long by 25mm wide.  The blade was 130mm long and 24mm wide.  It was submitted for analysis to the New South Wales Forensic and Analytical Science Service and Ms Viviene Beilby, senior forensic biologist, gave evidence that it revealed on both the handle and the blade a positive result on screening for blood and a mixture of DNA with the major component being consistent with that of the deceased.  Both accused were excluded from having contributed the minor component.
81Professor Lyons was shown this knife and asked if it could have inflicted the most serious of the wounds.  He said:
""It strikes me that the knife is possibly a little broader than I would imagine a knife that had inflicted that pattern of injuries but it, given the elasticity of the skin and the variance in the way that you see different injury patterns, it's not inconsistent that a knife such [as] this could have been used."" (T1 - 379.45)
82There were apparent bloodstains on the railing going down the eastern stairs and on the bottom landing leading to an area outside unit 3 (that is a little more than half way along the landing).  Subsequent analysis revealed that a stain on the railing of the stairway and four of those along the bottom landing contained a DNA profile consistent with that of the accused Ian Dacey.  
83A blue striped sports jersey was found on the ground in the vicinity of the door to unit 5.  It was apparently blood stained. It was common ground that this had been worn by the deceased and had been removed by an ambulance officer. On a stained area on the upper left chest, which was positive for blood, there was a DNA mixture recovered with the major component having a profile consistent with the accused Ian Dacey.
84A metal Leatherman multi tool was found on the landing in the vicinity of unit 4 (Exhibit D).  It was apparently bloodstained. Its tools comprised pliers, a saw blade, a file, a screwdriver, a small blade, a can opener, a serrated blade and a knife.  Analysis at the laboratory revealed that it showed positive for blood on the plier head and a section of handle.  No blood was detected on the knife blade section.  Both accused were excluded from the DNA profiles recovered from the plier head section.  Mr Dent was the major contributor to DNA material recovered from the handle; the minor contributors could not be identified.
85The Crown does not positively assert that either the knife found on the upper landing or the multi-tool device found on the lower landing were used in the stabbing of Mr Dent (T2 - 23.44).  
86Medical paraphernalia and bloodstaining found on the bottom landing in the vicinity of units 3 and 4 indicate that to be the location where the ambulance officers found Mr Dent and treated him before taking him away to hospital.  An area of apparent bloodstaining nearby (Marker P) and another not far away (Marker R) were swabbed and later were found to contain a DNA profile consistent with that of the accused Ian Dacey.
87A black baseball style cap was found in the garden bed adjacent to the bottom landing (Marker V) opposite unit 4 (immediately below Mr Dent's unit).  The laboratory later found DNA on it in the form of a mixture with the major component bearing a profile consistent with that of the accused Lee Dacey.  That was found on the inside sweatband.  There was another stain on the outer surface of the cap at the front above a logo which contained a mixture of DNA.  The major component was of the same profile as the deceased and the minor component had the same profile as the accused Lee Dacey.  There were traces of DNA from at least one other individual but at levels too low to determine a profile.
88It was confirmed in cross-examination that there was no apparent blood staining on the first floor landing, tending to indicate (although not conclusively) that the stabbing did not occur there.
89The apparent bloodstains on the stairwell handrail were in the nature of transfer stains, consistent with someone who had blood on their hand holding the railing as they used the stairs.
90Another matter of potential significance given the eyewitness testimony was that there was no apparent damage to any chairs that were found on the bottom landing.  
Analysis of items later seized by police
91Police subsequently came into possession of a jacket which had been worn by Ian Dacey on 10 August 2011.  It had apparent bloodstains on the right wrist cuff and outside lower left from each of which was recovered DNA consistent with the deceased.
92A pair of joggers was seized when Lee Dacey was arrested on 8 November 2011. It seems to be accepted that he was wearing them on the occasion in question. On the tongue of the right shoe there was a stain which screened positive for blood and contained a DNA mixture, the major component of which was consistent with the profile of the deceased.
The factual issues
93At this point it is appropriate to mention the main factual issues to be determined.
94The cases for the accused were to the effect that Ian Dacey stabbed Mr Dent when they were upstairs.  He did so in a perceived need to defend Lee Dacey from a threatened knife attack by Mr Dent.  After the stabbing they each came downstairs.  There was some interaction between Mr Dent and Ian Dacey before Lee Dacey called out to him to leave and they both then departed.
95The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was an available inference that the stabbing occurred downstairs and it was accompanied by, or preceded by, a joint assault by both accused upon Mr Dent both upstairs and downstairs.  Mr Hoyle conceded that if it was determined that the stabbing occurred downstairs, self-defence would be negated.
Significance of the crime scene and DNA evidence
96The lack of blood staining in Mr Dent's unit or on the upper landing tends to support (but not definitively prove) the proposition that the stabbing did not occur upstairs.
97The finding of the knife on the landing just outside the door to Mr Dent's unit bearing his, but not the accused's, DNA tends to support the defence case that he produced a knife.  (It is curious, however, that the knife was found under the wheel of a bicycle - see photos 10-11 in Exh B).  There is also support for this in the finding of a bloodstain with Ian Dacey's DNA on the stair railing and further bloodstains on the lower landing which indicate that he had been cut somehow when upstairs.
98Ms Moen submitted that the fact that there was blood on both the handle and blade of this knife supported an inference that the stabbing had occurred upstairs.  That was a reference to presumptive testing at the laboratory.  Detective Phillips also performed a presumptive test and it was negative.  Photographs of the knife in situ and when later examined indicate that if there was blood on it then it was in a minute quantity.  If Mr Dent had been stabbed upstairs and his blood got onto this knife, I would expect it would have been in more obvious quantity.
99The findings of Ian Dacey's DNA on the guernsey worn by Mr Dent, and Mr Dent's DNA on the jacket worn by Ian Dacey, tend to confirm contact between the pair in some fashion.  Given the acceptance that Ian Dacey stabbed Mr Dent, this is unremarkable.  And the location of bloodstains with his DNA confirms he was in the vicinity of Mr Dent on the bottom landing.
100The Leatherman multi-tool found on the lower landing can be excluded as the instrument used to stab Mr Dent.  The longest blade is not long enough.  There was no physical evidence found to link it to either accused.  DNA material consistent with Mr Dent's profile was found on the handle but it is unclear whether this was from him handling the object or from his blood having gotten on to it when it was nearby.
101The finding of Mr Dent's DNA on Lee Dacey's joggers and cap is neutral.  There is no evidence as to what bodily material of Mr Dent was on the cap (that is, whether it was blood, saliva or skin cells).  There is evidence that the material on the joggers was, presumptively, blood.  In both cases it is a matter of speculation as to how and when the material got there beyond saying that the material on the joggers tends to suggest he was in close proximity to Mr Dent when he was bleeding.
Movements of the accused prior to the event
102Mr Warren Curtis is a taxi driver.  He gave evidence of picking up the two accused and the deceased at around 6.30pm on 9 August 2011 near the deceased's home and taking them to Newcastle.  He said that Mr Dent appeared to be sober but the two accused were definitely affected by either alcohol or drugs; they had trouble getting into the taxi and were ""nodding off"" in the back seat.  Mr Dent explained to Mr Curtis, ""One of the boys has been celebrating all day. That's why they're the way they are, they're brothers"".
103There is no direct evidence of it but it is common ground that Mr Dent returned home at some stage of the evening.
104Mr Marcus Groh is also a taxi driver.  He said that he picked up the two accused at around 2.25am near Newcastle railway station and took them to Hamilton.  They smelt of alcohol and their speech was slurred. CCTV footage (Exh L) recorded in the vicinity of the railway station showed Lee Dacey walking normally but Ian Dacey staggering around. 
105Mr Groh said that one of the men was taller than the other by at least 5cm.  (That estimate was not challenged.)  When the men had alighted from the taxi he noticed that the taller one (Lee Dacey is taller than his brother) who had been sitting in the back had left something on the seat.  He called out, ""Oi, you've dropped something"".  The man reached back in and grabbed the object.  Mr Groh's description of it and a sketch he drew (Exh G) are consistent with it being a Leatherman multi-tool device, similar to the one later found at the crime scene.  
106It was suggested in cross-examination that it was the shorter of the two men (Ian Dacey) who had been seated in the rear but he insisted that it was the taller man.  Ms Moen submitted that it made sense that her client sat in the front seat, given he was less intoxicated that Ian Dacey.  I do not think that their relative degrees of intoxication would make that more likely.
107The Crown Prosecutor invited me to accept Mr Groh's evidence.  Alternatively, he submitted that which ever accused was the passenger in the back seat, Mr Groh calling out and the passenger reaching back in to retrieve the object rendered it likely that both accused would have been aware that one of them had the object.  As I understood the submission, the fact that one was bringing such an object to Mr Dent's home supported the Crown case that there was a joint criminal enterprise. 
108I am minded to accept Mr Groh, notwithstanding the contrary evidence given by Lee Dacey to which I shall refer shortly.  Mr Groh's evidence was clear.  He said that when he spoke with the police on 30 August 2011 he had a reason to remember this particular fare because of the knife left on the back seat. When it was suggested to him by the cross-examiner that the taller man sat in the front he maintained his position. He committed his recollection to writing only 20 days after the event.  It was not suggested he had said anything inconsistent about the seating arrangements in that statement.  
109I also accept the force of the Crown Prosecutor's submission that given the front seat passenger was still in close proximity to the taxi when Mr Groh called out and the rear seat passenger lent back in to retrieve the object, it is likely both brothers were aware that one of them had this implement.  But I am doubtful that it supports the proposition of there being a joint criminal enterprise to cause harm to Mr Dent in existence at this time.
The incident
110A number of neighbours gave evidence of hearing and seeing things relating to, and leading up to, the stabbing.  I will refer to their evidence shortly but it is appropriate to first refer to the evidence given by Lee Dacey in the first trial.  It may be taken that it was embraced by Ian Dacey from the fact that, although he was cross-examined, there was no challenge to any material aspect of his version.
Lee Dacey
111Lee Dacey said that he had known Mr Dent for nearly 10 years as he was a friend of Lee Dacey's mother.  He and his brother went to Mr Dent's home at around dusk on 9 August 2011.  They were there for an hour or two.  They purchased for $350 a half a gram of speed which the three then shared but otherwise they occupied the time chatting ""like friends do"". They then travelled by taxi to the home in Newcastle East where Lee Dacey lived with his mother.  There they chatted and watched television.  Mr Dent left after a couple of hours.
112At about 2.30am, the two brothers caught a taxi near Newcastle railway station to Mr Dent's home.  He maintained that he sat in the front seat. He did not have a multi-tool and he was not aware of his brother having any weapon. He did not hear any conversation with Mr Groh about an item left on the back seat. 
113They went to Mr Dent's home. Their purpose was ""to score more speed"". He was awake when they arrived. He told them that they would have to hang around for a while because he could not go to his supplier at such an hour of the morning.  In the meantime they watched television, chatted and had a laugh.   
114Mr Dent did not leave until ""at least half past 5"".  Lee Dacey gave him $350 for the purchase, either by handing it to him or putting it on the table. Mr Dent was gone for no longer than half an hour.  While he was gone the brothers dozed off. 
115When Mr Dent returned he tapped Lee Dacey on the shoulder.  He woke up straight away and asked, ""Did you get it?""  Mr Dent said that he had but when Lee Dacey asked him for it, Mr Dent claimed that he had not been given the money yet.  They debated this.  Mr Dacey said that he woke his brother up so that he could verify that the money had been provided earlier.  He said to Ian, ""He's trying to rip us off"".  He then turned and continued his argument with Mr Dent.  It continued with the pair moving out onto the landing where the following occurred:
""I said, 'We give you the money'. [Mr Dent responded] 'Youse aren't getting fucking nothing' and he pulled a knife out, a kitchen knife out of, with his right hand out of the back part of his belt, like his pants just there."" (T1 - 972.30)
116He was shown a photograph of the knife later found on the landing outside Mr Dent's unit and said it either was the knife or ""it's very very similar"". 
117Lee Dacey claimed that Mr Dent also said, ""Youse aren't getting fucking nothing, I'm going to fucking stab you"".  He said he walked backwards because ""it was a shock to me. I didn't want to get cut or stabbed.""  He backed up towards the railing as Mr Dent was facing him.  He said that Ian Dacey was behind him (which sounds impossible if Lee Dacey was backed up towards the railing, particularly given the landing was only about 1.5m wide). He said his brother intervened.  There was a fight between Ian Dacey and Mr Dent involving scuffling and punching.  It reached a point when Mr Dent's back was ""on the railing sort of just arched over a bit"".  Lee Dacey said he told them to ""stop it, just stop it"" and he broke them apart.  He held on to his brother and Mr Dent proceeded downstairs.  It was when he was trying to break the pair up that his cap got knocked off and fell to the ground below.
118Lee Dacey said that he did not have any weapon and he did not punch Mr Dent.  All he did was break them apart to stop the fighting and hold on to his brother. He denied a number of matters; in effect denying that there was any joint criminal enterprise.  He said it all happened very quickly; ""like in a minute, two minutes, if that"". 
119He was asked if he realised that Mr Dent had been stabbed.  He replied, ""No I didn't at that time"".  In cross-examination he said that he did not see a knife in his brother's hand up on the top landing.  He was not aware his brother had a knife at all.  They did not later discuss where he got a knife from.
120Mr Dent went down the stairs followed by Ian Dacey.  He proceeded to follow after them. When he arrived at the ground level he went out onto the grassed area and his brother ""was walking with me"".  Mr Dent called out, ""You fucking stabbed me you cunt"".  He claimed that up to that time he did not know that Mr Dent had been stabbed.  He turned and saw his brother over in the garden at the railing to the bottom landing. He called out, ""Come on Ian, let's go"".  Ian Dacey came over to him and they left. 
121Lee Dacey denied going near the bottom landing; denied punching Mr Dent; and denied having any agreement or understanding with his brother to assault Mr Dent.  He said it was only when they were on their way to Rachel Caldwell's home that his brother told him that he had stabbed Mr Dent.  He responded, ""Oh fuck, you stabbed him"" and ""that's all I basically said about it and I was, yeah, I was a bit shocked"". 
122Lee Dacey said that when Mr Dent approached him with the knife it was ""very unexpected, he was my friend""; ""I was scared for my life"".  He denied any intention to hurt Mr Dent.  He was angry with him for ""trying to rip us off"" but never wanted to hurt him.
123I turn to the evidence of the neighbours.
Robert West
124Mr Robert West lived in unit 4 which was directly underneath number 10.  He woke on the morning of 10 August at around 3 or 4am.  He could hear male voices upstairs.  He recognised Mr Dent's voice but not the others.  He went back to sleep but woke again at around 5.00 or 5.30am.  The voices were a bit louder; it sounded like an argument.  He next heard footsteps outside proceeding towards, then down, the stairs at the eastern end.  First there was one set, like one person running, and sometime later they were followed by a couple more sets of footsteps.  
125Mr West next heard Mr Dent knocking on the door of unit 3 which was occupied by Ty Lee.   Mr West opened his door and saw Mr Dent calling out ""Mr Lee, Mr Lee"".  He did not see any other people on the bottom landing at that time.  He later saw two males on the bottom landing; they were jostling.  They came down the stairs towards Mr Dent and grabbed him with both hands around the torso.  At this point Mr Dent was directly outside Mr West's door calling out, ""Robert help me"".  Mr West closed the door, put some clothes on and returned to the door.  He had been away from the door for about 30 seconds.  Mr Dent was still just outside and the two males were on the bottom landing.  He said they appeared to be angry.  One of them picked up a chair and threw it and it hit Mr Dent.  The men then ran off.  Mr West said that Mr Dent said something about having been stabbed.  
126Mr West conceded a number of matters that were raised in cross-examination.  He had previously suffered a head injury and experienced lapses in both short and long term memory. He agreed that he might be confused about some of the things he claimed to remember.  He agreed that the lighting was not very good; he could not make out much more than just silhouettes.  But he denied that the taller man (Lee Dacey) was on the grassed area in front of the bottom landing as opposed to being on the landing itself. 
127Mr West's conceded memory difficulties call for some circumspection in accepting his evidence where it is not otherwise supported.
Brian Leary
128Mr Brian Leary's evidence given on a prior occasion was read to the jury at the first trial.  He lived next door to Mr Dent in unit 11.  He woke on the morning of 10 August at around 6.00am, had a shower and walked to a local shop.  On his way out he heard a voice coming from Mr Dent's unit: ""We left the money on the table"" and then heard Mr Dent say, ""There was no money on the table"".  That was all he heard and he proceeded to the shop.  When he returned he saw that there were ambulance and police officers present.
Jeffrey Sawyer
129Mr Jeffrey Sawyer lived in unit 5 on the ground floor.  On the morning of 10 August he was woken by the sound of voices upstairs.  He heard someone say, ""I've only got $35 to my name"".  Mr Dent called out, ""and I need some furniture and stuff"".  He then heard various banging and clanging noises and the sound of Mr Dent coming downstairs.  Mr Sawyer got up and went to his door and saw Mr Dent sitting at the door of his neighbour, Mr West.  He was bleeding.  He said two men came down from Mr Dent's unit via the eastern stairs.  One of them continued in a westerly direction on the grassed area.  The other one stopped and had words and a scuffle with Mr Dent.  Mr Dent called out, ""You stabbed me you cunt"".   Both men were on the grassed area but there was a scuffle involving Mr Dent and one of them over the railing.  The two men then left and an ambulance was called. 
Arthur Tovey
130Mr Arthur Tovey lived in unit 12. He woke early as he usually did and at about 6.00am he heard Mr Dent out on the landing speaking on the phone, saying ""You better come over and get him, he's been here all night and he's driving me crazy"".  Then he said, ""Your mum wants to talk to you on the phone"".  He did not hear anything in response and assumed that Mr Dent must have gone inside his unit.
131Mr Tovey next heard someone running past his door; this was at about 6.15am.  He did not pay any attention and remained inside his unit until 9.00am when a police officer knocked on the door.
David James
132Mr David James lived in unit 6. He rose early and went to the local newsagent to get the paper.  When he returned he heard some commotion; an argument of some sort; loud voices.  As he proceeded along the bottom landing towards his unit he saw two men coming quickly down the eastern stairs.  Mr Dent was first and there was someone behind him.  Mr James hurried to get inside his unit. The man behind Mr Dent was giving him a push.  Another man (who I accept was Lee Dacey) came down the stairs in a hurry; as he came past (presumably past Mr James on the landing) he lashed out at nothing with his foot.  Mr James went into his unit and closed the door.  He did not hear anything more.  At 7.00am he became aware of the presence of police officers.  In cross-examination, Mr James denied a proposition that the second man did not continue from the stairs onto the landing but went out onto the grassed area.  
Leonie Burns
133Ms Leonie Burns lived in a unit block that overlooked the block Mr Dent lived in.  She woke just after 6.00am to sounds that included three male voices yelling.  She went to her window and saw three men fighting.  She said they were in a location that was inconsistent with all of the other evidence, namely near a laundry block and clothesline. With the use of the scale plan (Exh A) and a photograph (Exh 9) I estimate that this was some 10-12 metres away from Mr Dent's unit block. She was asked whether it was possible that the men were on the bottom landing of the building but said they were not.  She said the men were wrestling and punching and Mr Dent was falling to the ground and trying to get up.  She did not see anything in the hands of any of the men. She said they were all yelling but could not make out what was being said.  She conceded that the lighting was ""not the best"". 
134In cross-examination, Ms Burns was somewhat uncertain that there were three voices yelling as opposed to two. She also conceded she was distracted by her infant children.  She made other concessions, including that she could not make out the features of the men; they had their backs to her; the lighting was not good; and she was looking through a window that was foggy and wet.  But she remained insistent that she saw three men together. 
135Given the location where she said the men were, I am compelled to regard Ms Burns' evidence as unreliable.  She said she did not realise it was Mr Dent who was involved in the incident she saw.  She agreed that fights were not unusual in the area.  There must be a real possibility that she had merged memories of this incident with another one. 
Emilie Davis
136Ms Emilie Davis was staying in the same unit block in which Ms Burns resided.  She woke to the sound of fighting, yelling and screaming.  She got out of bed, opened the window and saw three men fighting and yelling; they were ""huddled together"". They were on the upper landing of Mr Dent's unit block. She yelled out something to the effect that they should be quiet.  Ms Davis attended to her infant son but she could still hear the yelling and screaming.  She looked out from another window and saw three men still on the upper landing.  The shorter one (Ian Dacey) was fighting with Mr Dent over the railing while the taller one (Lee Dacey) briefly went back into Mr Dent's unit.  Mr Dent broke free and ran to the eastern stairs and proceeded down them.  The shorter man (Ian Dacey) followed him and then so too did the taller man (Lee Dacey).  
137Ms Davis said that once they were downstairs, Mr Dent proceeded to the west along the lower landing, but the two men caught up to him around the first flat (unit 6); they grabbed him and threw him up against the wall and then made actions consistent with punching.  Mr Dent managed to escape after about a minute, but he ended up on the ground and the taller man (Lee Dacey) picked up a plastic outdoor chair and threw it at him.  The two men then left, proceeding west along the landing.  The next thing that happened was the arrival of an ambulance.  
138In cross-examination, Ms Davis conceded that she did not know Mr Dent at the time. She had subsequently heard his name mentioned as the victim of what had occurred.  She was tested as to her ability to have seen what she claimed occurred, given that there was a freestanding laundry building in the way as well as some trees.  She maintained that when the men were on the bottom landing she could still see the top half of their bodies.  She did not see some things that other witnesses had claimed to have seen.   She said she last saw Mr Dent when he was towards the far right hand (western) end of the bottom landing; she was adamant and would not accept she could be wrong.  The punching she saw occurred at that end, not outside one of the flats at the eastern end.  She denied a proposition that Mr Dent was only involved in a fight with one man at that location.
139Ms Yehia obtained a concession from Ms Davis that when she saw the men on the upper landing it looked like two men fighting with a third man (the taller one) trying to pull one from the other. With reference to a photograph (Exhibit K) she said that Mr Dent was slammed up against the brick wall downstairs towards the eastern end of the bottom landing.  She denied a suggestion that the taller man was not involved in that aspect. She denied being confused about which of the two men threw the chair; she had never been confused about that; and, when she was reminded of it, she explained that in saying at the committal hearing that it was the shorter man she must have been confused. 
Justin Moss
140Justin Moss lived in a nearby unit block and knew the deceased.  On the morning of 10 August 2011 he left his unit at 6.15 and was walking towards Glebe Road where a friend was going to pick him to take him to work.  As he passed by he heard yelling and swearing and he also heard people calling out from windows to the effect that the people involved should be quiet.  He said the lighting was dismal; it was just becoming light.  
141As he got closer to Mr Dent's unit block he saw some people who were outside the front door of Mr Sawyer's unit (unit 5).  He said one person was standing with his back at the rail which he thought was Mr Sawyer.  He saw Mr Dent who he described as ""cowering down with his hands up"" and there was another man punching him.  He said he was sitting on a step at the doorway with his knees to his chest and his hands up over his head.  He didn't recognise the man who was punching him.  He said that man was about 6' tall and he described his clothing.  
142Mr Moss said that there was another man down on the grass, a smaller man who was about 5' 5"".  He was yelling out, ""come on, he's had enough"" and, ""come on, Ian, let's go"".
143The man who was punching Mr Dent got up and walked away; he jumped the handrail down off the balcony and walked towards Glebe Road, namely to the west.  Mr Moss was in a hurry so he kept going.  The last he saw of Mr Dent was when he was sitting on a step.  He was making no noise; he was just sitting still in the same position with his knees to his chest.
144In cross-examination by Mr Hoyle, Mr Moss said that whole thing happened quickly.  He watched for about 15 or 20 seconds.  He did not see a chair being thrown.
145In cross-examination by Ms Yehia, Mr Moss said that the fourth man was somewhere on the grassed area, 20 to 25 feet away from where the three men were on the landing.  He was on the western side of where the action was occurring.  He was cross-examined about the relative heights of the men in question but nothing turns on this as his evidence that the man on the grass called out, ""come on, Ian, let's go"" indicates that it must have been Lee Dacey.  
Edith Lindstrom
146Ms Edith Lindstrom lived in a unit block that overlooked Mr Dent's block.  She was in the shower from about 6am when she heard some people yelling.  At about 6.15 when she got out of the shower she said the yelling and the commotion was still going on.  She looked out of her bathroom window and saw Mr Dent, who she knew.  He was at the railing on the bottom landing and a male who was standing on the grass below the railing was trying to pull him over.  Mr Dent was resisting.  There was a third male who was standing behind the one who was trying to pull Mr Dent over the railing.  He was standing a short distance behind on the grass.  He said, ""that's enough, let's go"".  With that the first male let go of Mr Dent who then sat down on the concrete landing and leant over.  The two males walked away.
Findings as to the evidence of neighbours
147It is understandable that the evidence of the neighbours is not completely consistent.  In respect of some of them there are remarkable dissimilarities: for example, Ms Burns as to the location where she saw men fighting.  I should not be taken to be critical of any of the witnesses; there was no suggestion that anyone was being dishonest or reckless in giving their evidence.  This is simply an example of a phenomenon often encountered with eyewitness testimony in relation to an event that is unexpected and occurs fairly quickly.  The attention of a witness might be focussed more on one aspect than another.  A particular aspect might be more significant to one witness than another and therefore more likely to be recalled.  The attention of witnesses might be focussed upon only portions of the incident.  The latter is a very real consideration in this case, given some of the witnesses only saw part of the events and were otherwise inside their unit or were distracted by their children.  The environmental conditions must also be considered, particularly the lighting and the distance between the witness and the event. The question is whether the evidence of these witnesses may be reconciled.
148The evidence of Messrs Leary and Sawyer supports the proposition that there was an argument in Mr Dent's unit over money.  This is something that is consistent with the evidence of Lee Dacey; but it is not inconsistent with the Crown case either.
149Some other evidence needs to be mentioned to put into context Mr Tovey's evidence of overhearing Mr Dent on the phone.  What he heard is consistent with Mr Dent speaking to the mother of the accused. There was evidence of a call being made to her at 6.13am.  The call for an ambulance was made at 6.19am.  So, it seems that at 6.13am, Mr Dent was experiencing a level of frustration with one or the other, or both, of the accused.  Ms Moen submitted that there was no suggestion of hostility or violence or anything of that kind in the overheard conversation.  Mr Hoyle submitted that, whilst it was not entirely clear, the ""problem"" may well have only emerged after the phone conversation.   If the heated argument about money and drugs had not commenced before then, the argument and the physical actions that ensued must therefore have occurred quite quickly. 
150It seems clear enough that there was some fighting on the upper landing outside Mr Dent's unit before Mr Dent went downstairs, closely followed by Ian Dacey and shortly after by Lee Dacey.
151Mr Dent must have been distressed.  He called out to Mr Lee and to Mr West for help (although to no avail). 
152Mr West and Ms Davis saw two men physically engaged with Mr Dent on the bottom landing.  Mr James was insistent that Mr Dent was followed onto the bottom landing by two men.  Their evidence is certainly not identical in terms of the detail of what they observed but that is the common thread.  It contradicts the assertion of Lee Dacey that he never went on to the bottom landing.  His version is also contradicted by the physical evidence in that he claimed that Ian Dacey did not go onto the bottom landing either but his DNA was found in two blood stains towards the middle of that landing.
153Two witnesses, Mr West and Ms Davis, said that they saw a chair being thrown at Mr Dent by one of the two men.  I am mindful of the evidence that there was no sign of this upon Detective Phillips' examination.  But there was also evidence of people moving in and around the scene before the police examination began.  I do not accept Ms Davis' evidence that it was the taller of the two men who did this.  The relative difference in the men's height would have been difficult to discern at a distance and in dismal lighting, particularly given the men would not have been standing still.
154Mr Sawyer said he saw Mr Dent sitting at the doorstep to Mr West's unit and he was bleeding. He said that he then saw two men come down the eastern stairs.  The effect of what he then described was that both men proceeded out onto the grassed area.  This evidence does not sit comfortably with other evidence.  I take the view that Mr Sawyer is mistaken.  
155I am of the view that the observations of Messrs Sawyer and Moss and Ms Lindstrom of men on the lawn can only be understood to be observations made at a slightly later stage of the events; that is after events occurred on the bottom landing. It is likely that the two accused left the bottom landing and proceeded out on to the lawn and then to the west.  But it seems that Ian Dacey engaged in a further scuffle with Mr Dent over the railing.  He desisted with this when his brother called out to him to leave. 
156There remains a question as to where it was that the stabbing occurred.  I will return to this when I deal with the issue of self-defence.
Subsequent statements by the deceased
157Nurse Amy Revett was working in the High Dependency Unit at the John Hunter Hospital while Mr Dent was a patient there. She said that a number of telephone calls were received from people asking for Mr Dent.  There was one in the early evening in which the caller claimed to be Mr Dent's brother, Tony.  Mr Dent agreed to take the call and was given a cordless phone.  The conversation was short; he was silent for a little while but then yelled into the phone, ""you fucking dogs"" and became quite distressed. When he gave the phone back to the nurse he said, ""that was not my brother it was the two men that stabbed me, my girlfriend's sons"". 
158Ms Revett made notes in the hospital records at 7.25pm on 10 August.  They record that she heard Mr Dent become abusive to the caller, saying ""you fucking dog"" and that he later told her that the caller was the man who had stabbed him.
159A short time later she overheard a conversation between Mr Dent and Dr Dinesh Sinnaduray in which he said that it was his girlfriend's two sons who had stabbed him for some drugs and some money.  The notes record: ""Pt stated when asked by RMO about attacker, that it was his partners 2 sons"". 
160There was another call on the morning of 11 August in which the caller claimed to be a correctional officer calling from Grafton Gaol on behalf of Mr Dent's brother Tony.  After confirming that the call was legitimate, it was put through to Mr Dent.  Nurse Revett overheard him saying something very similar to what he had said in the earlier call: ""it was my girlfriend's two sons stabbed me in the back for some drugs and money that I had"".  She said that the deceased was telling his brother that his girlfriend's two sons came to see him at his house and then stabbed him in the back and left him there to die and it concerned drugs and money.  According to her statement, ""the two sons were asking Mr Dent what drugs he had in his house"".
161Dr Sinnaduray gave the following evidence:
""Q. And so doing the best you can try and put this conversation in first person, in other words try and use the words you used and whatever his response was if you could tell us what his words were?A. It's very difficult to do that given it was almost two years, its actually longer than two years since I had that conversation. I would have said something like, 'What exactly happened', and he said something along the line of, 'The son's of my girlfriend we were - they tried to borrow money off me and when I refused there was a fight'. That's basically what he said.""
162There is obviously a need for care in the assessment of such hearsay representations, particularly when the maker is unavailable to give evidence.  The accounts of what Mr Dent said are obviously paraphrased rather than verbatim.  If they are accurate, Mr Dent must have been speaking about the overall incident generally without attempting to provide an account of precisely what occurred.  I do not regard this evidence as being of any assistance in resolving the issues I must determine.  
Subsequent statements by the accused
Rachel Caldwell
163Ms Rachel Caldwell lived in Steel Street Hamilton which was not far from Glebe Road Hamilton South.  She was acquainted with Lee Dacey but said she did not know him well.  She did not know Ian Dacey at all.  She recalled an occasion which must have been on the morning of 10 August 2011 when she answered the door to the pair at about 7am.  Although she was in the process of getting ready to go to work she allowed them to come in.
164She noticed some blood on Ian Dacey's sleeve and later in her bathroom after he had used it to go to the toilet.  She asked him whether he was alright as she gathered that he had hurt himself.  She said he was hard to comprehend because he was slurring his words and she could not understand his response.  She also described him as being ""like quite sort of droopy and, and sort of half awake"".  She made tea and brought cookies and said that the conversation was ""fairly trivial"".  She believed there was mention of them having come from Hamilton South but there was no conversation about what had taken place there.
165The Crown Prosecutor was granted leave pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to question Ms Caldwell as though cross-examining.  She agreed that the answers previously given about the nature of the conversation that had occurred were not quite correct.  In her statement made in February 2012 when her memory would have been fresher she had said: 
""Whilst sitting at the table Lee told me that they had been ripped of $300 by a drug dealer in Hamilton South and there had been an altercation with him as a result of that. Lee told me that Easy [Ian Dacey] got into a fight with the drug dealer and Lee had got involved. During the conversation the fact that Easy had blood on his sleeves and Lee told me that Easy had cut himself during the fight with the man at Hamilton South."" (T1 - 792)
166Ms Caldwell agreed that she was telling the police the truth when she told them that.  She also agreed that she had told the police that Lee Dacey was doing most of the talking.
167The judge at the first trial directed the jury that statements made by one accused were not evidence against the other accused and that is something that I must bear in mind in my assessment of this evidence as well.
168In cross-examination by Mr Hoyle on behalf of Ian Dacey, Ms Caldwell confirmed that he did not speak very much and that he appeared to be affected by something, possibly drugs.
169In cross-examination by Ms Yehia, Ms Caldwell agreed that the words quoted above from her statement were a paraphrase as she could not remember the exact conversation.  The word ""altercation"" was hers, not his.  She was asked whether he might have said something about trying to pull two people apart and she replied, ""I think that was, might have vaguely been what, I think that was the general impression I got but again it was hard to understand, it was hard to comprehend what they were saying and my memory isn't great"". She explained that it was hard to comprehend because he was slurring his speech.  She also agreed that at the committal hearing she had given evidence that she had probably consumed cannabis that morning.  However, I note that the essence of the conversation according to Ms Caldwell was consistent with that to which Lee Dacey deposed.  He said he told her, ""We'd just came from Hamilton South"", and, ""A bloke had just ripped us off $350 and my brother got into a fight with him"".  He also said that Ian had a cut on his finger and he used the bathroom to clean it up.
170Lee Dacey agreed in cross-examination that he did not mention anything to Ms Caldwell about Mr Dent having produced a knife:  ""I didn't think she really needed to know"".  He agreed that it ""would be the single most important thing that would have stood out"" but he said, ""it doesn't mean I have to tell her about it"". 
Simon Westbury
171Mr Simon Westbury lived with his partner in the suburb of Lambton and in August 2011 received a visit one evening from the accused Ian Dacey who was accompanied by a man named Paul Maybury.  Mr Westbury told the jury that Ian Dacey said, ""Just said that he had to sort a fellow out that had ripped his brother off"".  He also said that Ian Dacey said, ""That he'd stabbed him and he hoped he wouldn't die.""  He thought that Ian Dacey had said that this had occurred earlier that day.
172In cross-examination it was suggested that this conversation never occurred but Mr Westbury disagreed.  He did agree that if it had occurred, he would have told his partner Sarah about it.  
Sarah Doolan
173Ms Sarah Doolan was Mr Westbury's partner.  She had known both accused for a number of years.  She recalled an occasion in August 2011 when she was in a car with Ian Dacey when he had said that he was worried he was going to get into trouble for something he did.  She said that he did not specify what it was and she did not ask.  
174In cross-examination Ms Doolan was asked about the occasion of the visit of Ian Dacey and Paul Maybury to Mr Westbury. She was not present but Mr Westbury told her of the visit when she arrived home. He said that Paul Maybury was claiming that she and Simon owed some money; he did not mention anything about a stabbing.
Yvonne Towers
175Ms Yvonne Towers and her daughter were drug users.  One evening in August 2011 she and her daughter went to the home of Mr Paul Maybury at Bar Beach.  Ian Dacey arrived shortly afterwards and was there for about 10 or 15 minutes before Ms Towers and her daughter left.  Ms Towers conceded that she and her daughter were there to obtain a supply of drugs.  She had known Ian Dacey for about 10 years and Lee Dacey for even longer.  After Ian Dacey arrived she had a conversation with him that involved, on the Crown case, his making admissions.
176Ms Towers said that Ian Dacey said, ""I've got myself into a spot of bother"".  She asked what he had done and he replied, ""I've gone and done something wrong"".  She asked him for clarification and he mentioned Peter Dent.  He referred to having been at the deceased's home and she gave the following account of the conversation:
""Q. What was the next thing that was said? A. He said that he'd done something wrong with his, him and his brother Lee had done something wrong and I asked him what was it, and he said that Lee had asked for Easy's protection or something to, you know he was saying to him, 'wake up, wake up, Peter's robbing me, Peter's robbing me'. So he was looking for his brother to help him and Easy said that he, this is what Easy said. Easy said he woke up and he said 'I, I just, didn't take any notice and I went back to sleep and then next minute I knew I could hear Lee saying again, 'wake up, wake up, he's robbing me, he's robbing me' and Easy said he woke up then and just more or less said to Lee, 'piss off, leave me alone, I want to sleep' and, and then he said for the third time 'next minute he's waking me up again', and he said 'I was very tired because I'd taken some pills' and he said, 'I woke up again to Lee saying 'he's fucking robbing me, he's, he's fucking taking me money'' and Easy said he put his hand in - do you want me to continue.
Q. Yes please. A. Easy said he put his hand in his pocket and had grabbed a knife out of his pocket, and I said, 'what did you do then Easy?' and he said 'I grabbed the knife out of my pocket' and he said, 'I had to stop him and shut him up and I, I just lent over and I just went doof, doof, doof'.
Q. All right so now, when you use that expression, ""doof, doof, doof"", you gestured with your hand, your right hand. What did you mean to convey first of all what did you mean to convey by that gesture with your hand? A. Ian showed, that's what Ian showed me that movement as in he was referring to stabbing him with the knife out of his pocket.""
177Ms Towers said that she and her daughter had asked him what he was going to do with himself and he replied that ""he and Lee had run away from the situation"".  She was asked whether there was mention of blood and she said, ""He said after he went doof, doof, doof, he said 'and blood squirted out everywhere and blood went all over us'"".
178She said that Mr Maybury came over and told Ian Dacey to be quiet and not say anything.  She and her daughter left shortly afterwards.
179Ms Towers conceded in cross-examination that drugs were a problem in her life at that time.  She thought she was on heroin and she was at Mr Maybury's home on the occasion in question in order to obtain amphetamines.  It was suggested to her that the conversation about which she had given evidence did not occur and she replied, ""I wish it didn't but it did"".  She also said that she had tried to forget it, ""because I think the world of them boys"".  
180She conceded that since that time she had found that drugs had affected her short-term memory but her long-term memory was better.  She maintained, however, that she had a clear memory of the conversation.  She agreed that the words, ""spot of bother"" were her paraphrase, and that perhaps that particular sentence was wrong, but she maintained a correct recollection of the conversation generally.  She denied not liking Ian Dacey; she said, ""I like Ian a lot ... I always have liked Ian"".  She did not like the fact that he had been charged in relation to Mr Dent's death.  She knew Mr Dent.  It was suggested to her that for that reason she had tried to make it as difficult for Ian Dacey as she could, but she replied, ""I tried really hard to get out of this today"".  
Corrective Services officers
181Ian Dacey was remanded in custody after his arrest.  He was held at Cessnock Correctional Centre.  On 23 October 2011 he approached a senior correctional officer, Mr Timothy Hayes just after he had been on a visit with a female person.  Mr Hayes said that he appeared emotional; his eyes were red and glassy.  He told Mr Hayes, ""I want to tell the truth ... I stabbed him but I might have gone too far, what should I do""?  Mr Hayes advised him to speak to his lawyer.  
182Mr Hayes contacted his superior, Assistant Superintendent Keith Hague to let him know what occurred and he was told to furnish a report which he did.
183In cross-examination, Mr Hayes, prompted by a transcript of a conversation recorded by way of listening device in the visit area, agreed that Ian Dacey had said, ""All I was doing was sticking up for a fucking loved one"".  He also agreed that he had said, ""He fucking pulled a knife on my fucking brother"".  He said that his girlfriend had told him to tell the truth.  He also agreed that Ian Dacey had said, ""Maybe I went too far because I was off my head but that's the fucking truth of it"".  He agreed that Ian Dacey was sober and obviously distressed during this conversation.  
184Assistant Superintendent Keith Hague confirmed the report by Officer Hayes about what Ian Dacey had said.  He arranged to speak to Ian Dacey in his office.  Mr Hague told Ian Dacey that he would have to contact the police but Ian Dacey insisted on speaking to him so he was cautioned (namely he was informed of his right to silence).  He said that his girlfriend wanted him to tell the truth but his solicitor had told him not to say anything.  
185Ian Dacey told Mr Hague, ""It was fucking like this ... we were in Hamilton where we normally hang out, we were smashed"".  He also said:
""We got in a cab and there was a bit of a verbal between Tony Dent and my brother just shit.  I had a multi, a multi tool, it was in the cab.  When we got back I went to sleep on the lounge.  I woke up and my brother was shouting with Tony, fuck, what do you do when you love someone, Mr Hague, and you have got to protect them.  Then I see Tony with a knife.  He pulled the knife at my brother.  Fuck, I love my brother so what do you do.  I just stabbed him.""
186Mr Hague asked, ""Who did you stab?""  And Ian Dacey replied:
""Tony.  He was going to kill my brother.  When you love someone you've got to protect them.  I didn't mean to kill him.  I stabbed him up in the chest I think and one in the guts that's why I stabbed him there because I didn't want to kill him but it was my brother Mr Hague, and I love my brother.""
187Mr Hague told him that he needn't say anymore but he replied,
""Mr Hague, I just need to tell the truth.  I didn't mean to kill him.""
188Mr Hague told him to stop there and that he would be speaking to the police about what he had been told.  The accused was then returned to his cell. 
189It was indicated by Ms Yehia that, by consent, the conversation was admitted in the case against Lee Dacey as well.
190There was no challenge in cross-examination to the accuracy of Mr Hague's account of the conversation.
Findings as to subsequent statements by the accused
191The conversation between Lee Dacey and Rachel Caldwell is only available to be considered in the case concerning him.  It is notable for the absence of any mention of Mr Dent having produced a knife and of threatening to stab Lee Dacey.  He said that this was something that ""horrified"" him; he was ""shocked"", ""scared"" and ""in fear for my ..."".  But all he told Ms Caldwell was that Ian had got into a fight with a drug dealer and, according to her, he had got involved as well.  He claimed that he did not tell her about what must have been to him the most striking feature of the whole incident because, in effect, there was no reason to.
192Mr Westbury's account of the conversation he claimed he had with Ian Dacey (admissible only against him) is also notable for the mention of stabbing Mr Dent but the absence of mention of anything relevant to a claim of self-defence.  The conversation was disputed but I am inclined to accept Mr Westbury's account.  There is nothing in the conversation that Ian Dacey now disputes: he concedes he did stab Mr Dent and I accept that he hoped that Mr Dent would not die.
193Ms Doolan's account of Ian Dacey saying he was worried about getting into trouble about something is so general that it advances no-one's case.
194Ms Towers' account was of the most detailed conversation with Ian Dacey (admissible only against him).  It was also disputed.  However, doing the best to assess it only from the printed page of the transcript, I am prepared to accept the essential aspects of it.  She conceded drug use and memory problems but nothing that would suggest she would fabricate something she did not really recall.  She claimed to bear him no ill-feeling; indeed she expressed reluctance in having to give evidence against someone she liked and had known for a long time.
195What Ian Dacey told Ms Towers is consistent with there having been an argument concerning drugs and money; the accused feeling that they were being ""robbed""; and Ian Dacey producing a knife from his pocket and stabbing Mr Dent multiple times. There was nothing in the account that is consistent with the stabbing being the product of a perceived need to act in self-defence or defence of another.
196Criticisms were made that her account of what Ian Dacey said did not reflect known facts.  It was submitted that the repetition of the word ""doof"" only three times was inconsistent with five or six wounds being inflicted.  But that assumes Ian Dacey was intending to convey to Ms Towers the exact number of stab wounds, which is highly doubtful.  It is more likely he was intending to convey that he stabbed Mr Dent multiple times.  It was submitted that Ms Towers' account of him having said, ""blood squirted out everywhere and blood went all over us"" was not reflected in the facts.  But Mr Dent did bleed heavily and it is highly likely Ian Dacey got some on him. At the most, I regard this as nothing more than an embellishment, perhaps to make the account sound more dramatic or the situation that he was concerned about sound more serious.
197The account given by Ian Dacey to the prison officers is of dubious reliability. I am mindful that he was said to be emotional and crying at the time.  But that could be consistent with a number of alternative interpretations. It might indicate that he was making a genuine, heartfelt, credible confession.  But it could also indicate that he had convinced himself of an exculpatory account to the point where he actually believed it.  Or it could indicate that he is a good actor.  I am in no position to choose.  
198The conversations with the officers occurred more than two months after the event and after Ian Dacey had been charged with murder.  I accept that it was before the prosecution brief of evidence had been served but Mr Dacey must have appreciated the essential aspects of the case against him.  The conversations with the officers are the first known occasion when the claim of Mr Dent having threatened Lee Dacey had been made. There was not a hint of this in his earlier accounts.  Mr Hague counselled Ian Dacey to remain silent but he was adamant that he wanted to be heard. In these circumstances I have reservations that this was a version intended to advance his own interests and perhaps also his brother's.  In the end, I do not know what to make of it.  I do not propose to take it into account.
Prior violent conduct by the deceased
199The defence cases sought to rely upon tendency evidence in relation to the deceased.  It was asserted that he had a tendency to act spontaneously in an aggressive and violent manner.  In addition, a single prior incident was said to establish a tendency to produce a knife from a concealed position about his body and to use it in a threatening manner (T2 - 241).  To establish this tendency the following evidence was adduced (Exh 11):
In 1998, Mr Dent assaulted a woman and thereby contravened an interim apprehended violence order.
In 1999 he committed an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  He went to the home of his ex-defacto in breach of an apprehended violence order, broke a window and threatened to kill the woman and another occupant of the home with a shotgun.
In 2003 he assaulted a staff member at a school.  The facts in that matter included an account of abusive conduct and violent threats he made towards his 7 year-old daughter.  He also threatened the school principal that he was going to go home and return with a gun and kill him.
In 2005 there was another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he assaulted a man at a hotel in Lismore.  The victim had offered him pills that the deceased did not want.  The victim then referred to him in offensive terms and he reacted by punching him to the face.
In 2009 he committed an assault.  This involved him abusing some neighbours, kicking a chair and smashing it, pulling a carving knife out from under his jacket and pointing it at them, threatening to stab either one of them through the heart if they came near him. After his arrest he threatened to return to the neighbours and ""do them in"" if he was granted bail. 
200There was also evidence of an event that occurred on 9 August 2011.  Mr Leary, the resident of unit 11, agreed in cross-examination that he had a falling out with Mr Dent in relation to an amount of $100 that Mr Dent owed him.  He said that Mr Dent assaulted him by striking him 3 or 4 times with a golf club.  A golf club was found propped up against a wall of Mr Dent's unit (Det Phillips T145 - Exh B photos 26 & 27).  A neighbour, Ms Emilie Davis, witnessed part of this event. 
201These events establish that violent conduct by the deceased was not unprecedented.  The 2009 event also shows that it was not beyond Mr Dent to produce a knife and make threats to use it.  But just because a person reacts with violence in some situations does not render it, necessarily, more likely that they have a tendency to act violently in any situation.  Whether Mr Dent acted in an aggressive manner and threatened violence with a knife on the morning of 10 August 2011 is very much dependent upon the evidence directly relating to that event.  All that the evidence of the prior events establishes is that it is not improbable or fanciful that he did.  
Intention to cause grievous bodily harm  202I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ian Dacey intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Dent.  He delivered at least five stabbing blows with a knife (the sixth may have been a defensive wound).  One of those blows was delivered with enough force to penetrate through clothing and skin and deep into the chest.  
Self-defence
203It is necessary to determine whether it is a reasonable possibility that Ian Dacey believed that it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend his brother.
204For a combination of reasons, I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that he did not have such a belief.
205I accept that he was affected by drugs in the early evening of 9 August, at about 2.30am on 10 August, and still by about 7.00 that morning.  I bear in mind the evidence of Dr Allender about methylamphetamine affecting a user's faculties by altering perceptions and judgment. But he spoke of other effects as well, including aggressive and risk taking behaviour and, after some passage of time, causing fatigue and sleepiness.  The observations of Ms Caldwell of Ian Dacey drooling, slurring his words, nodding off and the like are more consistent with him being in that later stage of affectation.  At the time of the stabbing, Ian Dacey had not had any drugs for about 12 hours.  From what is known about his conduct during and after the event (for example, none of the neighbours saw either of the men stumbling or staggering around), and what he is reported to have said about it, I consider it unlikely that he was experiencing any significant alteration of his faculties of perception and judgment at the relevant time. Moreover, I have no doubt about his capacity to form an intention to achieve a desired result.
206If Ian Dacey was responding to a perceived need to defend his brother from a threatened knife attack by Mr Dent, this would be expected to have been prominent in any account Ian Dacey gave of the event.  There was no mention of it in what he conveyed to Mr Westbury, or to Ms Towers.
207The knife found on the landing just outside Mr Dent's unit supports the claim of self-defence (more aptly, defence of another). It bore the DNA of Mr Dent but not that of either accused. This supports the reasonable possibility that Mr Dent did in fact produce a knife.  That Ian Dacey deposited blood on the railing of the stairway and on the lower landing supports the proposition that he sustained a cut upstairs.
208The fact that no blood at all was found on the upper level causes doubt about whether Mr Dent was stabbed there.  The significant deposits of blood were all downstairs.  However, it must be acknowledged that there was no expert evidence as to when bleeding might be expected to occur to a degree that blood would be deposited. All that can be said is that the crime scene examination does not support the proposition that the stabbing occurred upstairs.
209Another relevant factor is that Mr Dent did not complain of being stabbed until near the end of the incident downstairs.  I accept that a delayed realisation by a victim of having been stabbed is not unknown.  But this is another piece of circumstantial evidence to be considered.   210Finally, for what it is worth (because his credibility is dubious), Lee Dacey was in close proximity to what was occurring on the upper landing and he did not see his brother with a knife, let alone stabbing Mr Dent.
211Putting all of this together, I accept that there was an argument upstairs concerning money and drugs between Mr Dent and Lee Dacey.  Ian Dacey was woken from sleep after it had started and sought to intervene. Mr Dent probably produced a knife and there was a physical struggle in which Ian Dacey sustained a cut.  But Mr Dent was not winning the fight.  The knife was dropped and he quickly fled downstairs. He was pursued to the lower level where both men were involved in assaulting him further.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in the course of this, Ian Dacey drew his knife and stabbed him multiple times.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no belief that there was a need to do this in defence of either himself or his brother.  In any event, if there was, it was not a reasonable response in the circumstances Ian Dacey must by then have perceived.
Conclusion as to Ian Dacey
212I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in producing a knife and stabbing Mr Dent multiple times, including to the chest, Ian Dacey intended to cause grievous bodily harm; that grievous bodily harm was in fact caused; and this was something that was not done in self-defence.
Joint criminal enterprise
213There is no evidence that Lee Dacey knew or even suspected that his brother was armed with a knife.  And I accept Ms Moen's submission that the critical events occurred spontaneously and rapidly.  I have come to the following conclusions.
214I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any joint criminal enterprise to cause physical harm to Mr Dent was on foot when the two accused went to Hamilton South.
215I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was at any time a joint criminal enterprise to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Dent.
216I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a spontaneously formed agreement between the two accused to assault Mr Dent.  
217I have a reasonable doubt about whether Lee Dacey was aware that his brother had a knife and a reasonable doubt about whether he foresaw the possibility that in the course of the assault upon Mr Dent his brother might inflict grievous bodily harm. Verdicts 218Ian Dacey:
Count 1 (Murder):  Not Guilty
Count 2 (Causing grievous bodily harm with intent):  Guilty 219Lee Dacey: 
Count 1 (Murder):  Not Guilty
Count 2 (Causing grievous bodily harm with intent):  Not Guilty

2764690,R v Thomas [2014] NSWSC 1181,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1The Crown seeks to present an indictment against Michael Thomas (""the accused"") alleging that on 31 January 2013, at Emu Plains in the State of New South Wales, he did unlawfully kill Susan Thomas (""the deceased"").  The indictment alleges, in the alternative, that on the same date the accused recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to the deceased.
2The question of the accused's unfitness to be tried for those offences was raised prior to any arraignment on that indictment.  In these circumstances, having regard to the provisions of s. 8 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") an enquiry has been conducted for the purposes of determining the issue of the accused's unfitness.  
3Having regard to the provisions of s. 10(2) of the Act, I record the fact that I am satisfied that the issue of the accused's unfitness has been raised in good faith.  Pursuant to s. 11 of the Act that issue is to be determined by a Judge alone on the balance of probabilities.  There is no onus of proof on either party.
4The following material was tendered by the Crown on the hearing:
(i)a report of Dr Gary Banks, Clinical Forensic Psychologist dated 1 July 2014 (excluding that part appearing under the heading ""comment"" at pp 4-5), along with Dr Banks' Curriculum Vitae (Ex A);
(ii)a copy of the Crown Case Statement (Ex B);
(iii)a copy of the transcript of an ERISP conducted with the accused on 31 January 2013 (Ex C);
(iv)a DVD of that ERISP (Ex D); and
(v)the results of testing administered by Dr Banks in his assessment of the accused (Ex E).
5Senior counsel for the accused tendered two reports of Dr Susan Pulman, Forensic Psychologist, dated 19 November 2013 and 22 August 2014, which were marked Exhibits 1 and 2 respectively.  
6In addition, the accused's father was called to give oral evidence regarding aspects of the history recorded by Dr Banks in his report.
THE CROWN CASE7The following summary is taken from the Crown case statement filed in the proceedings:
""Background:The accused, Michael THOMAS, is the adopted son of the deceased, Susan Thomas. He is 25 years old.
The deceased, her husband, her other adopted son and the accused all lived together at 13 Lucas Street, Emu Plains.The accused is prone to violent outbursts and has an alcohol-dependency problem. He also has a moderate intellectual disability stemming from ADHD, attention deficit disorder, Asperger's Syndrome and Opposition Defiance Disorder. He prefers to spend his day in bed and playing video games and has had several arguments in the past with his parents regarding his employment situation. He has difficulty controlling his emotions and easily becomes angry and frustrated when he is asked to do something that he doesn't want to do.
He has obtained employment in the past through ""Ability Options Employment"" and his most recent job was as a kitchen hand at Outback Steakhouse in Penrith. However, he had recently quit his job as he was unhappy at work and wanted to become a DJ.
Day of the incidentThe accused's father knew that the accused was unhappy at work so on 31 January 2013 he decided to drive the accused to work to have a word with the boss. The accused usually worked between 9am to 12midday on Thursdays.
When they arrived at the Steakhouse the accused's father was advised that the accused had resigned the previous week. They got back into the car and arrived home at about 9:30am.
The deceased was in bed as she was suffering from terminal cancer. She had survived breast cancer and another cancer previously but had recently (late 2012) been diagnosed with a more virulent bone marrow cancer and had only been given months to live. A conservative estimate as at the date of her death was 6 weeks. The deceased was still mobile but on some days she had to stay in bed for lengthy periods due to the pain.
The deceased and her husband had a conversation with the accused about his job in their bedroom. They were telling him that he needed to stop sleeping in and that he needed to ""lift his game"". He was quiet and appeared to listen to his parents. The accused's father left the bedroom and the deceased was still sitting up in bed, propped up by a number of pillows. The accused then left the room.
The deceased then called for the accused to go back into the bedroom. The accused's father saw the accused leave his bedroom and go back into the deceased's bedroom. It was only the deceased and the accused in the bedroom.
She repeated what she had said earlier to the accused that he had to get new employment and he got increasingly angry, which is when he punched her twice to the face.
The accused immediately noticed that there was something wrong with the deceased's breathing. The accused left the room.
The accused's father was in the kitchen when he heard a noise coming from the bedroom about 30 seconds after the accused had gone back into the deceased's bedroom. He described the noise as two quick thumps. He went into the bedroom where he saw the deceased lying on her back in the bed and he noticed blood on her cheek. He asked if she had been hit but she said she was alright. He realised that she couldn't have fallen and that she must have been hit. He went into the bathroom to get a flannel to wipe away the blood and when he returned to the bedroom both the accused and Benjamin were in the room. The accused was not talking or moving so the accused's father rang 000.
While on the phone to 000 they were trying to help the deceased to open her mouth so that she could breathe. A female paramedic arrived and the accused's father informed her that the deceased had been hit on the side of the face. The paramedic did what she could until the ambulance arrived.
The ambulance arrived and took the deceased to Westmead Hospital. She arrived at the hospital shortly before 11am. She was taken into the emergency department but due to her illness there was significant bleeding on the brain and the surgeons decided that it would be too risky to perform surgery as the deceased had little clotting factor in her blood and an operation would have been fatal.
A decision was made to turn off the deceased's life support and she was declared dead (""life extinct"") at 3:05pm.
The police attended the hospital and spoke to the family. They arranged for the accused's father and brother to attend the police station to provide statements. They then arrested the accused and took him to Parramatta Police Station.
The accused's father provided a statement to police at Parramatta Police Station while his brother participated in an electronically recorded interview at Penrith Police Station.
...AutopsyThe body of the deceased was examined on 1 February 2013. Dr Szentmariay reports that the direct cause of death was ""blunt force head injury"" and antecedent causes as ""morbid conditions"" with other significant conditions contributing to the death but not relating to the disease or condition causing it as ""metastatic breast cancer and its treatment"".
He reported ""Post-mortem examination showed three nearly confluent areas of dark red contusions on the left side of the face, mostly centred adjacently in front of and inferior to the left ear. Subsequent internal examination showed an underlying large confluent haemorrhage. No fractures of the facial bones were identified.""
His findings were ""In summary, based on the reported circumstances and on the above findings, the cause of death is recommended to be recorded as blunt force head injury. The injury pattern present is consistent with those seen following reported events. The clinically reported low platelet level (due to breast cancer and its treatment) can significantly contribute to haemorrhage following trauma.""
Crown CaseThe crown case is that the accused punched the deceased twice to the left cheek. At the time of the assault the victim was terminally ill with cancer with only weeks to live. Because of the bone marrow cancer, she had little blood clotting ability, and as a result doctors were unable to perform surgery upon her and she died from her injury.""
THE EXPERT EVIDENCEDr Banks8Dr Banks interviewed the accused on 12 June and 19 June 2014 and provided a report dated 1 July 2014 (Exhibit A).  He set out (commencing at para. 2 of that report) aspects of the history provided to him by the accused.  In light of evidence given by the accused's father, some aspects of that history were not entirely correct.    
9Dr Banks recorded (at para. 2) that the accused had been adopted when he was ""6, or 5 or 4"".  In light of the evidence given by the accused's father (T36 L1-16) that was incorrect.  The accused had not turned 3 years of age when he was adopted.  
10Dr Banks also recorded, in the same paragraph, that when the accused was ""10 or 11"" his parents adopted another child.  That was also incorrect, the accused's father having given evidence (T36 L33-34) that the accused was in fact aged 8 at that time.  
11Dr Banks also recorded (commencing at para. 8) that the accused had ""attained his Year 10 certificates"".  To the extent that this may have conveyed the impression that the accused was awarded the School Certificate, it was misleading.  The evidence of the accused's father (T36 L43-T37 L13) was that the accused was diagnosed with an intellectual disability at an early age and that as a consequence, he was not able to be placed in mainstream classes, had never sat an examination, and had not been awarded his School Certificate.  
12Dr Banks also recorded (at para. 9) that the accused ""had worked at Penrith Paceway for a couple of months"".  The evidence of the accused's father (T37 L46-T38 L5) was that the accused had undertaken a cooking course, specifically tailored to persons with intellectual disability, which was conducted in the grounds of Penrith Paceway.  The suggestion that the accused had ""worked at Penrith Paceway"" was somewhat misleading.  
13Dr Banks administered the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale Testing when assessing the accused.  The composite score summary obtained by Dr Banks, which incorporated verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed and full scale IQ, was generally consistent with that obtained by Dr Pulman following similar testing (at [31] below).
14Dr Banks concluded that:
(i)the accused's overall cognitive capacity was well below average (para. 22);(ii)his performance on testing of verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed was similarly well below average (para. 22);(iii)his overall non-verbal intelligence was well below average (para. 27);(iv)he met the criteria for moderate intellectual disability (para. 23);(v)his overall cognitive functioning was well below average, and had been since early childhood (para. 23).  
15Dr Banks also concluded (at para. 26 of his report):
""...The results of the tests indicated that (the accused) had a Moderate Intellectual Disability, with extremely poor auditory attention span, working memory and information processing speed.""16Despite these conclusions, Dr Banks expressed the view that the accused was fit to stand trial.  In reaching that view, Dr Banks referred to the criteria in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48.
17Dr Banks reported (inter alia) that he had asked the accused various questions about court procedures.  These included questions directed towards ascertaining his understanding of the roles of the principal participants in a criminal trial.  In this regard Dr Banks reported as follows (commencing at para. 28):
""...Mr Thomas stated that the Judge 'talks about what happened, asks questions and decides if you're guilty or not guilty' and solicitors 'write stuff down that the barrister says'. With regards barristers he stated that they 'get up and help you talk and they wear a wig and he agreed that his barrister's job is to question the evidence stating 'he sticks up for you, talks about what happened and the evidence'.  He stated that the role of the prosecution barrister was to 'talk about the evidence'. With regards to the Jury, he initially stated I know he sits on the stand', however with the use of exploratory questioning and illustrating the layout of a Court, Mr Thomas was able to sufficiently describe the Jury stating 'they talk about things to do with the charge, they want to know more evidence... they look at risk and decide if I did it' (emphasis in original).
18Based partly upon these statements, Dr Banks concluded (at para. 29) that the accused ""indicated that he had an appropriate understanding"" of judicial proceedings.  Dr Banks was cross-examined about this aspect of his opinion (commencing at T21 L14):
""Q.  About eight lines down you say this, ""he stated that role of the prosecution barrister was to 'talk about the evidence.'""?  A.  Yes.
Q.  Did you have any concerns about his understanding of the prosecution? A.  I really didn't press it much further than that. 
Q.  ""With regards to the jury he initially stated 'I know he sits on the stand.'""  Did that trouble you?  A.  No, because he had already mixed up pronouns earlier throughout the interview and I took it clearly that he was referring to the judge.  A couple of questions on he clarified that quite readily. Q.  And he said to you once you had given him an explanation, ""they talk about things to do with the charge.  They want to know more evidence.  They look at risk and decide if I did it.""  Did that cause you any concern? A.  It highlighted that he's certainly operating at a basic level.
Q.  What about the words ""they look at risk.""  What did you understand that to mean?  A.  I was trying to get from him what the role of people in the jury are there to do. 
Q.  I understand that, what did you interpret the words ""they look at risk"" to mean? A.  In the context of our discussion at that point I would suggest that he was talking about the likelihood of him committing further offences, so the risk of further offence. 
Q.  Is that part of the role of the jury on your understanding? A.  Presuming that they don't have involvement in sentencing matters, no.""
19Dr Banks also expressed the view (at para. 29) that what he regarded as the accused's basic comprehension of legal proceedings ""was further demonstrated in the ERISP transcript in which he indicated an understanding of his rights and capacity to follow the interview proceedings"".  Dr Banks explained (T22 L24-28) that in making these observations he particularly had in mind questions asked of the accused at the commencement and conclusion of the interview.  
20It is noteworthy that Dr Banks was not provided with a copy of the DVD of the actual interview, but relied upon the transcript to express these views.  Both are in evidence before me and I have had the opportunity to view the DVD recording in its entirety.  Given Dr Banks' reliance upon the contents of the ERISP to support his opinion that the accused is fit to stand trial, it is appropriate for me to set out some of those questions and answers.
21At the commencement of the interview the accused was asked:""Q18 I'm going to ask you certain questions about that matter.  I want you to understand that you don't have to say or do anything if you do not want to.  Do you understand that?A Yes.  Yes.
Q19 Whatever you do say or do will be electronically recorded on these DVDs as the interview takes place.  Do you understand that?A Yes.""
22Dr Banks accepted when cross-examined (T22 L34-41) that it was very difficult for an intellectually disabled person to comprehend a caution administered by police, because the terms of a caution included difficult abstract concepts combined in a lengthy sentence.  Nevertheless, he maintained that the accused understood it in this case.  When asked why, Dr Banks gave the following further evidence (T22 L43-50):
""Q.  Why do you assume that because he said yes that he understood it? A.  Because it was broken down to a level in very basic terms and he had a support person there. 
Q.  How did that help him in understanding the caution, the fact that he had a support person? A.  Fair question.  Probably didn't. ""
23In terms of the accused's answer of ""yes"" to each of Q18 and Q19, Dr Banks specifically agreed (T23 L46-T24 L1) that it was characteristic of persons with even a mild degree of disability to answer questions in the affirmative regardless of whether such an answer was correct or appropriate.  In particular, he gave the following evidence (commencing at T23 L46):
""Q.  Then ""Q.  Are you Michael Thomas?  A.  Yes.  Q.  Have you given the answers as recorded in this interview of your own free will?  A.  Yes.""  Just pausing there for the moment.  Is it a characteristic that people with a significance degree of disability, mild let alone moderate, that when they're asked a question they'll often answer in the affirmative regardless as to whether that's the appropriate answer? A.  Correct, and I've highlighted that in my report. 
Q.  Is it your understanding that one of the reasons that they do that is because they don't want to look dumb? A.  There's a readiness to acquiescence on top of not wanting to look dumb.  Yes, that's part of engaging and it is also impulse regulation difficulties.  So it is like when people of differing languages get together there is an increased level of nonverbal interactions within that process where people nod more to make sure there is an ongoing connection within the process. 
Q.  Is it not the case with many people with an intellectual disability that when they don't understand the question they look for signs as to what the appropriate answer might be, such as facial expressions from the questioner? A.  Potentially, and equally they'll also look for signs that if the question is then repeated the same following they're previous response that there is an increased likelihood that they will alter the response simply because they're getting the question again. 
Q.  The fact that a question is repeated is a fair indication to them that the last answer was the incorrect one which mains means they go to the alternative answer? A.  Incorrect or simply not satisfactory to the questioner. 
Q.  The problem that we have, the listener, is we don't know whether they really did understand the question the second time round or whether they were simply falling into that trap, isn't that so? A.  If the questioner is a little bit more sophisticated than perhaps what was demonstrated in this ERISP I think there is a potential to get more reliable and quite open responses from Mr Thomas, but caution needs to be taken. 
Q.  I would like you to answer the question I asked you.  I'll repeat it.  I'll paraphrase the question.  If the person being questioned gives the alternative answer the second time round, that is no instead of yes, we can't be sure they understood the question when it is repeated? A.  If it is presented as a binary closed question, then, no, I don't believe you can be sure."" 

24At the conclusion of the interview an officer who was independent of the investigation entered the interview room.  Having introduced himself and explained the reasons for his presence, the following was recorded:
""Q351 Has any threat, promise or offer of advantage been held out to you to give the answers as recorded in this interview?A Yes, what we were discussing.
Q352 Do you understand the question?A What was that?
Q353 OK.  Has anyone threatened you today to give, so you give a particular answer to any of the questions?A No, no.
Q354 OK.A No, no.
Q355 Has anyone promised you anything, that if you would, if you answer a particular question in a certain way, that you would get something?  Has that happened today?A Yeah.
Q356 OK.  The police who were sitting here, did they promise you anything?A No, no, no.""
25Dr Banks was then asked about that passage of questioning (commencing at T50 L47):
""Q.  We see the next question is question 351:  
""Q.  Has any threat, promise or offer of advantage been held out to you to give the answers as recorded in this interview?  A.  Yes, what we were discussing.""  
A.  He's actually answering the previous question.  He's answering 350. 
Q.  You don't know whether he is or not, do you doctor?  
HIS HONOUR:  Perhaps let the witness answer and then you can ask the next question.
Q.  Did you finish that answer, doctor?  A.  No.  I believe counsel are just challenging what I'm suggesting.  But from my reading of it I believe Mr Thomas is answering the previous question, and the police officer is simply not being patient enough because Mr Thomas has indicated straight after 350 he's answered in the affirmative, said, yes, and the police officer has pressed that question.  In the meantime Mr Thomas is actually thinking his way through the nature of that question and by the answer to 351 I believe he's actually saying, his considered or more reflective and open response to question be 350. 
HIS HONOUR
Q.  Would that indicate to you that Mr Thomas perhaps didn't comprehend the first of those questions?  A.  I believe so.
Q.  Do I take it, Doctor, that you had the transcript of the interview rather than the recording of the interview?A.  Yes, I did.
Q.  You have not seen the recording?A.  No.IERACE 
Q.  Next question:  
""Q. Do you understand the question?A. What was that.
Q. Okay.  Has anyone threatened you today to give  so you give a particular answer to any of the questions?  A. No.  No.  
Q. Okay.  A. No, no.""  
Now we can't be sure that he actually understood that question, can we?A.  Given the way it's phrased, it's an awful question, but no, I'm struggling with it, too.  I'm struggling with the quality of his response to the nature of that question.
Q.  Next:  
""Q. Has anyone promised you anything that if you would  if you answered a particular question in a certain way that you would get something?  Has that happened today?  A. Yeah.  
Q. Okay.  The police that were sitting here, did they promise you anything? A. No.  No.  No.  
Q. They didn't?A. Nah.  Nah.""  
Again I suggest to you that the reader can't be sure, given Mr Thomas' intellectual disability, that when he answered no repeatedly that he in fact understood what was being asked of him even then?A.  There was no effort within that span of questions to actually encourage Mr Thomas to reflect on the nature of the question that had been posed.
Q.  Can you answer the question I asked you.  A.  Yeah, I'm trying to.  His first ""yeah"" in that I would suggest, and I acknowledge that I haven't seen the DVD but his first ""yeah"" to me is a habitual conversational habit that he has where he simply says ""yes"" when people are talking.  It's a language habit.  The ""no no's"" and repeated ""no no's"" to me are contextually accurate but again repetitive so I would need to be checking his comprehension of the material given.  So the ERISP is replete with all of this so I have concerns about it.  Hence I have a different interviewing style, hence I've made a series of recommendations to the Bar table in the event that Mr Thomas is directed 
Q.  The question I asked you is simply the proposition I put to you that for all the reasons we've gone through when he gives what appears to be a more appropriately responsive answer to the question that is repeatedly rephrased we still cannot be sure that he understands?A.  No, I challenge that.  I believe you can.
Q.  Okay.  Next question:
""Q. No.  Okay.  Have they made an offer of advantage to say if you give us an answer you'll get something else?  Have they said anything like that to you?  It's called an offer of advantage.  So if you answer questions they will give you certain things.  Has that happened today?A. Yes.  
Q. Now did that happen?  A. Explain things, and then they explained it back to me.  
Q. Okay.  Now what I'm saying is have the two policemen who were here, or any other said to you if you tell us an answer we will give you something for that, so they said we will do something for you.  Did they do that?A. No.  I don't, No.  Not like an offering or something.""
If I suggest to you this is a nonsense, clearly Mr Thomas was struggling to understand questions when they were first asked and when they were repeated and when they were paraphrased?A.  I would still suggest that for  if the court is continuing with this matter as long as the question are taken out of the yes/no format and as long as they are not continually repetitive 
Q.  I'm not asking you what took place in the future.  Sorry.  If you could focus on the question I'm asking you about his performance in the ERISP rather than what would be the appropriate procedure at the trial.  A.  Okay.
Q.  Yeah?  I'm putting to you that repeatedly you see Mr Thomas failing to understand these questions even when they are repeated and even when they are paraphrased?A.  If you are asking me to look at that span, I don't believe so.  I believe there is a growing recognition and I think that's evidenced in his response to question 360.
HIS HONOUR
Q.  When you say a growing recognition, a growing recognition of what?A.  Of the concept of being offered  called the offer of advantage that it is now  he is forming an understanding of what's being spoken about.
Q.  But the fact that he is forming an understanding or taking time to form an understanding, doesn't that indicate that there is an initial lack of understanding?A.  Yes, but I would suggest that's possible for all people undergoing their first ERISP your Honour.""26Dr Banks also considered the ability of the accused to plead to the charge and, in particular, to exercise his right of challenge (at para. 35).  He said:  
""35. Mr Thomas demonstrated an understanding of the concepts of guilt and innocence stating that guilty meant 'you've done it' and not guilty meant 'you haven't done it. Furthermore, when asked to reflect on how he would plead to the possible different charges, Mr Thomas insightfully indicated that he would vary his plead according to the charge. With regards to his awareness of the right to challenge, given his observed readiness to answer questions in agreement, he may be more likely to affirm statements provided to him. However, the use of open questions and provision of time to respond, is likely to enable more elaborate and accurate responses.""
27When asked to explain his understanding of the right of an accused person to challenge (within the meaning of that term as it is used in Presser) Dr Banks said (T31 L1-16):
""A. To be able to dispute the information that's been put forward and not just to say no it's not the case but to actually say whether that information should be even talked about at all.
Q.  Were you referring to the word ""challenge"" in the Presser case?  Are you aware of the Presser case?A.  Yes I am.
Q.  You know that that word ""challenge"" is used in that passage, that A.  I am.
Q.  Is that what you were referring to?A.  That's where I'm invoking this.
Q.  Have you done many fitness reports before?A.  Yes, I have.""
28Dr Banks also observed (at para. 36):
""Mr Thomas demonstrated quite surprising insight into the behaviours he has observed at court and how he intends to behave stating that 'other inmates get stressed and fiddle, but I will just pay attention.  And if the judge speaks to you, you say yes your Honour"".
29When asked whether it was a matter of concern that the accused had, in effect, said that he would say ""yes your Honour"" without otherwise considering whether such answer was correct, Dr Banks said (T31 L25-26):
""It's certainly consistent with what I've highlighted in the previous paragraph; he has a habitual tendency to acquiesce"".  
Dr Pulman30Dr Pulman provided two reports, the first of which was dated 19 November 2013 (Exhibit 1).  In respect of the accused's fitness, Dr Pulman expressed the following opinion (at page 5):
""Mr Thomas was asked questions concerning the Presser criteria. Mr Thomas was able to state the nature of the offence for which he had been charged. He stated ""murder, the detectives think, or basically call it manslaughter"". He reported that his solicitor's name is Robyn Clark and that his next court date was ""in three weeks on Friday. I guess it's a mention"". He described his solicitor's role ""last time at Penrith Court, she does the writing down, the barrister does all the talking, they say their point of view"". When asked to describe the role of the prosecutor he reported ""I don't know, they've just got to wait, isn't he on my side?"" When asked what does the word ""guilty"" mean he responded ""You have done it"", and ""not guilty"" as ""you haven't done it"". When asked what does the term ""entering a plea"" mean, he stated ""is that the same as a bail application?"" He described the Judge's role ""is to say you are guilty or not guilty and asks if you would like to make a speech, probably a couple of sentences. If the Judge says you are guilty, you will probably get a sentence"". When asked what is meant by sentence he responded ""How long you will do"". When asked to give an example of evidence which might be used or presented he stated ""pictures of fingerprints"". He understood that the jury was ""there to help you, you can have a jury on both sides, don't really know"". ""
31Like Dr Banks, Dr Pulman also administered a number of tests to determine the accused's current intellectual functioning, the results of which were as follows:
IndexPercentileDescriptionVerbal Comprehension0.2Extremely LowPerceptual Reasoning3BorderlineWorking Memory0.1Extremely LowProcessing Speed0.1Extremely LowFull Scale IQ0.1Extremely LowGeneral Ability0.4Extremely Low 32In terms of comprehension Dr Pulman described the accused's capacity in the following way when giving evidence before me (T61 L33-41).
""Looking at the comprehension tests I was using, you would be using those at primary school ... he was struggling with what you would see for a child in Year 2 at primary school so he was functioning at that level and he would have such difficulty getting a job, being able to understand any instructions that were given to him, the nuances involved in interpersonal and dealing with other people, the intention of why people say things.  This is not talking about somebody with a mild intellectual disability.  Michael does need a lot of support in that sense of trying to secure a position for any length of time.  It would be difficult for him"".
33Dr Pulman also said (at page 9):
""The results of current intellectual assessment indicate that Mr Thomas is functioning within the range of Moderate Intellectual Disability consistent with previous assessments. He is functioning below 99.9% of the normal population with extremely limited attention, extremely poor information processing speed and impaired conceptual reasoning abilities.  
Assessment of his fitness to stand trial according to the Presser criteria suggests that whilst he has some understanding of legal proceedings, his appreciation is limited and it is my professional opinion that in combination with his Moderately Intellectual Disability is unfit to stand trial.""
34This conclusion was confirmed in the second of Dr Pulman's reports (Exhibit 2).
35Dr Pulman's observations in her first report regarding the application of the Presser criteria were the subject of further oral evidence before me.  Whilst Dr Pulman accepted that the accused understood the general nature of the charge (T42 L38-40) she expressed the view that he would require ""substantial guidance"" in exercising his right to challenge and that he would ""struggle"" with that concept (T46 L30-33).  
36Importantly, Dr Pulman expressed the view that the accused did not have the capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings or follow their course.  In particular she gave the following evidence (commencing at T46 L41):
""Q.  He needs during the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in the Court in a general sense but does he understand the purpose of all the various court formalities? A.  No, I don't believe he has the capacity to follow the course of proceedings even though in a general sense he doesn't need to be familiar with all the laws and what is happening but he would have difficulty and I would say substantial difficulty in just keeping up with what is being said in the Court room.
Q.  When you say keeping up? A.  Processing information even though he does not have to understand every sentence that is said in detail.  He is not a lawyer in that sense, just on the basis of when I was interviewing him on a onetoone situation, having to repeat questions, clarify instructions, he had difficulty following what I was asking him to do and that was quite simple, straightforward even last Wednesday, he had substantially difficulty just keeping up with what I needed him to do so in that sense I do not believe he has the capacity to follow the course of proceedings to know what has happened in a general sense.""
37Significantly, Dr Pulman expressed similar views to those of Dr Banks regarding the accused's propensity to simply agree with propositions which were put to him without properly understanding them.  In particular she gave the following evidence (commencing at T47 L41):
""Q.  Right.  In terms of telling the Court his version of events, does he have the capacity to understand questions about what happened? A.  If, if the questions are simple, straightforward, not leading questions, he could give you answers that are meaningful.  I would be concerned as to whether he might proceed along the path to agreeing to things that were not necessarily the case, based on my interview with him, he would sometimes say, ""Oh yes, that is what happened,"" and then he would come back and say, ""I know something else.""  I would have to go back and clarify, ""Can we go back and clear exactly what you mean.""  If he could answer questionnaires he might have to clarify, ""Exactly what do you mean?""  That was in a supportive environment so I would be concerned about his giving evidence as to his version of events in a courtroom setting.
Q.  Now, I suppose there are two basic types of events A.  Yes.
Q.  that might become relevant in a trial.  One is the account of concrete events whether or not he did what someone else did, where he went, whether he spoke any words and so on, but beyond that what would be relevant in a trial would be his intention at various particular points of time.  In other words some abstract concepts? A.  He would have great difficulty with the abstract concepts.  He could, as you said, go through the facts, he was there at a particular day, he went into that room, he did this, he did that, went into this particular room.  It is more when you get to more of a conceptual question regarding intent and when it is the conceptual abstract reasoning questions, where he would need to really give a very detailed response in the sense of what he was thinking and why, I think he could struggle with those questions particularly given his capacity for abstract reasoning in a general sense.
...
Q.  I think I am getting a different point, is there a danger that he might misunderstand a question and give an answer responsive to the misunderstood question without the Court realising?A.  Yes.
Q.  So the Court might think that he has understood a question in fact asked and work on that basis? A.  Yes.
Q.  How big is that danger?  Is it a remote possibility or not?A.  I think if you are looking at highly probable, remote or reasonable, I would say reasonable probability.""
38Dr Pulman then gave the following further evidence (commencing at T49 L13:
 ""Q.  Doctor, does his apparent readiness to answer ""yes"" to a question asked of him indicate anything in particular to you relative to the disability that you diagnosed?  A.  Yes, given the extent of his disability it is not unusual to see individuals acquiesce and agree to what you have said or think they are doing the right thing by saying ""yes.""  They quite often feel a bit more uncomfortable saying ""No"" they say ""yes"" and I am thinking this is not a ""yes"" or ""no"" I am asking an openended question.
Q.  Quite apart from those matters, did the instances in those types of answers were given indicate to you a lack of understanding of the question? A.  Yes, it did, it did.
Q.  Quite apart from the propensity to answer ""yes""? A.  Absolutely.  To give an example, we were talking about some of the, what he had been doing during the period he had been incarcerated and we discussed the course he was, he was cooking and doing different hospitality courses.  You would ask him ""Did you pass the exam?""  He would say, ""Yes, I passed the exam,"" and number of people would think a written exam in that and I asked, did that involve him writing, and he would say, ""Oh, it was all hands on.""  Although a simplistic example you might have the inference it was a written exam. It was a two minutes hand on, watching something, doing something.""
39Dr Pulman specifically cited (T60 L45 - T61 L30) Q and A 351 and Q and A 355 in the ERISP as examples, firstly of the accused's propensity to readily acquiesce to a proposition put to him and secondly, of his inability to understand the impact of questions put to him.
THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES40In R v Presser (supra) Smith J set out the criteria to be applied when determining the question of the fitness of an accused person to stand trial.  His Honour said (at 48):
""...The question, I consider, is whether the accused, because of mental defect, fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is in an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel if any.""
41Subsequently, in Kesavarajah v R (1994) 181 CLR 231 the plurality said (at 245):
""In R v Presser, Smith J elaborated the minimum standards with which an accused must comply before he or she can be tried without unfairness or injustice. Those standards...require the ability; (1) to understand the nature of the charge; (2) to plead to the charge and to exercise the right of challenge; (3) to understand the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether the accused committed the offence charged; (4) to follow the course of the proceedings; (5) to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given in support of the prosecution; and (6) to make a defence or answer the charge. ""
42Their Honours went on to say (at 246):
""...In the context of a trial, fitness to be tried is to be determined by reference to the factors mentioned by Smith J in Presser and by reference to the length of the trial. It makes no sense to determine the question of fitness to be tried by reference to the accused's condition immediately prior to the commencement of the trial without having regard to what the accused's condition will or is likely to be during the course of the trial. There is simply no point in embarking on a lengthy trial with all the expense and inconvenience to jurors that it may entail if it is to be interrupted by reason of some manifestation or exacerbation of a debilitating condition which can affect the accused's fitness to be tried. Of course, that is not to exclude from the jury's consideration the question whether the condition is such that difficulties can be accommodated by an adjournment if and when they arise.""
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIESSubmissions of the Crown43The Crown submitted firstly that the DVD recording of the accused's interview with police was of some significance in determining the issue of fitness.  The Crown submitted, in particular, that in circumstances where the evidence established that the accused did not have a deteriorating condition, the DVD provided a ""snapshot"" of his presentation at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, which was the same as his current presentation.  
44The Crown acknowledged, as I understood it, the difficulties arising out of some of the answers given by the accused to questions put in the interview.  The Crown acknowledged, in particular, that it may be open to find that some of the initial answers given by the accused to questions asked of him were inappropriate and/or non-responsive.  However, the Crown submitted that it was also evident from viewing the DVD and reading the accompanying transcript that once the relevant issues were clarified, the accused exhibited an understanding sufficient for him to be able to provide a cogent response.  This, the Crown submitted, supported a conclusion that with the adoption of an appropriately patient approach, the position could be reached where the accused had a sufficient understanding of all the matters attendant to a trial, and was thus fit.  
Submissions of the accused45Senior counsel for the accused firstly submitted that this may be a case in which it was appropriate for me to consider the question of the accused's fitness to be tried separately from the question of his fitness to enter a plea.  I should say immediately that I do not consider that it is open to me to take that course.  The provisions of the Act do not draw any such distinction.    
46In terms of the competing psychiatric opinions, senior counsel for the accused firstly relied on the fact that aspects of the history provided to Dr Banks were either objectively incorrect, or at the very least misleading.  It was submitted that as a result, two issues arose.  Firstly, it was submitted that the incorrect history provided by the accused to Dr Banks highlighted the general unreliability of any statement the accused might make.  Secondly, it was submitted that because that history formed, at least in part, the basis for Dr Banks' opinions, the fact that it was incorrect in parts necessarily had a bearing upon whether those opinions should ultimately be accepted.
47Senior counsel further submitted that I should find on the evidence that the accused did not meet two particular aspects of the relevant criteria.  Firstly, he submitted that the evidence established that the accused lacked an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and lacked the ability to properly follow them.  This, it was submitted, was evidenced by his lack of understanding of the respective roles and functions of the principal participants in a criminal trial.  Secondly, senior counsel submitted that the evidence established that the accused lacked the capacity to make a defence to, or answer the charge.  In this regard it was submitted that I would be satisfied on the evidence that the accused had a fundamental incapacity to properly comprehend things put to him, coupled with clear propensity to respond in the affirmative to questions that were asked of him because of a perception that it was the ""correct"" thing to do, and in the absence of giving any proper consideration to the question asked.
CONSIDERATION 48Both of the experts agreed that the accused has a moderate intellectual disability.  The use of the term ""moderate"" in that context has the capacity to suggest that the disability is less than significant.  Dr Pulman explained (T57 L20-32) that the categories of intellectual disability are defined by psychologists (in ascending degree) as ""mild"", ""moderate"", ""severe"" and ""profound"".  Viewed in that way, it might be thought that a ""moderate"" disability was one of limited significance.    
49However, the test results of both experts place the degree of the accused's disability into its proper perspective.  Those results establish that the accused's intellectual functioning is below 98-99 percent of the normal population.  More specifically, those results establish that the accused is a person who exhibits limited attention, poor information processing speed and impaired conceptual reasoning abilities.
50Dr Pulman's use of an age equivalent to demonstrate the practical extent of the accused's disability is telling.  Dr Pulman described the results of the accused's comprehension tests as being consistent with the results which would be expected from a primary school student in year 2 (T61 L35).  As she succinctly put it (T61 L38-39):
""This is not talking about somebody with a mild intellectual disability.""  
51However the existence of a relevant disability does not, by itself, determine the issue of the accused's unfitness.  Accepting that the accused's disability is as the experts have described it, consideration must then be given to the results of the application of the Presser criteria.  Both Dr Banks and Dr Pulman expressed the view that the accused was able to meet some aspects of the criteria.  However, their opinions were divided in relation to two principal matters, namely the ability of the accused to:
(i)understand the nature of the proceedings; and 
(ii)follow the course of the proceedings.
52Having considered the whole of the evidence, I am not able to accept the opinions of Dr Banks that those particular criteria were met, and that the accused is therefore fit to stand trial.
53For the reasons I have already set out, aspects of the history recorded by Dr Banks were either incorrect or at the very least misleading.  That is not intended to be a criticism of Dr Banks.  However, it remains the case that the accused's history necessarily formed a part of the material upon which Dr Banks based his ultimate opinion.  Dr Banks not asked whether his opinion may have been different had the correct information been provided to him.  In the circumstances of this case the fact that aspects of the history recorded by Dr Banks were incorrect does not, of itself, cause me to reject the entirety of his opinions.  That said, there is merit in the submission advanced by senior counsel for the accused that the fact that the accused was unable to provide accurate information regarding his own personal history is illustrative of the many problems brought about by his intellectual disability.  
54In terms of the accused's ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, Dr Banks reported that when asked about court procedures, the accused said that the role of the prosecution barrister was to ""talk about the evidence"" and that when asked about the jury the accused stated ""I know he sits on the stand"".  Taken by themselves, those answers exhibit a fundamental lack of understanding of two primary aspects of a criminal trial.  
55As I have outlined (at [18]) Dr Banks gave evidence that he construed the accused's statement about the role of the jury as being a reference to the trial judge.  However it is apparent from Dr Banks' evidence that he did so only after he had put further questions to the accused.  In my view, that demonstrates, without more, a clear lack of understanding on the part of the accused as to the role and function of the jury.  The very fact that Dr Banks was required to administer further questioning tends very much in favour of the conclusion that the accused did not initially understand what was being put to him.  In these circumstances, I am unable to accept the opinion of Dr Banks (at [18]) that the accused indicated that he had an ""appropriate understanding"" of proceedings.    
56Further, having first referred to the jury as the person ""who sits on the stand"" the additional statements of the accused regarding his understanding of the role of the jury (which were apparently elicited following the further questioning administered by Dr Banks) were the following:    
""They talk about things to do with the charge, they want to know more evidence...They look at risk and decide if I did it.""
57I am not able to accept the conclusion of Dr Banks (at [17] above) that these statements demonstrated an ability on the part of the accused to ""sufficiently describe"" the jury and its function.  The terms of the statements made are, in my view, fundamentally at odds with such a conclusion.  
58In particular, the accused's apparent understanding that part of the role of the jury is to ""look at risk"" is plainly wrong.  Dr Banks interpreted this as a reference to the jury considering the likelihood of the accused committing further offences.  As Dr Banks conceded, that is obviously no part of the jury's function.  In my view, his assessment that this reference did no more than ""highlight that (the accused) is certainly operating at a basic level"" grossly understates the true position. The accused's apparent understanding that part of the jury's function is to ""look at risk"" is fundamentally at odds with the proposition that he has the capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings.
59Dr Banks' opinion that the accused met this part of the relevant criteria was apparently fortified by the answers given by the accused to questions put to him in the ERISP.  In my view, the contents of the ERSIP run completely contrary to the proposition that the accused has the capacity to understand and follow the nature of the proceedings.  
60I have had the opportunity of viewing the DVD footage of the interview in its entirety.  That opportunity was not made available to Dr Banks, although it was made available to Dr Pulman.  For the entirety of the interview (which extended over 1 hour and 6 minutes) the accused exhibited a flat, blunted and generally expressionless affect.  There were, more often than not, long pauses between the question being asked and the answer being given.  Those pauses appeared to be at least consistent with difficulties being experienced by the accused in comprehending the questions which were being put to him. 
61Quite apart from these general observations, the answers given by the accused to specific questions put to him, far from confirming that he is fit to stand trial, do nothing other than support the conclusion of Dr Pulman that the accused's capacity to comprehend is severely compromised to the point where he would not be able to understand or follow the course of the proceedings, and is therefore unfit.  In particular, Dr Pulman expressed the view (at [39] above) which I accept, that the passage of questioning from Q and A 351 to 356 demonstrates not only the accused's inability to understand questions put to him but also his propensity (about which both she and Dr Banks were agreed) to simply answer questions affirmatively without really understanding them, and irrespective of whether those answers are correct or not.  In this regard it is noteworthy that Dr Banks appeared to concede (at [23] above) that there was what might be described as a general uncertainty as to whether the accused had the capacity to understand any question put to him.    
62A further issue arises from that part of the opinion of Dr Banks in which he concluded that the accused had the capacity to exercise his right of challenge.  It is evident that Dr Banks' did not understand that the reference to ""challenge"" in the relevant criteria is a reference to the ability of an accused person to exercise his right of challenge to persons called as members of a jury, and that he thought that this was a reference to the capacity of an accused to challenge the evidence.  It follows that in this respect, Dr Banks misapplied part of the relevant criteria.  
63It is noteworthy that Dr Pulman, who correctly applied this part of the criteria, expressed the view that understanding the exercise of the right of challenge is something with which the accused would ""struggle"" (at [35] above).  That opinion is completely consistent with the accused's lack of understanding of the role and function of the jury in general (as demonstrated by his statements to Dr Banks).  It provides further confirmation that the accused is unfit to stand trial.  
CONCLUSION64For all of these reasons, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to stand trial.  In particular, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he lacks the ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, that he lacks the ability to follow the course of the proceedings and that he is, at the very least, severely compromised in being able to understand, and exercise, his right of challenge.
ORDERS65In those circumstances, I make the following orders:
(1)I find the accused unfit to stand trial;
(2)I refer the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to the provisions of s. 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990;
(3)I order that the accused be remanded in custody until such time as effect is given to any determination made by the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
(4)I direct that the Registrar provide to the Mental Health Review Tribunal a copy of Exhibits A to E along with Exhibits 1 and 2 which were before me in these proceedings, together with a copy of these reasons.

		29 August 2014",2014-08-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764691,TS v R [2014] NSWCCA 174,"Judgment1LEEMING JA: As Bellew J observes, it is no small thing to order a permanent stay of criminal proceedings.  The Court must be satisfied that the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness, or would be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process.  The emphasis is that of the High Court in R v Edwards [2009] HCA 20; 83 ALJR 717 at [23], demonstrating that a mere risk of unacceptable injustice or unfairness is insufficient.  The High Court's emphasis also illustrates that an application for a stay does not involve the court declining to exercise its jurisdiction, contrary to what was said by the primary judge.  Instead, the court's jurisdiction having been properly invoked, it is exercised, and exercised decisively - bringing the controversy to an end without a determination of the merits - but only if the heavy onus borne by the accused is discharged.
2I agree with the reasons and conclusion of Bellew J.  In particular, I agree that this is a case where error has been shown in the decision of the primary judge, that this should Court itself to exercise the power, that it should do so with the advantage of further evidence not before the primary judge, and that the heavy onus borne by the accused has been discharged - essentially by reason of the uncontested expert evidence of the unreliability of the memories recovered 37 years later coupled with the demonstrated evidence of prejudice to the defence case.  The proceedings should be permanently stayed. 
3ADAMS J: I agree with Bellew J and the additional remarks of Leeming JA.
4BELLEW J:  On 5 May 2014, at the commencement of a special hearing pursuant to the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""), the applicant was arraigned before her Honour Judge Huggett on an Indictment containing 47 separate counts alleging that between 22 July 1973 and 30 November 1973 he committed various sexual assaults upon a male to whom I shall refer as ""the complainant"".  Having been arraigned, the applicant sought a permanent stay of the proceedings.    
5In a judgment delivered on 12 May 2014, her Honour dismissed the application.  The applicant now seeks leave, pursuant to s. 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to appeal against her Honour's order.
6A non-publication order made in the District Court remains in force, preventing publication of any material which might identify the applicant, the complainant, or the school to which reference was made in the evidence.      
The case against the applicant7In the 1970's the complainant attended a junior school at which the applicant was a teacher.  He alleges that over a six month period in 1973, he was sexually assaulted by the applicant.  The offences are alleged to have occurred at one of three locations, namely:
(i)in the applicant's residence at the school;
(ii)in a vehicle said to have been owned by the applicant; and
(iii)at a school camp.The circumstances in which the allegations emerged8Although the offending is alleged to have occurred in 1973 it was not until 21 October 2010, some 37 years later, that the complainant made a statement to the police.  Having set out in that statement the allegations against the applicant, the complainant explained the circumstances of the disclosure of his alleged offending (AB 101):
""... I never discussed with anybody what (the applicant) had done to me. I have been told by my therapist that due to the trauma and pain inflicted by (the applicant) I suppressed the memories for thirty seven years until they came back in late July 2010. In January 2010 my family started attending a family therapist ...  We attended regular sessions and through that (my therapist) believes that because my youngest son is twelve and issues with my eldest son the memories of (the applicant) came back to me. I have discussed my memories of (the applicant) with (the therapist) and in late August I went to (my school) and spoke to the headmaster...about what had happened to me. I have also told my wife...and my parents...and then my sister...""
9The complainant gave evidence at a committal hearing about the circumstances in which his recollection of the alleged offending emerged.  When asked (AB 118 L37) whether there had been a particular incident or episode in which he remembered the alleged offending, he said:  
""No, no. There was no - I couldn't - I couldn't identify a specific episode. All I know is that one day they weren't there, the next day they were there. And because of my distress, I'm a little hazy as to the exact date when they came back"".
10The complainant said that once he had disclosed the alleged offending to his therapist (to whom I shall refer as ""A"") the other issues with which they were dealing ""took a back seat"" and that from that point onwards their discussions were ""purely about the memories that had come back"" (AB 121 L19-37).  He explained that the therapy administered to him included the following (AB 122 L2-5):
"".... She said one of the things that you might like to do is write a letter to (the applicant) about how you feel.  So as I was writing that letter I decided to basically write the other statement that I did which was effectively a memory dump"".11The ""other statement"" is a typewritten document prepared by the complainant (AB 139-142) which contains a partial account of the alleged offending.  It also includes the following (AB 141):
""I can't remember a lot of what happened and at the moment I am only getting flashes of memories. ... I am also getting memory flashes of watching a boy face down with a man on top of him, but I can't see what is happening to the boy. ...I am still getting memory flashes of what happened during those sessions but at the moment I don't know if it is fact or my memory playing tricks.  Until (the therapist) and I have worked through these flashbacks I cannot definitely say what happened to me during all of these sessions.  I can be sure about what has been described in this statement because it is very real and vivid to me.""  
12When taken to the first of those paragraphs in his evidence at the committal the complainant said (AB 123 L3-6):
""Well, that's - that was my sort of interpretation of what memory this was, this traffic jam of memories.  Yes I do accept the fact that I wrote that, but I'm not qualified in psychology so I was merely sort of putting down what was basically my interpretation of what it was"".  
13The complainant told the court (AB 122 L19-21) that this document was prepared ""at the early stage of starting to unpack this traffic jam of memories that I actually had"".  When asked about the process of his recollection he said (AB 124 L33-34):
""Well they were all there.  I knew they were all there but it was just basically processing them"".  
14When asked how he knew that ""they were all there"" the complainant replied (AB 124 L40-48):
""Because I - I knew that - that - I knew these incidents had happened but I didn't know the terms dates.  I knew - I had points of - I had points where in a timeline I knew that things happened.  Whether I could process what had happened or whether I ignored it because I needed to emotionally, I don't know, that's something you'd have to ask (the therapist).  I'm not qualified to answer that sort of question.  But for me I knew that the incidents had happened but I didn't know the timings at the point, because I'd had the points of reference of my birthday, the holidays, the long weekend and the camp - which was the camp"".
15What asked (AB 125 L36) whether he had concerns that his memory was ""playing tricks"" the complainant said:
""Yeah, I'd - I'd - I'd definitely admit to that.  I would say any reasonable normal person who suddenly is having visions of them being, and memories of them being abused would definitely be worried about it"".
16On 1 May 2014, several years after he made his statement to the police, the complainant advised the Director of Public Prosecutions of the following (AB 159):
""In the last session with (A) on 19 April 2014 I disclosed to her that I was experiencing new memories in relation to the Penile Penetration which occurred between 2nd and 4th October 1973.
I am now remembering the feeling not only of pain but the feeling of hair and skin against my back and also of pressure on my back"".
17A also gave evidence at the committal proceedings.  She said (commencing at AB 111) that she commenced counselling sessions with the complainant in January 2010 and that on 7 August 2010 she had received a text message from him in which he had ""flagged"" some issues.  She then saw the complainant on 13 August 2010 at which time he told her of the alleged offending.  She explained (AB 111) that on that occasion she was told by the complainant that he ""had some recollections for the first time of what had occurred.""  When asked whether or not there had been any aspect of the therapy which had been directed towards the complainant reviewing aspects of his life or delving back into his memory, A responded:
""He hadn't been my primary client. I'd been doing family work so the work may have brought some memories back but there was nothing specifically with (the complainant) around that"".
18A said that her next consultation with the complainant was on 24 August 2010.  She said that she did not actively ""work through"" the specific incidents giving rise to the alleged offending, but engaged in what she described (at AB 112 L1) as ""active listening"".  When asked about what the complainant had disclosed to her, A said (AB 113 L34-36):
""His disclosure was fairly clear I think in - you know he didn't actually - (the complainant) didn't actually give me a lot of detailed information but would say he would be distressed by some of the memories that he was having.""
Q: Do you have any recollection of assisting him working through his memory flashes to assist him work out whether it was a valid and real memory? A: M'mm.
Q: Did you have any interventions in that regard?A: If we were talking about a flash back situation which is more commonly related to post traumatic stress disorder, where he was actually going back into believing that he was in the moment where he was actually having sensations, whether it be auditory or physical sensations as if the process was actually happening to him, I would work through that at that time and once again, in terms of how would he bring himself back into the present if he was overwhelmed in a situation of feeling like he was back in that moment, which often can happen with flashbacks.""
19A explained (commencing at AB 114 L1) that her primary aim in providing counselling to the complainant was to relieve the distress from which he was suffering.  She said then said (AB 114 L11-18):
Q: So from your perspective what you understood that you were getting was a fairly complete picture of his memory, not a fragmented one, is that right?A: Yes.  As I say there wasn't a lot of description to me but just that he was having - at times he was - there was certain catalysts that would bring recollection to him.
 Q: Without disclosing, were those catalysts situational were they? A: Sometimes auditory.
The applicant's interview with police20The applicant was interviewed by police on 11 November 2010.  At Q 35 (AB 259) the general allegation made by the complainant was put to him, to which he replied:
""Well, you know, I understand that, but I, as I said, I can't remember the guy at all, to be honest, um, and I know I did those sort of things.  Ah, I can't say yes, I did it to him ....""
21The applicant's reference to having done ""those sort of things"" was a reference to the fact that in 1995 he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for similar offending, committed between 1969 and 1975.  The Crown relies upon these matters as tendency evidence.  I have discussed this issue in more detail below.    
22When interviewed by police the applicant admitted that he:
(i)was a teacher at the school at which the complainant attended (Q48-50; AB 260);(ii)owned a ""Kombi"" vehicle, which was the same make of vehicle in which some of the offending was alleged to have occurred (Q52; AB 261);(iii)took groups of boys to a camp in the same area as that in which some of the offending was alleged to have occurred (Q131-133; AB 268).
23Commencing at Q134 (AB 268) the specific allegations made by the complainant were put to the applicant.  The applicant repeated (at Q154; AB 272) that he had no recollection of the complainant and variously told police that he had no recollection of acting as the complainant alleged.  However at Q174 (AB 277) the applicant said:
""I believe everything he said is bullshit .....""  
24The applicant's later answer to Q182 (AB 279) typified his general response to questioning regarding the specific allegations:
""... I just don't believe a word of it ...He's told one great lie there ... what he said is the imagination, a way to get more money.  That's what he's after.  He wants to get more money than he gets what he gets but that's what he's after.  Good on him.  Go for it.  Go for it and get some money.  If I did do something to him to start with, getting, getting money where he can, no worries.  But what he said there is rubbish"".
25The applicant's reference to the complainant ""getting money"" is seemingly a reference to the fact that the complainant has engaged a solicitor to act for him in relation to a claim for damages against the applicant and the school (AB 316).  
The applicant's fitness to stand trial26The committal proceedings at which the applicant and A gave evidence concluded on 5 August 2011, at which time the applicant was committed for trial in the District Court.    On 5 February 2013 the matter came before Judge Frearson SC who was asked to determine the question of the applicant's fitness to stand trial.  
27In a judgment delivered on 6 February 2013 (AB 223-233) his Honour found the applicant unfit to be tried and referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  On 6 August 2013, the Tribunal determined that the applicant would not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried (AB 234-254).  
28On 26 August 2013, the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the court, pursuant to s. 19 of the Act, of his intention to proceed with the charges against the applicant.  A special hearing under s. 19 of the Act was fixed to commence before Judge Huggett on 5 May 2014.  
The application before the primary judge29Having been arraigned before her Honour, the applicant moved on a notice of motion (AB 82) which sought an order for a permanent stay of the proceedings on grounds which were pleaded in the following terms:  
(i)""The continuation of these proceedings by way of special hearing will involve an unacceptable injustice or unfairness to the applicant.
(ii)The allegations date back to 1973, some 41 years ago, and as a consequence the applicant will be severely prejudiced in his defence by this extraordinary delay.
(iii)The allegations in this matter are the result of repressed memories which the complainant allegedly experienced for the first time in 2010 and there are significant issues as to the potential unreliability of such evidence.
(iv)The applicant suffers from poor health such that he is unfit to be tried and he has cognitive and memory deficits that significantly impair his ability to defend these allegations.
(v)The circumstances involved in this prosecution are so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process"".
The evidence before the primary judge30The notice of motion was supported by an affidavit of the applicant's solicitor, Mr Williams, of 5 May 2014 (commencing at AB 84).  That affidavit was admitted without objection and Mr Williams was not cross-examined on its contents.    I have already referred at [8]-[24] to some of the evidence which emerges from the material annexed to Mr Williams' affidavit.  However it is necessary for me to make reference to other parts of the affidavit which were before her Honour.     
The applicant's difficulties in obtaining evidence 31Mr Williams deposed (commencing at AB 85) to various difficulties which the applicant had faced in obtaining relevant evidence.  These difficulties, the majority of which stemmed from the long period which had elapsed since the alleged offending, included the inability to obtain documentary evidence which was corroborative of the applicant's instructions.  
32In particular, bearing in mind that some of the alleged offending is said to have occurred at the applicant's school residence, the applicant has instructed his solicitors that he was not living at the school at the relevant time, but was in fact living at another school with a friend (to whom I shall refer as ""N"").  In these circumstances, subpoenas were issued to each school for the production of documents which might corroborate those instructions.  No documents were produced.  The subpoena directed to the school at which the applicant was employed responded that it had ""been unable to locate any documents"" (AB 85).  Whilst it was not expressly stated, it is reasonable to infer that the inability to produce documents in response to the subpoena had come about due to the passing of time.   
The applicant's state of health33The affidavit of Mr Williams also annexed a series of medical reports concerning the applicant's health (commencing at AB 143).  Without canvassing the entirety of that material, the evidence established that the applicant:
(i)has a history of cardiovascular disease and stroke (AB 197);(ii)was found to have extensive infarcts of the left temporal and occipital lobes which gave rise to cognitive deficits (AB 169);(iii)has auditory and visual memory loss (AB 176; 196; 198; 207);(iv)suffers from aphasia, an impairment of the capacity to use words caused by lesions in the cortex (AB 144); (v)has an auditory attention span falling within the borderline range (AB 196);(vi)has impaired executive functioning (AB 197); and(vii)suffers from a number of physical ailments including obesity, hypertension and osteoarthritis (AB 207). 
The expert medical evidence 34The affidavit of Mr Williams also annexed a series of reports provided by Dr John Roberts, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist.  Dr Roberts had been asked by the applicant's solicitors to express his opinion concerning (inter alia) the process by which the complainant came to recall the alleged offending.  For that purpose Dr Roberts was provided with various material, including the transcript of the evidence given by the complainant and A at the committal proceedings.  
35Dr Roberts described the complainant's account of the process by which he came to recall the allegations as ""recovered memory"", before expressing the following opinion (commencing at AB 156):  
""The material suggests the extensive involvement of (A) in regard to the recollections described by (the complainant).  The probability that (the complainant's) recollections are iatrogenically induced must be considered on reasonable psychiatric grounds as highly probable.
I refer to a number of statements made by Professional Organisations in relation to recovered memories and note in 1993 The American Medical Association stated that recovered memories are of ""Uncertain authenticity which should be subject to external verification. The use of recovered memories is fraught with problems and potential misapplication"".
In 1993 The American Psychiatric Association stated that ""It was impossible to distinguish accurately between true and false memories.
In 1994 the Council and Scientific Affairs of the AMA concluded and recommended that accusations of Childhood sexual abuse based on recovered memories cannot be proved or disproved and it is not known how to distinguish true memories from imagined events.
The American Psychological Association in 1994 comments that ""Most people who were sexually abused as children remember all or part of what happened to them. The American Psychological Association does not discount memories of abuse that have been forgotten for a long time to be remembered but such mechanisms are not understood but comment further on the possibility to construct convincing pseudo-memories for events that never occurred.""
36Having noted that the applicant had told police that he was not able to recall the complainant, Dr Roberts then said (AB 157):  
""(The applicant) is suffering from significant brain damage which if it is assumed that he is incapable of remembering of (the complainant) and assuming that contact between (the applicant) and (the complainant) occurred, the demonstrable pathology would account for the lack of ability to remember.
There is a physical basis demonstrated in terms of brain damage that in terms of the location of the brain damage demonstrated would potentially affect memory.
While (the applicant) fulfils the demands of Presser standards, his ability to give evidence in regard to matters of fact and his capacity to respond to specific questions in relation to this matter is such that if it is assumed that his brain damage prevents him from recollecting any connection with (the complainant), if it is assumed that such a connection occurred, he would not be able to give any evidence in regard to any such presumed connection.
In regard to recovered memory, the history given is indicative of recovered memory having occurred. This occurred in the context of therapy being given by a social worker. The evidence is of the social worker interfering in this process - memory recovery during therapy is highly suggestive of iatrogenic factors.
In order to comprehensively assess what appears to be apparent from evidence provided, it would be desirable on psychiatric grounds to review all aspects of the therapies engaged in by A to obtain a complete picture of her level of intervention.
In summary, there is conclusive evidence of recovered memory and there is a physical basis for (the applicant) not being able to remember.""
37Dr Roberts, who was the only medical expert retained in the proceedings, also gave evidence before the primary judge.  In doing so, he expressed the following opinions, namely that:
(i)this was a ""clear cut"" case of recovered memory, within the definition of that term as it appears in the relevant literature (AB 32 L22);(ii)it was probable that A had played a role in the complainant's memory emerging (AB 32 L41-50); and(iii)allegations based upon recovered memory are universally regarded by psychiatrists as being unreliable (AB 20 L44-AB 35 L2).  
38When asked to explain the difference between a recovered memory and a normal memory Dr Roberts said (at AB 31 L33 and following):""...The difference is that in what's so called recovered memory is that it is alleged by the proponents of that pathology that what happens is that due to a traumatic event, recollections of that traumatic event are suppressed and stored in a pristine manner without the knowledge of the person concerned. So they are meant to have no knowledge of the traumatic event but it is stored in whatever location. Some people refer to it as being stored in the subconscious, other people talk about bodily memory. But the bottom line is that the evidence for the repressed memory is nil, it has never been shown to exist and it is a hypothesis based on a Freudian construct, which again is purely hypothesis and the evidence is really to the contrary, that if you speak to people who've been involved in traumatic events, such as prisoners or (sic) war, people from concentration camps, people who've served in battle, they have a recollection of the trauma that they've suffered. So the evidence for it is not there, to some degree it is tending to be of iatrogenic and the evidence given in court in my view very strongly supports recovered memory as being present.""
39Dr Roberts explained (at AB 32 L7 and following) that the evidence was strongly supportive of the complainant having a recovered memory.  This, he explained, was because on the account of the complainant, he had no memory of the incidents at all at one point, but his memory had returned to him some 37 years later.
40When asked whether or not A had played any role in the emergence of the complainant's memories Dr Roberts said (at AB 32 L43-50):
""One cannot give a yes and no answer to that. I think on grounds of probability this seems to be the case. The reason why I say that, is that the memories appear to have returned in the context of therapy in which matters of a sexual nature were being dealt with, his son's homosexuality. Sexual matters were being brought up and after a session in therapy relating to this concern, very soon after, I can't recollect from the records whether it was a day or some days, he texted (A) and asked for an urgent consultation. So it appears, simply because of the chronology of events, that it is probable that what had happened at the therapy session gave rise to certain processes which resulted in the emergence of recollections of events which are in essence a repressed memory.""
41Dr Roberts expressed the unequivocal opinion that a recollection of events which was based upon recovered or repressed memory was unreliable.  In particular he said (commencing at AB 34 L44):
""A wide variety of learned bodies, the Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, the American and the British and the Canadian equivalent, all are of the view that what is known as recovered memory is forensically unreliable. So it really cannot be relied on as an account of matters of fact and I think that the bottom line is that independent corroboration is the ultimate gold standard and often the courses cannot occur. But recovered memory is not regarded as being forensically reliable and it differs in that case from the so-called normal memory which may not be reliable either but it is certainly less so and cannot be relied upon.""
42Although Dr Roberts was cross-examined at some length, his evidence that this was a ""clear cut"" case of recovered memory was not directly challenged.  Further, although questions were put to Dr Roberts in cross-examination (AB 26 L39-AB 33 L23) regarding the role played by A in the emergence of the allegations, nothing he said eroded, in any way, his evidence in chief concerning the probability of A's intervention and its effect.  
43Most importantly however, Dr Roberts' evidence as to the opinions of the broader psychiatric community concerning the reliability of allegations based on recovered memory was not the subject of any effective  challenge in cross-examination.  On the contrary, his opinions were confirmed.  When asked in cross-examination why such evidence was unreliable, Dr Roberts responded (AB 46 L30 and following):
""The consensus of the world bodies of psychiatrists and psychologists say that that form of memory is not forensically reliable.  I am quoting what all learned bodies in this regard have said and come out with consensus statements.  The form of memory that comes back is pristine detail after apparently not being in existence for decades or not being in existence, it doesn't matter whether its decades or not, is regarded by the learned authorities throughout the world as being forensically unreliable and being forensically in essence dangerous.  If you have recovered memory, you can't rely upon it in the forensic sense.  The only way of it (sic) you can assume that it might be true and accurate, and that is also the opinion of the learned bodies, is by independent corroboration of the events.  It's not my words, it's what the position statement is of all learned bodies in my specialty and in psychology.""  

The ground of appeal44Proceedings brought under s. 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 do not proceed by way of rehearing.  The role of this Court, if leave is granted under the section, is to review the correctness of the interlocutory decision:  R v BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 at 264 per Hunt CJ at CL.  Against this background, the applicant relied upon a single ground of appeal before this Court which was in the following terms:
""The learned presiding judge erred in refusing to order a permanent stay of the proceedings to be tried by way of special hearing under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990"".
45The remedy sought before the primary judge was a discretionary one.  In those circumstances, this Court will not intervene unless it can be established that there was some error on the part of the primary judge which caused the discretion to miscarry:  House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.  
46To a large extent, the written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant agitated the same arguments which had been advanced before the primary judge in support of the application, without precisely articulating how it was said that her Honour had erred in the exercise of her discretion.  However in the course of oral submissions, counsel for the applicant argued that when considering the questions of unfairness and prejudice to the applicant, her Honour had misdirected herself and had applied the incorrect test to determine whether a stay should be granted.  In particular, it was argued that her Honour had applied her focus to the effect of a special hearing under the Act, rather than the particular circumstances of the applicant's case.
47It was submitted by the Crown that the appropriate course was to consider the question of a grant of leave without hearing full argument about whether the Court should intervene.  Such an approach was endorsed in R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 722 per Gleeson CJ.  However in the present case the oral submissions of both parties canvassed not only the asserted errors on the part of the primary judge but aspects of the evidence supporting the application which was before her.  In effect, the approach of both parties was to advance full argument as to the correctness of her Honour's judgment.  Given that approach there is reason, in this case, to depart from the approach endorsed in Matovski.   
Her Honour's reasons48Bearing in mind the error relied upon, the relevant passage of her Honour's reasons is as follows (AB 9-10):
""In relation to Ground 1, a special hearing is a mechanism Parliament has mandated is invoked where there has been a finding of unfitness and the DPP has indicated its intention to proceed with the charges.  It is a limited hearing with limited outcomes, one of which includes that the accused could be found not guilty of all or any of the alleged offences.  It is recognised that an accused in a special hearing may be unable, for example, to understand the nature of the charge or to decide whether he or she has a defence.  Unfitness might prevent an accused giving instructions about matters such as what evidence should be tested by cross-examination.  However a Court cannot decline to exercise jurisdiction because a relevant statute might occasion some unfairness: Grills v The Queen (1996) 70 ALJR 905"".  
49It is relevant that this part of her Honour's reasons was in the context of her consideration of ground 1 in the notice of motion, which asserted that the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice and unfairness to the applicant.
Submissions of the applicant 50Counsel for the applicant submitted that it was evident from this passage that her Honour had misdirected herself by, in effect, applying her focus to the procedure for a special hearing under the Act as opposed to the circumstances of the applicant's case.  
51Counsel submitted, in particular, that the issue before her Honour was not whether procedure prescribed by the Act was unfair.  Rather, the issue was whether, on the evidence, unfairness would be visited upon the applicant to such a degree as would justify a stay of proceedings.  
52In these respects, it was submitted that her Honour had considered the wrong issue, and thus erred in the exercise of her discretion.  
Submissions of the Crown53The Crown submitted that the procedure for a special hearing under the Act necessarily assumed some degree of mental infirmity on the part of the alleged offender.  Viewed in this way, the Crown submitted that it was not open to the applicant to rely upon mental infirmity as a basis upon which to escape the application of the Act, and assert that the continuation of the proceedings was somehow unfair.  It was submitted that in these circumstances, her Honour's observations as to the scheme of the Act were entirely correct, and that her reasons did not reflect error.  
54The Crown also relied upon the fact that an applicant for a stay of proceedings necessarily bears a heavy onus.  It was submitted that the applicant had failed, before her Honour, to point to matters of such extreme prejudice which may have justified the remedy which was sought.  
Consideration55It has been observed that the procedure for a special hearing under s. 19(2) of the Act has its shortcomings.  In Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51; (2004) 211 ALR 1 it was observed (at [28]):
""It is self evident that a special hearing in which an accused is disabled from instructing his or her lawyers or in other ways from full participation in the proceedings will have its deficiencies.  But no system of justice is perfect.  Neither the deficiencies of a special hearing under the Act, nor the other matter which was referred to in submissions, that the Act reposes expansive and wide discretions in the State Attorney-General, provides reason not to construe and apply the Act according to its tenor.""  
56However, the focus of the question before the primary judge was not the operation of the Act and its related deficiencies.  The question was whether, having regard to the principles which apply to an application for a permanent stay of proceedings (which are canvassed below) such a remedy was warranted in the particular circumstances of the applicant.  In my view, it was no part of the answer to that question to observe, as her Honour effectively did at AB 9-10, that aspects of the procedure under s.19 might be regarded as unfair in any event.  The issue was not whether the operation of the Act was unfair.  The issue was whether, because of the evidence to which counsel for the applicant had pointed, a stay was warranted.  If the test for a stay was met, the fact that there may have been some inherent unfairness in the operation of the Act was irrelevant.  In my view, in approaching the matter in this way, her Honour erred.     
57In addition, the overall effect of her Honour's reasoning at AB 9-10 was that because the Act may operate in a manner which could be regarded as unfair in any event, some different (and seemingly less stringent) test was to be applied in determining whether a stay should be granted. That was not correct.  The same test stood to be applied notwithstanding that the proceedings which were sought to be stayed were a special hearing rather than a trial.
58Further in my view, her Honour's reference to declining to ""exercise jurisdiction because the relevant statute might occasion some unfairness"" was inapposite, as was the associated reference to the decision in Grills v R; PJE v R (1996) 70 ALJR 905.  Her Honour was not asked to decline to exercise her jurisdiction on the basis that the Act operated unfairly.  She was asked to find that the circumstances of this case were such that its continuation should be regarded as being unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive.  The two propositions are quite different. To categorise the application as her Honour apparently did was, with respect, to misunderstand the basis upon which it was brought.    
59For all of these reasons I am satisfied that error has been established.  


Should this Court grant a permanent stay of proceedings?The relevant principles60The evidence which was before the primary judge is also before this Court.  As error has been found, it is open to this Court to exercise its own discretion and determine, having regard to the applicable principles, whether the application should succeed.  
61In order to justify an order for a permanent stay of proceedings there must be a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial which is of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do can relieve against its unfair consequences: R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605-6 per Mason CJ and Toohey J; Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 111 per Wilson J; Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 34 per Mason CJ.  
62In R v Edwards (2009) 83 ALJR 717 the High Court articulated the test, by reference to the earlier decision in Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 in the following terms (at 720):
"".... whether, in all of the circumstances, the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness or whether the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process"".  
63The categories of circumstance which may justify an order granting a stay of criminal proceedings are not closed, nor are they capable of exhaustive definition.  However, it must be recognised that a stay of a criminal trial is an extreme remedy which will be reserved for the most exceptional cases; Barton per Wilson J at 475; Jago per Mason CJ at 582.
64The onus remains upon an applicant for an order for a stay to establish a factual basis for the order which is sought: Boulos v R [2008] NSWCCA 119 at [46].  That onus is necessarily a heavy one: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW (2006) 226 CLR 256 at [9].
The application of the principles to the present case65The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred more than 40 years ago.  In the circumstances of the present case that is a factor which gives rise to a number of matters of significance.  In my view, a combination of those matters gives rise to unacceptable injustice and unfairness, warranting a permanent stay of the proceedings.    
66I have already made reference (at [31]-[32]) to those parts of the affidavit of Mr Williams in which he deals with the absence of available documentary evidence.  It is open to infer that the documents sought were not produced because of the passing of time.  I am unable to agree with the primary judge's conclusion that the proposition that relevant evidence was not available was ""somewhat speculative"" (AB10).  The evidence which was before her Honour was to the contrary.  
67In this regard it should also be noted that before this Court the applicant read, without objection from the Crown, a further affidavit of Mr Williams, annexed to which was a statement from N which was provided to the police in May of this year.  That statement, which I infer was not before her Honour, confirms the applicant's instructions regarding his residence at the material time.  In one sense, it might be said that N's statement goes some way towards ameliorating the effect of the absence of the material which was sought under subpoena.  At the same time, it tends to corroborate the applicant's instructions in one particular respect.  In doing so, it undermines a material aspect of the Crown case.  
68The period of time which has elapsed since the alleged offending occurred also impacts in another particular way.  I have noted (at [21]) that the applicant was convicted in 1995 for not dissimilar offending as that which is alleged by the present complainant.  There is evidence (AB 86) that those proceedings were the subject of significant media reporting, which included television news coverage depicting the applicant, and articles and photographs in the print media.  A second statement annexed to the most recent affidavit of Mr Williams provides further support for the conclusion that the media coverage was widespread.  There is also evidence that despite extensive attempts, little evidence of such reporting has been able to be recovered (AB 86).
69The complainant gave evidence in the committal proceedings (AB 27 L25-32) that he did not become aware of the applicant's prior record until after he had recalled the alleged offending.  Those representing the applicant would necessarily wish to explore that issue with the complainant in light of what is said to have been the previous widespread media publicity surrounding the applicant's earlier conviction.  The inability to obtain the relevant material completely prevents that issue from being pursued.  Once again, the unfairness which flows from the absence of that material is not speculative, it is the fact.      
70It is also relevant that the applicant is now approaching 77 years of age and is beset with a number of health issues.  The Crown relied on the decision in Subramaniam (supra) in support of the proposition that the fact that the applicant suffered from mental health issues was of limited significance in light of the fact that the proceedings are in the nature of a special hearing under s. 19.  However as I have set out at [33] above, the health issues raised by the applicant go substantially beyond matters bearing on his mental health.      
71It must also be emphasised that this is not just a case in which there has been a significant delay in the allegations being made. To view it in that way would be to oversimplify it.   Rather, and quite apart from the fact of the delay, it is a case in which the process of recollection has been questioned, and in which the recollection itself has been categorised, without equivocation, as unreliable.    
72I have set out (at [34]-[43]) those parts of the evidence of Dr Roberts which go to this issue.  There is no basis on which to conclude that the evidence of Dr Roberts should be rejected.  The Crown did not adduce evidence of any contrary opinion and, for the reasons I have already set out, there was no effective challenge mounted in the cross-examination of Dr Roberts before her Honour.    
73Further, leaving aside the opinions themselves, Dr Roberts expressed the view (AB 34 L48-49) that ""independent corroboration is the gold standard"".  He also said (AB 39 L47-48):
""... the bottom line is if there's independent corroboration that puts a different perspective on the situation"".  
74In the present case there is no independent corroboration of the complainant's allegations.  Whilst that, of itself, may not be unusual in matters of this nature, the absence of independent corroboration assumes considerably greater significance in view of the process by which the allegations emerged.  The only independent evidence before this Court which bears upon the complainant's allegations is the statement of N.  That statement does not corroborate the complainant, but in fact goes some towards way to exculpating the applicant.    
75Finally, I should note that reference was made in the proceedings before her Honour, and before this Court, to the fact that the Crown would seek to rely upon the evidence which led to the applicant's previous convictions in 1995 (AB 301-305) as tendency evidence under s. 97 of the Evidence Act 1995.  The Court has not been provided with a copy of any tendency notice served but in general terms, the evidence in question concerns assaults on schoolboys between 1969 and 1975.  
76Section 97 of the Evidence Act proceeds on the basis of inferential reasoning that people behave consistently in similar situations (see FB v R [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [23]; R v Chittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 198 A Crim R 492).  For the evidence to be admissible, it would be incumbent upon the Crown to establish that it had significant probative value.  Whilst striking similarity is not required, it remains the case that generally speaking, the closer and more particular the similarities, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value in the sense referred to in s 97 (see BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [108] per Hodgson JA; see also the discussion by Basten JA in Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [39]-[44]). 
77The Crown conceded before this Court that the relevant similarity was limited to the broad nature of the offending and nothing else.  Having read the material, and in light of the Crown's concession, I have considerable doubt as to its admissibility as tendency evidence.  However, it is not necessary to resolve that question for the purposes of determining the present application.  The fundamental unreliability of the complainant's evidence, along with the various other matters to which I have referred, satisfy me that the test for the grant of a permanent stay of proceedings has been met.
ORDERS78 I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal is granted;
(2)The appeal is allowed;
(3)The decision of Judge Huggett of 12 May 2014 dismissing the application for a stay of proceedings is quashed;
(4)The proceedings on the Indictment presented against the applicant in the District Court of NSW on 5 May 2014 are permanently stayed.

2764692,NSW Crime Commission v Battah [2014] NSWSC 1262,"Judgment
1By summons filed on 1 September 2014, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedules One and Two to the summons; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; an order pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all of the defendant's interests in the property specified in Schedule Two to the summons; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of the defendant's illegal activities within the period of six years before the filing of the application.
2The orders sought in the summons, apart from the proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 1 September 2014.
3In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
(1)Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 1 September 2014; and
(2)Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and an assets forfeiture order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 1 September 2014 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).
4Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
""10A   Proceedings for restraining orders
(1) Application for orderThe Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).
...
(3) The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.
(4) Notice to affected person of applicationDespite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.
(5) Determination of applicationsThe Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:
(a) in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:
(i) the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities...
and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based ...
and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.""
5The plaintiff's application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.  
6The plaintiff's application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 1 September 2014. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being: supplying a prohibited drug (amphetamine) of an amount greater than the commercial quantity of that drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the DMTA) and two counts of supplying prohibited drugs (amphetamine and heroin) contrary to s 25(1) of the DMTA. These are serious criminal offences within the meaning of s 6(2)(b) of the Act because s 6(3) provides that offences under s 25 of the DMTA are ""drug trafficking offences"". Mr Spark deposes that the defendant was charged with the offences described in the Facts Sheet on 28 August 2014..
7Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in the first-mentioned [4] of his affidavit. The deponent has annexed correspondence between Ms Gyenge, an Intelligence Analyst employed by the plaintiff, and Mr Burton, Intelligence Manager, Gangs Squad of the NSW Police. He has also annexed correspondence with Detective Gavin Wood, the supervisor of Detective Edwards, the officer in charge of the investigation who had prepared the facts sheet. Detective Gavin Wood informed Mr Spark that he was familiar with the contents of the facts sheet and that the facts set out are, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true.
8Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he has made into the defendant's property interests.
9Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
10In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark's affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects. 
11I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark's affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
12I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark's evidence. I accept Mr Spark's evidence as to the speed with which cash and motor vehicles can be disposed of, or real estate encumbered, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it. 
13The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and the real property is situated in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
14The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant's property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act. 
15In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
16I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages. 
17On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.
Orders18Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor being noted) and;
Considering that, having had regard to the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 1 September 2014, there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion stated therein

(c)Likely future requirement to undergo right ankle surgery including the possibility of a right ankle fusion;

(d)Accelerated degenerative change to right ankle;

(e)Difficulties walking, standing or sitting for long periods;

(f)Difficulties using stairs or ladders;

(m)Requirement to consume pain killing medication;

(n)Interference with social activities;

(o)Interference with domestic activities;

(p)Interference with employment activities;

(q)Onset of arthritis in ankle;

(r)Nerve damage;

(s)Possible requirement to have injection therapy in the ankle.

5Past out of pocket expenses are agreed. 

6The issues for determination concerning assessment of damages are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff's claim for non-economic loss;

(b)The plaintiff's future out of pocket expenses;

(c)The plaintiff's future economic loss. Past economic loss is (with one exception) agreed;

(d)The plaintiff's claim for future domestic assistance. No claim is made for past domestic assistance.

The circumstances of the plaintiff's accident

7On the day of the accident, the plaintiff left her place of employment to go to the shop across the road to buy her lunch. In order to get there, she had to walk along a cement driveway. As she did so, a vehicle approached her at speed and she had to jump out of its way. There was a drain cover over an adjoining drain and it was the practice of staff to move this drain backwards and forwards leaving a gap. This meant that the gap was a ""moving"" gap. When the plaintiff stepped backwards her foot landed in this gap and she suffered an immediate and severe twisting injury. The circumstances of that injury, and the subsequent treatment she received, are not matters of factual dispute. 

8The plaintiff was taken back to her workplace by her colleagues. She was seen by a first aid officer and taken to the occupational health and safety centre at work where she was seen by a Dr Pathirana. She had an MRI performed on her ankle and foot and was referred to Dr Kuo. The initial management was conservative and her foot was bandaged for six weeks. There was a three-week delay in obtaining the MRI report, but when it was provided, it was clear that surgery would be necessary.

9Dr Pathirana, in her report to Dr Kuo of 18 February 2009, outlined the plaintiff's injury as follows:

""MRI revealed multiple pathology which partial thickness tear of spring ligament complex, bifurcate ligament tear with possibly associated avulsion fracture of cuboid are few of them.

Currently her swelling is improved moderately and has near full range of movements of the R/ankle joint although it is painful.""

10Three months post-surgery conservative care had not resolved the plaintiff's problems, and she underwent surgery in May 2009, being discharged from hospital on crutches. She was described as ""progressing well"" from the surgery in Dr Kuo's reports of 29 May and 26 June 2009 and again in his report of 15 September 2009. 

11At this stage, Dr Kuo considered that the plaintiff had the capacity to return to work in her pre-accident employment on light duties and that, in the longer term she was fit to return to her pre-injury activities with a prognosis of ""fair to good"". His sole note of concern was that if the symptoms became worse, she ""may"" require treatment of the osteoarthritis she was predisposed to, in the form of medication and/or injections in the first instance. He added, in his 15 September 2009 report:

""In the longer term, she may come to surgery such as a sub-talar joint arthrodesis.""

12Regrettably, no updating report from Dr Kuo since 15 September 2009 was ever obtained.

13The plaintiff returned to work on 8 August 2009 and continued to perform the same duties, although still using one crutch for the first few weeks. She remained in her employment, performing the same tasks, at Blue Star Group until 2012, when she was retrenched as one of more than 200 workers who lost their jobs due to a management changeover. 

14The plaintiff, whose strong work ethic was obvious from her work history and her evidence, obtained work almost immediately, in a similar position at Geon Print Group. She remained in their employ for a year, losing that job only because the company went into liquidation. 

15The plaintiff then returned to Blue Star, through the good offices of a labour hire company Kelly's Recruitment, and remained there until February 2014. Her evidence, which is discussed in more detail below, was that she had difficulty performing that task, and that she had similarly suffered while working for Geon Print Group, and would have had trouble continuing in that role. She was not cross-examined on that evidence and Dr Sullivan, who examined her for the defendant in January 2014, noted and agreed with her description of those difficulties, which principally related to her having to stand for too long.

16Since February 2014, the plaintiff has been working in a largely sedentary position at Webster Print as a dispatch controller. She is able to perform this work without too much difficulty as the job is largely sedentary.

17This brings me to a consideration of the plaintiff's evidence.

The plaintiff's evidence

18The plaintiff has had a very hard life. Careful analysis of that life, from the glimpses of it afforded by Dr Klug's report and her evidence, underline the very stoic and uncomplaining nature she has, as well as her cautious approach to doctors, which may in part explain the unsatisfactory nature of much of the medical evidence.

19The plaintiff was the youngest of thirteen children. She is currently 48; her oldest sibling is now 75, and five of her other siblings have died. Reading between the lines, there would have been very little money to spare for the members such a family. Nevertheless, the plaintiff told Dr Klug she had had a secure childhood and very good parenting ""despite her father's behaviour"". Her father was an alcoholic who abused her mother, but the plaintiff excused this by saying he suffered a head injury in a motor accident. This explanation is revealing of the plaintiff's stoic nature and caution with authority figures such as doctors.

20The plaintiff became pregnant at the end of Year 10 in 1982, at the age of 16. She therefore did not complete High School. The man with whom she had the child was violent and an alcoholic, like her father, but she lived with him until 1995, and had a second child in 1985. At some stage they married.

21Her husband drove a truck, and she worked for him, completing office tasks, between 1982 and 1989. He got into financial difficulties and went bankrupt, so in 1992 she enrolled in a Salvation Army secretarial course at Mt Druitt and commenced work at Apollo Window Blinds as a receptionist in late 1992. Apart from admission to a psychiatric facility in 2001 for three months, she has worked full time for the whole of her adult life, including the period after the accident.

22The plaintiff lost her husband in dramatic circumstances in 1995. His truck broke down on a highway, and he appears to have left it there, before being struck by another vehicle. He either then ""ran away"" (to use the plaintiff's words) and left the scene, or fell in a river and drowned. His clothing was found nearby, but no body was ever found. This was very traumatic for the plaintiff, who continued to work and to bring up their two children alone.

23One of the plaintiff's daughters developed depression and, a year or two later, both daughters disclosed to her that they had been sexually abused by their father prior to his disappearance/death. This was simply too much to bear for the plaintiff. She had a breakdown, and on 2 January 2001 she was admitted to Cumberland Hospital for three months. It says a lot for her character that both her employer and her current de facto, whom she had met shortly before these events, stood by her. She had four months off work, three of them in hospital, and returned to work on medication. She ceased taking medication and seeing the psychiatrist about a month afterwards. This again shows her stoic nature and her caution with members of the medical profession.

24The plaintiff as a witness was straightforward in her answers. I share the opinion of all of the medical practitioners who have commented on these issues that she has described her symptoms frankly and without embellishment. Her de facto husband, Mr Miller, gave similarly straightforward evidence.

25The plaintiff's condition over the five year period since she suffered the injury the subject of these proceedings is set out below.

(a) The plaintiff's ongoing medical treatment after the injury

26The plaintiff remained under the care of her general practitioner in relation to her ankle, being on crutches for about six weeks and then on one crutch for a further three to four weeks. She returned to work whilst still on one crutch. 

27Following the surgery the plaintiff had physiotherapy for about six weeks. She has had no treatment since. Dr Pathirana's reports do not go beyond noting that after the surgery the plaintiff was gradually put back on suitable light duties and then certified to perform normal duties on 4 August 2009, which was followed by a further three-week trial and a clearance given on 29 August 2009 for performance of full duties. 

28Dr Pathirana was a doctor retained by the plaintiff's employer, not the plaintiff's generally practitioner. Unusually, there was no report from the plaintiff's general practitioner. The plaintiff's evidence was that she rarely consulted doctors and she does not appear to have consulted her own general practitioner at all about her injuries and disabilities from this accident.

(b) The plaintiff's condition shortly after the outcome of the surgery

29The plaintiff described her condition as going from being unable to do anything for herself (T 19) to the following approximately two or three weeks after the outcome of the surgery:

""Q. But then after you've improved, after we get to the end of two or three months, what was the outcome of the surgery?
A. Okay. I could drive. I could drive probably, say, for an hour. After that, I couldn't drive any more.

Q. What was it like for standing on?
A. Standing on? I could probably stand for about two hours maximum. That would be it for a day.

Q. And walking? What was it like?
A. Walking? It would be probably be about an hour maximum. That would be it for the day. And I'd have aching, throbbing.

Q. What was it like for stairs?
A. Stairs? It was impossible. I'd probably be - probably two flights of stairs would be maximum.

...

Q. We're talking about three months after the surgery. Could you kneel at that stage?
A. Couldn't do it at all.

Q. Crouching or squatting?
A. No, not at all.

Q. But you did return to work fairly shortly after the surgery, didn't you?
A. Yes, but it was a sitting down job at that time.

Q. You had a doctor's certificate for light duties.
A. Yes. 

Q. And they gave them to you.
A. Yes. 

Q. I think you told me something about this: when you returned to work on light duties, did you have one crutch or two?
A. I had one crutch when I returned.

Q. Then you had light duties for a time.
A. Yes. 

Q. Eventually, did they put you back onto normal duties?
A. Yes, they did."" (T 19-20)

(c) One year after the surgery

30The plaintiff described her condition as follows:

""Q. After that three months that I was just asking you about, following the surgery, you continued to have some improvement, didn't you, for a while?
A. Yes.

Q. How long did it take after the surgery till you got to your maximum improvement?
A. 12 months.

Q. So I want to ask you some questions about how you were at that stage, maximum improvement.
A. Right.

Q. Could you kneel?
A. No.

Q. Could you crouch or squat?
A. No.

Q. What was it like for standing?
A. I could stand for probably maximum 3 hours.

Q. What was it like for walking?
A. Same probably, 3 hours.

Q. And at the end of 3 hours, either walking or standing, what was your foot and ankle like?
A. I still have the pain every day after 3 hours. I have throbbing of a night-time trying to sleep.

Q. We're talking about 12 months after the surgery.
A. Yes."" (T 20-21)

31The plaintiff continued to work full time over the whole of this period, with no absences from work for pain and taking no painkillers.

(d) The plaintiff's condition today

32The plaintiff's evidence was as follows:

""Q. So nowadays, is your tolerance for walking or standing still about the same?
A. It's about the same.

Q. Can you kneel nowadays?
A. I can kneel but I have to take the pressure off that ankle, so I kneel to the one ankle, to my left.

Q. Then how do you get up again?
A. With great difficulty.

Q. What about crouching or squatting?
A. Same, I kneel to my left or squat to my left, not to the right side.

Q. Over the last 3 or 4 months, how would you say this injury is going? Getting a bit better, a bit worse or staying pretty much the same?
A. I think it's a little bit worse as far as I can feel I'm getting arthritis in it.

Q. What's the sensation you feel rather than the medical diagnosis of it?
A. I get - it cracks and it locks. When I'm walking, you can feel it, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.

Q. Did it do that a year after the surgery, was it making that cracking noise and that locking problem?
A. No, it did used to lock every now and then but I didn't get the cracking - that now when I walk I can actually hear it cracking as I walk.

Q. Recently, have you see Dr Kuo again?
A. I saw Dr Kuo about 2 weeks ago.

Q. And are there any plans for you to see him again?
A. I have to go back to see him again and have another scan done.

Q. You know that in this case Dr Kuo - one of two I think - has said that if you get arthritis you may need injection procedures into the ankle and eventually have a fusion done?
A. Yes.

Q. Is Dr Kuo a doctor who you trust?
A. Yes.

Q. So if he recommended that sort of treatment, would you have it?
A. Yes.

Q. I want to ask you, since the accident, how you've been going from an emotional point of view?
A. Not too bad. I'm not happy with the point I can't carry my grandkids upstairs and things like that now. I don't trust myself to carry them because of my leg, because of my ankle. But that's the most disappointing part."" (T 21-22)

Summary of the plaintiff's evidence

33The plaintiff's evidence is that she reached maximum improvement about a year after the surgery and that she has effectively plateau and remained at that level since, although more recently she feels she had started to deteriorate in that she is having more ""clicking"" in her ankle when she walks. Her evidence is thus that she suffers from the following restrictions:

(a)She said she cannot crouch or squat;

(b)She initially said she cannot kneel, but later said that she can provided she places her right ankle in a way that is comfortable;

(c)She said she is restricted in driving more than 1 to 2 hours. She said she does not ordinarily have to drive that much on an average day; and

(d)She has a standing tolerance of some 3 hours per day and a walking tolerance of about the same per day, after which she has pain and has to rest the ankle.

34The plaintiff does not describe constant pain; if she is on her feet for more than three hours a day she needs to rest when she comes home. In closing submissions, Mr Lidden SC in submissions painted to me a picture of a woman in constant pain, but her evidence was as follows:

""Q. Did you tell Dr Kuo around that time, in June 2009, that you were having no pain in the ankle?
A. No, I didn't tell him I had no pain.

Q. This is about six weeks after the surgery. You didn't have constant pain in the ankle, did you?
A. Six weeks afterwards?

Q. Yes.
A. Yeah, I still had a lot of pain.

Q. This is when you were still on crutches, is it?
A. Yes. 

Q. Was there a period in late 2009, after you were off the crutches, when you didn't have pain in the ankle, except if you'd been up on your feet for a long time?
A. Not really. I still had a lot of pain for about the 12 months.

Q. So around that time did the pain start to settle down?
A. It started to ease down after about 12 months afterwards.

Q. Was it around that time that it was really doing things and activities that brought on the aching or the pain?
A. That's correct, yes.

Q. Is it the case that you've told a number of doctors you've been to see that, in the warmer months, things weren't too bad, going through
A. That's correct. Cold weather brings it on, and if I'm actually standing on it or

Q. So is it the case, then, that the things that bring on the aching and the pain are being up on your feet or walking for too long? And you've given us some time estimates of how long you can do those things.
A. Yes. 

Q. And the cold weather makes it ache. Is that right?
A. Yes, yes.

Q. But the cold weather doesn't cause a sharp pain, does it?
A. No, no, no. It's like a throbbing sort of - hard to say. It's not a stabbing pain, no.

Q. More of a dull ache?
A. Yeah, like a - yeah."" (T 33-34)

35The plaintiff is able to drive for about an hour but after that time feels uncomfortable (T 35). She told the doctors that she was able to undertake ordinary household duties:

""Q. Don't worry about what you said to a doctor at a particular time, but does it sound right that, about 12 months after your surgery, you were able to attend to your ordinary household duties - cooking, cleaning and those sorts of things - without any great difficulty? Does that sound right?
A. It may have been right, yes.

Q. I take it, in relation to the town house you're living in, that any outdoor duties and things - they've traditionally been the domain of Warren. Is that right?
A. Yes."" (T 36)

36The plaintiff did not tell any medical practitioner about being unable to clean the bathroom floor. She told the court this was an oversight on her part. This evidence is dealt with in more detail below.

The plaintiff's evidence in relation to the cracking noise in her ankles

37When asked how her condition had recently worsened, the plaintiff stated that her ankle was making a cracking noise at times and this was a new problem, as was the degree to which it would lock up after she had been walking for a while. She said the locking was accompanied by pain, which would ease when the ankle unlocked. 

38However, Dr Cairns noted a history in May 2010 as follows:

""She reports intermittent tendency for the ankle to give way into inversion about two or three times a day which, although painful, does not provoke resultant bruising or swelling. She is aware of some residual ankle stiffness, and intermittent, non-painful cracking. If active on her feet for prolonged periods, she experiences some swelling above the ankle. She reports nocturnal pain extending up the sides of her right leg below knee, cramp like, causing her to stand out of bed to get relief.""

39Dr Cairns also noted the plaintiff was unrestricted in her ability to perform household and other chores, including the shopping. He noted she was able to squat as long as she elevated her heel (p 3 of the report) and that she was on full time normal duties at work. 

40Similarly, Dr Clarke, in his report dated 29 July 2010, noted that the plaintiff could weight bear and run (although the plaintiff disputed this in her evidence), and that she complained of tenderness and tightness, as well as an ache in the cold weather, but that in the warmer months the ankle had been quite comfortable. He similarly noted these findings about the ankle being comfortable in the summer months in his report of 3 August 2011.

41Although Dr Slater does not comment on ankle cracking, Dr Sullivan, in his updating report, noted pain being brought on by standing, walking or driving and that the ankle occasionally gave way. There was some cracking.

42The plaintiff said she was able to perform most household tasks, but that cleaning the bathroom floor, especially around the vanity and toilet, was not possible because it involved crouching down. Her de facto husband, Mr Muller, performed this task. This evidence is set out in more detail in the section of this judgment on future home care.

The plaintiff's future treatment

43The plaintiff is not currently taking any medication or seeing a general practitioner about her ankle. Her treating surgeon, Dr Kuo, described her future wellbeing (as at 2009, when he was writing his reports) as ""fair to good"", in that she responded well to surgery but that she did have chondral damage in the sub-talar joint which ""could predispose her to osteoarthritic change"". He went on to note:

""If symptoms become worse she may require treatment of the osteoarthritis in the form of medication and/or injections in the first instance. In the longer term, she may come to surgery such as a sub-talar joint arthrodesis.""

44Dr Clarke in his medicolegal report of 29 July 2010 states:

""She may have difficulty negotiating uneven surfaces and will possibly need to wear an ankle guard on occasions. The sub-talar region of the ankle is likely to deteriorate in years to come and eventually she may require further operative intervention in the form of a localised arthrodesis.""

45He repeated this comment in his subsequent report of 3 August 2011:

""She may develop progressive degenerative changes in the ankle in the years to come.""

46Dr Cairns, unhelpfully, does not deal with these observations or refer to them at all. He simply states that she has made a ""generally satisfactory recovery from a significant injury"" and that she has ""minor ongoing residual disability"" (report of 10 May 2010).

47More helpfully, in his report of 31 January 2014, Dr Sullivan states:

""She should undergo an up to date MRI looking at the sub-talar joint for possible arthritic change. The joint is stiff and she is tender in that area.""

48He went on to say that she would continue to have problems with work when carrying heavy objects and walking on uneven ground, that she has some discomfort with prolonged standing and does over do this for eight hours a day, but does not recommend surgery. The reference to an MRI is for possible arthritic change only.

Other medical evidence

49A report of Dr Klug dated 14 October 2011 finds that there is no psychiatric injury. The plaintiff gave Dr Klug an incomplete history and, given the wealth of indications of potential risk to the plaintiff's emotional wellbeing, the inadequacy of his history is unfortunate. 

50However, notwithstanding the plaintiff having withheld from Dr Klug the seriousness of her psychiatric difficulties in 2001, her violent marriage, the circumstances in which her daughters disclosed sexual abuse and other relevant details of her background, the fact remains that he is of the view the plaintiff suffers from no psychiatric injuries, and there is no evidence to contradict his finding. He specifically notes the absence of depression, irritability, altered appetite (despite the fact that she put on two stone in weight), disturbance of concentration or memory, social withdrawal or loss of ability to enjoy activities and social events. Accordingly, no claim can be made for any injury of this nature.

51Although referred to only briefly in the defendant's outline of submissions (at paragraph 34), the plaintiff was cross-examined about an ongoing stomach condition which, unlike her ankle problems, has required her to take time off work and consult a medical practitioner. It was put to the plaintiff in cross-examination that this problem, rather than her ankle, was the biggest source of ongoing pain and anxiety. The plaintiff's medical records in relation to this stomach condition were tendered, and I was invited to discount the plaintiff's damages on the basis that this was her real problem.

52The submission made by the defendant overlooks two fundamental principles relevant to the assessment of damages in personal injuries. First, the tortfeasor must take the plaintiff as she is found: Mt Isa Mines v Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383 at 406 per Windeyer J. Whether the accident compounds or aggravates a pre-existing condition, or the plaintiff develops some other medical condition which causes her injury, the defendant is not entitled to a discount on the damages that would otherwise be awarded because of other health conditions of the plaintiff unless the defendant satisfies the onus of proof to show that the ongoing complaints of the plaintiff are as a result of the underlying, or unrelated condition: Watts v Rake (1960) 108 CLR 158; Purkess v Crittenden (1965) 114 CLR 164. Secondly, in order to discharge such an onus of proof on a medical issue, the defendant must provide evidence of an expert nature. 

53It is not for the court to determine medical issues such as the nature and extent of health problems (and I note in this regard that the explanation for the plaintiff's stomach problems appears undiagnosable even to the experts she has consulted) without the benefit of expert evidence. The defendant is not entitled to tender medical records relating to the plaintiff's treatment for conditions not particularised by the plaintiff and not the subject of medical reports by the defendant, and ask the trial judge to carry out his/her own decision-making skills to opine, without the benefit of expert explanation, that the plaintiff has medical conditions which impact upon her general health or future employability. 

54Additionally, the plaintiff has been cross-examined about these medical issues. The plaintiff's evidence is that her stomach problems are now under control due to changes in her stomach medication. Those answers must stand, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and any role her stomach problems have played in her health is thus of no relevance to her claim for future economic loss. 

Non-economic loss

55All of the doctors agree that the plaintiff is fit for her pre-injury duties. The plaintiff's evidence is that she has a condition which causes her pain after three hours a day of standing and walking, which aches in cold weather but is more comfortable in warm weather, which cracks and occasionally locks but which has not, it would appear, cause her to fall and requires her to be careful negotiating uneven ground and stairs. She can kneel, although very awkwardly, but remains unable to crouch or squat. I note the medical evidence records that she can perform these tasks, but I am satisfied that they are so difficult for her to perform that she cannot do so.

56The plaintiff has shown a commendable attitude to work in that she returned to work as soon as she was able. She has continued to work in jobs which require her to remain on her feet for several hours a day, in circumstances where she has gone home with sore feet. She is now in a position where her 38 hours a week with about three hours per day of compulsory over time consists of sedentary work, and she is able to perform this work without significant difficulties.

57In the future, the plaintiff may require surgery (Dr Klug), is predisposed to osteoarthritic change (Dr Kuo and Dr Sullivan) but is otherwise capable of continuing in her normal duties. The reference to the plaintiff developing degenerative changes in the ankle, and in particular arthritis, must be given due weight. The plaintiff's injury was ""significant"" according to Dr Cairns, but the evidence is that she has made a good recovery. The evidence about a future arthrodesis is limited only to it being a possibility, but there is a real chance of arthritis, and the plaintiff appears to have developed this now, according to Dr Sullivan.

58The plaintiff has suffered some loss of amenities. Prior to the accident, she enjoyed going for a run with her dog and she has not been able to do this. After a long day at work, if she is standing, she comes home with very sore feet and has to lie down on the sofa. However, it is clear from her evidence that pain is not constant, and that she has been able to perform her largely sedentary work in her current employment without difficulties. She has similarly been able to perform nearly all her domestic chores and has maintained a good relationship with her de facto partner. She has not suffered loss of enjoyment of activities and life in general, and she is able to work full time as well as to perform over time. Mr Lidden SC put to me that the appropriate sum to award for non-economic loss is 35% of the most extreme case ($176,500).

59The plaintiff suffered a significant injury, and clearly this takes non-economic loss over the threshold. However, her level of pain has not resulted in her taking any form of analgesic, even Aspirin, or consulting a general practitioner, beyond her recent return to see Dr Kuo. She is able to work full time, perform most household tasks and activities and her complaint of ongoing symptoms is slight. I am satisfied that she has made a substantial recovery from her injury and that when carrying out the evaluative exercise of determining the amount of non-economic loss, an appropriate award is 20% of the most extreme case ($16,500). 

Past economic loss

60The plaintiff was paid $3,498 by her workers compensation insurer. Additionally, she gave evidence, about which she was not cross-examined, that she suffered a loss of $80 per week for the 24 weeks she received workers compensation insurance. That sum is $1,920.

61Any figure for loss of past superannuation on this additional sum was not the subject of submissions. If this is an oversight it may be corrected under the slip rule. 

62Accordingly, both the sum of $1,920, plus $3,498 representing past wage loss, should be awarded. Any additional sum for past loss of superannuation on both sums, and/or Fox v Wood, should be included in the calculations of this precise amount.

Future economic loss

63The medical evidence was that the plaintiff was fit for her pre-injury duties, which required her to remain on her feet much more than her present job. The plaintiff's job appears to be secure, but the uncertainties of the labour market in this area of the job marked are evidenced by the plaintiff's own history of having been retrenched from one of the four jobs she has held since the accident, and of having to leave another job by reason of the company going into liquidation. Additionally, when the plaintiff returned to her former employment through a labour-hire company, she was obliged to leave work because she had difficulties standing for long periods of time.

64The likelihood is that the plaintiff will continue in full time work, which she tells the court she enjoys doing. Her current job is more financially rewarding than her previous employment. She has a strong work ethic and if she loses her job, her evidence is that she would find another one. The real difficulties is how to make an allowance for two potential factors, the first being that she would need to be off work if she is to have an arthrodesis, which would probably result in employment disruption for a period of up to one year, and the second is the impact of gradual degeneration of the injury site due to osteoarthritis. 

65The evidence on these issues is limited. The most that the medical practitioners have done is to opine that an arthrodesis ""may"" be necessary. Mr Maybury, for the defendant, points to the fact that there is no information as to the cost of the operation, the length of time that it would take, the age at which the plaintiff would require to have such surgery, or indeed if such an operation is even a likelihood, as opposed to a mere possibility.

66Mr Lidden SC points to the plaintiff's evidence that having recently been to see Dr Kuo, that Dr Kuo is about to perform an MRI, and that Dr Kuo has expressed a view about her needing this surgery at some stage in the future. He also relies upon the advice of Dr Sullivan that an MRI is required. However, when Dr Sullivan was making those statements in January 2014, he was referring to the degenerative effects of osteoarthritis. He does not express a view as to the necessity or desirability of any further operative intervention. It is unfortunate that there is no report from Dr Kuo to counteract this opinion.

67If some allowance is made for the plaintiff to have a surgical intervention which will take her out of the workforce for a period of six months, this being the most likely period of time given the amount of time she was absent from the workforce for the debridement procedure, it would have to take into account the likelihood that she would have to cease employment and then seek further employment and that the net effect would be the absence from the workforce of one year. The question is whether such an allowance should be made and, if so, the degree of discount that should be made to take into account the scant and unsatisfactory evidence on this issue.

The relevant principles for assessing the plaintiff's future economic loss

68Where a plaintiff calls incomplete evidence of future economic loss and only a low award is made, a plaintiff cannot generally complain: State of NSW v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536 at [69]. 

69However, the lack of such evidence is not an uncommon problem. Heydon JA went on to set out a series of principles relevant to cases where there are evidentiary difficulties of this kind. These included issues relevant for a jury assessment of damages (which was the case in State of NSW v Moss), but also included the warning that difficulty in assessing the amount does not mean that the plaintiff is only entitled to a nominal sum (at [71] - [72]). An increase in earnings after the injury, a not uncommon event in personal injury damages assessment, is no bar (at [85]). 

70State of NSW v Moss is generally cited as the relevant authority on how to assess such loss in circumstances where the evidence is uncertain or problematic. Where precise evidence is not available, the court must do what Devlin J in Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 at 438 called ""the best it can"" (at [72]). The court is not constrained by narrow limitations even though it is not entitled, without evidence, to assume a specific figure for what could have been earned without the injury (at [77]).

71However, there is a difference between no evidence being available (in the sense of an identifiable claim, such as loss of a chance to enter a profession) and no evidence of loss at all. The cases discussed in State of New South Wales v Moss are cases where future earning capacity ""has unquestionably been reduced"" (at [87]). None of the cases considered by Heydon JA concerned injured persons who had returned to the workplace, declared fit to perform pre-injury duties, who had carried out those same duties for some years, and was still working full-time as at the time of the trial. The uncertainties to which Heydon JA are uncertain estimates of what those ""unquestionable"" losses are. 

72The plaintiff does not suffer those losses today, in terms of her ability to work full time. There is no doubt that the plaintiff will remain full-time in the work force for the rest of her working career, and that all of the medical evidence points to her being able to do so, subject only to the potential future development of problems which will require investigation and potentially surgery at some time in the future and the vicissitudes of life in the workplace for a woman at the plaintiff's level of employment.

73Despite the plaintiff's willingness to work, she is in a vulnerable position in the workforce. She lost two jobs due to the financial problems of her employers, and had difficulty performing another job (coincidentally with the company which had employed her at the time of the accident) because of the amount of standing, as Dr Sullivan notes. She has not yet had difficulty finding another job, but as she becomes older, this will become more difficult. As a poorly-educated woman at the bottom of the workplace ladder, the plaintiff will be even more likely to have difficulty changing jobs, or taking any time off work in relation to ankle problems, by reason of this injury. I am satisfied that, for the range of jobs her education and training makes her suitable, her earning capacity has ""unquestionably been reduced, but its extent is difficult to assess"" (State of New South Wales v Moss, supra, at [87]).

74In circumstances such as these, an award of a buffer for future economic loss would reflect the proposition that, to paraphrase Heydon JA, the want of precise evidence does not necessarily result in non-recovery of damages: Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v Kerr (2012) 83 NSWLR 302 at [7] per McColl JA. However, McColl JA went on to warn that this was not a licence to award buffers indiscriminately; where the evidence enables a more certain determination of the difference between the economic benefits the plaintiff derived from exercising earning capacity before injury and the economic benefit derived from exercising that capacity after injury, recourse should not ordinarily be had to the award of damages for future economic loss by way of a buffer (at [9]). It was when I drew these observations to Mr Lidden's attention, his response was to identify the sum sought as future wage loss as 25% of the plaintiff's current salary of approximately $52,000 per annum ($150,000) plus future loss of superannuation (at 13.93%) totalling $20,895.

75Mr Lidden SC's submission that the plaintiff has lost 25% of her income earning capacity for the whole of her working life (the basis upon which the claim for $150,000 is claimed) does not take into account McColl JA's explanation of the process for estimating future economic loss by the comparison of the past and future earnings, and endeavouring to identify the impact of the plaintiff's injury on her future earning capacity. The plaintiff's injury may affect her prospects of finding employment if, as has occurred in the past, she is made redundant due to her employer putting off staff or going out of business; similarly, at some future stage of her working career, she may require absence from the workforce for some months to have surgery, which may impact upon her ability to return to the workforce. That is the extent of her future economic loss, and to put that loss at 25% of her current income is demonstably an overstatement of that loss.

76However, the defendant's estimate of zero for future economic loss similarly fails to apply the principles of State of NSW v Moss, supra, as explained by Basten JA in Allianz Australia Ltd v Kerr, supra, at [24], where his Honour stresses that the question is not loss of income, but loss of capacity to earn income which ""is or may be productive of financial loss"", citing Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340 at 347; State of New South Wales v Moss, supra, at [71] per Heydon JA; State of New South Wales (NSW Police) v Nominal Defendant (2009) 53 MVR 243 at [86] per Beazley JA (Allsop P and Macfarlan JA agreeing). The plaintiff is not required with precision to identify that loss; the court must assess the degree of probability that the loss will occur (at [26], citing Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd (1990) 169 CLR 638). 

77The medical evidence is, as has already been noted, scant and dated. Dr Sullivan's report does, however, identify arthritic changes, which is suggestive of the possibility that the surgery to which Dr Kuo refers may be appropriate in the future. More importantly, Dr Sullivan notes that the plaintiff has some discomfort with prolonged standings and that the plaintiff ""does overdo this for eight hours a day"".

78There is only a small likelihood is that the plaintiff will require ongoing treatment and potentially, towards the end of her working life; perhaps more realistically, however, her arthritic changes will impact upon her ability to perform work requiring standing for long periods, and she will continue to have problems at work when carrying heavy objects and walking on uneven ground. These problems will impact upon her employability in the event of changing jobs. 

79Taking the above into account, the most realistic way to approach the quantum of the plaintiff's future economic loss is to allow for a buffer representing six months and a year of employment and the superannuation benefits for the relevant period, using the plaintiff's current salary as a guide, and taking into account the long period of her future working life up to seventy years of age. Based on the information provided to my by counsel in the course of closing submissions, in the course of which I invited them to address me as to what such a buffer should be, I propose to award a buffer of $50,000. 

80This figure is ""necessarily impressionistic"", for the reasons explained by McColl JA in Allianz Australia Ltd v Kerr, supra, which are worth repeating:

""It must also be taken into account, when considering theappellant's complaint about the adequacy of the claims assessor's reasons for quantifying the buffer, that the task of assessing damages for lost earning capacity is ""necessarily impressionistic"": Brear v James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd [2000] NSWCA 352; (2000) 50 NSWLR 388 at [49] per Mason P (Spigelman CJ and Priestley JA agreeing).""

81The reasons for this figure being impressionistic are the failure of the plaintiff's legal advisers to provide up-to-date medical reports or evidence in relation to the plaintiff's future treatment (including the failure to answer Dr Sullivan's report, which does not refer to surgery as necessary) and the wide difference in the submissions made to me by both parties at the hearing.

Past and future out of pocket expenses 

82Past out of pocket expenses are agreed at $17,226.

83The plaintiff takes no medication for ongoing pain and does not consult a general practitioner about her ankle problems. Nevertheless it is clear from Dr Sullivan's report of 31 January 2014 that the plaintiff needs to undergo an up to date MRI looking for possible arthritic change as the joint is stiff and she is tender in that area. He has suggested a radiologist to perform this and offered to look at the report. This indicates some ongoing problems and the defendant puts a cushion of $5,000 on this amount.

84The real question in these proceedings is whether at some future stage the plaintiff may require surgery. Dr Sullivan, the only doctor who has provided a recent report in relation to her condition, has not said so. The plaintiff has recently returned to consult Dr Kuo, but there is no report. Why there has been this delay in seeking a report about such essential evidence is not explained.

85The next problem is that, while I have noted, in the section above concerning future economic loss, that the plaintiff may pssibly require surgery in the form of an arthrodesis, there is no information as to when this will incur, what the cost will be, or how much time she will need to take off from work. I am simply left to speculate.

86Given the uncertainty concerning the plaintiff's future surgery, and the total lack of information, I propose to double the small sum for contingencies proposed by the defendant, and award the plaintiff the sum of $10,000 as a cushion for future out of pocket expenses, to allow for her requiring further treatment for the arthritis Dr Sullivan has observed in his report. The nature of the treatment to which he refers suggests that MRIs and visits to the specialist over the rest of the plaintiff's life are expenses that should be taken into account.

87It is impossible to identify when the plaintiff will require surgery, if at all, or what the cost will be. I propose to allow only a small buffer to allow for this eventuality, namely $5,000. Accordingly the plaintiff's future out of pocket expenses are $15,000.

Future home care

88Although there is no claim for past care, future care was particularised at two hours per week (having originally been claimed at 4 hours per week). 

89Counsel for the defendant submits that the medical evidence does not support a claim for domestic assistance. That is correct, but I am conscious that the NSW Court of Appeal has warned that the expression of such opinion must be made by an appropriately qualified person, and not an orthopaedic surgeon or other medical practitioner without the requisite skills in rehabilitation medicine: Boral Bricks v Cosmidis [2014] NSWCA 443 at [93]. Consequently, the opinion of the plaintiff's own medico-legal orthopaedic surgeon that the plaintiff does not require home assistance (see the final paragraph of Dr Clark's report) is inadmissible, if the approach advocated by Basten JA is accepted. This course was embraced by Mr Lidden SC, who urged me to disregard all the medical evidence to the effect that the plaintiff did not need any home care, and to rely instead upon her evidence that not only did she require assistance in the home, in the form of help to clean the two bathroom floors, but that this work could not be performed by the members of the plaintiff's family who reside with her. Accordingly a claim for two hours per week of paid home care ($80 per week for 40 years x 917.5, totalling $73,400) was made.

90Whether or not the medical practitioners were sufficiently expert to express a view, it was within the realm of their expertise to take a history of the plaintiff's ongoing disabilities, which all of them did. All of them report the plaintiff as being able to perform her usual chores, as well as to work full time, and of having the functionality to perform these chores when medically examined. None of them refer to the specific problem of which the plaintiff complains, namely the difficulty of crouching down to clean the bathroom floor and bath and the difficult areas in between, such as behind the toilet and under the vanity.

91The plaintiff's evidence was that she forgot to tell the doctors this, and that her de facto, Mr Muller, now cleans the bathroom. Mr Muller also gave evidence that he did this task. The plaintiff said that he should not have to clean the bathrooms and she would prefer that he did not have to do so. Mr Muller, who presented as an easy-going and kind-hearted person, said that he was prepared to keep on cleaning the bathrooms in their entirety, and that he considered the performing of such a task as part of the ordinary give and take of the domestic relationship. (The plaintiff's adult daughter, who resides with them, has the sole care of three children and does not participate in the housework).

92Mr Muller's evidence was that prior to the plaintiff's accident he was largely responsible for outdoor work, and that now they were living in a townhouse with very little garden, he was performing these extra household tasks in about the same amount of housework time as he was devoting to the outside of their former home. There was no evidence that he would cease to perform these tasks in the same way that he had done in the past.

93The amount claimed falls below the threshold, and the basis upon which an award is sought is for future paid care: Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353. The correct approach to such damages is explained in Gordon v Truong (2014) 66 MVR 241 at [132] - [134] as follows:

(a)The trial judge must make a finding, from the evidence, that the plaintiff is in need of domestic assistance, and the amount of time required for this purpose. The plaintiff is not entitled to be compensated for a non-injury need, such as cleaning the whole bathroom, if the need is only for someone to clean those parts she cannot reach without pain (i.e. the bathroom floor). The court must also be satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff will obtain commercial services, and should not make an award to compensate for such services unless this is the case: Miller, at [23].

(b)The next stage is what Basten JA calls the ""predictive"" exercise (Gordon, at [132]) as to whether Mr Muller would continue to look after the plaintiff in the same way that he had in the past, namely to clean the bathrooms. 

(c)Additionally, there may be findings necessary of the plaintiff's or Mr Muller's pre-injury financial position (at [133]).

94The evidence of the plaintiff's need for assistance in the bathroom was scant, and to the contrary of the evidence of Mr Muller, whose willingness and physical ability to continue to perform this task was explored in some detail by counsel for the defendant (cf Gordon at [134]). This is consistent with the minimal amount of care required. Additionally, I accept the submission of counsel for the defendant (outline of submissions, paragraph 60) that it is inherently unlikely that the plaintiff would bring in a paid cleaner to perform one minor, isolated task, namely cleaning the bathroom floor. I cannot be satisfied of any reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff would in fact obtain such commercial services (Miller, at [23]) and accordingly am not satisfied that the plaintiff has made out a claim for future care.

95No award will be made for domestic assistance.

Orders

96By reason of the uncertainty concerning the precise figure for past economic loss, I have invited the parties to bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting the mathematically agreed sum for entry as judgment in the plaintiff's favour. I have granted liberty to apply in relation to costs, which will otherwise follow the event.

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff.

(2)Parties have liberty to bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting the mathematically agreed judgment sum.

(3)Defendant pay plaintiff's costs.

(4)Liberty to apply in relation to costs.

(5)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		16 December 2014",2014-08-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764707,Wollongong City Council v Frames & Trusses (NSW) Pty Limited (No 2) [2014] NSWLEC 135,"EXTEMPORE Judgment
1The Council has sought to charge the respondent to these Class 4 proceedings with contempt of court, and, when the hearing commenced this morning, the prosecutor sought to amend its Notice of Motion (""NOM"") and Statement of Charge (""SOC""), and the defendant sought to have the contempt proceedings dismissed.
2The substantive proceedings were resolved by the making of consent orders by Pepper J on 22 October 2013.  Orders 1, 2 and 6 provided as follows:
1. The Respondent, its servants and agents are restrained from using, causing, suffering or permitting to be used Lots 17 and 18 DP 262279 otherwise known as 70-72 Princes Highway Yallah (""the Subject Property"") for the purpose of assembling, or assembling and storing, frames and trusses.
2. Order 1 is suspended until 1 March 2014.
...
6. In the event that an application is approved or agreed by Council that is inconsistent with the above orders, the parties are at liberty to approach the Court to vary these orders to ensure consistency with that approval or agreement.
3On 2 May 2014, the Council granted a Development Consent which enlivened Order 6.
4A joint application was made by the parties, on or about 3 April, to set aside those 3 and 2 other orders of 22 October 2013, with effect from 2 May 2014.  Pepper J made the ""set aside"" order, by consent, on 16 May, but with effect from 2 May ([2014] NSWLEC 60).
5Meanwhile, on 14 May 2014, the Council had filed its NOM and SOC for contempt.
6Apart from costs and any ""further"" orders, the Council sought in the NOM an Order: 
1. That the Respondent Frames & Trusses (NSW) Pty Limited be punished for contempt of the orders of this Honourable Court made 22 October 2013.
7The SOC stated the charge thus:
The Respondent Frames & Trusses (NSW) Pty Limited, by its servants and agents, has disobeyed the orders of this Honourable Court made on 22 October 2013 in that the Respondent, its servants and agents have used Lots 17 and 18 DP 262279 otherwise known as 70-72 Princes Highway Yallah for the purpose of assembling and storing frames and trusses, contrary to order 1 of the orders made by this Honourable Court, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked with the letter ""A"".
8Annexure ""A"" was a complete copy of the orders of 22 October 2013, initialled by Pepper J.
9The charge came before the List Judge (Craig J) on 13 June 2014.  No plea was entered, and the Registrar allocated these hearing dates, but no substantial directions appear to have been made.
10On 1 September, the prosecutor lodged with the Court, some written submissions on conviction, in which (at pars 14 and 15) counsel for the Council (Mr O'Gorman-Hughes) made clear that the Council sought imposition of a fine, and not sequestration of property.
11On 2 September, counsel for the defendant (Messrs Lynch SC and Neggo) made written submissions that (par 11) there was ""no legally sufficient SOC"", and so the NOM should be dismissed.
12At the conclusion of his brief oral opening this morning, Mr O'Gorman-Hughes sought to amend both the NOM and the SOC.
13In the case of the NOM, the amendment sought would add the words ""by fine"" after the word ""punished"" in the relevant paragraph of the NOM (par 1) quoted above (at [6]).
14In the case of the SOC, the charge would be reframed as follows (emphasis added to indicate changes):
The Respondent Frames & Trusses (NSW) Pty Limited, by its servants and/or agents, has disobeyed the orders of this Honourable Court made on 22 October 2013 in that between 1 March 2014 and 29 April 2014 the Respondent, by its servants and/or agents, used Lots 17 and 18 DP 262279 otherwise known as 70-72 Princes Highway Yallah for the purpose of assembling and storing frames and trusses, contrary to order 1 of the orders made by this Honourable Court, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked with the letter ""A"".
15Annexure ""A"" (the orders of 22 October 2013) would be unaffected by the amendments.
16Rule 6.3 of the Land and Environment Court Rules 2007 makes clear that, so far as applicable, Part 55 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 applies to contempt proceedings in this Court.
17Part 55 Rules 6 and 7 lay down the NOM/SOC procedure, and Rule 7 requires that the SOC ""specify"" the alleged contempt.
18Mr Lynch SC contends that the SOC commencing this contempt proceeding did not do so, in that it failed to ""identify the precise acts of the alleged contemnor"" (subs par 6), upon which the prosecutor relies.  No particulars of the usual kind were provided (or sought).  The SOC cannot ""merely couple the language of an order with a bare allegation of breach"" (subs par 7).
19He relied upon the following authorities: Burwood Council v Steve Nolan Constructions Pty Ltd & Anor (""Nolan"") [2014] NSWLEC 54; McDonnell v Novello [2006] NSWSC 1186; Newcastle City Council v Leaway Pty Ltd [2005] NSWLEC 619; lnghams Enterprises Pty Ltd v Timania Pty Ltd (""Inghams"") [2005] FCAFC 155; Matthews v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2009] NSWCA 155, and cases upon which they rely, such as Chiltern District Council v Keane [1985] 1 WLR 179.
20On behalf of the prosecutor, Mr O'Gorman-Hughes relied on those cases, and also on Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1758, and Mosman Municipal Council v Kelly (No 3) (""Kelly"") [2009] NSWLEC 92; (2009) 167 LGERA 91.
21He submits that the orders of 22 October 2013, annexed to the SOC are not ""extrinsic materials""; they are the particulars, and they are sufficiently specific in respect of what uses or activities are said to offend them, and how.
22In so far as no specific period of breach is included in the SOC, he submits that it would be clearly apparent that no breach could occur until 1 March (the end of the suspension of Order 1, nominated in Order 2), and that the period of alleged breach must end by 13 May, the date of the signing of the contempt process by Council's solicitor.
23He refutes the asserted defects in the NOM and SOC, and submits that the amendments proposed cause neither unfairness nor prejudice to the defendant.  In effect those amendments could be said to be to the defendant's advantage, or at least neutral.
24On the principles in Kelly (at [58] - [59]), these proceedings would involve contempt which is ""criminal"", rather than ""civil"", in character.  In that circumstance, the Court would need to invoke s 21(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in order to allow the amendment to correct a defect.  However, Mr O'Gorman-Hughes submits that the charge as framed is not defective, and, as the defendant would not be ""irreparably prejudiced"", and as the loss of ""some tactical advantage"" is not sufficient to ground a refusal of leave (Borodin v R [2006] NSWCCA 83), the amendments should be allowed.
25Turning to the various contempt authorities I have listed earlier, I note that I closely considered most, if not all, of them in Nolan.
26The correctness of my analysis, and my distillation of the correct principles, seem to be common ground between the parties - it is only their correct application to the case at hand which is in dispute, and their sources must be considered in their own particular context.
27Does the SOC give the defendant enough information to enable it to meet the charge?
28Having to ""deduce"" some particulars from an annexure to which the defendant signified its consent, does not amount to requiring of the defendant a degree of ""inference"" which the authorities find too broad, and offensive.
29I think this prosecution satisfies that test (see Keane at p622, and Nolan at [63]), and the tests articulated by the Full Federal Court in Inghams (at [32] - [34]).  The prosecutor has properly pleaded a case, and not just acted fairly towards the defendant (to use the formulation at the conclusion of Mr Lynch's oral submissions in reply).
30The defendant's objections to the initiating documents are dismissed.
31In accordance with Inghams ([32](d)), I will allow the amendments sought by the prosecutor, and we should now proceed with the matter, as envisaged by Inghams (at [32](e)).
32The parties' costs of this argument will be their costs in the cause.

		03 September 2014",2014-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Land and Environment Court
2764728,R v Zahab [2014] NSWSC 1197,"Judgment
1By an indictment presented on 21 August 2014, Khoder Zahab is accused of murdering his father, Mohammad Zahab on 14 February 2013, at Bankstown, NSW.
2Mr Zahab (""the accused"") has pleaded not guilty to this offence.  
3He has elected to be tried without a jury: s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
4The Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the accused each submit that I should return a special verdict in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, of not guilty, upon the basis that Mr Zahab was:
""... mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his ... action, at the time when the act was done ..."".
Trial by Judge Alone
5Where an accused is tried without a jury, s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act imposes certain obligations upon the judge in reaching a verdict. That section provides:
""(1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.(2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.""
6Section 133(2) requires me to expose in this judgment my reasoning process linking the principles of law with the facts found and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict reached:  Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250.  This requirement however does not extend to publishing a judgment in the form a summing up would have taken had the trial been before a jury:  R v Winningham (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 May 1995).
7Section 133(3) requires me to set out any requirement on me to give a warning to the jury, had this trial been before a jury, as well as the reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or in consequence of it, I have reached a particular verdict:  Fleming at [28].
Agreed Facts
8The Crown and the accused agreed on all of the relevant facts surrounding the death in February 2013.  The Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the Court.  What follows is drawn from that statement.  Although I am not bound by that statement, I am satisfied that I should make findings in accordance with them.
The Initial Scene
9As at February 2013, the accused, who was then 42 years old, was living at 17 Belar Avenue, Villawood.  His parents, and a nephew, lived at 140 Stacey Street, Bankstown.  His younger brother, Osman Zahab, and Osman's wife lived next door at 140A Stacey Street, Bankstown, along with their children. 
10On 14 February 2013, Osman Zahab called 000 on his mobile phone.  He told the operator ""...I got a paranoid schizophrenic that's just attacked my parents"".  He identified that person as ""my older brother...Khoder"".  The incident was broadcast over police radio. 
11Police arrived at the accused's parents' house in Bankstown.  On entering the house, the police located the body of Mohammad Zahab (""the deceased"") at the bottom of the staircase, and observed that his head had been completely removed from the body. 
12The accused was seen to be standing on the third step of the staircase, holding a knife.  The police drew their weapons and ordered the accused to drop the knife.  The accused dropped the knife. 
13There was a physical altercation between the accused and a police constable, following which the accused was handcuffed and advised that he was under arrest.
14The accused was taken to Bankstown Police Station and placed into custody. 
Events in the days leading up to the Killing 
15At the time of the killing in February 2013, the accused was in receipt of a Disability Pension from Centrelink due to mental health issues.  
16He had been a patient of Bankstown Community Mental Health for a number of years, where he had been previously diagnosed with schizophrenia.
17Mr Osman Zahab, the accused's younger brother, told police that approximately two years prior to February 2013: 
""...Khoder begun making accusations that I had robbed him and kidnapped his ex girlfriend. Khoder was admitted to Banks House Mental Hospital. He stayed at Banks House for about two weeks."" 
18At the time of the killing, the accused was on bail for an offence which occurred in January 2012, in breach of s 86 of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that he had detained a woman, without consent, with intent to obtain an advantage, namely information, and at the time of detaining the woman, actual bodily harm was occasioned to her. 
19This matter was finalised in the District Court on 25 September 2013, approximately seven months after the killing of the deceased. The verdict of the trial judge, Huggett DCJ, was ""Not Guilty on the Grounds of Mental Illness"". 
20The accused's mother, and wife of the deceased, Mrs Malaka Zahab, told police that around one month prior to the killing, the accused ""started getting crazier"". She asked him whether he was taking his medication to which he replied, ""Why would I need to take medication. I'm fine"".  Mrs Zahab suspected from this that the accused was not taking his medication. 
21Mrs Zahab also told police that approximately one week before the killing, she noticed the accused ""was acting strangely"".  The accused had told her that he wanted to take a shower at her house, ""because it reminded him of his childhood.""
22Around three weeks before the killing, according to what Mr Osman Zahab told the police, the accused:  
""started hallucinating again...[and] started to accuse people of doing things which they have not done""
23This included an accusation that Osman Zahab was ""trying to set [the accused] up to kill him.""
24Osman Zahab also told police that:
""A week or so [before the incident] he accused 7/11 Service Station staff of stealing $300.00 from him...[He] came over to my house and we had some dinner ...He started swearing and screaming for no reason...he started to push me and we had a bit of a push and shove. Khoder then pulled a knife on me. He said something about 'I'll kill you, it was all you'. He wasn't making any sense. I walked over to him and I told him if he was going to use the knife, use it. He continued to yell and scream and then he put it away. About five minutes after this, he started asking me to forgive him.""
25On 12 February 2013, two days before the killing, the accused arrived at Osman Zahab's smash repair business and said he had been driving up and down Parramatta Road trying to buy a car.  He said something had happened to his car, he wanted to buy a car with an alarm, and told Osman to take him to rent a car.  Osman drove the accused to four car rental places, however they were all closed, so he took the accused to their parent's house.
26At around 4.40pm on 13 February 2013, the day before the killing, the accused attended Hertz Car Rentals on Canterbury Road, Bankstown claiming to have a booking for a rental car.  The manager, Mr Ong Imtongkome, was unable to find a booking in the system and asked the accused who the booking had been made by.  The accused replied: ""my wife made a booking for me.""
27Twice the accused presented an ATM card to the Manager after being told a credit card was required.  The accused approached the counter and asked for a glass of water, with which he was provided.  He continued to ask for numerous glasses of water after that.  He also commenced opening and closing the door for customers.
28The Manager told police that the accused then approached the counter and said:
""You have my licence details. You have a photocopy of my licence...I know how you guys work. I know you're going to pass this information to the police and the police will chase me up. Don't treat me like a dog. I know you did a photocopy.""
29The accused started speaking about religion, God and ""out of the blue said the word 'murder' "". 
30The accused then went into the caryard to where a car was being cleaned. He placed his backpack in the front passenger seat of the car and said, ""I want this car"".  An exchange along the following lines then occurred:
Accused: ""where is the key to the ute?""
Manager: ""what ute are you talking about mate? We don't have any utes here""
Accused: ""my wife made a booking for me, so I want the car""
Manager: ""when did you speak to your wife?""
Accused: ""I spoke to her three years ago""
31Another staff member arranged for the police to attend.  However, as they had not arrived by 5.30pm, the Manager closed the premises and left.   
Detailed Account of the Evening before, and morning of the Killing 
32At some point prior to 9.30pm on the evening of 13 February 2013, the accused arrived at his parents' house. 
33During the evening, the accused kissed his mother's hands and feet and said, ""Mother I love you. I want you to love me.""
34The accused's father was eating at the dining table.  The accused was invited to eat.  Mrs Zahab told police she observed the accused pick up his plate, sit down, have a bite of food, then stand up and move to a different seat.  He did this several times. 
35Mrs Zahab asked the accused if he had taken his medication, but he did not respond. 
36Later that evening, the accused went to the downstairs bathroom to have a shower.  Mrs Zahab noticed the bathroom light was off and offered to turn the light on, which the accused declined.  He wanted the light off while he was showering.  The accused asked his mother where the tap was.  She turned the tap on and the accused screamed, ""... they keep turning the water off"".  When his mother asked to whom he was referring, the accused replied: ""... they do. They keep turning the water off.""
37Later that evening, because the accused wanted to sleep at his parents' house, Mrs Zahab offered him a mattress in the bedroom being used by his nephew, the grandson of Mrs Zahab and the deceased, Mr Bilal Haddad.  As Mrs Zahab turned the bedroom lights off, she noticed the accused's ""eyes change"".  She told police his eyes ""looked as though they were popping out of his head"". 
38In a statement given to the police, Bilal Haddad said that he and the accused decided to have ""a smoke"" of cannabis in his room during the early hours of 14 February 2013.  Bilal Haddad told police that the accused had lit a candle, held it in his hand and started to dance around.  Bilal told the accused ""not to be too loud"" as he did not want to be caught by his grandparents with cannabis in his room.
39At approximately 4am on 14 February 2013, Mrs Zahab woke to loud noises and banging.  She went to the bedroom where the accused and Bilal were and saw the accused holding a candle in both hands, jumping up and down, and pointing to things saying ""You're the devil. You're the devil"".  She also saw Bilal lying in bed, laughing.  Mrs Zahab believed that Bilal ""was pretending to laugh to keep Khoder happy"".  The accused looked at his mother, said, ""You're the devil"" and slammed the bedroom door in her face.
40Mrs Zahab then performed her morning ablutions and prayers, during which she noticed the noises grow louder.  At around 5am, she observed the accused jumping up and down yelling, ""You're the devil. You're the devil"".  She went to her room and heard the door being locked from outside and the accused continuing to yell, ""You're the devil. You're the devil"".
41At approximately 5.30am, Mrs Zahab left her bedroom to go downstairs.  She saw the accused in the upstairs hallway with a candle in one hand and Bilal Haddad's running shoes in the other, saying ""devil, devil, devil"". 
42Mrs Zahab walked to the first landing on the staircase.  The accused followed her.  As she went to take the first step down the next flight of stairs, she felt a push in her back and heard the accused saying ""devil, devil, devil."" 
43Mrs Zahab fell down the stairs, put her hands out, hit the floor, slid forward and hit her head on the door to the toilet.  She told police that after her fall she felt dizzy and her head was spinning, however she quickly stood up, as she was afraid the accused was going to kill her.  By this time the accused had come down the stairs.  He punched Mrs Zahab in the face in between her eyes. 
44Mrs Zahab was later taken to Bankstown Hospital and treated.  She suffered bruising to her left arm and wrist, bruising to her nose, soreness to her back and right leg, and pain in her neck.  The accused was charged in relation to that assault.  The charge was placed on a s 166 Certificate when the murder charge was committed to this Court. 
45Bilal Haddad, having seen the accused punch Mrs Zahab, went to the bedroom of his grandfather, the deceased.  He woke the deceased and told him what the accused had done.  Mrs Zahab told police that the deceased came down the stairs saying to the accused, ""What are you doing? That's your mum"", to which the accused replied, ""No, no, she's a devil. She's a devil.""
46Mrs Zahab then saw the accused pick up a brick wrapped in plastic, which was being used as a doorstop for the front door, and bash the deceased on the side of the head twice while repeatedly saying; ""You're the devil.  You're the devil."" 
47The deceased fell to the ground. Mrs Zahab attempted to calm the accused down by saying prayers. The accused then: 
""... bent down and bashed [the deceased] in the head one more time as he lay on the ground. [The deceased] yelled 'your son killed me. Your son killed me. I am dead'""
48The accused ran to the kitchen and searched through drawers.
49Mrs Zahab exited her house and ran next door to her son, Osman Zahab's house. She banged on the back door and told Osman:
""Your brother's gone crazy. He has killed your father. Call the police""
50Bilal Haddad, having also seen the accused assault the deceased, climbed onto Osman's balcony and told Osman what he had seen.
51It was at this point in time that Osman Zahab called 000 on his mobile phone and spoke with the operator.  I have earlier set out the terms of this conversation. 
52Osman went to the back door of his parent's house, opened the door and saw the accused:
""...on his knees. He was squatting over something. I heard him saying what we say when we are about to slaughter a cow or a chicken to make it halal. He said it twice.""
53The accused then approached Osman with a knife in one hand and what appeared to be a head in the other hand.  The accused told Osman to ""get out of here"" and started to yell in Arabic.  Osman told police he was unsure what the accused said. 
54When police arrived at the scene the accused was observed to be standing on the third step of the staircase, holding a knife.  The police drew their weapons and ordered the accused to drop the knife.  The accused dropped the knife.  It landed at the bottom of the staircase near the body of the deceased.  The police observed that the accused was holding clothing in both hands.  The accused was ordered to drop the clothing.
55Constable Howe moved up the stairs towards the accused.  The accused grabbed a chair and threw it down the staircase.  Constable Howe stepped back to avoid being hit and then continued further up the stairs. 
56The accused started yelling.  Constable Howe grabbed the accused by the shoulders.  The accused grabbed Constable Howe by his police vest and the front of his neck.  Constable Howe stated that he took the accused ""to the ground and began a ground wrestle with him."" 
57The accused was charged in relation to this assault. The charge was placed on a s 166 Certificate when the charge of murder was committed to this Court for trial.
58Two other police officers, Constable Bye and Leading Senior Constable Toner helped Constable Howe.  The accused was handcuffed by a fourth police officer, Constable Conaghan, and advised that he was under arrest. 
59The accused was then transported to Bankstown Police Station. 
Interactions with the Accused at the Bankstown Police Station
60At Bankstown Police Station, the accused was cautioned and again advised that he was under arrest by Detective Senior Constable Troy Smith. 
61Detective Smith asked the accused why he had scratches on his face, to which the accused replied:
""They drugged me and raped me, they drugged me with heroin in the day and Ice in the night.""
62The Custody Manager at Bankstown Police Station, Sergeant Brooke Smith, requested an Arabic Interpreter for the accused.  Sergent Smith also suggested that a Support Person be present if the accused was to be interviewed, and made arrangements through the Bankstown Mental Health Crisis Team for a support person to attend the Police Station. 
63Detective Senior Constable Dodd was also present at the Police Station and observed the accused.  He has stated that he saw the accused lying on his back, singing and laughing.  The accused told Detective Dodd:
""I didn't kill my father, I killed a pig, it was just a pig. He's not of my blood anyway.""
64The accused also accused police of bashing and assaulting him.  There was no basis for any such accusation.
65Based upon his observations, Detective Dodd advised Sergent Smith that police would not interview the accused until he had been assessed by a mental health service and had a support person present. 
66Dr Sidney Oden, Mr Andrew Whalan and Mr Barney Eadet from the Bankstown Community Mental Health Crisis Team, and an Arabic interpreter attended the Police Station. 
67In conversation with Detective Dodd, Dr Oden said this of the accused:
""...on the balance of probabilities...[he] is not in touch with reality at present and stated he thinks there is a conspiracy against him and that he is a pawn, like a tennis ball, being hit back and forth. He is not acknowledging and comprehending what is happening...He told me he has not taken his meds for about 18 months."" 
68Dr Oden advised police that the accused was on the ""severe end of psychosis"" and in his opinion, 
""...should be hospitalised immediately where he would be medicated straight away""
69He also informed the police that, in that event, the accused would likely be able to be interviewed ""in a few days"" though; 
""...it could take longer, depending on how long he had been off his medication."" 
70Based on these opinions, Detective Dodd decided to wait until the accused had been medicated for a period of time before interviewing him.  Forensic procedures were carried out on the accused by a doctor and in the presence of Mr Eadet (the support person) and Detectives Dodd and Smith. 
 Post-mortem Examination of Deceased 
71A post-mortem examination was undertaken by Dr Rebecca Irvine, a specialist pathologist, on 15 February 2013.  Dr Irvine, who had also visited the scene, formed the opinion that death was occasioned by the combined effects of blunt force injuries to the head, chopping wounds to the head and stabbing wounds to the chest.
72She also noted that either shortly before, or else soon after, death the head of the deceased had been decapitated.  A 12.4cm long knife blade tip was recovered from the soft tissue on the left side of the neck of the deceased.
73Dr Irvine observed that the stab wounds to the chest had injured critical vessels, including the left pulmonary artery and the aorta.  She also observed the near amputation of the right fourth finger by sharp force, which she thought was very likely to be a defensive wound.
74In short, the injuries were many, and indicative of significant force, uncontrolled rage, and homicidal intent.  The decapitation was particularly violent, and gruesome.  
Factual Conclusions
75From all of the Agreed Facts, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt that, on the morning of 14 February 2013, Mr Zahab, the accused, bashed and stabbed his father, the deceased, thereby causing his death.  I am satisfied that he did so, intending to kill him.  He then decapitated him.  
76I am satisfied of his intent beyond reasonable doubt: first, because of the number, nature and extent of the injuries inflicted on the deceased; second, because of what Osman Zahab heard him saying when he saw the accused in his parents' house; and third, because of what he told police after the incident of having killed a pig.  These three factors combine to make it plain that the killing occurred at a time when Mr Zahab was acting with the intention of killing his father. 
77But for the defence of mental illness, to which it will be necessary to come, I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Crown has proved all elements of the offence of murder.
78Indeed, counsel for Mr Zahab did not submit to the Court that such findings ought not be made, nor did he present any argument which cast any doubt on these being the appropriate findings.
Mr Zahab's History and Mental State
79The mental history and state of Mr Zahab was proved through the expert reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist, dated 24 July 2013, 30 August 2013 and 2 November 2013, and reports of Dr Bruce Westmore, also an expert forensic psychiatrist, dated 5 July 2013, 22 November 2012, 9 October 2012 and 14 September 2012.  Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore were called as witnesses, and gave their evidence concurrently.  
80Dr Westmore examined Mr Zahab on 5 July 2013, and on two previous occasions, namely 13 September 2012 and 20 November 2012.  Dr Nielssen examined Mr Zahab on 5 July 2013.  There is no significant disagreement between each of the experts.  
81I note that the occasions on which Dr Westmore examined the accused in 2012 were prior to the incident involving the deceased, and that the subsequent examinations of the accused by both Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen were conducted prior to the Not Guilty verdict being entered in respect of the charge arising out of the incident in January 2012. 
82The fact that the reports span a period of approximately 14 months provides the Court with a comprehensive psychiatric account of Mr Zahab prior to, and during, his period of incarceration for the killing in February 2013.
83I am satisfied that I should approach the histories provided to the psychiatrists, although principally admitted for the purpose of demonstrating their psychiatric opinions, as evidence of the truth of what the psychiatrists were told: s 60 Evidence Act 1995.
84Mr Zahab was born on 2 April 1970 in Lebanon.  He was the third of seven children to his parents who were of Sunni Muslim heritage from Tripoli on the North Coast of Lebanon.  His father, the deceased, was a carpenter and his mother did not work.  His eldest sister worked in childcare, and the sisters immediately older and younger than him were married with children.  His youngest sister worked at the local council and both his younger brothers were panel beaters and spray painters.  One sister died of respiratory problems. 
85Mr Zahab came to Australia at the age of five. He reported a difficult childhood.  He was apparently severely punished by his father and bullied at school.  He attended primary school in Revesby and then Bankstown Boy's High to the end of year ten, when he left school.  He reported that he had wanted to complete high school, however he had to leave in order to work to help support his family.  He said he enjoyed, and was good at, sports, in particular soccer and rugby league.
86After leaving school, he completed an apprenticeship as a boilermaker and welder at the Transfield Plant at Seven Hills, including the four years at TAFE, and was involved in several large scale metal fabrication projects, including building wheat silos, making portable bridges for the army and large scale metal fabrication for public buildings.  In addition to his training as a boilermaker, he completed two years training as a panel beater and two years working with a plumber. 
87He married in his early twenties to a woman of Anglo-Australian heritage and had two sons from that marriage, now aged 20 and 21.  His eldest son is studying at a university on the Gold Coast and his younger son is a house painter.  Mr Zahab lived on the Gold Coast for around 9 years during his early adult life. 
88For the last 13 years, Mr Zahab has been in a relationship with another woman, the complainant in the January 2012 matter. 
89Mr Zahab has a history of drug abuse.  He began smoking cannabis in his mid twenties; at the same time he began smoking cigarettes.  He smoked cannabis on and off, and reported that he was not aware of a direct relationship between his use of cannabis and symptoms of psychosis. 
90As well, Mr Zahab has used other drugs, including methamphetamine on one occasion, cocaine, hallucinogenic trips and MDMA.  He has not consumed alcohol since the age of 17. 
91His main drug of abuse, however, has been heroin, which he used intermittently for nine years prior to the killing.  This included periods of dependence on up to 2 grams of heroin per day, followed by distressing withdrawal symptoms when unable to obtain the drug.  He commenced treatment with the anti-craving medication, Methadone.  He had one period of long-term drug rehabilitation, beginning with a detoxification at the William Booth Institute and then some months at a dual diagnosis centre called Miracle Haven. 
92Mr Zahab told Dr Nielssen that his only illegal drug use in the two years prior to being remanded in custody was cannabis. 
93From at least 2001, Mr Zahab had been experiencing hallucinations and expressed bizarre persecutory beliefs.  He was diagnosed with psychosis in 2001 and began treatment with the antipsychotic medication Risperidone.  He had a number of psychiatric reviews and received treatment with the antipsychotic medication Olanzapine (Zyprexa) from 2003 to 2005.
94In June 2011, he was involuntarily admitted to Banks House.  At that time it was noted that he had been known to Bankstown Mental Health since 2007, and was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1997.  At the time of his admission he expressed persecutory beliefs regarding neighbours.
95He had a number of contacts with the Community Health Centre in November and December 2011, during which he was reported to be behaving strangely and expressing bizarre persecutory beliefs, for example, that people were getting into his house and that his Methadone had been poisoned. 
96In 2012, he was seen intermittently, including by a psychiatrist.  A referral dated 26 June 2012 noted: ""making death threats to the community around him"".
97Mr Zahab told Dr Neilssen and Dr Westmore that in the months before the killing of his father, he had become increasingly paranoid, believing he ""could translate messages coming from the sounds made by cars"" and that different emergency sirens ""had different meanings"".  He said that he believed his thoughts could be picked up by radio ""depending on the channel"" and that he had smashed two television sets because he believed they were two-way mirrors monitoring his movements.  He had also turned his television to the wall, unplugged it and covered it with a towel to stop it from observing him.  He also said that particular colours, sounds and smells had patterns that could be translated into meaning.
98He told Dr Westmore he believed the cannabis he smoked was laced with Ice and heroin, he said:
""They gave me the Ice to make me shattered during the day and at night they gave me the pot laced with Heroin to make me sleep, so they could control.""
99When asked by Dr Nielssen who he thought was behind the conspiracies, he said this:
""I didn't know...it was different voices...I sometimes see the shapes of gnomes and dwarfs and also animals...I felt everybody was a clone...as I walked along the street I thought that people were being chained up inside and were made into sex slaves...I thought people were slaughtering people...I heard screams as I walked down the street.""
100Dr Westmore stated that: 
""Leading up to the homicide, a neighbour had contacted the health service expressing concerns about Mr Zahab's deteriorating behaviour. Family members describe Mr Zahab as behaving in a peculiar way and leading up to the homicide itself he reported calling his mother the devil. He indicated to me that he believed his parents had been cloned and that his father was a 'pig.' ""  
101On 15 February 2013, the day after the killing, he was examined in custody by a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts. Mr Zahab recorded feeling ""excellent"" and expressed the grandiose belief that he had ""houses everywhere"".  Dr Roberts noted that during the interview, he shouted in Arabic in response to apparent hallucinations.  Dr Roberts noted prominent paranoia, delusional beliefs and recorded that his speech was ""unintelligible at times"".  He was referred to the Mental Health Screening Unit. 
102An assessment by a trainee psychiatrist on 19 February 2013 noted that Mr Zahab had not been taking his medication, had been using drugs, and was ""currently acutely psychotic with...hallucinations paranoid delusions and thought disorder"".  Further entries made in February 2013 noted the presence of disorganised thinking, inappropriate laughter as though in response to voices, persecutory and grandiose beliefs, and limited insight. 
Expert Opinion
103When the accused was interviewed by Dr Westmore he gave this account of the killing of his father.  He said:
""I was believing that everyone was clones, my mother was the devil and that everyone was dead and buried on a property already ... as far as I was concerned, I was slaughtering a pig."" 
104Dr Westmore asked him directly why he had cut off the deceased's head, he said, ""I believed he was a pig, I was delusional, hallucinating."".  When asked by Dr Westmore how long he had thought his father was ""a pig"", he replied ""nearly a year."" 
105He told Dr Westmore that he could not understand why he had killed his father, he said:
""I don't understand, I ask myself every day, why and what for. It was like a nightmare. I just saw black and red and I was up in the police station.
...
I'm sorry for everything that happened, it wasn't in my hands."" 
106He went on to state that he was mentally ill at the time he killed his father and that he wanted the court to acknowledge that.  When asked whether he got on with his father he said;
""Yes, I loved my father, even though he used to bash me a lot and mentally and physically abuse me, call me names, I'm a donkey, I'm no good.""
107When interviewed by Dr Nielssen, he said he had no memory of actually assaulting his father, or why he might have decapitated him.  However, he told Dr Nielssen that on the evening of the killing:
""I thought my real family were dead and were buried under the house and the people who were there were clones.
...
I felt strange...I just couldn't sit still...I changed my plate because I thought the food was poison...I thought that people were coming into the house to kill me...I felt too paranoid to turn on a light...I was looking out the window and I thought I could see pyramids like in the olden days."" 
108Dr Westmore, in his report of 5 July 2013, expressed the following expert opinion: 
""[Mr Zahab's] history describes multiple symptoms which are likely to be of psychotic origin, including delusional beliefs, ideas of reference and auditory hallucinations. He reports these symptoms have diminished since has been placed back onto medication. 
...
Based on his history, and supported quite strongly by collateral histories provided by family members, Mr Zahab was acutely psychotic at the time he killed his father.
I understand from his history that his compliance with medication has been poor. He has a history of recurring episodes of psychosis with associated behavioural problems, including aggression.
Leading up to the homicide, a neighbour had contacted the health service expressing concerns about Mr Zahab's deteriorating behaviour. Family members describe Mr Zahab behaving in a peculiar way and leading up to the homicide itself he reported calling his mother the devil. He indicated to me that he believed his parents had been cloned and that his father was a ""pig"". 
...
Mr Zahab's chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness is characterised by auditory hallucinations, delusional beliefs, ideas of reference, formal thought disorder and, possibly at times, a disturbance of mood. 
I note the concerns expressed by one police officer in relation to Mr Zahab possibly feigning symptoms of mental illness and I note the content of the statement provided by his nephew. Despite those concerns and observations, I maintain the view that Mr Zahab was acutely psychotic at the time of the homicide.
Mr Zahab could raise a mental illness defence to the charge of murder. He was suffering from a disease of the mind (acute relapse of a paranoid schizophrenic illness) and that illness would have totally deprived him of knowing that he ought not do the act and that the act was wrong ... I am of the view that the mental illness defence is the correct defence, which should be raised in this particular case.
Mr Zahab will require long term supervision in a secure psychiatric facility, he will require long term treatment by psychiatrists and treatment with medication."" 
109Dr Nielssen, in diagnosing Mr Zahab with chronic schizophrenia, expressed this opinion:
 ""The diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia is made on the basis of the history of typical symptoms of the illness, including hallucinations of voices, thought broadcasting, ideas of reference from his surroundings and persecutory beliefs, a typical pattern of treatment, including involuntary admissions to a psychiatric hospital in the community, treatment as a condition of a Community Treatment Order and treatment with antipsychotic medication in prison, and aspects of Mr Zahab's presentation during the recent interview when he was thought to be blunted in his emotional range and to be rather literal in his response in a way that was typical of chronic schizophrenia.
Based on the information that is available to me, I believe Mr Zahab has the defence of mental illness open to him...He has a disease of the brain in the form of chronic schizophrenia, which produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. His mental illness gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of bizarre persecutory beliefs...Mr Zahab reported that he did not remember the lethal assault of his father. However, the history elicited suggests that he was acutely mentally ill at the time and held a number of bizarre delusional beliefs, including that his family had been replaced by clones, and on the balance of probabilities he was deprived of the ability to recognise that his actions were morally wrong at the time as well. 
...
Mr Zahab requires indefinite secure treatment for mental illness and long term supervision to ensure that he remains abstinent from illegal drugs that might trigger a further episode of mental illness."" ""
110In a supplementary report dated 2 November 2013, Dr Nielssen, having reviewed various medical records and read a report of Dr Westmore, confirmed the diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and the availability of the defence of mental illness.  He said this:
""A review of the medical records and other documents confirms both that Mr Zahab has a chronic schizophrenic illness that has been present since at least 2001, and also that he was acutely mentally ill at around the time of the offence...
...
I confirm the opinion expressed in my previous report regarding the availability of the defence of mental illness to the charge of the murder of his father.""
111Both experts adhered to their views in evidence.  I accept the expert opinions of Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore and their evidence.  Neither party submitted that I should not.
112However, I should say that I have formed the opinion that both of these experts have undertaken their task diligently and thoroughly.  Their opinions are unqualified and seem to me to be properly based upon the material that they had.  As well, the opinions accord with the inexpert and untutored view, which I would have reached as a matter of common sense.
113As the tribunal of fact I am not bound by the opinion of any expert witness or any number of expert witnesses.  However, this is a circumstance in which the expert witness engaged by the Crown, and whose evidence was not challenged by the accused, and the expert witness called by the defence, agree with each other.  In those circumstances I should not reject the unanimous opinions of the expert witnesses unless there is evidence before me which would cast doubt on those opinions:  R v Huy Pham [2007] NSWSC 1313 at [42] per James J; R v Coles [2008] NSWSC 682 at [9] per Grove J.  Here, there is no such evidence.  
Should a Special Verdict be Found?
114The issue to which I now turn my attention is whether that mental illness, which I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt existed, is sufficient to satisfy the legal tests to enable a special verdict to be found.
115Before I do so, I note that, had the proceedings been heard in a trial with a jury, there would have been an obligation on me to inform the jury of the legal and practical consequences of a special verdict.  I bear all those matters in mind in considering my verdict in this case.  In particular I note, and have regard to, the following matters:
(a)if my verdict is ""not guilty by reason of mental illness"", I have to decide what should then be done with the accused.  If I am satisfied that neither his safety, nor the safety of any other member of the community is seriously put at risk by his release, I can order his release into the community either unconditionally or on conditions that I believe are necessary for his welfare and that of the community.
(b)if it is not appropriate to release the accused at this point in time, I can make an order that he be detained in custody until he is released by due process of law.  This means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
(c)the composition and functions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, including its obligation to review a case of a forensic patient as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody, its obligation to review the patient at least once every six months, and its obligation not to release a forensic patient unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. 
116The real issue in this trial is whether the accused has available to him the defence of mental illness.  The defence is a matter for the accused to establish, not beyond reasonable doubt, but on the balance of probabilities:  Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659.  If the accused does establish the defence of mental illness, then a special verdict is to be returned.  
117Section 38(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides:
""38 Special verdict
(1) If, in an indictment ..., an act ... is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his ... action at the time when the act was done ..., then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act ..., but was mentally ill at the time when the person did ... the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.""
118That section, and the Act, do not provide any definition of the term ""mentally ill"".  The meaning of that term is determined in accordance with the M'Naghten Rules:  R v M'Naughten (1843) 8 ER 718 at 722:  
""Every man is presumed to be sane; and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, unless the contrary is proven ...;  that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.""
119In order to persuade the Court to return a special verdict, it is necessary for Mr Zahab to persuade me, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time he killed his father, he was suffering from a mental illness, which led to a defect of reason such that he did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.
120I am well satisfied that Mr Zahab knew what he was doing.  He intended to kill his father by bashing him with the brick, which was wrapped in cloth.  He also intended to kill him by stabbing him on a number of occasions in the chest and by attacking his father's neck in a chopping way.
121This was a brutal, vicious and unconstrained attack, which only stopped when Mr Zahab thought that his father was dead.  I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Zahab knew the nature and quality of his acts.
122However, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the killing, Mr Zahab was mentally ill.  He was at that time, and had been for a significant period, suffering paranoid schizophrenia.  This type of illness is a ""disease of the mind"".  It was in an acute phase at the time of the killing, and was characterised by a number of bizarre and delusional persecutory beliefs.
123The evidence of the two expert psychiatrists who are eminently well qualified, and are highly experienced and respected in their profession, persuades me to accept the view, and I find that, Mr Zahab did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  He could not make that judgment because of his mental illness.  
124Paranoid schizophrenia, a mental illness recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders - 5th Edition (DSM-V), generally has features such as the presence of prominent delusions, or auditory hallucinations.  The delusions are typically characterised by being either persecutory or grandiose, or perhaps both.  Religiosity is often a feature of the delusions.  It is atypical of paranoid schizophrenics to see disorganised speech, disorganised or catatonic behaviour or negative symptoms.
125Whilst it is always theoretically possible for an intelligent individual to attempt to feign or mimic the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, it is very hard to do so in a way that hoodwinks or deceives trained experts.  It is particularly difficult to do so over a lengthy period of time.  Here, Mr Zahab has suffered from a mental illness for over a decade.  He has been consistently diagnosed with mental illness throughout that period, and by a number of different doctors.  
126Here, I am persuaded that Mr Zahab is not feigning or inventing his mental illness for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of his criminal conduct.  The accounts of the independent witnesses as to Mr Zahab's conduct prior to, and at the time of, the killing are consistent with and proof of, the diagnosis reached by the expert psychiatrists.  As well, the very nature of the killing itself also serves as support for the conclusions of the experts.
127Because of his mental illness, Mr Zahab did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  Counter-intuitively, Mr Zahab thought that what he was doing was right.  
128This issue is raised by the second part of the M'Naughten Rules.  It is necessary here to remind myself of the proper direction which would in substance be given to a jury on this issue.  I do so by reference to legal authority.
129In R v Porter [1933] HCA 1;(1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190, the test was formulated by Dixon J in the course of his summing up to a jury in these terms:
""The other head is of quite a different character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing, but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. That is the issue, the real question in this case. Was his state of mind of that character? I have used simple expressions, but when you are dealing with the unseen workings of the mind you have to come to close quarters with what you are speaking about, and it is very difficult to be quite clear as to what is meant in describing mental conditions. I have used the expression 'disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind.' That does not mean ... that there must be some physical deterioration of the cells of the brain ... you are dealing with a very different thing - with the understanding. It does mean that the functions of the understanding are through some cause, whether understandable or not, thrown into derangement or disorder.
Then I have used the expression 'know', 'knew that what he was doing was wrong'. We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act of killing at a particular time, a particular individual. We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong?  If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.
If you think that at the time when he administered the poison to the child he had such a mental disorder or disturbance or derangement that he was incapable of reasoning about the right or wrongness, according to ordinary standards, of the thing which he was doing, not that he reasoned wrongly, or that being a responsible person he had queer or unsound ideas, but that he was quite incapable of taking into account the considerations which go to make right or wrong, then you should find him not guilty upon the ground that he was insane at the time he committed the acts charged.""
130The terms of this explanation of the second part of the M'Naughten test has been judicially approved: Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 55; (1952) 86 CLR 358; Regina v Matheis (1958) 58 SR (NSW) 321 at 322 per Owen J, Street CJ and Herron J agreeing; R v Matusevich & Thompson [1976] VR 470 at 477 per Young CJ, Starke and NelsonJJ.
131It is appropriate that I regard what Dixon J said as a practical synthesis of the concepts involved, and have regard to it, in undertaking the task which follows.
132I have relied heavily on the expert opinions and evidence of Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore.  Both counsel for the Crown, and counsel for the accused, submitted that I should accept these opinions, and hence I should be satisfied that Mr Zahab has available to him the defence of mental illness because he did not know, in all of the circumstances, that what he was doing was wrong.
133In all of the circumstances, I consider that I should accept the expert psychiatric opinions and their evidence and, accordingly, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time he killed father, the accused, Mr Zahab, did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  Accordingly, he was mentally ill, and a defence under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act has been established.
134The consequence of finding in the accused's favour on the defence of mental illness is that I return a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness.  One possible consequence of that is that the accused could be discharged, either conditionally or unconditionally, into the community.  Neither the Crown, nor counsel for Mr Zahab submitted that in all of the circumstances of this case, this would be appropriate.  It clearly would not be appropriate.
135What will happen in this case is that the accused will be detained in custody until he is released by due process of law.  In other words, he will remain in custody and be held as a forensic patient and come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  
136In coming to my decision as to the appropriate verdict, I have taken into account the composition and functions of that Tribunal and the fact that the accused will not be released until it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release.  His case will be reviewed by the Tribunal as soon as practicable and, if further detained, his case will be reviewed at six monthly intervals.  If at some stage the accused is released, it may be on conditions that if any of those conditions are breached, or his mental condition deteriorates to a point where he may be a serious danger to others, the Tribunal may order that he be apprehended and further detained. 
Additional Charge
137As I have earlier indicated, there are two charges of assault that have been brought before this Court pursuant to a certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
138The assaults occurred immediately before the killing of the deceased by the accused, and immediately after.  Both occurred when the accused was mentally ill.
139I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this Court should deal with these offences: s 166(1A) Criminal Procedure Act.
140Compared with the principal offence, these two backup charges are minor.  No lasting injury was caused.  The accused was mentally ill at the time.  The accused has been in custody now since February 2013, a period of over 18 months, which is longer than any sentence that would have been imposed had he been found guilty of the offences.
141In this case, the interests of justice favour the final disposition of these charges.  Accordingly, I will order that the charges be dismissed.
Conclusion
142My conclusions are:
(a)I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts of the accused Khoder Zahab on 14 February 2013 caused the death of Mohammed Zahab.
(b)I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of that killing the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from a disease of the mind that he did not know that what he did was wrong.
Verdict
143I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness with respect to the sole count on the Indictment being the offence of murder contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900.
Orders
144I make the following orders pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986:
(1)Order that the charges on the certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, be dismissed.
145I make the following orders pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990:
(1)Order that Khoder Zahab be detained at the Psychiatric Ward, Long Bay Prison Hospital, or at such other place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of law.
(2)Direct the Registrar of the Court to notify the Minister for Health of this judgment and order.
(3)Direct the Registrar of the Court to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of this judgment and order and to provide to that Tribunal the following documentation:
(a)A copy of these reasons for verdict and orders;
(b)A transcript of these proceedings;
(c)A copy of each of the exhibits tendered at the trial.

Conclusion

[280]

1Mr Desmond Campbell (the appellant) was arraigned on a charge that on 24 March 2005 he murdered Janet Campbell.

2The appellant was convicted following a trial before Latham J and a jury. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 24 years to date from 10 May 2010, with a balance of term of 9 years expiring on 9 May 2043.

3The appellant has appealed against his conviction on the following grounds:

""1. A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the Trial Judge advancing, for the first time in the summing up, a second and alternative scenario, which was not relied upon by the Prosecution, which amounted to liability for murder, namely reckless indifference to human life.

2. A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the summing up from a failure on the part of the Trial Judge to leave an alternative verdict of manslaughter by dangerous and unlawful act.

3. The Trial Judge erred in admitting the evidence of Associate Professor Cross over objection.

4. There has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the Appellant on account of fresh evidence.

5. The Trial Judge erred in her directions attaching to the evidence of June Ingham as constituting motive and tendency.""

4Ground 2 of these grounds was abandoned at the hearing.

5Because of the nature of the grounds of appeal and the submissions made by the parties, it is necessary to set out the evidence at trial in some detail.

The evidence at the trial
The appellant's relationship with the deceased

6In a record of interview conducted between the appellant and two police officers on 25 March 2005, tendered by the Crown at the trial, the appellant said he met Janet Campbell formerly Fisicaro (the deceased) in January 2000 when he was stationed as an ambulance officer at the Deniliquin Hospital. The deceased lived in Deniliquin whilst he was working at the hospital. The appellant said his friendship with the deceased escalated approximately a year and a half before the deceased's death. The deceased and the appellant were married in September 2004. The deceased was 49 years old when she died on 24 March 2005.

7The deceased had previously been married to Frank Fisicaro and had one son from that marriage, Stephen. Frank Fisicaro died in 1997. According to the deceased's sisters, Ms Eunice Marshall and Ms Ellen Rourke, and a work colleague, Mr Colin Sander, it was rumoured around Deniliquin that the deceased was a wealthy widow. 

8The deceased was described by her solicitor, a Mr David Grant, as ""simple"" and being of ""below average intelligence"". An acquaintance, Mr Stanley Drummond, said she was ""a little bit slow"". The deceased's sisters and her son gave evidence that the deceased did not play sport, participate in any exercise activities or like camping. Her sister, Ms Rourke, and her son said she had a fear of heights and her brother said she hated the dark. 

9By contrast the appellant told police after the deceased's death that he was not aware the deceased was scared of heights and that she used to laugh at him because he could not stand too near the edge of a cliff. However, photographs were tendered at trial showing the appellant posing for the camera on benches and railings on the edge of lookouts and hills. 

10A marriage celebrant, Ms Jennafer Whelan, gave evidence that in August or early September 2003 the appellant and the deceased met with her to discuss their proposed wedding. She said a date was set for later that year. However in October or November the appellant contacted her to cancel the wedding. According to Ms Whelan the appellant told her it was because the deceased had told him an unforgivable lie. 

11On 23 March 2004 the deceased contacted a dressmaker, Ms Marlene Erard to make an outfit for her wedding, which she said was planned for 13 April. Ms Erard gave evidence to the effect that the deceased mentioned there were family issues in her family not accepting or liking her fiancée. That same day the deceased visited a general practitioner, Dr Sydney Paul, and requested a contraceptive pill prescription. The deceased subsequently informed Ms Erard the wedding was postponed. 

12In April or May 2004 the appellant's brother (Neil), his (then) wife (Ms Toni Sanderson) and her son visited the appellant in Deniliquin. The appellant told Neil that a woman was harassing him and that he should not answer the door or phone. Ms Sanderson's evidence was that the appellant said a woman called Janet was stalking him. She said she heard the appellant on the phone to the woman and he seemed really pleasant. However when he came off the phone he was the complete opposite, denigrating the woman, saying she was very ugly and filthy rich. She said the appellant told her the woman was so ugly he couldn't bring himself to ""shag her"". Neil gave evidence that he heard the appellant say something like ""She was so ugly you would have to chew your arm off if you woke up next to her"". Neil said he also heard the appellant say something about how he didn't think he could have sex with someone to get a sports car. During that stay at Deniliquin Neil said he suggested the appellant buy an EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) as he was talking about a hobby of riding trail bikes. 

13Mr Colin Sander, a work colleague of the appellant and the deceased, gave evidence. He said that on 25 April 2004, at the ANZAC day horse races in Deniliquin, he went up to the appellant to congratulate him on his engagement to the deceased. He said he had heard about the engagement through general gossip and family members. According to Mr Sander the appellant said that he was not engaged to the deceased, never would be and if she kept on stalking him he would ""put out an AVO on the bitch"". 

14The appellant's superior at work, Mr Robert Crampton, said that whenever the appellant spoke about the deceased it was in a derogatory manner. Mr Crampton said initially the appellant said they were engaged, however subsequently the appellant told him the relationship was finished and from then on he denied vehemently that there was any relationship between him and the deceased. According to Mr Crampton the appellant said to him, on dozens of occasions, from the time the appellant first said the relationship with the deceased was finished to the day he left Deniliquin, that she was ""a fat ugly slut, that she was chasing him, texting him, phoning him, that he was sick of it. He was going to - if she kept it up, take out an AVO against her, kick her up the arse and tell her to ... fuck off"". 

15During the winter of 2004 the appellant telephoned Ms Whelan (the marriage celebrant) stating he and the deceased were intending to be married on 17 September 2004. They were married in Echuca, Victoria on 17 September. No guests were present at the wedding and at the appellant's request Ms Whelan arranged two witnesses to attend the ceremony. The deceased did not tell her family about the wedding.

16Mr Grant gave evidence that on 9 August 2004 the deceased had executed a will leaving her entire estate to her son. However, on 24 September, after her wedding with the appellant, the deceased executed a new will, leaving a legacy of $100,000.00 to her son with the residue of the estate to be divided equally between her son and the appellant. Mr Grant also gave evidence that the deceased asked him to not tell anyone about her marriage. 

17Ms Marshall gave evidence that in September 2004 she became aware that the deceased wanted to sell her Deniliquin house. She said that the deceased and her son moved out of their Deniliquin house and in with one of the deceased's sisters in October 2004. Ms Rourke gave evidence that when she and the deceased were packing up the house in Deniliquin the deceased said the appellant had to leave the night they were packing because his brother was ill and in a coma. Neil was not in a coma in hospital. The deceased also told her that she had received an engagement present from the appellant's parents. She said she had not met them but had spoken to them on the phone. The appellant's parents gave evidence they had never met the deceased or spoken on the phone to her. The appellant's father said he had never sent her a present.

18A real estate agent, Ms Julie Humphries gave evidence that on 15 October 2004 the deceased and the appellant viewed two properties in Otford, one of them located at 49 Station Street, Otford (the Otford residence). The property was purchased for $660,000.00. The deceased paid a holding deposit ($1,660.00), the balance of deposit ($64,350.00 on 8 November), the stamp duty ($25,194.00) and later in February 2005, $50,000.00 to reduce what was owing on the mortgage over the Otford residence. The land was held by the appellant and the deceased as tenants in common. 

19An acquaintance of the deceased, Mr Stanley Drummond, gave evidence that on 14 November 2004 the deceased told him that the appellant had wanted the house to be in his name so that he could claim benefits from the Ambulance Service. However she said she had kept the house in her name. At the end of 2004 the appellant spoke to a friend, Mr John Thompson. The appellant told Mr Thompson he was looking to buy a place in Otford and had found a place that cost around $600,000.00. The appellant told Mr Thompson he could afford it because his parents had helped him purchase it. 

20In late November or early December 2004, the appellant started living at the Otford residence. He commenced work at the Helensburgh Ambulance Station on 18 December. The deceased spent a few days at the Otford residence in December 2004. 

21Neil gave evidence that after Christmas in 2004 he went with Ms Sanderson and her son to the Otford residence. The appellant did not mention a woman named Janet or that he had married. Whilst Neil was visiting the appellant, a Ms Gorica Velicanski stayed at the Otford residence in the appellant's bedroom. The appellant's relationship with Ms Velicanski is discussed in detail below. 

22Evidence was given at trial to the effect that one day while Neil and Ms Sanderson were at the Otford residence a neighbour from next door, Mr Christopher Wilmott, came over. He said to Ms Sanderson and Ms Velicanski words to the effect, ""You must be Des's wife, Janet"" or ""You must be Janet"" or ""One of you ladies must be Janet"". Both ladies denied being Janet. Neither Neil nor Ms Sanderson questioned the appellant about Janet's identity as the former did not want to jeopardise his relationship with his brother. 

23Ms Sanderson said there were three or four occasions when she saw the appellant in close proximity to the edges of cliffs.

24On 28 January 2005 the appellant purchased a two person dome tent and an alpine camper sleeping bag from a K-Mart store in Figtree. The appellant told police after the deceased's death that he initially bought the camping gear with the intention of going camping with Mr Thompson. 

25On 15 February 2005 the deceased visited Dr Paul again and was prescribed a contraceptive pill. 

26On 23 February 2005 the appellant purchased an EPIRB from Dick Smith, Moore Park. The appellant told police after the deceased's death that he took the EPIRB on the day of the deceased's death because when he first moved to Otford he went for a walk along the cliff track along the bottom of the escarpment and thought it was ""really hairy"". The next week he had seen EPIRBs on sale.

27On 28 February 2005 Mr Thompson stayed with the appellant for three days. Mr Thompson gave evidence that the appellant did not mention anything about being married or someone coming to move into the house. They went bushwalking but did not go camping. There was no plan to go camping at anytime. 

28One of the appellant's work colleagues at Helensburgh, Mr Christopher Robbie, said the appellant told him he was married but there were family troubles. The appellant said his wife was going to move up to Otford with him. It was Mr Robbie's impression that the appellant was looking forward to the day she would arrive. Mr Robbie recalled that two weeks before the deceased's death the appellant was excited about her coming up and showing her the area and taking her camping. 

29On 18 March 2005 the deceased moved to the Otford residence. One of the deceased's sisters helped her pack up her belongings in Deniliquin. When they were packing the deceased was putting things into garbage bags. The deceased said to her sister that the appellant had told her it would be easier to carry her things in bags rather than boxes and cases. 

30Mr William Young, a brother-in-law of the deceased, gave evidence that on four or five occasions over a period of two or three months the deceased spoke to him about the National Park. She said going to the National Park was part of her initiation for her new life. She said the appellant had been up in the National Park many times looking for a suitable camping site and it was part of her initiation to go camping. 

31On 22 March 2005 the deceased spoke to a friend, Mr Barry Navin. She said she moved up to Otford on 18 March and that the appellant was talking about taking her camping in the National Park over the Easter period. 

Financial transactions between the appellant and the deceased

32On 1 April 2004 the deceased withdrew $2,500.00 from a Macquarie Investment Account and deposited it into the appellant's National Visa Account. 

33On 7 June 2004 the deceased withdrew $23,000.00 from an investment account and deposited it into the appellant's NAB Flexi Direct Account. She had told her financial advisor that the money was to repay a loan on a property at Castlemaine where the appellant's parents lived. She said the property was in the appellant's name. There was no such property and no such loan. The appellant's parents did not receive the money from the appellant. The funds were used to reduce credit card debts owed by the appellant. 

34Upon the sale of the deceased's house in Deniliquin, the proceeds went directly into the appellant's NAB Flexi Direct Account. The appellant used approximately $25,000.00 of the money to pay his debts. 

35On 22 October 2004 the deceased and the appellant signed a National Bank loan application. The appellant listed his assets as $2,100.00 and a car. The deceased's assets were listed as a home valued at $280,000.00, a $250,000.00 investment account and a car. 

36The Ambulance Service reimbursed $19,333.20 (being the stamp duty paid on the Otford residence) to the appellant on 9 March 2005. Notwithstanding the receipt of this money he did not pay the stamp duty. This money was not passed onto the deceased but rather some of it was used to pay the appellant's debts. 

37On 4 January 2005 the appellant purchased a motorbike and transferred $3,500.00 from his account by way of internet transfer. On the same day there was another internet transfer of $5,000.00. 

38Throughout April and May 2005 the appellant withdrew an amount totalling $70,000.00 from the joint mortgage account held by the appellant and the deceased and placed part of the money in the appellant's bank account or used it to pay off his credit cards.

39The evidence established that the appellant received by way of benefit from his relationship with the deceased, both before and after her death, a monetary amount totalling $325,202.00. This did not include the benefit he would obtain from the sale of the Otford residence and under the deceased's will. It was estimated that if these amounts were included the monetary benefit would total $467,736.00. 

40Ms Rachel Slat, a solicitor specialising in family law gave evidence at the trial. She said that if there had been divorce proceedings in March 2005 the appellant would be expected to receive, through a negotiated settlement or court order, between 0% and 5% of the appellant and deceased's total assets. The evidence was unchallenged.

The appellant's relationship with the deceased's family

41Ms Marshall stated that the first time most of the deceased's family members met the appellant was around March 2004. Within a couple of days of having introduced the appellant, the deceased told her family members that she was engaged. The deceased's family members and friends gave evidence that they confronted the deceased not long after meeting the appellant, when they heard stories about the appellant, to the effect that he was a womaniser and only wanted to marry the deceased for her money. Members of the family had heard rumours about the appellant's earlier treatment of a Ms June Ingham. The appellant's relationship with Ms Ingham is described below. 

42Ms Marshall and Ms Rourke gave evidence that the deceased denied the truth of the rumours and wouldn't listen to what her family was saying. Ms Marshall gave evidence that the deceased was besotted with the appellant. Ms Rourke gave evidence that the deceased told her the appellant didn't need her money as he had his own, had a farm in Bendigo and was going to leave it to her son Stephen, not his daughter from a previous relationship, whom he hated. 

43Members of the deceased's family challenged the deceased again when they heard that the engagement was ""back on again"". This was after having being told by the deceased that the engagement had been called off and it ""wasn't worth it"" because her family did not approve. The deceased's brother gave evidence the deceased told him that the appellant was going to put an AVO out against him if he kept saying things about the appellant. Members of the deceased's family were not told of her marriage to the appellant until around 17 March 2005, a day before the deceased left Deniliquin. 

44The appellant told police after the deceased's death that he thought her family were ""interfering pricks"". He knew that the deceased didn't tell them she was married to him until a month or so before her death. He didn't think he could name half the family members, because he was not interested in them. 

The appellant's relationship with other woman

45In addition to the relationships described below evidence was led at trial that the appellant had been married twice before and had divorced in October 1991 and February 1996. 

(a) Ms Ingham

46From 1997 the appellant had a relationship with Ms Ingham, who the appellant met when working in England. In 1999 and 2000 Ms Ingham visited the appellant in Australia. Mr Crampton gave evidence that in 2000, whilst Ms Ingham was visiting the appellant in Deniliquin, the appellant spoke about her to Mr Crampton in a derogatory way. He said to Mr Crampton that he wished she would go home so he wouldn't have to spend so much on her. 

47The evidence of Ms Ingham was to the following effect.

48Between November 2000 and April 2001 the appellant asked Ms Ingham over the telephone to marry him. 

49In 2001 Ms Ingham received money from a property settlement connected with a previous marriage. Ms Ingham at some stage had discussed with the appellant the amount she was expecting to receive from the property settlement. 

50On 4 April 2001 Ms Ingham was picked up by the appellant from Melbourne airport. She had thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with him. Later that night the appellant became very angry when Ms Ingham told him how much money she had received from the property settlement (approximately £28,000.00). The appellant said it was not as much as she was supposed to get. He called her a ""fucking liar and a slag"". The appellant did not speak to her for the rest of the evening. 

51The next day the appellant drove her from the hotel they had stayed at back to the airport and left her there. Ms Ingham went to a hotel. Later that night the appellant called and apologised to Ms Ingham. He said he would return the next day to Melbourne by bus. The appellant also started talking about how he wanted a sports car. 

52The appellant came back to Melbourne the next day. He and Ms Ingham went to one car dealership, which the appellant had found, and decided to buy a Lotus Esprit. Ms Ingham paid for the sports car using money from her property settlement. It cost $63,000.00. The appellant contributed $5,700.00 by way of credit card to help pay for the car. Ms Ingham told the appellant she would pay him back, which on 4 May 2001 she did. At that time she also paid the appellant an additional $1,100.00. 

53After purchasing the car Ms Ingham went and lived with the appellant in Deniliquin. At some stage the appellant gave her an engagement ring. Whilst Ms Ingham was living with the appellant in Deniliquin the appellant suggested that they sell the car and use the money to buy a house. The appellant said the house would be in his name as she was not a resident of Australia. He made a will out to Ms Ingham so if anything were to happen to him, she would get the house. 

54In May 2001 the appellant told Ms Ingham he had sold the car and had not lost that much money on it. An amount of $50,000.00 was placed in the appellant's bank account. Mr Crampton said he remembered the appellant had a Lotus Esprit sports car. He told Mr Crampton he had sold it for $60,000.00. 

55Ms Ingham found a house which she agreed to buy in June 2001 for $148,500.00. The deposit for the house was paid out of the funds from the sale of the car on 6 June 2001. The appellant received a first home owner's grant totalling $7,000.00. Ms Ingham never received any of the money remaining from the sale proceeds of the car (that was not put towards the house). 

56Ms Ingham lived with the appellant in the house throughout 2001, at times travelling to England to visit friends and family and resolve remaining legal and family affairs. Ms Ingham met the appellant's parents multiple times and also met Mr Thompson. On 27 December 2001 Ms Ingham travelled to England to say goodbye to her family and pack up and send her things over. When in England Ms Ingham packed all her belongings up and shipped them to Australia. Ms Ingham said whilst in England her telephone calls with the appellant got shorter and shorter and he started to not call her back. On 15 February 2002 she received a text message which said, ""I'm sorry, but I am moving to live with ex-wife and Jess. Will sell house and send you money. Post me address for your things to be sent to. Have made up mind to do this."". 

57Ms Ingham subsequently found out from her younger sister still living in Deniliquin that the appellant was selling the house bought with the proceeds from the car. She obtained a solicitor to help recover the money from the sale of the house as the appellant did not respond to her text messages. She sought to recover $40,000.00 from the appellant. The appellant said he was going to post her things back but she did not receive anything save a photo album. Ms Ingham subsequently discovered in her legal proceedings against the appellant that he had sold the house for $150,000.00. There was evidence that out of this sum the appellant received $22,694.99. Ms Ingham settled her proceedings against the appellant for $9,000.00 by way of two payments, one in September 2003 and one in January 2004.

(b) Ms Velicanski

58The evidence of Ms Velicanski was to the following effect.

59In 2003 Ms Velicanski received an email from the appellant on the website ""youdate.com"". Around 10 or 11 September 2003 the appellant went with Ms Velicanski and stayed a couple of nights at Budgewoi. They then travelled to Sydney and spent the evening at the Ibis Hotel at Sydney Airport. They fought, but subsequently the appellant sent a card and teddy bear to Ms Velicanski and asked to continue the friendship. They continued to send regular emails. 

60On 19 December 2003 Ms Velicanski flew to Albury and stayed in Deniliquin with the appellant for two or three days. After that trip they remained in contact and in February 2004 the appellant drove to Budgewoi to stay with Ms Velicanski for approximately two weeks. Both in Deniliquin and in Budgewoi Ms Velicanski had a sexual relationship with the appellant. Following the stay in Budgewoi Ms Velicanski and the appellant had regular contact, speaking on the telephone on a daily basis. The appellant told her he loved her. 

61Between February and April 2004 Ms Velicanski went and saw the appellant in Albury. In April 2004 she went and saw the appellant in Deniliquin. Whilst visiting, the appellant suggested Ms Velicanski meet his parents. Before the end of Ms Velicanski's stay she and the appellant had an argument so she returned to Sydney. 

62Ms Velicanski did not have much contact with the appellant from April 2004 until November 2004. In November 2004 Ms Velicanski received a text message from the appellant asking her to come on a trip with him to Townsville. After this they started communicating again by text message. The appellant told Ms Velicanski he had got a job in, and was moving to, Helensburgh. The appellant visited Ms Velicanski in Budgewoi from 17 to 20 November. Ms Velicanski asked the appellant if he had had any other girlfriends since seeing her in April. The appellant replied ""only one local sheep"". 

63Ms Velicanski next met with the appellant on 20 or 21 December 2004 at a hotel in Darling Harbour. The appellant told her he had bought a house in Otford for $660,000.00 and was going to move into it in February 2005. He did not tell her he was already living at the house. He later asked if she would ""trust him"" and go away with him for a few weeks ""without asking questions"". He later invited Ms Velicanski to come and stay in Otford. 

64Ms Velicanski went to the Otford residence on 29 December 2004. After being asked by a neighbour, Mr Wilmott, if she was Janet, she later asked the appellant who Janet was. He said she was a friend of his who came with her boyfriend to look at the house. 

65Ms Velicanski went to see the appellant in Otford again in February 2005 and on 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and 16 March. In March, whilst Ms Velicanski was at the Otford residence the appellant said that a friend was coming from Tamworth to go camping with him. He said he was then going to do an Ambulance Service course in Goulburn for six weeks, so Ms Velicanski would not be able to contact him. The station officer at Helensburgh Ambulance Station said the appellant was not enrolled to attend any such course during his time stationed at Helensburgh. At no stage did the appellant tell Ms Velicanski anything about a woman named Janet or that he was intending to get, and later had got, married.

(c) Ms Janet Aldred

66The evidence of Ms Aldred was to the following effect.

67Ms Aldred met the appellant in October 2002 on a dating website ""RSVP"" and ""Udate"". The appellant stayed at Ms Aldred's home in Sutherland a couple of weeks later and they had intermittent contact via email and phone. Some time around the end of 2004 Ms Aldred visited the appellant at the Otford residence for two or three days. She also stayed with the appellant for three days either on 15 or 22 March 2005. Whilst staying at the Otford residence Ms Aldred went and collected a parcel from the post office for the appellant. On the back of the parcel it said ""from Janet"". On each occasion she met the appellant they had a sexual relationship. 

(d) Ms Lynda Rodgers 

68In May 2004 Ms Rodgers re-established contact with the appellant, a former boyfriend. The evidence of Ms Rodgers can be summarised as follows. 

69Ms Rodgers visited the appellant in Berrigan a few weeks after first making contact. She stayed the weekend with the appellant and had a sexual relationship with him. The appellant asked her to stay with him and leave her husband. 

70In the June school holidays of 2004, Ms Rodgers visited the appellant at Deniliquin and stayed for four nights. They also met up on 12 August in Melbourne. On that occasion the appellant spent more than a thousand dollars on dinner and drinks. In October they ceased to have contact as the appellant told Ms Rodgers she asked too many questions. They had been emailing and telephoning frequently from May to October.

71On 25 February 2005 Ms Rodgers emailed the appellant. They continued to email each other a couple of times a week until around May or early June. 

The day of the incident

72On the morning of 24 March 2005 the deceased spoke to her mother on the telephone and told her that she and the appellant were going camping about five kilometres from their home. She told her mother, ""... it's a beautiful camping ground. Everybody camps there. It's all set up."" Her mother asked about toilets and she said, ""... It's lovely camping grounds here. Everything is here."" 

73Unless otherwise indicated, the following description of the camping trip was given by the appellant in a recorded interview to police officers early on 25 March 2005. 

74The deceased and the appellant had never been camping together before, although the appellant was experienced in camping from his army days when he was a platoon commander in the parachute battalion. The appellant said it was probably more his idea than the deceased's to go camping that day. 

75According to the appellant they had spoken about going camping for a long time; however the decision to go camping was made on that day because the weather was good. According to the appellant the deceased had an allergy tablet before they went camping. The appellant did not take a mobile because he rarely had service in Otford, let alone in the National Park. A Royal National Park ranger, Mr William Sullivan, gave evidence at trial that there was mobile telephone reception from most providers about 100 metres south of where the appellant and the deceased had camped. Detective Sergeant Spago also gave evidence that she had been to the site where the deceased and the appellant camped on more than eight occasions and she had not had any difficulty getting coverage from her service provider, Optus, including on 25 March 2005.

76The appellant said he and the deceased drove to the Otford lookout car park. Mr Wilmott saw them leave the Otford residence around 11 am. The appellant had told Mr Wilmott, when asked, that they were camping around ""Burning Palms"". 

77Upon arrival at the car park around 12-12.30 pm they walked from the Otford lookout along the cliff top track until they came to the junction with the coastal track. They followed the coastal track down through the ""Palm Jungle"" until they came to the general vicinity of the ""Figure Eight Pool"". 

78The deceased was complaining all the time about being tired and her pack being heavy so they stopped at around 2 pm and set up their tent near some small trees, where there wasn't too much grass and a small clearing. The ground was rough and according to the appellant very difficult to walk on, with thick plants everywhere. The appellant dug out a rock and set the tent up with the deceased. The tent was about 15 metres from the edge of the cliff with the door of the tent facing the cliff. The appellant said he ""never even thought twice"" about the tent and its proximity to the cliff edge. The appellant said he was not familiar with the location where they camped above the ""Figure Eight Pool"".

79Mr Sullivan gave evidence that he had never seen anyone else camp at the site where the appellant and the deceased camped and that it was not a designated area for camping. At that time there were camping areas at North Era Beach, Uloola Falls and at a trial location at what is now known as Wattamolla. There were signs at the Otford Lookout and along the track saying ""no camping"" and advising a camping permit was needed. The appellant did not apply for or have a camping permit. Mr Sullivan said that there were reasons why people would not want to camp where the appellant and the deceased camped; namely, the distance from the walking track to the location was difficult because of the nature of the vegetation, the slope of the site would have been uncomfortable to sleep on, there was very little area devoid of vegetation to set up a tent and it was close to the edge of the cliff. Mr Sullivan said the vegetation growing in that area, Lomandra, had sharp points. Mr Sullivan said that the closest camping site was at North Era Beach which would take a minimum of 45 minutes for an average person to walk from the site at which the appellant and the deceased camped. Mr Sullivan said there were toilets at ""Burning Palms"" in 2005. 

80At the campsite the appellant and the deceased ate food, drank tea and coffee, had a small amount of Baileys and lay around the tent. They only noticed it was windy when they were in the tent and saw the top of the tent moving a little bit. The appellant said they were both in good spirits. 

81According to the appellant after sunset, or 7 pm, as it was getting dark, the deceased left the tent saying she needed to go to the toilet. She did not take a torch with her and despite having toilet paper did not appear to take any, none being found around the area. There were no signs of anybody having gone to the toilet in the area when it was examined on 25 March 2005. The appellant told her not to go ""down that way"" as he had been to the toilet there himself earlier on. The appellant said about 15 seconds later he heard a sound like ""ooh"" or a loud sigh. The appellant said he yelled out something like, ""what the fuck have you done?"" and the deceased did not reply. 

82The appellant said he then went outside the tent and looked around. He could not see the deceased anywhere. When first speaking to police at the St George Hospital he said he looked over the edge and could not see her at the bottom. In the interview on 25 March however the appellant said he tried to get close to the edge to look over at several spots but he could not go really close because he was ""a bit touchy about big drops"" and climbing ""real high ladders"". 

83The appellant said he became concerned the deceased had gone over the edge, so he got his backpack from the tent and ran along the coastline. He grabbed his backpack because he thought he would need the space blanket in it and he thought there were bandages in there, which there were not. He did not know whether the deceased was over the edge, down the track or hurt. 

84At this point the appellant said it was not totally dark and it was light enough so you wouldn't walk into a tree. One of the appellant's neighbours, Ms Judith McGrath, gave evidence that it was an extremely bright night from a full moon. Expert evidence established at trial that 96% of the moon was visible on 24 March, it rose at 6.25 pm and the sun set at 7.02 pm. Civil sunset (beyond which point artificial lighting is needed) was 7.27 pm. 

85There were two gullies north of the campsite. The first could not be descended due to a 10 metre vertical drop. The appellant ran along the coastline and at the second gully got to a creek. He climbed down this, using a rope (later measured to be 8.32 metres in length) to descend the last bit of the slope that was about 10 metres to the bottom. The appellant then said he went back along the beach towards their campsite.

86The appellant found the deceased at the bottom of the cliff (adjacent to their campsite). She was in a sitting position further out from the bottom of the cliff than where the appellant thought a person would be. A lot of blood splatter was subsequently observed on the rocks a number of metres from the deceased towards the cliff face. The appellant pulled the deceased's body up onto a flat rock and checked her pulse. He performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation but he knew she was dead. She was bleeding from the head and one eye was closed. 

87The appellant described a huge swell which he said meant he had to drag the deceased onto higher rocks so she wouldn't be swept away. He said she was ""pretty heavy"" and it was ""very difficult"". He put his jacket over her and set off his EPIRB some time before 8 pm. The EPIRB was first detected by a satellite beacon between 7.25 and 7.35 pm. The appellant recalled that the moon was up. He said at the time he did not know how long he should wait or whether he should run back to Otford to get help.

88A partial footprint (matching the deceased's shoes, probably her right shoe) was subsequently identified just over the edge of the cliff where the slope of the ground was 25.64 degrees. There were small tea-trees and a number of their branches were freshly broken off. The broken branches were at a height of 1.435 metres and 1.480 metres, around chest height on an average person. Blood or human tissue was found at several points down the cliff. The evidence at trial indicated the shoelaces on the right shoe of the deceased were undone.

The rescue operation 

89A rescue helicopter was dispatched and arrived just before 10 pm at the location in Otford. According to a paramedic on the helicopter the conditions were quite good; clear, cool with a minor breeze. The moon was up and there was good visibility. 

90The paramedic was winched down the helicopter onto the rock platform. He saw an EPIRB in a shoe on a rock fairly high up out of any water. He saw another shoe in a crevice. The deceased was face down winched between some rocks, in amongst the waves so the paramedic could not attempt a retrieval. The appellant was standing on a rock a number of feet back. 

91The paramedic moved the appellant 25 metres back to be safe from the waves. He had a conversation with the appellant in which the appellant said it was his fault as he had brought the deceased away camping for the weekend and now she was dead. The paramedic asked the appellant if he had moved the deceased, to which he replied ""no"". The appellant appeared to be somewhat confused, very nervous, shaking, severely distressed, nauseated and dry reaching. He was not injured. The paramedic gave evidence that the appellant's clothes were dry, not wet. 

92The appellant was winched up to the helicopter and flown to St George Hospital at Kogarah, arriving at 11.05 pm. During the helicopter flight the appellant did not say much. On arrival the appellant looked like he was in shock, he was quiet, staring off and teary at times. 

93At St George Hospital two nurses noted the appellant was wet from the knees down. Whilst being examined by a nurse the appellant said ""We have only been married for six months"". He then placed his head in his hands and sobbed. He said he did not have any next of kin. 

94The deceased's body was subsequently retrieved by a second helicopter operation. When the appellant formally identified the deceased he began crying loudly and hugged her for about 30 seconds. 

95The appellant had a recorded interview with the police on 25 March 2005. At the end of the interview the appellant said, ""You know, I feel as though I'm doing, I feel as though I'm doing her a great disservice when I can't show the, can't show my emotions, like I want to, when, you know, but I just, I don't, I can't find it in myself now at this stage to have anything just waffling forget it."" 

The post mortem

96A post mortem examination of the deceased was conducted at 9.30 am on 26 March 2005. The autopsy report stated that the cause of death was multiple injuries, with significant injuries to the head, trunk and limbs. A pathologist specialising in neuropathology found the deceased's brain had sustained injury due to trauma. Bruising on the deceased's right upper arm and left upper arm was consistent with either the fall itself or being vigorously held. There was no significant natural disease. There was a blood alcohol level of 0.02. There was no other detection of common drugs that would cause impairment. 

97A clinical forensic pharmacologist, Dr Judith Perl, gave evidence. She said that, due to the possibilities of contamination and given the results of other samples taken from fluid in the deceased's vitreous humor, on the balance of probabilities there was no alcohol in the deceased's body at the time of her death. Dr Perl gave evidence that even if she had a blood alcohol level of 0.02 there would not have been any measurable level of impairment in terms of co-ordination, steadiness on the person's feet or normal psychomotor functions. Dr Perl did not expect an anti-histamine tablet to have had an impairing effect upon the deceased to any significant degree. 

98A scientific officer working for the Police Forensic Services Group examined the deceased's clothing and concluded that the jeans and belt worn by the deceased were done up when the damage to the clothes occurred. 

After the incident

99On 26 March 2005 the appellant sent text messages to Ms Velicanski at 5.11 pm and 5.38 pm. 

100On 27 March 2005 a senior ambulance chaplain, Reverend Ray Green visited the appellant. The appellant appeared traumatised and confused. His responses to questions relating to the funeral arrangements were incoherent and he made no definite decisions. The appellant was agreeable, upon Reverend Green's suggestion, for him to contact the deceased's family. Reverend Green contacted the deceased's son and subsequently was contacted to be told the deceased's family would be claming custody of the body. That same night at 8.20 pm a call was made from the deceased's mobile to vote on the show ""X Factor"".

101On 28 March 2005 Mr Grant, acting on behalf of the deceased's son who was executor of the deceased's estate, applied to the State Coroner's Office for a release of the deceased's body on the directions of the executor. The appellant withdrew his claim to not release the body. The appellant's superintendent, Louise Hennessy, visited the appellant and arranged that he would not have to return to work until 14 April, as opposed to 6 April as was on his original roster. Ms Hennessy observed the appellant appeared sad, with redness around his eyes, was constantly wiping his noes and at one stage was crying. 

102On 29 March 2005 the appellant went to a Harvey World Travel store and inquired about brochures on Asian destinations. The appellant then inquired about travelling to Townsville. He said he wanted to travel from 1 April to 6 April and there would be two people travelling, himself and his wife. When asked for the names of the people travelling the appellant gave Ms Velicanski's name. The appellant proceeded to pay for the trip to Townsville.

103Ms Velicanski confirmed she received a phone call from the appellant on 29 March 2005 asking if she had a passport and whether she would go overseas with him for a holiday. Ms Velicanski said she could not go away because of work commitments but could leave from 1 April to 6 April. 

104On 31 March 2005 Mr Grant received a letter by fax from solicitors acting for the appellant, requesting a copy of the will of the deceased. The same day Neil came and stayed at the Otford residence. Neil had found out about the deceased's death when he received messages of condolence on his phone, which used to belong to the appellant. After reading the messages he went on the internet and found out about the deceased's death. He went to see the appellant to provide support. 

105Neil gave evidence that when he saw the appellant on 31 March 2005 he was ""obviously very, very drunk"". He was mixing extremely strong drinks, had bloodshot eyes and kept going into silences. Neil had never seen the appellant like that. 

106On 1 April 2005 the appellant and Ms Velicanski went away to Townsville. Neil stayed at the Otford residence. Neil's evidence was that before the appellant left the Otford residence he suggested Neil use his RSVP account while he was away. However Neil said although he tried to use the account it didn't work and after that attempt he did not communicate with anyone on that account. 

107Ms Velicanski gave evidence that in Townsville she and the appellant went to bars, restaurants, the beach, on car trips and to lookouts. They had a sexual relationship during this time. However they had a fight on 4 April and the appellant packed his bags and left. 

108On 5 April 2005 the appellant made a payment to the dating site RSVP in order to communicate with other profiles on RSVP. On 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 April the appellant's RSVP account communicated with several other RSVP accounts.

109The appellant did not attend the deceased's funeral which took place on 6 April 2005. 

110On 10 April 2005 Ms Velicanski gave evidence that she went to the appellant's house in Otford to drop off presents she had bought him in Townsville. The appellant told her he had a singles party that night but to wait for her at the house. When he arrived at the Otford residence that night he proposed to her and asked her to move in to the Otford residence with him. Ms Velicanski stayed for some weeks at the Otford residence. She saw no female clothes or toiletries or any sign that anybody else had recently lived there. She once discovered a rates notice with the names ""Des and Janet Campbell"" as well as a wedding card. The appellant found her reading the card and became very angry and yelled at her. However the appellant convinced her he was not married. At some stage the appellant told her that if the police ever contacted her she should deny knowing him. 

111Within two weeks of the deceased's death one of the appellant's neighbours, Ms McGrath, saw the appellant burning something in his backyard.

112On 20 April 2005 the appellant signed an agreement for a real estate agent to sell the Otford residence. 

113During the four week period after the death of the deceased the appellant made 12 phone calls and 54 text messages to Ms Velicanski, 30 text messages to Ms Rodgers and 3 text messages to Ms Aldred. One of the text messages to Ms Velicanski was in response to a text message from her inquiring about the camping trip. He responded he did not go because it was too wet.

114In May Ms Velicanski terminated her relationship with the appellant. In mid-May Ms Rodgers met with the appellant and spent two nights at the Airport Hilton with him. Ms Rodgers gave evidence that the appellant never mentioned Janet, a wife, buying a house in Otford or someone close to him having died. 

115The appellant did not contact any members of the deceased's family. However Ms Marshall gave evidence that over the following few months they attempted to contact the appellant to obtain the deceased's personal property. They tried ringing the appellant, however if he answered the phone, when the family identified themselves he would hang up. The family eventually faxed the appellant sometime in June 2005 saying they were coming to Otford in person. 

116Ms Marshall gave evidence that on 1 July 2005 members of the deceased's family arrived at the Otford residence around 5.00 pm to 5.30 pm. The appellant locked the doors and closed the curtains and drapes. The appellant said he would contact the police if they did not leave his property. When the police came the deceased's family obtained her car. Subsequently they collected a small box of items from the appellant's solicitors. 

117Mr Thompson gave evidence that in July 2005 he visited the appellant at the Otford residence and went to the Otford lookout. The appellant did not mention having been married or his wife having died.

118On 31 August 2005 the appellant's home was searched. After searching through the photographs on his computer, no photograph of the deceased could be found. There were photographs of Neil, Ms Sanderson and her son, Ms Velicanski and of the appellant's then fiancé (and future wife), Melissa.

119The appellant's parents learnt of the deceased's death when the appellant telephoned and said something to the effect that the love of his life, that he was going to live with for the rest of his life, had been killed. The appellant did not say he was already married to the deceased. 

Expert evidence led at the trial 

(a) Associate Professor Rodney Cross

120Associate Professor Cross gave evidence that he was an honorary member of the Physics Department at Sydney University, holding this position since 2004. He said he had conducted a lot of research into plasma physics and the physics of sport. He said he had been involved in consulting work involving fatal falls from balconies and cliffs and had published extensively on the physics of sport. Associate Professor Cross said he considered himself a ""pretty good"" biomechanic but was not particularly familiar with the medical terminology of biomechanics, more the mechanic aspect of it. 

121Associate Professor Cross gave evidence that standing on a 26 degree slope was like standing on a tiled roof. He said if someone was standing facing the edge of the roof they would feel slightly unbalanced. He distinguished it from the slope on a travelator at shopping centres which has a maximum allowed incline of around 12 degrees. 

122Taking into account the partial shoe print and broken branches Associate Professor Cross considered the deceased was upright as she went over the cliff, as opposed to crouched or rolling.

123Associate Professor Cross considered a range of scenarios as to how the partial shoe print could have been left. In a scenario where the deceased was standing, looking at the view, Associate Professor Cross considered she would be in an unstable and uncomfortable position. This was particularly the case if she was standing on just one foot, as indicated by the one foot print. In a suicide scenario, Associate Professor Cross said it was physically possible for the deceased to step down onto the slope and to jump off in a suicide attempt, except for the fact there were branches directly in front of her. He also said it was physically possible the shoe print was left from a scenario where the deceased was doing a cartwheel. However, he added that most people cannot cartwheel. Associate Professor Cross said it was not physically possible that the shoe print was caused in circumstances where the deceased was sitting on a rock and put one foot down, as the rock in question was too far away from the shoe print. Associate Professor Cross said he would have expected to see slip and slide marks on the ground if she had been slipping or sliding. 

124Associate Professor Cross also considered a scenario involving the deceased tripping. There were two rocks approximately one metre from the partial shoe print. They were both 50 millimetres above the rest. One of the rocks was on a boundary between a 16 degree and 26 degree slope. 

125Associate Professor Cross said the partial shoe print could have been caused if the deceased was walking at a brisk or medium walking pace, tripped on one of the rocks and then stepped on the soil a metre beyond. Associate Professor Cross agreed the degree of the slope on which the person was walking would have a small effect on the distance over which a person could recover their balance or the pace at which a person would have to be moving to end up stepping on soil a metre beyond the trip point. He said he could perform experiments to quantify the effect but had not yet done such experiments. 

126Associate Professor Cross considered the deceased would have tripped on the rock that was closest to the shoe print. Associate Professor Cross said walking at a medium to fast pace in the vicinity of either of the rocks, close to the cliff would be perilous or dangerous. Associate Professor Cross said the shoe print was inconsistent with tripping on a shoelace. However he conceded in cross-examination that it was possible for a person who trips on their shoelace to regain their balance even momentarily, depending on how firmly they stepped on the shoelace. 

127In dealing with a scenario where the deceased was pushed, Associate Professor Cross said he considered the partial shoe print was more likely to be the second or third step of the deceased, rather than the first step she would take to recover from the push. Associate Professor Cross said the partial shoe print could in that way be consistent with the deceased being vigorously held by the arms by a person who ran a few steps towards the edge with her and then pushed her. 

128In cross-examination Associate Professor Cross was asked whether he was familiar with the position of the foot when it was in a state of plantarflexion. He stated this was a biomechanical term and he was not particularly familiar with the medical terminology of biomechanics, although he was familiar with the mechanical side. 

129Associate Professor Cross also agreed in cross-examination that a person who slips on a shoelace does not necessarily fall flat on his or her face but said it was the most likely outcome. He also agreed that a person's ability to regain his or her balance from a trip depended on a lot of variables. These included the person's reflexes, their physical condition at the time (such as whether they were suffering stiffness or soreness), whether they were fatigued or relaxed in terms of their concentration and the evenness or unevenness of the terrain. 

130Associate Professor Cross agreed a fit athlete would recover more quickly than an unfit, non-athletic person. He also agreed that the partial shoe print was consistent with a person standing at least slightly forward, although he said it was also consistent with other possibilities. He agreed that a person walking at a moderate walking pace who was ""ankle-tapped"" could take further steps in an attempt to recover from the trip before falling to the ground. Similarly a person tripping on a shoelace, over a rock or some Spinifex could have the same reaction. 

131Associate Professor Cross was subsequently called for further examination. By that time he had been provided with Mr Beck's report. He agreed that the two most likely scenarios were that the deceased was tripped as she was walking towards the edge of the cliff or that she was pushed. 

132However, he disagreed with Mr Beck's opinion to the extent it suggested it was more likely the deceased tripped. Associate Professor Cross considered the fact that the partial shoe print was of a toe print was the predominant reason Mr Beck came to the conclusion a trip was more likely than a push. He was of the opinion that such a fact was not decisive because the sole reason there was only a toe print may have been because the soil conditions simply prevented a heel print (or complete foot print) from being created. 

(b) David Beck

133David Beck gave evidence at trial that he was a qualified mechanical engineer and biomedical engineer. He said the field of Biomedical Engineering was the application of the anatomy and physiology of the human body to a specific field of engineering, in his case, the mechanics of the human body in terms of its movement and reactions. 

134Mr Beck said based on the partial shoe print the foot was in plantarflexion, which he likened to a woman walking in high heels. Mr Beck was of the opinion that when the shoe print was made the deceased's body was slightly, to well, forward. 

135In cross-examination Mr Beck considered it unlikely the reason the partial shoe print was a toe print was because of the soil conditions. This was because he had inspected the soil and said it was very soft and that people usually apply more pressure to their heel than to their toe. He said notwithstanding twigs and debris there still should have been some imprint of the heel on the soil. However he conceded he did not realise the significance of some tufts of grass near the partial shoe print which could have impeded the formation of a complete shoe print. 

136Mr Beck gave evidence that he would rule out the scenario of the deceased having slipped. He said the evidence was equally consistent with the deceased having been pushed or having tripped. 

137With respect to the tripping scenario, Mr Beck identified numerous trip points, one being 1.5 metres from the cliff edge. However he did note there were other trip points such as Spinifex and rocks that were in a three metre radius of the cliff.

138Mr Beck gave evidence that the ability, speed and distance at which a person was able to recover from a trip was affected by where in the ""swing"" of a person's foot they tripped, the age of the person, stiffness or fatigue in the person, their fitness and weight and the decline of the terrain. He said that males generally recover from trips faster and are less likely to fall to the ground and injure themselves than females. Mr Beck considered the reaction time was somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4 seconds. 

139Mr Beck said that taking the trip point as 1.5 metres from the cliff, on an incline of 14.9 degrees, he conservatively estimated it would take a woman of the age and weight of the deceased 4.7 metres to recover from a trip. This was if the trip occurred at the most conservative part of the swing in the person's foot, namely a trip mid swing. He estimated if the slope was 17 degrees it might take her 5 metres and on a 26 degree slope 7 metres to recover from the trip. 

140Mr Beck considered it would not have an effect on his estimations if he were to assume that the deceased was of reasonable fitness as the trip points were so close to the cliff edge that even if she was fitter she still wouldn't have been able to recover in time to avoid a fall. In cross-examination Mr Beck clarified his estimations were based on a study which showed the recovery time of young active men in their 20s tripping when walking at a pace of 1.1 metres per second (or 4 kilometres per hour). Mr Beck used this study and then made allowances for the deceased's gender and age to generate his estimates. He said the deceased would have been walking a bit slower than four kilometres per hour.

141Mr Beck also gave evidence that the ability of a person's vision to distinguish colours diminishes during twilight hours or as light diminishes. 

The Crown case and the directions to the jury

142To understand the submissions on Grounds 1 and 3, it is necessary to say something about the manner in which the Crown sought to prove its case and the directions given by the trial judge to the jury.

143In opening the Crown put its case as follows:

""Now, ladies and gentlemen, so far as the law is concerned and the charge that the accused is facing in this particular trial is very, very simple and straightforward.

The elements of a charge of murder are, firstly, a death. In this case the death is the death of Janet Campbell, the accused's wife. There will be no dispute that the death occurred.

The second element is that the death must be occasioned by an act of the accused. There must be some act of the accused which caused the death. 

That is very much in issue in this trial.

Thirdly, the accused must have performed that act intending to cause the death of the deceased, as we call the person who has died. In this case, also, that is very much in issue. The real issue in this case is: Did Janet Campbell die by virtue of a tragic accident or, alternatively, has the Crown proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she died because she was pushed over a cliff deliberately by the accused?

If she was pushed over the cliff deliberately by the accused, I don't think anybody would suggest that he had anything other than an intention to kill her. The cliff, over which she went, was something like 50 metres high. Anybody pushing another human being over a cliff of that height must intend to kill that other person. 
...

Ladies and gentlemen, when Janet Campbell went over the cliff, she left a partial impression of a single shoe print in the steep area right next to the steep drop and right next to this partial shoe impression, the police found the two branches from that tree just to her left had been recently broken off at about chest height.

When the shoe print was found by the police, they took a plaster cast of it and that plaster cast was later compared with Janet's shoes and you will hear expert evidence that it is consistent with being part of the front portion of either the left or right shoe print with her feet facing forwards.

If you look at this photograph in your folders, Detective Moon is actually standing in the 48-degree slope and his hand is at the base of the 26-degree slope to next [sic] the base of that tree and he is pointing out, as I understand it, in that photograph where the partial shoe impression was found. When we go to the scene, there will be something in the ground to mark where that shoe impression was found and Detective Moon will be there, harnessed like you will be not down there, but actually at the top just where this rock is. He'll then take you up to the edge where this piece of rock is (indicated), so you can see over where the shoe print was and you will see the broken branches at about chest height.

The Crown case is that, to have caused a clear, unsmudged shoe print in that section of the steep cliff edge, Janet must have gone over the cliff in an upright position, facing forwards. If she had somehow, inexplicably not known where the cliff was and put a foot in that section, she would have slipped, slided, there'd be slide marks, there would not be a clear - when I say 'clear', a defined shoe print. The defined shoe print occurred, the Crown says, because somehow - we don't know how - the accused got her to stand near the edge of the cliff and forcefully pushed her over and she, unexpectedly, going towards the cliff, naturally puts her foot in front of her, goes down, makes the shoe impression and of course she can't stop herself, she grabs the only thing which is there, which is that tree, breaks it off and then goes over the cliff. If she had slipped, it would have been quite different.
...

Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the period after Janet's death. And the Crown case is that the accused was totally and utterly unaffected by the death of his new wife.

The Crown case is that that is because it was not an unexpected death, it was not a tragic accident, but, rather, it was the result of his long-term plan.""

144The Crown case as opened thus postulated two scenarios. Either the appellant pushed the deceased over the cliff or she slipped and fell in a tragic accident.

145Prior to the closing addresses, the following exchange occurred between the trial judge and counsel:

""HER HONOUR: Up until now, the parties have almost entirely concentrated on whether it was a push or a trip. It occurred to me that it is, consistent with the facts, if the jury accepted the facts - and, at this stage, they seem to be uncontradicted in terms of the features of the site and things of that nature, the lightning conditions and things of that nature - it seems to me to be open for the jury to find that the accused may well have either pushed or held Ms Campbell or Ms Fisicaro roughly by the arms and propelled her towards the cliff and then she tripped in the momentum that was initiated by the accused and fell over the cliff, in other words, I don't see that a push and a trip is necessarily inconsistent with the facts, nor do I think that it is inconsistent with the Crown case and likely to form murder.

Does anyone want to say anything about that? I am just raising it because I don't want it to come up later on and then the parties are caught unawares.

HUGHES: Your Honour, I have to say if that scenario was entertained, that is still consistent with being a push and it is still pushing, he would still be liable for murder, if as a consequence of that, she tripped, that was the intention as to the end result.

HER HONOUR: That's right. All I wanted to say was I don't think that they are mutually exclusive.

HUGHES: No, that's my position. I think your Honour is quite right.

HER HONOUR: Do you want to say anything about it, Mr. Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, I agree.""

146The Crown Prosecutor in his closing address did not refer to this possibility but maintained the case that the appellant deliberately pushed the deceased over the edge. He did not embrace an alternative submission; namely, that the jury could find that the appellant pushed the deceased towards the cliff resulting in her tripping and falling over the edge, consequently giving rise to liability on the basis of reckless indifference to human life.

147In her directions to the jury, the trial judge gave the following directions (the subparagraph references have been inserted by me for ease of reference):

""(a) The accused maintained in his record of interview that he did not see what happened. You cannot speculate why Mrs Campbell was in close proximity to the cliff edge, but we know that she was there. We know that she was afraid of heights, we know that she was not an athletic person, we know that she was unfamiliar with bush terrain; we know that she was not affected by alcohol, although she was an inexperienced drinker, we know her jeans have not been undone, we know that there was enough light so that she could see the cliff edge and the vegetation and the general nature of the terrain. We know that she was close enough to the cliff edge so that she could be pushed over the edge or close enough, so that if she tripped, while facing down the slope, she was unable to recover her balance and she fell over the edge; or she was close enough so that a firm push towards the edge, followed by a trip, propelled her over the edge where her shoe impression was found. We know that she tried to save herself by grasping a nearby branch of a tree and that it broke in the attempt.

You will appreciate that counsel in this trial have concentrated on one of two scenarios: Either Mrs Campbell was pushed; or she tripped. But I just want to remind you that they are not mutually exclusive. Even if the accused pushed Mrs Campbell towards the edge of the cliff so forcefully that she tripped as she was propelled forward and then was unable to recover her balance before going over the edge, that would nonetheless meet the legal requirements of murder, because the accused's act in pushing Mrs Campbell is a substantially contributing cause of her death.(Summing Up 10/05/2010 pg 8-9)
...

(b) Now, I am going to outline to you the ingredients of the charge of murder.

The crime of murder has been committed by the accused if the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt each of the following: Firstly, that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased; secondly, that the act causing death was done with an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her which is simply another expression for really serious physical injury; or with reckless indifference to human life.

Just in relation to that last phrase, reckless indifference to human life, an act is done with reckless indifference to human life if the accused foresaw or realised that his act would probably cause the death of the deceased, but he continued with that act regardless of the risk of death.

Now, these two ingredients or elements if you like, namely that it was the deliberate act of the accused and that the deliberate act was done with the particular intention or with reckless indifference to human life, they are the two elements that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt before you could return a verdict of guilty against the accused.

May I suggest that the real area of dispute is concerned with the first element, namely: Was it the accused's deliberate act that caused Mrs Campbell to fall from the cliff to her death; or was it nothing more than a tragic accident?

It has not been suggested that, if someone deliberately pushes another person from a 50-metre cliff onto a rock platform below, that such an act, deliberate act, would not be done with the intention to kill or to at least cause very serious injury. That is not a proposition that could be seriously argued by anyone. Similarly, a deliberate push towards the edge of such a cliff would demonstrate very considerable reckless indifference to human life.

So, may I suggest to you that, if you were to find that the accused did deliberately push her from the cliff, there could really be no serious dispute about what his intention was at the time given the nature of the height of the cliff and the terrain below. (Summing Up 10/05/2010 pp 18-19)

...

(c) In some cases a person's acts may themselves provide the most convincing evidence of his intention at the time. Where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person's act and where the person deliberately does that act, you may readily conclude that he did that act with the intention of achieving that particular result.

Now, that is, in effect, what the Crown argues here. The Crown says you would find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally pushed Mrs Campbell or held her firmly from behind and steered her to the edge of the cliff; that she reached what has been called 'the point of no return' and he did that with the intention of killing her; the Crown asks you to infer or to conclude that the height of the cliff and the nature of the surface onto which she fell demonstrated that the accused intended that she would be killed or, at the very least, very seriously injured.
(Summing Up 10/05/2010 pp 20)

(d) The third state of mind which is the basis of murder is referred to, in legal terms, as 'reckless indifference to human life'. So if, at the time the accused committed the act that caused the death of the deceased, he foresaw or realised that his act would probably cause the death of the deceased, that he continued to commit that act regardless of that consequence, then the accused would be guilty of murder.

What is at the nub of this mental state is that the accused must contemplate or foresee that death was a probable consequence or likely result of what he was doing. If he did come to that realisation, but determined to go on and commit the act, regardless of the likelihood of death resulting and death does in fact result, then he is guilty of murder.

The conduct of a person who does an act that he knows or foresees is likely to cause death is regarded, for the purposes of the criminal law, to be just as blameworthy as a person who acts with an intention to cause death.

For this basis of murder, the accused's actual awareness of the likelihood of death occurring must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is not enough that he believed only that really serious bodily harm might result, or that he merely thought that there was a possibility of death. Nothing less than a full realisation on the part of the accused that death was a probable consequence or the likely result of his conduct is sufficient to establish murder in this way.

Again, you are concerned with the state of mind that the accused had at the time he committed the act causing death. It is for you to determine what the act causing death is and, in the context of the Crown case, the Crown has alleged it is the accused deliberately pushing Mrs Campbell from the edge of the cliff.

May I remind you, of course, there is no direct evidence of what the accused's state of mind was, such as a confession or statement made at the time, but, of course, to state the obvious: The accused has always denied playing any part in his wife's death.""(Summing Up 10/05/2010 pp 20-21)

148With that background it is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal relied upon.

Ground 1

""A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the Trial Judge advancing, for the first time in the summing up, a second and alternative scenario, which was not relied upon by the Prosecution, which amounted to liability for murder, namely reckless indifference to human life.""

The submissions of the parties

(a) The appellant

149The appellant submitted that it was the trial judge who introduced for the first time the hypothesis that the appellant, acting with reckless indifference to human life, pushed the deceased who tripped and fell over the edge of the cliff.

150The appellant submitted that the defence was deprived of an opportunity to respond to this alternative basis of liability and had conducted its case in a manner aimed at undermining the Crown case as opened and advanced at the trial. The appellant in his written submissions did not indicate in what fashion the trial would have been conducted differently.

151The appellant also submitted that the irredeemable prejudice which occurred was that ""it entirely undermined the forensic mileage the defence had made in cross-examination"". He submitted that it was the Crown case that the appellant somehow managed to get the deceased to stand near the edge of the cliff and pushed her over to her death. He submitted the Crown case on this basis was open to the exclusion of accident. This was because the ""unsmudged"" footprint was consistent with the deceased having been upright and facing forward at the time the print was left, which in the Crown case was inconsistent with a trip or a slip.

152The forensic mileage that the appellant was referring to in that context, was the concession by Associate Professor Cross that one of the two most likely scenarios was that the deceased tripped as she was walking towards the edge of the cliff. The appellant submitted that the introduction of the scenario of a push with reckless indifference to human life followed by a trip and a fall, undermined this evidence and the evidence of the appellant's own expert, Mr Beck, who stated that the possibility of a trip or a push were equally consistent.

153In particular, the appellant contended that the defence case ""neutralised the evidential significance of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross in cross-examination"". He referred to the following concessions which he said were made by Associate Professor Cross:

""He was not a biomechanic, however the witness classified himself as 'a pretty good biomechanic, but on the mechanics side of biomechanics'.

A person who trips on a shoe lace does not necessarily fall flat on their face.

The ability to recover from a trip was affected by many variables.

The print was confined to the toe area of the foot, which was not confined to the deceased being in a stationary position at the time it was laid down.

The most likely scenarios were that the deceased tripped as she was walking towards the edge of the cliff or that she was pushed, albeit that he did not prefer a trip because a trip required [a] moderate pace about which he gave evidence in the demonstration before the jury.""
(References omitted).

154He contended the unchallenged evidence of Mr Beck was that a push or a trip were equally consistent. He said that this evidence was also undermined by the alternative scenario put by the trial judge.

155In making this submission the appellant relied on what was said by this Court in Reg v Solomon [1980] 1 NSWLR 321, where it was held that a trial miscarried by reason of the introduction by the trial judge of reckless indifference to human life as a basis for a finding of guilt of murder. He also referred to the summary of the relevant legal principles by Johnson J in Robinson v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 192; (2006) 162 A Crim R 88.

156The appellant summarised the prejudice as follows:

""that the intervention of the trial judge firstly urged upon the jury a particular mode of thought and one that was, if the jury came to a certain view, incontrovertible evidence of guilt;

this mode of thought appeared to have a logic invited upon the jury by the trial judge giving it the weight of a judicial imprimatur;

it was a logic which was not the subject of defence address or evidential attack during the course of the trial;

the speculative hypothesis was not based on any evidence;

in the absence of any assistance as to unlawful and dangerous act the jury could only have understood as a matter of inexorable logic that if satisfied of the speculative basis for the push the appellant was guilty of murder.""

157At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant submitted that it was entirely speculative for the trial judge to leave to the jury the factual scenario from which it could be concluded that the appellant acted with reckless indifference to the life of the deceased. She submitted that the evidence of tendency and motive which was adduced was capable of proving an intent to kill but not capable of establishing a push with reckless indifference to the life of the deceased.

158Counsel for the appellant accepted that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) (the Rules) applied and that it was necessary for her to demonstrate procedural or substantive unfairness. She emphasised the unfairness which resulted from the fact that counsel had no opportunity to respond to the direction.

159Counsel for the appellant submitted that in the circumstances of this case, particularly in light of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross, the only way the jury could have found the appellant guilty was if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had intent to kill. She submitted that the alternative, suggested in the direction of the trial judge, did not address the evidence which either supported or tended against the conclusion of reckless indifference to human life.

160Counsel for the appellant submitted that having regard to the manner in which the case was conducted, the alternatives were that the deceased was either deliberately pushed over the cliff or it was an accident. She submitted that the scenario of a push and a trip was not supported by the objective evidence. She submitted that the factual scenario of a push followed by a trip was inconsistent with the expert evidence of Associate Professor Cross. However, she acknowledged there was no ground of appeal that the verdict was unreasonable.

161Counsel for the appellant submitted that the interchange between the trial judge and counsel to which I have referred in par [145] above did not amount to acquiescence in the direction of reckless indifference to human life.

(b) The Crown

162The Crown submitted the direction was correct in law and available on the evidence. It was submitted it did not materially change the issues to be considered or the case to be met by the appellant.

163The Crown submitted that in her direction to the jury the trial judge identified the real issue in the case, namely, how the deceased came to fall from the cliff. It was pointed out that the inclusion of reckless indifference to human life as a basis for liability was not the subject of complaint during the trial and as a consequence r 4 of the Rules applied.

164The Crown submitted that the fundamental task of the trial judge was to ensure a fair trial. It was submitted, referring to what was said by Street CJ in Reg v Solomon supra, that there may be occasions where the trial judge should put to the jury matters of fact or law not put forward by the Crown. It was submitted that in those circumstances appellate intervention would only be justified if the accused was placed at a tactical disadvantage.

165The Crown placed reliance on what was said by Johnson J in Sheen v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 259; (2011) 215 A Crim R 208 at [85], of the significance (in that case) of the absence of objection supporting the view that there was no prejudice. The Crown also noted Johnson J's statement at [88] that in the case of a complete denial of the events giving rise to the offence, there would have been nothing counsel could usefully have added in his closing address. It was submitted that in the present case liability on the basis of reckless indifference to human life was for all practical purposes the same as liability arising from intention to kill. It was emphasised that the appellant's case was that he had no involvement with the deceased's fall. 

166The Crown placed some reliance on the fact that in his closing address at the trial the prosecutor pointed to the fact that the expert evidence supported the conclusion that the shoe trip was caused by the second or third step after being pushed.

167Both in written submissions and at the hearing particular reliance was placed on r 4 of the Rules. Senior counsel for the Crown emphasised that litigants are bound by their counsel's conduct of the case, ""a principle that forms part of the practical content of the idea of justice as applied to the outcome of a particular case"". This was a reference to Gleeson CJ's comments in Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161 at [18].

168Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the expert evidence did not shed much light on what happened at the edge of the cliff. She submitted that both experts agreed that the deceased could have tripped. She submitted the evidence established that the deceased's foot was on the edge of the cliff and that both experts agreed she was upright. She pointed to the fact that the cliff was extraordinarily steep.

169In that context senior counsel for the Crown submitted the only issue was whether the deceased was pushed by the appellant or whether her death was an accident in which the appellant was not involved. She submitted that the addition by the trial judge of the factual possibility that the deceased was pushed and then tripped, and the possibility that she was pushed with reckless indifference to her life, did not affect the case presented by the accused.

170Senior counsel for the Crown contended that the submission by the appellant that the ""push and trip theory"" was not consistent with the expert evidence was not correct. She accepted that the scenario was not expressly considered by either expert but submitted the experts both said they could not say whether there was a push or a trip because there was only one footprint. However, she noted that both experts agreed that the deceased was upright, moving forward and that she was either pushed or tripped.

Consideration

171The task of an appellate court in considering a ground of appeal of this nature is to determine whether there has been an unfairness to the accused, by reason of the manner in which the trial was conducted, which gives rise to a miscarriage of justice such as to require the court's intervention: Reg v Solomon supra at 327-328; Robinson v The Queen supra at [149].

172It was explained in Reg v Solomon supra that in some circumstances there is an obligation on a trial judge to put to the jury defences which appear to be reasonably open, notwithstanding they may not have been raised by the defence. However there is no corresponding obligation to put to the jury matters tending to conviction not raised by the Crown. Street CJ stated at 327 that the fairness or unfairness of travelling beyond the ground covered by the Crown would be at the forefront of the judge's mind in deciding whether to put fresh considerations to the jury: see also Moffitt P at 334.

173The possibility of unfairness is the reason that appellate courts have consistently warned against a judge putting to a jury matters not relied upon by the Crown. In R v Pureau (1990) 19 NSWLR 372, a case where the trial judge first raised the possibility of an alternative verdict, Hunt J at 376 said that considerations of fairness meant normally such matters must be raised before closing address when all disputes about the issues to go to the jury should be resolved. The passage was approved by the High Court in James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6; (2014) 88 ALJR 427 at [34]. In Regina v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [87] Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated that a trial judge should normally refrain from putting an argument in support of the Crown case which was not put by the Crown.

174It is not possible to define all the circumstances in which unfairness could arise. However, one occasion when it may is where the accused is placed at a tactical disadvantage. For example, when the accused (or counsel retained on his or her behalf) has conducted the case, called evidence and cross-examined on the basis of the manner in which the Crown presented its case, a tactical disadvantage would arise where the case would or may have been conducted differently had the issue raised by the trial judge clearly been an issue during the course of the trial: see Reg v Solomon supra at 328. Even if no tactical disadvantage other than the inability to address the jury can be shown, that of itself can constitute significant prejudice: Robinson v The Queen supra at [146].

175The relevant principles were summarised by Johnson J in Robinson v The Queen supra at [137]-[149]. I would respectfully adopt that summary.

176However, quite apart from r 4 of the Rules, the fact that no objection was taken to the direction can be of significance. In Sheen v The Queen supra Johnson J pointed out at [88] that the failure to raise objections at the close of the trial judge's summing-up is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of its fairness and adequacy: see also Chand v R [2011] NSWCCA 53 at [58].

177It is important to remember that it was accepted by counsel for the appellant in the Court below that the suggestion that death could be caused by a push followed by a trip was not inconsistent with the Crown case. This was on the basis that it would still involve the appellant intending to kill the deceased. That concession seemed to be one which could properly be made. The critical issue is whether the jury could be satisfied that the appellant pushed the deceased intending to kill her and she fell to her death. The fact that she may have tripped prior to falling did not affect that position.

178The fact that the two persons who gave expert evidence did not directly address this issue does not in my opinion alter the position. Each of Associate Professor Cross and Mr Beck said that they could not determine whether the deceased fell as a result of a push or a trip. As a matter of logic it would follow that they could not exclude a push followed by a trip. At the risk of repetition it is helpful to set out again the particular direction given on this question, which I have set out in full in par [147](a) above:

""...We know that she was close enough to the cliff edge so that she could be pushed over the edge or close enough, so that if she tripped, while facing down the slope, she was unable to recover her balance and she fell over the edge; or she was close enough so that a firm push towards the edge, followed by a trip, propelled her over the edge where her shoe impression was found. We know that she tried to save herself by grasping a nearby branch of a tree and that it broke in the attempt.

You will appreciate that counsel in this trial have concentrated on one of two scenarios: Either Mrs Campbell was pushed; or she tripped. But I just want to remind you that they are not mutually exclusive. Even if the accused pushed Mrs Campbell towards the edge of the cliff so forcefully that she tripped as she was propelled forward and then was unable to recover her balance before going over the edge, that would nonetheless meet the legal requirements of murder, because the accused's act in pushing Mrs Campbell is a substantially contributing cause of her death.""

179The appellant submitted that the introduction of the hypothesis of a push followed by a trip undermined the concessions made by Associate Professor Cross. It is difficult to see why that is the case. He said that a trip or push were the most likely scenarios. He also said, if the deceased tripped, in order to leave the footprint where it was found she needed to be walking at a moderate pace. Similarly, Mr Beck's estimations of the distance it would take for the deceased to recover from a trip were based on her walking a bit slower than four kilometres per hour (par [140] above). When asked if he agreed that four kilometres per hour was a reasonably brisk pace he answered ""I'll take that"". It is therefore difficult to see how, when the experts were agreed that for a trip to occur the deceased would have to have been walking at least at a moderate pace, the alternative scenario of a push followed by a trip in any way undermined such concessions that had been obtained in the cross-examination of Associate Professor Cross.

180In this context it must be remembered that the defence case was that what occurred was a tragic accident in which the appellant did not participate at all. The issue for the jury was whether they could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what occurred was not such an accident. It was no part of the appellant's case at trial that he would not be guilty of murder even if the jury found he pushed the deceased.

181I have dealt with the question thus far without reference to her Honour's direction that the appellant was guilty of murder if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant pushed the deceased with reckless indifference to her life. This different mental element was not raised with counsel.

182The first reference to the hypothesis that the deceased fell over the cliff as a result of a push followed by a trip is the direction which I have extracted at par [147](a) above. That direction was given quite independently of the mental element of the offence. It was consistent with what the trial judge had raised with counsel and did no more than suggest that even if the deceased was forcefully pushed before she tripped and fell over the edge, that would constitute murder provided that the requisite mental element on which the trial judge subsequently directed the jury was made out.

183In that part of the direction referred to in par [147](b) above her Honour, although referring to reckless indifference to human life, suggested to the jury that the real area of dispute concerned the first element; namely, was it the deliberate act of the accused which caused the fall or was it nothing more than a tragic accident? It can well be understood why her Honour said this; if the appellant intentionally pushed the deceased over a 50 metre cliff it would be impossible to draw any inference other than that he intended to kill her.

184The principal direction in relation to reckless indifference to human life is to be found in that portion of the direction to which I have referred in par [147](d). Her Honour explained that for that mental element to be established the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware that death was a probable consequence or likely result of his conduct. Immediately after giving this direction she emphasised that the Crown's allegation was that the accused deliberately pushed the deceased from the edge of the cliff.

185This review of the directions made by the trial judge shows that her Honour did not directly link the push and trip hypothesis to the mental element of reckless indifference to human life. Equally, by adverting to a different hypothesis as to what occurred (albeit without objection from counsel when it was raised) and an alternative mental element, the trial judge did invite the jury to consider the Crown case on a different basis to that in which the case was opened and conducted.

186The issue remains whether leaving the case to the jury on that basis constituted a miscarriage of justice. I have already indicated why I consider the hypothesis of the push and trip, taken alone, did not constitute such a miscarriage. Further, for the reasons set out hereunder I do not consider that the introduction of the mental element of reckless indifference to human life, whether alone or in conjunction with the push and trip hypothesis, led to such a miscarriage occurring.

187I accept that it would have been preferable for the trial judge not to have raised the mental element of reckless indifference to human life. This is for three reasons. First, it formed no part of the Crown case. The Crown case was based essentially on the proposition that the appellant had a motive for killing the deceased, took the deceased to the campsite with the intention of killing her and did so. The suggestion that he pushed her realising that death was the probable consequence or likely result whilst not intending to kill her sits uneasily with that case. Second, it had the potential of inviting the jury to speculate on a mental element for which there was no real basis in the evidence. Third, it was raised without reference to counsel for the appellant, much less with any discussion as to the evidence which would suggest that the accused had that mental element. 

188However, the following matters demonstrate in my view that notwithstanding the factors referred to in the preceding paragraph, there was no miscarriage of justice in this case.

189First, whatever be the mental element, there was no suggestion the appellant could be found guilty of murder absent a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant pushed her towards the cliff and she fell as a consequence. The physical element was the same irrespective of the mental element.

190Second, and aligned to the first reason, the appellant did not advance a case that he pushed the deceased not intending to kill her. If that was the appellant's case there would be real injustice by raising reckless indifference to human life at the conclusion of the trial, even if only by reason of the fact that counsel did not have the opportunity to address on the issue. By contrast, the appellant's case was that he did not push the deceased and was not involved in her death at all. The case was fought on the basis that if the deceased was pushed and the push caused her death, that would constitute murder. The manner the trial judge summarised the position in the last paragraphs of those portions of the direction to which I have referred in par [147](b) and (c) above, accurately summarised how the case was conducted.

191Third, what I have said in the preceding paragraph is not affected by the hypothesis that the deceased tripped after she was pushed. That was accepted in the interchange with counsel, which I have referred to in par [145] above.

192Fourth, although the addition of the alternative mental element did raise the possibility of the jury speculating rather than reaching a decision on the basis of the evidence, that possibility was remote in the present case. Once the jury determined the deceased was pushed deliberately towards the cliff, there would be little room for speculation as to the intention of the appellant in doing so. The jury could only reach the conclusion of a deliberate push on the basis of the circumstantial evidence tendered by the Crown, which either supported the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to kill the deceased or it did not. It did not lend any support to the conclusion of a push with reckless indifference to the life of the deceased.

193Fifth, I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that counsel for the appellant at the trial raised no objection to the direction.

194For these reasons I am not satisfied that the addition in the directions of the push and trip hypothesis and the mental element of reckless indifference to human life, whether considered alone or in conjunction with each other, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

195It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

196Since writing the above I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Simpson J. I agree that ground 1 should be dismissed for the additional reasons given by her honour.

Ground 3

""The Trial Judge erred in admitting the evidence of Associate Professor Cross over objection.""

197To understand the submissions on this ground it is necessary to have some regard to the course of evidence of Associate Professor Cross and the approach taken to its admissibility.

198Associate Professor Cross produced a revised report dated 12 March 2010 outlining the evidence he would seek to give if called at the trial. This report, along with the curriculum vitae of Associate Professor Cross, was tendered on a voir dire which commenced on 8 April 2010.

199The evidence of Associate Professor Cross was objected to on the basis it fell outside his area of specialised knowledge.

200Associate Professor Cross gave evidence on the voir dire that he obtained his Doctorate of Philosophy in the field of plasma physics, being the subject of a fourth state of matter, which consists of very high temperature gas.

201Associate Professor Cross gave evidence that he had been involved in the investigation of a number of falling incidents with the NSW Police Force and the Coroner.

202Associate Professor Cross was asked about a portion of his report and his explanation of what he described as a normal reaction force. He said he was dealing with principles of physics or biomechanics. 

203Associate Professor Cross was cross-examined on the voir dire on his expertise in biomechanics. He said that in conjunction with Professor Nathan he had studied the swing speed of baseball bats by studying groups of baseball players to see how far they swung a baseball bat using standard biomechanical techniques.

204During the course of cross-examination on the voir dire, the trial judge made the following comment:

'HER HONOUR: I don't think you can go so far as to say he's not qualified. I mean, he's qualified in the sense that he has relevant academic qualifications in that area. He might be criticised, and I don't have a view about it one way or the other, but he might be criticised, I suppose, for placing undue reliance upon the context within which he's given opinions in the past. Well, that's fair enough, but that doesn't go to his expertise. I'm concerned with whether or not he has the relevant expertise to express the opinions he expresses in this case. I'm not concerned with their weight because their weight is a matter for the jury.""

205However, cross-examination on his qualifications continued. Subsequently the following exchange took place between the trial judge and counsel for the appellant at the trial:

""HER HONOUR: Can we just deal with basics? Do you say that Professor Cross does not hold specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience which brings him within section 79 of the Evidence Act?

HUGHES: I do. There's no evidence. There's certainly evidence that he's highly qualified in physics, but as to the application of the human movement to physics relevantly as opposed to the use of sporting equipment, for example, there's not demonstrated in the material before your Honour or his evidence in my submission evidence which demonstrates that he has the requisite qualifications or experience or training to give an opinion as to the likelihood of persons landing in a particular way given particular circumstances. It's just not there.

HER HONOUR: Can I just say this is I think something that has to be carefully distinguished. You may want to say something about the discretion to admit the evidence if the jury would misuse it or would place undue weight upon it and that the weight would be unjustified given certain gaps in the way that he's carried out the experiments, or that there is some underlying, if you like, shortcomings such as difference in the surface of the ground where the experiments were carried out as compared to the surface of the cliff and the failure to consider the possibility of a trip, things that might compromise the opinion to the extent that we would be placing undue weight upon it.

That's one thing, but section 79 only talks about the person having specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience. It focuses solely upon whether or not the person has relevant qualifications. 

As things presently stand I would think that Professor Cross has the qualifications and he certainly had some experience in matters of this nature but I am just wondering why you say that would be outside the scope of the exception provided by section 79. You see his qualifications are one thing - his specialised knowledge is one thing and whether or not his opinion can stand up to scrutiny is another.

HUGHES: I understand what your Honour says. The evidence is that he's given evidence with respect to - or to quote from page 1 - investigated about 20 such cases. That is a reference to falling incidents. But the manner in which that was done we're none the wiser. The competence with which that was done we're none the wiser, nor the expertise to carry out those investigations competently.

HER HONOUR: Well, I mean, he has written at least two articles that have been published in journals of forensic science, which means he's been subject to a degree of peer review which fall directly - which come directly within the scope of the facts of that case, namely fatal falls from a height, two case studies and falls from a height in the American Journal of Physics.

So, when you put that together with his general academic qualifications, it's hard to maintain that he doesn't have relevant specialised knowledge.

HUGHES: I don't think I can take that any further.""

206Thereafter, a discussion took place between the trial judge and the prosecutor concerning the admissibility of certain experiments carried out by Associate Professor Cross and whether his evidence was in fact based on any particular field of expertise:

""HER HONOUR : But in a sense that is part of the seductive quality of getting someone who says 'I am an expert in biomechanics' to express a view about the way in which the deceased left the cliff edge. I don't have a problem with the expression of opinion insofar as one can say, as the Professor says, a 26 degree slope has to be compared with things like a maximum 12 degree slope and a travelator, so that the jury has some way of relating their own common experience of the world with the kind of conditions under which one can be found standing on a 26 degree slope and indeed the video where Detective Moon, was it, who was standing in that spot and Detective Moon's statement in and of itself I would have thought would demonstrate to the jury the precarious nature of someone standing on a slope of that nature and the likelihood that, unless you're restrained in some way, you're going to lose your balance and tip over the edge.

I don't - I don't really see that Professor Cross doesn't have the requisite knowledge or expertise and I think that the evidence has to be relevant because relevance is, as I said, a fairly broad test, particularly in the circumstances of the case.

But what does concern me though is that this is one of those areas where in some respects the jury could reach all of these conclusions from their own experience and knowledge of the world after they have been presented with the primary facts without the expression of an expert opinion by someone who says: In my view she was pushed.

And, if that's right, then the introduction of that opinion does invest that evidence with more weight than it properly deserves.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It's still open to be tested without Professor Cross. Professor Cross is an ad hoc expert on 26 degree slope. The testing that he has conducted in relation to a 26 degree slope, his ability to explain to the jury the forward momentum and the relative positions, if I can put it as neutrally as that, and it is explained as a foot is where the human comes forward because of the relative positions between the slope and the perpendicular of the slope. Those aren't areas that will be within a jury's knowledge.

HER HONOUR: I don't understand Mr Hughes to even challenge that aspect of his expertise. That's the point. He can given evidence of, or - and Mr Hughes might correct me if I am wrong - but Professor Cross could give evidence of all of those things; the slope, the difficulty that a person would have maintaining balance on a slope of that nature, and you can give him the various factual assumptions that underpin that, ie her height, her weight, the type of surface, the type of shoes that she was wearing.

All of that can be factored into the equation. The jury can see for themselves that Detective Moon is not so confident that he wouldn't be secured by a harness in the event that he gets too close to the edge. They can see all of that.

I don't understand Professor Cross's expertise to be in doubt in relation to those matters. The vice, if you like, creeps in once you try and draw some meaningful comparison between the tests he conducted on a one-off occasion with a female subject in an unrelated terrain and then draws conclusions from that to express the ultimate opinion that he does in relation to the deceased being pushed.

I haven't formed a concluded view about it. It might just get over the line; it might not.""

207On 22 April 2010 the trial judge delivered judgment on the admissibility of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross. She pointed out that she had already ruled that Associate Professor Cross was appropriately qualified and that there was a relevant factual basis underlying most of the evidence he proposed to give. Her conclusion was in the following terms:

""[6] In my view, Professor Cross is relevantly qualified to explain to the jury the biomechanics involved in each of these scenarios, in the following respects :-

(i) a slope of approximately 26° conforms with the common slope for a tiled roof. It may be contrasted with a slope of 10 or 12°, being the slope typical of a travelator, which has the additional safety feature of a moving handrail.

(ii) standing on one foot on a 26° slope would be extremely unstable in normal circumstances.

(iii) the impression of the shoe at the cliff edge is consistent with a person in an upright position, applying vertical force to the ground.

(iv) it takes approximately .6 of a second for a person to fall from a vertical position to a horizontal one, assuming the application of force from behind, and assuming a normal reaction time of .2 of a second.

(v) a trip presupposes that the person is in motion.

[7] Having established the matters (i) to (v) above, and taking into account the physical features of the site that are established by other evidence in the trial, Professor Cross may express an opinion with respect to the various ways in which the shoeprint could have been left in the position where it was found. I would not allow reference to the experiment conducted by Professor Cross in the course of that opinion.""

The submissions of the parties

(a) The appellant

208The appellant submitted that the following portions of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross in examination in chief were not based on the witness's specialised knowledge and experience and were outside his expertise in plasma physics:

""That, from the pattern of the shoe print and the breaking of the branches the deceased was upright, or in a straight position when she went over the cliff.

He could exclude the deceased standing and looking at the view because this would have been unstable and he would expect two footprints not one.

He could exclude suicide on the basis that 'there were tree branches directly in front of her'.

Most people can't cartwheel.

The footprint could not be explained by having been left when a person was sitting on one of the rocks close to the print which, whilst notionally possible, had 'one problem' and that is 'a person sitting down cannot reach one metre with their foot while they're sitting down'.

He could exclude the deceased slipping because he would have expected more damage to the surrounding vegetation and he would not have expected a 'a clear stationary shoe print'.

After giving a demonstration in court before the jury of a person tripping over a book he could exclude the deceased tripping on one of the rocks at the scene because to explain the shoe print the deceased would have had to have been moving, before the trip, 'at a medium to fast place' and this would have been perilous.

Tripping on a shoe lace could be excluded because the deceased would have fallen on her face and this was inconsistent with the shoe print.

If the deceased was pushed he could envisage the second step leaving the print as it was found.""
(References omitted).

209Counsel for the appellant contended that the first critical piece of Associate Professor Cross's evidence was that the deceased was upright at the time the footprint was made. She submitted the inference was that this was inconsistent with a trip. She submitted that the defence was further undermined by Associate Professor Cross's evidence on what she described as the second critical matter; that if the fall was caused by an accidental trip, the deceased would have to be walking at a brisk or moderate pace. Although she acknowledged he subsequently said he could not come to a view about the speed necessary to bring that about without further experiments.

210Counsel for the appellant submitted that Associate Professor Cross did not have the relevant expertise to comment on any of the matters referred to in par [6] of the judgment of the primary judge (see par [207] above). She submitted further that his evidence was based on simulation experiments which the trial judge in fact had disallowed. She acknowledged that it may have been possible to reach the conclusion that the deceased was standing upright at the point of the shoe print. However she submitted this was undermined by the evidence of Mr Beck, that the footprint was consistent with accidental tripping and that the deceased could have left the footprint in a forward position consistent with an accidental trip.

211Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was incorrect to suggest that there was no real difference between the conclusions reached by each of the experts. She submitted that if the evidence of Associate Professor Cross, to the effect that the deceased was standing upright at the part of the cliff where the footprint appeared, was accepted it would be irresistible commonsense that the deceased had not tripped.

212Counsel for the appellant submitted the trial judge had shut down cross-examination on the voir dire on the qualifications of Associate Professor Cross.

213Counsel for the appellant accepted that it was possible for an opinion to be based on experience as distinct from specialised knowledge but submitted there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Associate Professor Cross had the requisite degree of experience to give the evidence he was permitted to give.

214Counsel for the appellant submitted that a number of the opinions expressed by Associate Professor Cross were not based on specialised knowledge in biomechanics. She also submitted that evidence as to the pace a person would have to walk before tripping was based on biomechanics. She submitted this evidence was critical to the preference Associate Professor Cross had to a push as distinct from a trip, because a person would not walk at the requisite pace at that part of the cliff to allow such a trip to occur.

(b) The Crown

215The Crown submitted that counsel for the appellant at the trial withdrew the objection to the evidence, referring to his comments ""I don't think I can take that any further"" at the conclusion of the interchange I have extracted in par [205]. I do not agree. Simply saying in effect I have no further submissions to make does not constitute a withdrawal of the objection.

216The Crown submitted that the appellant's submission ignored the extent to which normal rules of physics applied to the topics upon which the trial judge indicated that Associate Professor Cross was qualified to give evidence. It was submitted that the experience of Associate Professor Cross in ""the physics and biomechanics of fatal falls"" qualified him to give the evidence he was permitted to give.

217The Crown submitted the evidence of Associate Professor Cross was in any event not of particular significance, as his evidence was consistent with the deceased either having been tripped or pushed.

218The Crown contrasted this case with the decision of this Court in Wood v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 21; (2012) 84 NSWLR 581 where the evidence of Associate Professor Cross was strongly criticised. It was submitted that in the latter case Associate Professor Cross gave opinion evidence about very complex factual questions. It was submitted that, unlike the present case, his lack of formal training in biomechanics was significant in considering his qualification to give the evidence adduced in Wood v The Queen.

219Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the better criticism to be levelled at the evidence of Associate Professor Cross was that it was based on matters within the realm of common experience; namely, there was no evidence of slipping and there were broken branches at chest height consistent with the deceased standing at the time the footprint was made. However, she submitted that the movement of the human body is a study of physics. She submitted that Associate Professor Cross' expertise could be shown, not only from his professional qualifications but from the experience he had gained since 1997. This was in reference to the publications noted in his curriculum vitae and to the fact he had been retained to advise on 20 fatal falls by the Coroner and the NSW Police Service.

Consideration

220Section 79(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) is in the following terms:

""79(1) If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.""

221In the present case two issues arise. First, did Associate Professor Cross have the requisite specialist knowledge to give the evidence elicited from him? Second, was his opinion wholly or substantially based on such specialised knowledge?

222It is convenient to deal with the second issue first. At common law evidence from an expert was not admissible if it was no more than an attempt to guide the jury on matters which it was within their capacity to determine for themselves: Clark v Ryan [1960] HCA 42; (1960) 103 CLR 486 at 492. The reason for so confining the evidence as explained by Gleeson CJ in HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [44], is that experts who venture opinions outside their field of specialist knowledge may invest such opinions with a spurious appearance of authority and the legitimate process of fact-finding may be subverted.

223That proposition requires some qualification in light of the provisions of s 80(b) of the Evidence Act, which provides that evidence of a person is not inadmissible only because it is about a matter of common knowledge. In Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4; (2002) 76 ALJR 402 Gaudron J explained the operation of the section as follows at [82]:

""[82] The concept of 'specialised knowledge' imports knowledge of matters which are outside the knowledge or experience of ordinary persons and which 'is sufficiently organized or recognized to be accepted as a reliable body of knowledge or experience'. So to say, however, is not to say that an expert witness cannot have regard to matters that are within the knowledge of ordinary persons in formulating his or her opinion. So much is expressly acknowledged by s 80(b) of the Evidence Act.""

Whilst Gummow and Callinan JJ made the following remarks at 158:

""[158] Nothing in s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act), stands in the way of the reception of expert evidence of this kind. 'Training, study or experience', the words used in the section, necessarily include, as they must in all areas of expertise, observations and knowledge of everyday affairs and events, and departures from them. It will frequently be impossible to divorce entirely these observations and that knowledge from the body of purely specialised knowledge upon which an expert's opinion depends. It is the added ingredient of specialised knowledge to the expert's body of general knowledge that equips the expert to give his or her opinion. Section 80(b) of the Act is to no different an effect.""
(Citations omitted).

224The effect of the section was considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 70; (2007) 159 FCR 397. In that case Black CJ, Emmett and Middleton JJ without reference to either HG v The Queen supra or Velevski v The Queen supra made the following remarks as to the effect of s 80 on the common law rule:

""[54] Such an approach appears to ignore the language of ss 79 and 80 of the Evidence Act. Certainly, opinion evidence will not be admissible unless the opinion is based on specialised knowledge and that specialised knowledge is in turn based on the opinion holder's training, study or experience. However, the former rule of the common law that excluded opinion evidence as to a matter of common knowledge no longer applies. Under s 80, evidence of an opinion is not inadmissible only because it is a matter of common knowledge. 

[55] Clearly enough, if the matter about which expert evidence is to be given is patent and known to all, the Court's time would normally be wasted by such evidence. Section 135 may be called in aid in those circumstances. Nevertheless, the evidence may still be strictly admissible. Further, an expert may still be of assistance to the Court, even in an area about which most people know something. So long as s 79 is satisfied, and the opinion evidence is based on specialised knowledge and that specialised knowledge is based on training, study or experience, that opinion evidence will be admissible, whether or not it might then be excluded in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 135 (see generally the Law Reform Commission, Interim Report on Evidence, Canberra (1985), paragraph 43).""

225I doubt that s 80(b) of the Evidence Act goes so far as to make admissible opinion evidence said to be based on specialised knowledge, training or experience which in truth is evidence, which to adopt the expression used in the Full Federal Court ""is patent and known to all"". Such evidence as a matter of logic would not be based on specialised skill and knowledge. The effect of this section in my opinion is as explained by Gaudron J and by Gummow and Callinan JJ in Velevski v The Queen supra. The section makes it clear that in arriving at his or her opinion based on specialised knowledge, training or experience there can be no objection to an expert relying on matters generally known, or as Gummow and Callinan JJ described at [158], ""knowledge of everyday affairs events and departures from them"". In that way ss 79 and 80(b) of the Evidence Act can be read harmoniously.

226The evidence that Associate Professor Cross was held to be entitled to give is set out in the paragraphs of the judgment of the trial judge extracted in par [207] above. The matters referred to in subpars [6](i), [6](ii) and [6](v) of that judgment seem to me to be matters of commonsense and not based on any field of expertise, in particular not biomechanics. Similarly the proposed evidence referred to in subpar [6](iv) seems to me to be a matter of basic arithmetic based on the assumed normal reaction time.

227However, the matters referred to in subpar [6](iii) of the judgment of the trial judge, namely, that the impression of the shoe was consistent with a person in an upright position and the evidence which the trial judge said Associate Professor Cross was entitled to give in par [7] of the judgment, would in my opinion be based on specialised knowledge of biomechanics, or perhaps more accurately biomedical engineering. The unchallenged evidence of Mr Beck was that this discipline involved the application of the anatomy and physiology of the human body to a specific field of engineering. Further, that it was possible to apply biomedical knowledge with mechanical knowledge (in Mr Beck's case from his qualifications as a mechanical engineer) to understand the movement of the human body in terms of its movement and reactions. The opinions on the matters referred to in subpar [6](iii) and par [7] are opinions which a person qualified in such a field would be entitled to express.

228Similarly, although much of the evidence given by Associate Professor Cross referred to in par [207] could be derived from common experience, his conclusion that the deceased was upright and to have tripped would have had to have been walking at a moderate to fast pace, would seem to be based on specialised knowledge in the field of biomechanics. It follows that if Associate Professor Cross had appropriate knowledge in that field, he would be entitled to give the evidence he gave based on such expertise. The fact that his process of reasoning involved the expression of opinions on matters which could be said to be matters of common knowledge did not render his evidence inadmissible.

229The question remains whether Associate Professor Cross had the relevant expertise to give that evidence. It does not seem to me that his formal qualifications in physics or his particular field of study (plasma physics), qualified him to give this evidence involving an understanding of the mechanics of the human body in terms of movement and reactions. 

230Associate Professor Cross did not seem to suggest that his formal qualifications gave him that expertise. Rather reliance was placed on his study and experience.

231It was necessary in those circumstances for the Crown to demonstrate that the study undertaken by Associate Professor Cross and the experience gained by him, qualified him to give the evidence in question: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] and Dasreef Pty Limited v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; (2011) 243 CLR 588 at [32] and [37]. In my opinion the evidence tendered did not establish that Associate Professor Cross had acquired such specialised knowledge. His report stated that he investigated 20 cases for the NSW Police Force or Coroner, including the death of Caroline Byrne (the subject of the appeal in Wood v The Queen supra). However, it said nothing of what he did in these investigations or how they equipped him to give evidence in the present case.

232Associate Professor Cross's curriculum vitae listed a number of publications concerned with, what he described in the report tendered on the voir dire, the physics of sport. However, none of the publications were tendered and on their face they do not show specialised knowledge in biomechanics such as to enable him to express the opinion given by him.

233There are three exceptions. Associate Professor Cross's curriculum vitae refers to the book written by Associate Professor Cross, ""Evidence for Murder How physics convicted a killer"" (the Book) and two articles (""Fatal falls from a height: two case studies"" and ""Falls from a height""). None of these were tendered and the fact that he published the Book and two articles with those titles cannot lead to the conclusion he was appropriately qualified to give the evidence led from him. With respect to the views of the trial judge expressed in argument (see par [205] above), I do not accept that two articles concerning fatal falls from a height which were peer reviewed coupled with qualifications in physics, without more, qualified him to give the evidence.

234Neither the evidence given by Associate Professor Cross on the voir dire (see pars [198]-[203] above) or his evidence in chief (see par [120]-[132]) were in my opinion sufficient to establish he had the requisite skill and experience to give the evidence he in fact gave. His evidence did not provide any details of the consulting work so as to show he had the requisite knowledge and experience to give the evidence"".

235It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out.

Ground 4

""There has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the Appellant on account of fresh evidence.""

The submissions of the parties

(a) The appellant

236The fresh evidence relied upon in the written submissions was the publication of the Book, together with the conclusion of McClellan CJ at CL in Wood v The Queen supra at [730] (that the Book had the consequence that any evidence Associate Professor Cross gave on controversial matters had minimal if any weight). It should be noted that earlier in his judgment McClellan CJ at CL made the following remarks concerning the qualifications of Associate Professor Cross (not reproduced in the NSW Law Reports' reporting of Wood v The Queen):

""[467] To my mind A/Prof Cross was allowed, without objection, to express opinions outside his field of specialized knowledge.

[468] It was submitted to this court that at the very least A/Prof Cross' lack of expertise in these areas diminished the weight that could reasonably be attributed to his evidence. A/Prof Cross' qualifications are in physics and his primary area of expertise is plasma physics. He has spent some time since his retirement assisting the police in the investigation of incidents of persons falling and has published alone, or with others, some papers concerned with the physics of sport. In the course of these tasks he has applied his knowledge of basic physics. He has no qualifications or experience in biomechanics.""

237Counsel for the appellant submitted that the relevance of the decision in Wood v The Queen supra was that one of the bases on which the witness purported to establish his expertise in fatal falls, was his contribution to the investigation in the trial the subject of appeal in Wood v The Queen, which had been discredited. She accepted that the existence of the Book could have been discovered by due diligence at the time of the trial but said that the critical point was the opinion expressed by this Court in Wood v The Queen. She submitted that the material would have been relevant to cross-examine Associate Professor Cross. Senior counsel for the Crown conceded such material would be relevant on the voir dire as to the admissibility of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross and to test his evidence in cross-examination, if it was in fact admitted. 

(b) The Crown

238The Crown submitted that the Book was not fresh evidence as it existed at the time of the trial and it could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. As I have indicated this was accepted by the appellant.

239The Crown submitted in those circumstances the overriding question was whether there was a miscarriage of justice. It was submitted that the Book and the criticism made against Associate Professor Cross in Wood v The Queen supra was focused on his investigation in the trial the subject of that appeal.

240The Crown submitted that the trial judge only shut down the cross-examination on the expert code of conduct on the basis the witnesses' understanding of the code was not relevant to the admissibility of his opinion evidence but only to its weight. It submitted this was consistent with what was said in Wood v The Queen supra at [728]-[729]. The Crown emphasised that the opinion of Associate Professor Cross was ultimately neutral due to his inability to conclude whether the deceased was pushed or tripped.

241The Crown also submitted that if the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence there was no miscarriage of justice. It was emphasised that Wood v The Queen supra was not authority for the proposition that in any case where the evidence of Associate Professor Cross was admitted there was a miscarriage of justice.

242The Crown submitted that the evidence of Associate Professor Cross was neither significant nor particularly contentious. Reference was made to the submission of counsel for the appellant at the trial when he said ""Ultimately, that evidence ... is alarmingly in agreement ... But, ultimately, as her Honour said to you, they can only give so much assistance ... much of this is simply commonsense. There is no great science in tripping, it is something we have all done"".

243The Crown also referred to the direction to the jury on this issue:

""At the end of the day, despite what Mr Beck probably initially maintained in his report, both Professor Cross and Mr Beck concluded that the physical signs from the site and their knowledge of biomechanics and their knowledge of the deceased was consistent with either her being pushed or the fact that she tripped and they are not able, really, to determine which of those two is, in fact, the case. They might want to express an opinion about which of those two explanations they prefer, but it is not their preference that is in issue, ladies and gentlemen; it is a question of what conclusion you draw from the evidence.""

244Senior counsel for the Crown emphasised that in the present case Associate Professor Cross did not conduct the same experiments as those conducted by him in Wood v The Queen supra. She submitted that the flaws in his evidence in Wood v The Queen did not relate to the relevantly straightforward matters he was considering in the present case.

Consideration

245Having regard to my conclusion on Ground 3, this ground can be dealt with shortly.

246As I indicated the written submissions relied on the Book as fresh evidence. Not only could the Book have been discovered by reasonable diligence, it was referred to in the curriculum vitae of Associate Professor Cross. For the evidence to be admitted on the appeal it would thus be necessary to demonstrate there would otherwise be a miscarriage of justice: Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 402 and Peter Mickleberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 301. The principles were summarised by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63] (Mason P and Levine J agreeing) and it is unnecessary to repeat them.

247In the present case there was no miscarriage of justice. The evidence of Associate Professor Cross did not explicitly express a preference for a push or trip scenario, conceding that either was a possibility. The only difference with Mr Beck's evidence was that Associate Professor Cross understood Mr Beck to express a preference. However, each of Associate Professor Cross and Mr Beck ultimately agreed that to trip the deceased would have to have been walking at a moderate pace (see pars [125] and [179] above). The only real difference between the evidence of the experts was that Associate Professor Cross said that the deceased was upright at the time the footprint was made whilst Mr Beck said she was slightly, to well, forward. The directions to the jury (see par [243]) recognised the inconclusive nature of the evidence as did the comment of counsel for the appellant in the Court below to the effect that the experts were largely in agreement (see par [242] above).

248The appellant also sought to rely on the decision of this Court in Wood v The Queen supra in demonstrating that Associate Professor Cross lacked the necessary expertise to give the evidence. It did not seem to be suggested that the material relied upon by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Wood v The Queen, in reaching its conclusion concerning the evidence of Associate Professor Cross, was not available to the appellant in the present case or could not have been available with the exercise of reasonable diligence. I have already indicated why I am of the opinion that the admission of the evidence did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. So far as the decision itself in Wood v The Queen is concerned, I agree with Simpson J that the decision was irrelevant to the admissibility of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross. 

249It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 5

""The Trial Judge erred in her directions attaching to the evidence of June Ingham as constituting motive and tendency.""

250The directions the subject of this ground of appeal were as follows:

""The second category of evidence, if I could call it that, is the evidence as to motive. Could I indicate, ladies and gentlemen, that there is no requirement on the Crown to prove motive beyond reasonable doubt. Motive for the commission of a crime is not an element of the crime. It is something which can be taken into account if it exists towards the proof of guilt of the accused, but even if the Crown were unable to establish or suggest a motive, it would make no difference to the Crown case. It is just another piece of evidence or another plank of the evidence that the Crown relies upon in this particular trial.

The Crown's submission is that the accused's motive, in conducting a relationship and marrying the deceased, was purely financial and the evidence relied upon, in order to support that conclusion, is the following ...

...

Now, the Crown asks you to draw an inference from June Ingham's evidence which is this inference: That that experience with June Ingham taught the accused a lesson; that lesson was that he needed to ensure that his financial gains could not be taken away at the end of a relationship. I will have more to say about June Ingham's evidence shortly because there is this other category of evidence that her evidence falls into, but it is a matter for you whether you draw that inference, ladies and gentlemen, but it is an inference, the Crown says, you would draw from June Ingham's evidence. It is a combination of all that evidence I have outlined in this account that the Crown asks you to use towards the inference that the accused's motive in wishing to, not just end his relationship with Janet Campbell, but to kill her, was entirely a financial one.

...

Let me come to the evidence of June Ingham on the question of tendency. You will recall that I gave you that direction at the time Ms Ingham was about to given [sic] evidence. I am going to repeat that direction now so you appreciate the use to which you are permitted to put that evidence.

The evidence is before you because the Crown says that there is a pattern of behaviour, if one looks at the relationship with Ms Ingham and compares it with the relationship with Ms Campbell, and that pattern of behaviour may reveal that the accused has a tendency to act in a particular way, namely, to enter relationships with middle aged, single women with the intention of obtaining money from them to purchase property in his own name, whether that be his own name or jointly with Ms Campbell, without the intention of returning the money or allowing them to enjoy the long term benefit or use of the property but, rather, to appropriate that money and/or the property for his own use.

Now, the evidence of the accused acting in this way can only be used in the way the Crown asks you to if you are firstly, satisfied of that evidence beyond reasonable doubt. So you have to accept Ms Ingham's evidence beyond reasonable doubt if you are to use the evidence in that particular way.

You do not have to be satisfied of her evidence beyond reasonable doubt if you want to use it towards the issue of motive but you do have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if you want to use it in this particular way.

So if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, you may consider the evidence for the limited purpose of determining whether the accused acted in the same way with the same intention towards Janet Campbell.

The evidence must not be used in any other way other than, as I said, if you were satisfied that it was capable of establishing motive. It would, however, be completely wrong to reason that just because the accused betrayed June Ingham and appropriated a good deal of her money, he is, therefore, generally a person of bad character and for that reason he must have committed murder; that is not a valid processes [sic] of reasoning.

I am not going to go over Ms Ingham's evidence again but the Crown relies upon a number of features of the accused's dealings with Ms Ingham that were repeated or mirrored in his relationship with Janet Campbell. They are that they were both middle aged single women with money, certainly with more money than the accused had; that the accused expressed his desire that the house that they purchased in each case was in his name; that the property was purchased with money provided by those women; that there was money transferred into the accused's account for the purchase of the property and that there was money remaining in the accused's account from the purchase of the property which was used by the accused to buy various consumer items or pay off debts; that the accused promised in each case to change his will so that Miss Ingham and Ms Campbell would not be disadvantaged; that they would each receive the benefit of his estate and lastly, that in each case the accused received the benefit of refunded stamp duty from the Ambulance Service because of the purchase of the property, either partly or solely in his name.

Remember, as I said before, that the evidence of Mr Drummond and Mr Grant about the accused telling Janet Campbell that he would change his will, that is hearsay evidence but of course he did make that direct statement to Ms Ingham.

So, ultimately, as I said, if you accept the evidence of June Ingham beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown submission is that you would have no difficulty concluding that the accused began his relationship with Janet Campbell with the same goals in mind, that is, that the accused never intended to have a long-term genuine relationship with her. Even if you reach that conclusion, it does not allow you, without more, to also conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused killed Janet Campbell. It is but one of the building blocks in the Crown case.

So in summary, let me just explain what conclusion or inference the Crown asks you to draw from that combination of evidence that is referred to under the category of motive and tendency.

The Crown asks you to conclude that the accused was in the relationship with Janet Campbell for no other purpose but financial gain, consistent with his relationship with June Ingham and that the prospect that Janet Campbell would be able to regain the majority of her money from the accused, if there were divorce proceedings, provided the accused with a motive to murder her.

Once again, whether you draw that inference or conclusion, is a matter for you, but that is the inference or conclusion that the Crown says is supported by that body of evidence.""

The submissions of the parties

(a) The appellant

251The appellant submitted that the direction of the trial judge to the effect that the jury needed to be satisfied of the evidence of Ms Ingham beyond reasonable doubt if it was to be used as tendency evidence but not if it was to be used as evidence of motive was confusing. The appellant also submitted the direction contravened the prohibition of using evidence of motive as tendency evidence unless it satisfied the provisions of s 97 of the Evidence Act.

252The appellant submitted that the alleged motive was that the appellant entered into a relationship with the deceased and killed her for financial gain. He submitted that the Crown case was that the evidence of Ms Ingham made this state of mind more likely. He submitted this allegation involved tendency reasoning and the jury were not properly instructed as to the standard of proof.

(b) The Crown

253The Crown submitted that it was not suggested that the evidence was inadmissible both as tendency and motive evidence. It was submitted that the trial judge explained to the jury how the evidence should be approached. The Crown pointed to the separation of the motive and tendency directions as being helpful in making a conceptual distinction between the permissible uses of the evidence. 

254The Crown pointed to the fact that no redirection was sought concerning the directions at trial. It submitted that r 4 of the Rules applied and no miscarriage of justice was shown by the direction.

Consideration

255As pointed out by the Crown, it was not in dispute that the evidence was admissible both as to motive and as tendency evidence. Further, it was not in dispute that the trial judge was correct that the jury had to be satisfied of the evidence of Ms Ingham beyond reasonable doubt if they were to rely upon it as tendency evidence but not if they were to use it as evidence of motive.

256I have set out the relevant direction above at par [250]. The trial judge explained how the evidence could be used as evidence of motive, namely, that the appellant's motive in marrying the deceased was for financial gain. She subsequently indicated how the evidence could be used as tendency evidence emphasising if it was to be used in that way the jury had to be satisfied of its truth beyond reasonable doubt.

257Any difficulty the jury may have had in relation to the differing standards of proof resulted from the fact that the evidence was available for both purposes for which it was tendered and not from any direction given by the trial judge. The direction of the trial judge in my respectful opinion did all that could be done to alleviate any difficulty which might otherwise have arisen rather than give rise to such a difficulty.

258As the Crown pointed out, no redirection was sought at the trial. Rule 4 of the Rules applies and no miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. In these circumstances leave to raise this ground should be refused.

259Having regard to the way the case was conducted it was not necessary to consider whether the direction was unduly favourable to the accused in that it stated tendency evidence needed to be provided beyond reasonable doubt. Like Simpson J I would prefer to reserve any consideration of this question until it actually arises.

The proviso

260The question which remains is whether notwithstanding the appellant's success on Ground 3, it is an appropriate case to apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the proviso).

261The error in question was not of such a nature as to render the application of the proviso inapplicable. The error could not be described as radical. Nor, for the reasons for which I have given, did it give rise to such a miscarriage of justice as to render consideration of the proviso inapplicable: AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438 at [54], Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; (2012) 246 CLR 92 at [21]-[24] and Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29; (2012) 247 CLR 531 at [126]-[127].

262In these circumstances for the proviso to apply it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the accused: Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [44], Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [226], Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521 at [41]-[42] and AK v Western Australia supra at [53]. In considering the matter the Court is performing essentially the same function as when deciding whether a jury verdict should be set aside as unreasonable: Weiss v The Queen at [41], Festa v The Queen at [123] and Darkan v The Queen [2006] HCA 34; (2006) 227 CLR 373 at [84].

263I have set out the evidence at the trial above. Based on that evidence, excluding the evidence of Associate Professor Cross, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant murdered the deceased by deliberately pushing her over the cliff.

264Without repeating the evidence my reasons for this conclusion are as follows.

265First, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the appellant had little or no affection for the deceased. He told his brother the deceased was harassing him and described her to both his brother and his brother's wife as ugly or filthy rich (see par [12] above). He described her in similar derogatory terms to Mr Colin Sanders and Mr Robert Crampton.

266Second, consistent with his apparent lack of affection for the deceased he did not make the fact of his marriage generally known but rather took steps to conceal it. He denied any relationship to Mr Crampton (par [14]). Although the deceased received a wedding present purporting to come from the appellant's parents, the evidence was that they had neither met the deceased nor spoken to her or ever given her a present (par [17]). The appellant did not tell his brother or his wife that he had married when they visited him at the Otford residence after Christmas 2004 (par [21]). At that time Ms Velicanski was staying with the appellant at that residence (par [21]-[22]). Ms Velicanski gave evidence that the appellant told her that he had bought a property at Otford and asked her to stay with him (par [63]). She gave evidence that after she was asked by a neighbour if she was Janet she asked the appellant who Janet was and was told that she was a friend of his who came with her boyfriend to look at the house (par [64]).

267Third, although on a number of occasions the appellant exhibited some signs of grief and trauma as a result of the death of the deceased (see pars [91]-[94], [100], [101] and [105]) his activities in the days following her death were inconsistent with someone who had lost a recently married partner in a tragic accident. Five days after the accident occurred he made inquiries about travelling with Ms Velicanski, ""his wife"", to Townsville (pars [102]-[103]), a trip which occurred between 1 and 4 April 2005 (pars [106]-[107]). On 5 April following a fight with Ms Velicanski the appellant activated his RSVP account and communicated with other accounts (par [108]). Ms Velicanski subsequently stayed at the Otford house for some weeks, the appellant telling her he was not married and that if asked by the police she should tell them she did not know him (par [110]). 

268The appellant did not attend the deceased's funeral (par [109]). After his relationship with Ms Velicanski terminated in mid-May 2005, the appellant spent two nights with Ms Rodgers at the Airport Hilton. Ms Rodgers' evidence was that he never mentioned a wife, buying a house at Otford or someone close to him having died (par [114]).

269Fourth, the appellant had obtained substantial financial benefits from his relationship with the deceased (see pars [32]-[39] above). The evidence was that on divorce he would only retain a very small proportion of that benefit (par [40]). That had been the appellant's experience with Ms Ingham (par [57]).

270None of these matters, either alone or in conjunction with each other, could lead to the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant murdered the deceased. However, they do provide the background against which the events of 24 March 2005 fall to be evaluated.

271I have set out the evidence of these events in detail in pars [72]-[88] above. That evidence must be considered in the context that it was established, contrary to the statements of the appellant in his record of interview, that the deceased was fearful of heights whilst the appellant was not (pars [8], [9] and [23]). It is unlikely in these circumstances she would have been happy to camp close to the cliff, much less walk towards it.

272It is evident that the deceased believed she was going into a camping ground with facilities (par [72]). That can be contrasted with the place the appellant and the deceased set up camp. It was in an unauthorised camping area, difficult to access from the walking trail, uncomfortable to sleep on because of the slope and vegetation and close to the edge of the cliff (par [79]).

273The appellant said the reason for setting up camp at that site was that the deceased was tired and her pack was heavy (par [78]). However, it was around 2.00 pm and a matter of a 45 minute walk to the nearest designated campsite with facilities (par [79]). It would have been easy to arrive at that site by nightfall even travelling slowly with frequent rests along the walking track. It does not explain camping on an unauthorised site, itself difficult to access from the trail (par [79]). 

274The appellant said that the deceased left the tent after 7.00 pm. The evidence was that it was a bright night with a full moon and civil sunset was at 7.27 pm (par [84]). The door of the tent was facing the cliff. It would have been self-evident to the deceased that she was walking towards the cliff if that was what in fact occurred.

275I have referred earlier to the evidence of Mr Beck. He ultimately said that a trip followed by a fall involved an assumption of a person walking at four kilometres per hour or a bit slower for a person of the deceased's age and gender. He stated that it was not necessary for the deceased to be walking directly towards the cliff and she could have fallen at a 15 degree angle. Accepting this evidence it would still mean that the deceased was walking at a moderate pace generally towards the face of the cliff when she tripped.

276It is in my opinion inherently improbable that a person having a fear of heights would walk at a moderate pace down an increasingly steep slope towards a visible precipitous cliff face such that the deceased tripped on a rock and fell to her death. Taking into account the unlikely explanation given by the appellant for camping near the site, his untrue statements that he was scared of heights, his conduct both before and after the death of the deceased and the financial advantage he stood to obtain, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was deliberately pushed over the cliff by the appellant. There can be no doubt that if this was the case, he intended to kill her.

277In reaching this conclusion I have not placed any reliance on the tendency evidence nor on the fact the appellant did not have a mobile phone. I do not think that the evidence of Ms Ingham was sufficient to give rise to the tendency alleged. The failure of the appellant to take a mobile phone does not seem to me to point one way or the other to a conclusion of homicide or accidental death.

278Nor have I taken into account the fact that the appellant rather than immediately raising the alarm climbed to the foot of the cliff to locate the body. A reaction of this nature was equally consistent with a belief the deceased had accidentally fallen over the cliff as well as with the hypothesis the deceased was pushed. It does, of course, provide further evidence that the appellant was not fearful of heights contrary to his statement in his interview with the police.

279However, for the reasons I have given I am satisfied the proviso applies and no substantial injustice was caused by the erroneous admission of the evidence of Associate Professor Cross.

Conclusion

280In the result, the appeal should be dismissed.

281SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree, largely for the reasons given by his Honour, that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. I will avoid, so far as possible, repetition of the factual basis of the Crown case. 

Ground 1

282Initially, Ground 1 of the appeal was linked with Ground 2 as then pleaded (by which the appellant complained of the trial judge's failure to leave to the jury an alternative verdict of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act). Ground 2 was abandoned as a result of the decision of this Court in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317.

283As pleaded, Ground 1 asserts error on the part of the trial judge in one respect - in directing the jury with respect to murder by reckless indifference. That was said to be an error because murder by reckless indifference formed no part of the Crown case as it was conducted. The Crown case was unequivocally that the appellant intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on his wife. 

284As Ground 1 was argued, however (both in written and oral submissions), a second error was asserted. The second asserted error was said to lie in a direction given to the jury with respect to a possible alternative factual scenario in the death of Ms Campbell. It will be necessary to explain that further.

285The argument on appeal proceeded on the basis that the direction on murder by reckless indifference related solely to the alternative factual scenario. As the Chief Justice has pointed out (at [185]), that is not so. What are asserted to be two distinct errors need to be assessed separately. 

286The Crown case was that the appellant did an act that caused the death of his wife, Janet Campbell, with the intention of killing her, or, at the very least, inflicting grievous bodily harm upon her. The act the Crown alleged was pushing her from the side of a cliff so that she fell to the beach below. It was not in dispute that, in the circumstances that prevailed, if it were established that the appellant did (deliberately) push his wife from the cliff, then the only realistic inference available was that he did so with the intention of killing her or at least inflicting grievous bodily harm. 

287The factual issue between the parties therefore did not concern the appellant's state of mind; effectively the only factual issue was whether the Crown had established to the requisite standard that the appellant did in fact push his wife from the cliff, causing her to fall to the rocks below. The alternative case, advanced on behalf of the appellant, was that Ms Campbell's fall was the result of accident, or, at least, that the Crown was unable to exclude accident as a reasonable possibility. If that were accepted, the appellant was entitled to an acquittal. 

288The mechanism by which Ms Campbell fell (to use as neutral an expression as possible) was the subject of expert evidence. However, in this respect, there was little, if any difference between the experts. The experts canvassed three possibilities as to the mechanism of the fall: that Ms Campbell slipped and fell down the cliff; that she tripped and fell down the cliff; and that she was pushed over the cliff. Both excluded a slip as improbable. Mr Beck, a biomedical engineer called on behalf of the appellant, considered a trip and a push to be equally consistent with the known facts. That was in accordance with the view expressed by Professor Cross, called in the Crown case.

289The difference between the two alternative factual scenarios is important. If Ms Campbell's fall was caused by her being pushed over the cliff, then there was no room for any rational view that her death was caused other than intentionally. (There was no candidate other than the appellant as the perpetrator.) On the other hand, a fall caused by tripping opened up the possibility of accident, with no intervention by the appellant. Indeed, as the case was conducted, it was assumed that the tripping hypothesis excluded intervention by the appellant. If the jury found that Ms Campbell tripped (or that there was a reasonable possibility that she tripped), her death was accidental, and the appellant was entitled to an acquittal.

290The expert evidence provided no basis for preferring the trip scenario to the push scenario, or vice versa. The jury was called upon to decide the mechanism of the fall by inference, based on the circumstantial case advanced by the Crown. This was not a case in which the jury could conclude that the expert evidence pointed to a push, from which it would have been a short step to conclude that it was the appellant who pushed his wife, and that he did so with the relevant intention. Rather, the push/trip alternative fell to be evaluated in the light of the mass of evidence concerning the appellant's hostility to his wife, his aberrant behaviour generally, and her fear of heights.

291A good deal of attention was paid, during the course of the trial, to the single shoe print left by Ms Campbell, as relevant to her position immediately before her fall. The importance of this evidence somewhat evaporated in the light of the conclusions of the experts that a trip and a push were equally consistent explanations for her fall. It may, however, have been a cause of concern to the jury. 

292Neither party adverted to the possibility that, on the assumption that Ms Campbell tripped, the trip was preceded by, and caused by, a push by the appellant. The trial judge raised with counsel this third possible scenario. At the close of the evidence, her Honour said:

""Up until now, the parties have almost entirely concentrated on whether it was a push or a trip. It occurred to me that it is, consistent with the facts ... open for the jury to find that the accused may well have either pushed or held Ms Campbell ... roughly by the arms and propelled her towards the cliff and then she tripped in the momentum that was initiated by the accused and fell over the cliff, in other words, I don't see that a push and a trip is necessarily inconsistent with the facts, nor do I think that it is inconsistent with the Crown case and likely to form murder.""

293Counsel for the appellant had no difficulty with this proposition. He agreed that acceptance of that scenario would render the appellant liable for murder. He made no protest that what was contemplated represented a departure from the case made by the Crown. He did not suggest that, if the trial judge were so to instruct the jury, prejudice would be caused to the appellant. Nor did he suggest that, had that scenario been proposed by the Crown, he would have conducted the defence differently. 

294Accordingly, the trial judge directed the jury as follows:

""We know that she was close enough to the cliff edge so that she could be pushed over the edge or close enough, so that if she tripped, while facing down the slope, she was unable to recover her balance and she fell over the edge; or she was close enough so that a firm push towards the edge, followed by a trip, propelled her over the edge where her shoe impression was found. We know that she tried to save herself by grasping a nearby branch of a tree and that it broke in the attempt.

You will appreciate that counsel in this trial have concentrated on one of two scenarios: Either Mrs Campbell was pushed; or she tripped. But I just want to remind you that they are not mutually exclusive. Even if the accused pushed Mrs Campbell towards the edge of the cliff so forcefully that she tripped as she was propelled forward and then was unable to recover her balance before going over the edge, that would nonetheless meet the legal requirements of murder, because the accused's act in pushing Mrs Campbell
is a substantially contributing cause of her death."" (italics added)

295Later, in the summing up, she said:

""It has not been suggested that, if someone deliberately pushes another person from a 50-metre cliff onto a rock platform below, that such an act, deliberate act, would not be done with the intention to kill or to at least cause very serious injury. That is not a proposition that could be seriously argued by anyone. Similarly, a deliberate push towards the edge of such a cliff would demonstrate very considerable reckless indifference to human life."" (italics added)

The phrase ""towards the edge of the cliff"" (as distinct from ""over the cliff"") was repeated more than once. The phrase has featured in the submissions on behalf of the appellant, as hypothesising a factual scenario different from that advanced by the Crown.

296In fact, it did not. The focus of the trial was on whether the Crown had proved that the appellant pushed his wife, causing her to fall to her death. The focus of the trial was not on the immediate consequences of a push - (if the jury found that that had occurred) - that is, whether the push caused Ms Campbell to fall over the cliff, or whether it caused her to stumble (and trip) before falling. Either way, the appellant would have been guilty of murder.

297The direction was given, in my opinion, in order to deflect the jury from the distraction of the evidence concerning the shoe print, which in the end went nowhere. It allowed a reconciliation of evidence that Ms Campbell might have tripped, with evidence implicating the appellant in the cause of the trip.

298The acquiescence of counsel in the discussion with the trial judge indicates that that was how he perceived it.

299It was asserted, in the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant, that:

""3.11 The irremediable prejudice to the defence in casting this alternative basis for liability is that it entirely undermined the forensic mileage the defence had made in cross-examination.""

There was, however, no identification of ""the forensic mileage"" made by the defence and said to have been ""undermined"". Trial counsel did not perceive any adverse impact on the effectiveness of his cross-examination.

300In those circumstances, in my opinion there is no foundation in this aspect of Ground 1.

301The second aspect of Ground 1 concerns the directions on murder by reckless indifference to human life. 

302Section 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) provides as follows:

""18 Murder and manslaughter defined
(1) 
(a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.
(b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.""

303Murder is therefore committed when the act (or omission) causing death was done (or omitted):

(i) with reckless indifference to human life;

(ii) with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm;

(iii) in an attempt to commit, or in the course of the commission of, or immediately after the commission of, an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years (felony murder).

Category (iii), felony murder, is of no present relevance.

304Proof of murder by reckless indifference to human life requires proof by the Crown that the act causing death was done by the accused person in the knowledge of the probability that that act would cause death: The Queen v Crabbe [1985] HCA 22; 156 CLR 464; Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378. 

305The decision in Crabbe finally established that, in order to prove murder by reckless indifference to human life, it is not sufficient that the Crown prove that the accused adverted to the possibility that the act (or omission) would cause death. Nothing less than proof that the accused was aware of the probability that that act (or omission) would cause death would suffice. That issue was the focus of the decision. In the course of the judgment (Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ), the Court recognised that there may be cases in which the Crown falls short of proving that the act (or omission) causing death is done with an actual intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, but nevertheless knows of the probability that it will cause death or grievous bodily harm. 

(That latter statement must be read in the light of the judgment of Mason CJ in Royall, in which his Honour said:

""Section 18 departs from the common law in that it requires foresight of the probability of death; foresight of the probability of grievous bodily harm is not enough: Reg v Solomon [[1980] 1 NSWLR 321]."")

306The directions given by the trial judge in this respect are extracted in the judgment of the Chief Justice. It is not suggested that they are other than perfectly correct.

307The facts in both Crabbe and Royall were somewhat unusual. In Crabbe, the Crown alleged that the accused (Crabbe) in a state of intoxication, drove a prime mover with a trailer through the wall of a motel in Ayers Rock and into a bar in which patrons were drinking. Five patrons were killed and many injured. The Court said:

""There has been in this Court some difference of opinion as to whether the knowledge which an accused person must possess in order to render him guilty of murder when he lacks an actual intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm must be a knowledge of the probability that his acts will cause death or grievous bodily harm ... or whether knowledge of a possibility is enough."" (italics added)

308In Royall, the female victim fell from the bathroom window of a sixth floor flat in Kings Cross. The evidence showed that, earlier, the accused had assaulted her, with some degree of ferocity. The Crown put its case in three alternative ways:


the accused pushed the victim out of the window; 
the accused attacked the victim in the bathroom, and she fell in the course of avoiding the attack; 
the victim, with a well-founded and reasonable apprehension of life threatening violence, jumped from the window.

309In that case, the principal issue under consideration was causation. The various members of the Court, in separate judgments, adverted to the question of murder by reckless indifference to human life as distinct from murder with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.

310Crabbe and Royall are important for present purposes because they contain indications that the state of mind necessary to establish murder by reckless indifference to human life is not co-extensive with the state of mind necessary to prove murder with intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. As will be seen, however, the distinction may be marginal.

311In this case, the trial judge was at pains to direct the jury in accordance with Crabbe. She explained that, before the appellant could be convicted of murder on the reckless indifference scenario, it was necessary to prove that he was aware of the probability (as distinct from possibility) that the act with which he was accused would cause his wife's death. In the circumstances of this case, there is very little - if any - difference between doing an act with an intention to kill (or to inflict grievous bodily harm) and doing an act in the recognition that it would probably cause death. Indeed, in Crabbe, the Court said:

""... The conduct of a person who does an act, knowing that death or grievous bodily harm is a probable consequence, can naturally be regarded for the purposes of the criminal law as just as blameworthy as the conduct of one who does an act intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. Indeed, on one view, a person who does an act knowing its probable consequences may be regarded as having intended those consequences to occur ... It is however unnecessary to enter upon that controversy. If an accused knows when he does an act that death or grievous bodily harm is a probable consequence, he does the act expecting that death or grievous bodily harm will be the likely result, for the word 'probable' means likely to happen. That state of mind is comparable with an intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm.""

Their Honours went on to distinguish between recognition of the probability of the consequence of death with the possibility of the consequence of death. 

312In Royall, McHugh J said:

""The state of mind of a person who knows that his or her act or omission, if done or omitted, will probably cause death cannot be distinguished in terms of moral culpability from the state of mind of the person who intends to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. But there is a real distinction in terms of moral culpability between the latter two states of mind and the state of mind of a person who acts or fails to act even though he or she knows that there is a possibility that the act or omission might cause death.""

313The trial judge emphasised that the real area of dispute lay in whether it was a deliberate act of the appellant that caused Ms Campbell to fall, or the fall was ""nothing more than a tragic accident"". That was undoubtedly correct.

314As I have said, it was always accepted that, if the Crown were able to prove that the appellant deliberately pushed his wife from (or towards) the cliff, the only inference available was that he did so with the relevant (actual) intention. Whether he did so was the central issue in the trial. Equally, it was plain that, if he did so, he was aware of the probability of death ensuing.

315In my opinion, given the manner in which the trial was conducted by the parties, introduction of the reckless indifference scenario was surplusage. There was no direct evidence of the appellant's state of mind (the appellant did not give evidence in the trial), and there was no basis in the evidence to distinguish between actual intention and recognition of the probability of death.

316In Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107, Barwick CJ said:

""Of course, it is not appropriate in every case to give a direction as to reckless indifference to the consequence of a contemplated act as an aspect of the crime of murder. Indeed, occasions for doing so where there is material from which an intent to kill can be inferred, must be unusual. A trial judge, in my opinion, must be careful in a case of that kind to examine the evidence closely to satisfy himself that that evidence could support a conclusion that the accused acted with reckless indifference. A direction as to that aspect of murder when there is not material to warrant a conclusion that the accused acted with reckless indifference is likely to cause confusion in the minds of the jurymen; and ought not to be given. However, in my opinion, in this case the jury, if they were unwilling to infer an intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm were entitled to accept the view that the appellant foresaw the possible consequences of the discharge of the rifle if it discharged or was discharged whilst he was in proximity to the deceased; that he must have known that the rifle was loaded; and that he approached the deceased with the cocked sawn-off rifle in that frame of mind and that he pulled the trigger to discharge the weapon: or they could accept the appellant's statement that he stumbled with the rifle held aloft, at a time when he merely wished to frighten her. On either view they were entitled, in my opinion, to conclude that the approach to the deceased in such a fashion was an act done with reckless indifference to human life. I would reject therefore the submission that the case was not one in which reference to murder by recklessness could properly be made.""

317In Royall, Deane and Dawson JJ dealt with a submission that murder by reckless indifference to human life had inappropriately been left to the jury. Their Honours said:

""It has, of course, frequently been pointed out that it is not appropriate in every case of murder to direct the jury upon reckless indifference: see, eg, Pemble v The Queen [[1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107]. Be that as it may, the mere fact that reckless indifference is left to the jury when it is unnecessary to do so, does not result in a mistrial if, in the circumstances, the direction would not have misled the jury or have been likely to cause confusion in their minds. In this case, having regard to the way in which the trial judge dealt with the subject, we do not think that the jury would have been misled or confused by his remarks, even if it would have been better had the trial judge confined the question of intent to intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. Of course, if reckless indifference is left to the jury, they must be properly directed upon the subject and the applicant complains that in this case the trial judge's direction was incorrect ...""

Their Honours went on to hold that the jury had been adequately directed on the subject.

318So it is in the present case. Like the Chief Justice, I am of the view that the introduction of the concept of murder by reckless indifference did not cause a miscarriage of justice. I also would reject Ground 1 of the appeal.

Grounds 3 and 4

319With respect to Grounds 3 and 4 of the appeal, I agree with the Chief Justice that the evidence did not establish that Associate Professor Cross was appropriately qualified to give evidence as a relevant expert. It is therefore not necessary to proceed to a determination of Ground 4. However, I should observe that I have some difficulty with the proposition that the findings of this Court, in a different case, concerning Associate Professor Cross' credibility or reliability (assuming he was otherwise qualified to give the evidence) amount to evidence (fresh or otherwise) that could be taken into account in determining the admissibility of his evidence: see Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 91. In my opinion the judgment of this Court in Wood v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 21; 84 NSWLR 581 was and remains irrelevant to the admissibility of Associate Professor Cross' evidence. I would therefore reject Ground 4 of the appeal (if it were necessary to decide it).

Ground 5: the evidence of Ms Ingham

320Ms Ingham gave evidence of a relationship which she had with the appellant that bore marked similarities to the relationship of the appellant and Ms Campbell. Her evidence was admitted both as tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act, and as evidence going to establish a motive on the part of the appellant to murder his wife.

321The direction given to the jury differentiated between the standard to which her evidence had to be proved if it were to be used by the jury as tendency evidence (to the criminal standard) and the standard to which it had to be proved if it were to be used by the jury as proof of motive (in which case the criminal standard did not apply).

322In this Court, it was accepted by the Crown that the evidence of the facts relied upon as tendency is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, no argument has been directed to, or against, that proposition. This is not, therefore, the occasion to consider whether it is or is not correct. For my part, I would not wish to be seen to assent to the general proposition that evidence tendered as tendency evidence in a criminal trial must, in contrast with other circumstantial evidence, be proved beyond reasonable doubt. I wish to reserve consideration of that question, which is of considerable importance.

323Tendency evidence is a species of circumstantial evidence. It is well established that facts relied upon as part of the circumstances in a circumstantial case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt when they are indispensable intermediate steps in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573, per Dawson J at p 579, and see Mason CJ at p 575, but not otherwise.

324The evidence of Ms Ingham did not fall into the ""indispensable steps"" category. Her evidence that the appellant had behaved towards her in a manner that bore similarities to the manner in which he had behaved towards his wife did not constitute an indispensable link in the chain of reasoning towards guilt. It was merely another circumstantial fact (if accepted) to go into the mosaic constituted by the circumstantial case. Why tendency evidence should, so far as the standard of proof is concerned, be treated differently to other circumstantial evidence is not apparent to me. 

325It may be that the proposition that ""tendency evidence"" tendered by the Crown in a criminal trial must be proved beyond reasonable doubt derives from the various judgments of the High Court in HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334: see also DJV v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4 at [129].

326If HML is the source of the proposition, then, in my opinion, the proposition is questionable, for a number of reasons.

327In HML, the accused was charged in South Australia with two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with his daughter, who was under the age of 12 years. Consent (or absence thereof) was accordingly not an issue. The issue in the High Court concerned evidence tendered by the Crown of other acts of sexual impropriety alleged against the accused which were not the subject of charge. The evidence was referred to as evidence of ""uncharged acts"", a subject that has frequently troubled courts of criminal appeal (and trial courts). There is a marked absence of unanimity in the judgments in HML.

328Hayne J (with whom Kirby J, at least, generally agreed) concluded that evidence of sexual conduct other than the offences charged may be admissible under the tests stated in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461, but may be used by the jury as a step in reasoning towards guilt only if the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ""of the premise for that chain of reasoning"": at [244]. But Hayne J emphasised (at [102]) that his conclusions were confined to cases in which absence of consent was not an element of an offence being tried. That caveat is important. 

329Even more importantly, HML was an appeal from a jurisdiction in which the issue fell to be determined on common law principles. South Australia has not adopted what was hoped would be uniform evidence legislation. 

330In NSW, it is to the Evidence Act that judges must look for guidance on the question of the admissibility (and standard of proof) of, inter alia, tendency evidence: R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700.

331I can find nothing in the Evidence Act to support the proposition that evidence tendered as tendency evidence in a criminal trial must be proved beyond reasonable doubt before it can be used in proof of an offence.

332Moreover, it is not at all clear, from the judgments in HML, what it is that must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Under s 97 of the Evidence Act, evidence may be admitted to prove a tendency on the part of an accused (or other person), from which it might be inferred that that person acted in conformity with that tendency - that is, in proof of the offence charged. Is it the facts of which evidence is tendered to prove the tendency that must be proved beyond reasonable doubt? Or is it the tendency itself?

333These questions cannot here be resolved. I emphasise that these remarks are not intended to express any concluded views. They are intended only to signal that I do not accept (or reject) the proposition that, in a criminal case, evidence tendered by the Crown as tendency evidence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. That remains a live issue to be determined in an appropriate case. This is not that case.

334It may be that the direction given to the jury was unduly favourable to the appellant. In any event, I agree with the Chief Justice that the direction was clear, and would not have confused the jury. I agree that, pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), leave to argue this ground of appeal should be refused.

The proviso

335Finally, I agree with the Chief Justice that, with respect to the error in admitting the evidence of Associate Professor Cross, the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) ought to be applied. I do so for the reasons given by his Honour, and for the additional reason that the evidence given by Associate Professor Cross did not, when analysed, advance the Crown case. As mentioned above in relation to Ground 1, both experts agreed that Ms Campbell could have fallen from the cliff by reason of being pushed, or by reason of having tripped. Neither proffered a preference.

336The circumstantial case put forward by the Crown was extraordinarily powerful. It is set out in some detail in the judgment of the Chief Justice and does not call for repetition. 

337Accordingly, I agree that the appeal against conviction ought to be dismissed.

338HIDDEN J: I agree with the order proposed by the Chief Justice and with his Honour's reasons, as I do with the additional observations of Simpson J.

2764739,Mahdi Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: Mahdi Jahandideh (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal and, if granted, appeals against the sentence imposed upon him on 21 May 2013 by the District Court. 

3The applicant pleaded guilty before Central Local Court to the offence of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely, 2151.3 grams of opium, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code). 

4As a consequence of the plea, he was committed to the District Court where he adhered to the plea of guilty and, on 21 May 2013, was sentenced to a head sentence of 5 years' and 6 months' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 8 months. He was also fined an amount of $100,000. 

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the basis that the District Court erred in imposing a fine: 

(a)In the absence of reliable evidence that the applicant had the means to pay the fine;

(b)In the absence of evidence that the applicant had retained a profit from his offence. 

Facts

6The facts were set out in the Remarks on Sentence, from which the following summary is taken. 

7Shortly, and relevantly, the applicant arrived in Australia by plane with two packages of opium concealed within tight-fitting clothing in his groin area. The net amount of opium imported was 2151.3 grams. 

8There were four layers of packaging around the opium and the applicant's fingerprints were found on the inner-most layer and the second layer of packaging. 

9The applicant provided an account of the reasons for his visit to Australia with what purported to be supportive written documentation. There were substantial discrepancies in that information and account. 

10The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing and gave very limited answers in a recorded interview, having requested the opportunity to explore the opportunity to obtain legal advice. 

Legislation 

11The grounds of appeal and the relevant provision dealing with the imposition of a fine depend quintessentially on the provisions of s 16C of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Commonwealth Crimes Act), which is in the following terms:

""(1) Subject to subsection (2), before imposing a fine on a person for a federal offence, a court must take into account the financial circumstances of the person, in addition to any other matters that the court is required or permitted to take into account.

(2) Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a court from imposing a fine on a person because the financial circumstances of the offender cannot be ascertained by the court.""

12As can be seen from the foregoing, it is a requirement of the Commonwealth Crimes Act that, before imposing a fine, the court must take into account the financial circumstances of the offender, in addition to any other matters that are required to be or permitted to be considered. However, s 16C(2) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act makes clear that the requirement does not prevent a court from imposing a fine on a person where the financial circumstances cannot be ascertained by the court. 

13The ground of appeal upon which the applicant relies is confined to a failure to adhere to the process required by s 16C of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. In the course of oral submissions on appeal, counsel rejected any reliance upon a denial of procedural fairness; any reliance on the severity of the fine, as such; and any reliance upon the severity of the penalty in circumstances where both a term of imprisonment and a fine were imposed. 

Consideration

14The ground of appeal agitated on behalf of the applicant relates, given the immediately proceeding paragraph, to an error in the process said to have been undertaken by the sentencing judge. Not only did the applicant, in the course of submissions on appeal, not rely on any denial of procedural fairness and any argument relating to manifest excess or a sentence that is more severe than is appropriate, but counsel for the applicant, quite properly, concedes that the fine has, in all likelihood, no practical impact upon the applicant. 

15There are a number of matters that require comment. First, s 16C(1) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act requires a sentencing judge to take financial circumstances into account. It does not dictate that the financial circumstances will determine the fine that is to be imposed. 

16The financial circumstances of the offender is a mandatory consideration, but, expressly, there are other considerations. In Darter v Diden [2006] SASC 152; (2006) 94 SASR 505, Doyle CJ said:

""[29] I consider that a substantial fine was called for, even after making allowance for the loss of the vessel and the period of detention. A substantial fine was called for because, in particular, of the seriousness of the offence and its prevalence. Deterrence remains a factor, even if it is attenuated by the unlikelihood of recovery of the fine in future like cases.

[30] Treating the offender's capacity to pay as relevant, but not decisive, is consistent with the approach at common law. In Flego v Lanham (1983) 32 SASR 361 at 365-367 Wells J considered this issue. He said at 366:
But the offender's capacity to pay should always be kept in mind as a factor worthy of consideration; it cannot be decisive (see generally Reid v Liersch unreported, Walters J, 23 September 1970), but it is likely to be of some moment.

Legoe J came to a similar conclusion in Winkler v Cameron (1981) 33 ALR 663. This approach is consistent with the view of Finlay J in Rahme (1989) 43 A Crim R 81 at 86-88, although that case was complicated by the fact that the sentencing Judge had been urged to impose a substantial fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment. In Smith v R (1991) 25 NSWLR 1 Kirby P (at 21) expressed opposition to the imposition of a fine which was beyond the means of the person fined. That case also was complicated by its particular circumstances. It was a case involving contempt of court by a prisoner serving life imprisonment, the response of the Judge having been to impose a very substantial fine. The matter was complicated by the life sentence being served, which rendered other forms of punishment impractical, but likewise made the prospect of payment of the fine illusory. Nevertheless, Mahoney JA (at 23-24) and Meagher JA (at 24) both upheld the fine, recognising that it was unlikely ever to be collected.

[31] I have considered these cases and remain of the view that the defendants' capacity to pay was a relevant consideration, but not decisive. There is nothing in the Crimes Act to suggest that it is a decisive factor. Nor, in my opinion, does ordinary sentencing principle require that it be so treated.

[32] The impact of s 16C of the Crimes Act was considered by Mullighan J in Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Rota Tech Pty Ltd & Ors [1999] SASC 64 ; (1999) 201 LSJS 390. He considered a number of the reported cases and (at 397) said:

It follows that the capacity of the offender to pay cannot be the dominant factor when fixing the fine to be imposed. It is an important factor along with the other matters which the Court must take into account pursuant to s 16A. Where the offence involves large scale drug importation for the illicit drug trade in this country, the financial circumstances of the offender, whilst relevant, should not assume prominence in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.

I agree with his approach.""

17I also agree with the foregoing approach and add only that consideration of the financial circumstances may increase, rather than decrease, a fine in order for it to be a deterrent for the offender. 

18Secondly, the terms of s 16C(2) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act seek to make clear that the court is still capable of imposing a financial penalty in circumstances where the financial circumstances of the offender cannot be ascertained by the court. 

19A sentencing court is not in a position to investigate financial circumstances or to call evidence. The sentencing judge relies upon the material that is put before the Court during the course of sentencing proceedings. 

20In this case, the sentencing judge (Transcript, 21 May 2013, page 5) raised with counsel for the offender the possibility of a fine, as well as imprisonment, in terms that asked counsel what she said about the fine and made clear that his Honour was referring to a fine over and above any period of imprisonment. His Honour then asked:

""I am just asking whether you have any submissions about the fine?""

21Counsel replied:

""Your Honour, my instructions are that [the applicant] has limited means to pay a fine, and his business activities were somewhat limited, although he might have been travelling for business he was paid on a commission basis, so in terms of his financial position it was not a healthy position and remains obviously, since he has been in custody, unhealthy. His wife is currently working, I am told, to support the family given that he is not bringing in an income, so in my submission a fine for this particular offender would not be appropriate. He is of limited means.""

22That is the totality of the submission made in relation to the question asked by his Honour. No attempt was made to adduce evidence in relation to that question or that issue. And no evidence was adduced directed to financial circumstances. 

23However, during the course of the sentencing proceeding, evidence was adduced from the applicant's brother, which was answered by way of comparison with the brother's financial circumstances. The exchange was to the effect that the brother saw the applicant in Korea where he was working; that the applicant was married; that he has a family; that he has two children, aged five and seven; and that he, the applicant, financially supports his family and financially supports his parents, including medical and support payments for his mother, who, it was said, has a disability. In contrast, the applicant's brother is not expected to contribute to his parents' health expenses, because he does not have the income and/or assets so to do (see Transcript, 16 May 2013, page 10-11). 

24Lastly, the applicant's brother was asked whether he was aware of any of the financial circumstances of the applicant and he answered:

""Actually he told me 'I have a little bit', but I didn't ask him much. He told me he has some problem but I didn't ask him much.

Question: Do you know how much he earned or was that something he didn't talk about?

Answer: I don't know I didn't talk.""

25The only other material before the Court that was relevant to this issue was material that suggested the applicant was engaged in business, interested in business ventures associated with livestock and mining and that he had undertaken something in the order of 100 to 130 overseas trips in the preceding period of approximately 2 years. There is nothing in the material accepted by his Honour to suggest that the applicant did not have financial circumstances that were sufficient to enable him to pay the fine imposed. 

26It must be said that very little material was put to his Honour, notwithstanding his Honour's request. It is difficult for a judge to enquire into the financial circumstances of a person upon whom it is anticipated a fine is to be imposed, other than by asking what, if anything, is to be put in relation to such a fine or such a penalty. Notwithstanding the request, no material was adduced on behalf of the applicant. 

27It is fair to say that his Honour did not have a high regard for the truthfulness and accuracy of that which emanated from the applicant. It is, therefore, not surprising that the submission, put on instructions, that the applicant had little resources should not be accepted by his Honour. 

28The applicant cannot point, as earlier stated, to any practical effect or prejudice associated with the fine that was imposed. The applicant does not say that the fine is manifestly excessive, or that the overall penalty, being the combination of the term of imprisonment and fine, are manifestly excessive or inappropriately severe. 

29Given the terms of s 16C of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, it is at least prudent for a sentencing judge contemplating the imposition of a fine to enquire of counsel for the offender as to the financial circumstances of the offender and, where a submission is made which is not to be accepted, to put such matters to counsel. Further, it is necessary to address both issues in the remarks on sentence. 

30Nevertheless, given the attitude of the sentencing judge to that which emanated from the applicant, it is unsurprising that the submission made as to the lack of financial resources would not be accepted. 

31The sentencing judge, in determining to impose a fine, expressly refers to the need for general deterrence and the appropriateness of a financial penalty in circumstances where a crime is committed for financial gain. The sentencing judge does not, in terms, state reasons for rejecting the explanation of counsel. Nor does the sentencing judge make clear that he is in a position where he could not ascertain the financial circumstances of the applicant. Nevertheless, the applicant does not complain about the lack of reasons. 

32His Honour did refer to the evidence about the applicant's business interests and the overseas travel. His Honour did not include in his remarks the express statement that these financial circumstances have been considered in fixing the fine. Nor did the sentencing judge express the view that he could not ascertain those financial circumstances. It would have been prudent to have done so. 

33Given that the applicant does not complain about a lack of procedural fairness; was asked, below, as to matters pertaining to the imposition of a penalty and put submissions, expressly, on instructions; does not complain about the lack of reasons for rejecting the explanation or for imposing a fine; and cannot point to any practical or legal prejudice associated with the imposition of the fine, it seems to me that the current application for leave to appeal is not an appropriate vehicle for discussing the requirements and process to be adopted when applying s16C of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. 

34Further, given the necessity of the Court to be satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted, there are insufficient prospects of success in the appeal. 

35In my opinion, the matter is not one in which the Court ought to grant leave and I propose that the Court refuses leave. 

36BEECH-JONES J: Subsection 16C(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) when read with subsection 16C(2), or even without it, only obliges a sentencing court to take into account the financial circumstances of the relevant offender so far as they are established to the relevant satisfaction of that court. If the material before a court is not sufficient to satisfy it of the existence of any particular financial circumstance pertaining to an offender then s 16C(1) is engaged in respect of it. 

37In this case, to the extent that the sentencing judge was satisfied about any matter pertaining to the applicant that might have answered the description of a financial circumstance, and there was not many, they were referred to in his Honour's sentencing judgment. Thus his Honour noted some evidence about the applicant's work history, his travel and his assumption of responsibility to pay his parents medical bills. In circumstances where his Honour noted those matters I do not consider the applicant has not come close to demonstrating that his Honour failed to comply with s 16C(1) even if His Honour did not expressly state he took them into account at the particular point in the judgment where he referred to the imposition of a fine. 

38Ordinarily I would be minded to grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. However, in view of the position taken by the other two members of the Court, I am content to agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J.

2764744,Health Care Complaints Commission v Parsons [2014] NSWCATOD 97,"reasons for decision

Introduction

1This matter, before the Occupational Division, is an inquiry into a Complaint lodged with NCAT by the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) against Amity Kim Parsons, an Enrolled Nurse (Division 2). The panel of NCAT conducting the inquiry comprised a presiding member who is an Australian lawyer, a registered nurse member, an enrolled nurse member and lay member who is not a nurse. Below we set out the decisions of the tribunal, our reasons for those decisions and the orders made by the tribunal.

 

What the tribunal decided 

 

2The tribunal cancelled the registration of Amity Kim Parsons on the register of health practitioners, in relation to nurses, kept by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia and maintained by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA).

 

3The tribunal ordered that at least two years elapse, from the date of the order in this matter, before Ms Parsons may apply (make an application for a review under s 163A of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) (the National Law) to the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New South Wales (NCAT) to be registered as a nurse on the register of health practitioners maintained by AHPRA.

 

4The tribunal ordered that Ms Parsons pay the HCCC's costs of the proceedings, as agreed or assessed.

 

Issues arising at the commencement of the hearing

 

5Ms Parsons was not present at the commencement of the hearing, so we had to decide whether we should proceed to hold the inquiry into the Complaint made against her by the HCCC in her absence. It was clear from NCAT's records of its directions hearings and from the statement, dated 18 August 2014, of Ms Dinahan, the solicitor employed by the HCCC, who had carriage if this matter, that Ms Parsons had been provided, in good time, with all the documents that the HCCC intended to tender to the panel in this case and that she had plenty of time to prepare her case, if she wished to. We were also aware that Ms Parsons had made it clear, on a number of occasions, including on the morning that the hearing commenced, that she did not intend to take part in it. We tried to contact Ms Parsons at the commencement of the hearing on the mobile number that she had been contacted on previously, but were unable to. We decided to continue the inquiry without her being present.

 

6At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the HCCC, Ms Talbert, tendered an amended Complaint to us and advised us that that document had been emailed to Ms Parsons. All but one of the amendments proposed simply to repair typographical errors. The substantive amendment added the single particular from complaint five to the particulars of complaint six. As we did not consider Ms Parsons to be prejudiced by these late amendments, we allowed them to be made and proceeded to conduct our inquiry on the basis of the amended Complaint.

 

The Complaint and what has to be proved

 

7In this matter, the HCCC's amended Complaint contained seven complaints which covered all five forms of complaint that may be made about a registered health practitioner under s 144 of the National Law. Those complaints are:

 

(1)Criminal conviction,

 

(2)Unsatisfactory professional conduct (and) professional misconduct

 

(3)Lack of competence

 

(4)Impairment, and

 

(5)Suitable person.

 

8Our role is to consider the evidence put before us as it relates to the subject-matter of each of the seven complaints. We have to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, by that evidence as to which, if any, of the seven complaints has been proved. It is only after we have found that the subject-matter of a complaint has been proved that we may take action in relation to it and consider whether or not to make a protective order. The responsibility for proving the subject-matter of a complaint lies with the party alleging it - in this case the HCCC.

 

The sources of the evidence

 

9The two volumes of documentary material relied upon by the HCCC in this case were tendered by Ms Talbert. That material was marked Complainant's Exhibits (CE) 1- 41. Three other documents were tendered. These were marked CE 42-45. No witnesses, other than Ms Dinahan on preliminary questions relating to Ms Parsons' non-attendance at the hearing of the inquiry, were called to give evidence at the hearing. The documentary material tendered to us included clinical and progress notes, documentation relating to Ms Parsons' admissions to hospitals and other places for rehabilitation and other material. It was this documentary material that gave us an understanding of Ms Parsons' history of drug and alcohol use.

 

The evidence 

 

10Ms Parsons was born in 1985. She completed a Certificate IV in Nursing at TAFE NSW and was registered as an enrolled nurse by the then Nurses and Midwives Board of NSW on 17 June 2010. However, despite this significant achievement, Ms Parsons had already had a turbulent life. Before she was 24 years old and before she became an enrolled nurse she had had five children. The first was born in August 2003 and the last in April 2009. The drug and alcohol assessment notes and other notes made during her admissions seeking opiate detoxification show her advising that she began drinking at age 12. In notes made on 31 January 2012, she advised she had not used alcohol for a year, but that she had been abusing it prior to that time. At another time she advised that she first had cannabis at age 13. She began to use amphetamines at age 15 and had continued to use amphetamines on and off from that time. The notes made on 31 January 2012 report Ms Parsons as advising that she started using heroin a year ago and used it ""at least three times daily"". She spent from $150 to $300 a day obtaining it. However, she claimed that she had reduced her use in the last few days before her admission for detoxification. She also advised that she used prescription opiates occasionally but not regularly. Her partner got these opiates ""off the street"".

 

11It is unclear when Ms Parsons began working as an enrolled nurse after her registration, but she stopped working as an enrolled nurse in May 2011, only 11 months after her registration. Notes from NSW Health's Mid North Coast Local Health Network at Port Macquarie dated 17 May 2011 report her as being ""9 days out of detox"" at Concord Hospital and that she had relapsed immediately into using heroin and speed. This report is consistent with her commencing heroin use early in 2011. The rest of the note is consistent with her having ready access to heroin. A further note, dated 1 June 2011 indicates that Ms Parsons rang to state that she had missed an appointment on 25 May and wished to make another one. She attended an assessment for opiate detox on 6 June 2011 and was accepted for detox to commence on 14 June. However she failed to attend to attend for the program to commence on that day. She had been using drugs on that day and agreed to come the next day, but did not attend. As there was no further contact with her, she was formally discharged fron the drug and alcohol service in Port Macquarie on 11 July 2011.

 

12By the time she reported her heroin use, her two eldest of her children were with her mother and her three younger ones were with their biological father. It appears that after she met up with her new partner she began to use heroin.

 

13On 3 December 2011, Ms Parsons went the Accident and Emergency Department of Wyong Hospital and was admitted from there to the Drug and Alcohol Unit with abdominal cramps and nausea and because she wanted detoxification from methadone and heroin. On that day she agreed to commence a period of detoxification immediately. Ms Parsons was admitted to the unit and settled in. However, by 10.30am on 4 December she wanted to discharge herself in order to fly to Western Australia in order to join her partner. She was counselled about the risks of doing this, but by 12.15pm she had signed a discharge against medical advice form which set out the risks of her discharge. She then left the hospital.

 

14Whether she went to Western Australia or not is unclear. However she came to the notice of the police when she was in the driver's seat of a car in Malta St, Fairfield East, a suburb of Sydney, on 3 January 2012. During a search by a policewoman, she was found to be in possession of a single valium tablet. As she was unable to produce a prescription for that tablet and refused to offer any other explanation she was charged with possession of a prescribed restricted substance (valium). She was convicted of that offence on 30 January 2012.

 

15At approximately 12.15pm on 15 January 2012, Ms Parsons stole $80.00 worth of petrol from a service station in Port Macquarie. At approximately 12.30pm on the same day, she stole $26.95 worth of petrol from another service station in Port Macquarie. She was subsequently charged with two offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception as a result of those two incidents and was convicted of both offences.

 

16On 31 January 2012 she returned to Wyong Hospital and was admitted with opiate withdrawal for detoxification. Her reason for her presentation was noted as being because her supply of heroin was no longer available because her partner was in gaol. The progress notes state that there was extensive scarring and new marks on both her forearms and feet.

 

17Her progress notes also show that she suffered withdrawal symptoms during her admission to Wyong Hospital. She was discharged on 8 February 2012 into the care of the Kempsey Community Health Centre. Her progress notes state that she was going to stay with her sister.

 

18Two days later on 10 February 2012, Ms Parsons assaulted her sister and damaged her sister's car. She was charged with both common assault and damaging property as a result of those events and was convicted subsequently of those offences.

 

19We note that while Ms Parsons was not obliged to report the valium offence to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (the National Board), she did have an obligation under s 130 of the National Law to report, through AHPRA, both the fact that she had been charged with the other three offences and the fact that she had been convicted of those charges. Ms Parsons reported neither the fact of the charges nor the fact of the conviction for those charges, within seven days as required by s 130. However she did note those convictions on her application, through AHPRA, for re-registration as an enrolled nurse in 2012. Other charges brought by the police against her will be referred to below. She did not bring the fact of either being charged with or convicted of those offences to the notice of the appropriate bodies as required by s 130 of the National Law.

 

20On 6 February 2012, AHPRA received a Notification (complaint) from a nurse working in the withdrawal management (detox) unit at Wyong Hospital stating that, while a patient in the unit, Ms Parsons had admitted to injecting amphetamines since 15 and injecting heroin and illicit prescription opiates daily for the past 12 months. The notifying nurse expressed concern that Ms Parsons may be impaired as a result of her substance use and may not be fit to practise nursing.

 

21That notification was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council of NSW (the Council). Its Notification Committee met on 24 February 2012 and resolved that Ms Parsons should attend for a health assessment and provide the Council with any information regarding drug use, charges or convictions and any other material that could assist the Council in the assessment of the matter. On 2 March 2012 correspondence was sent to Ms Parsons advising of the notification and of the matters resolved by the Committee. An appointment for her to attend a psychiatric assessment by Dr Samuels, was made for 8 May 2012. Attempts to contact Ms Parsons, though numerous, were unsuccessful until, probably as a result of an email sent to her on 20 August 2012, she contacted the Council by telephone on 22 August 2012.

 

22Some of what Ms Parsons had been doing in the interval between the time she left Wyong Hospital on 8 February 2012 and when she telephoned the Council on 22 August 2012 was reported on by Michael McCarthy the Nursing Unit Manager of Kempsey Drug and Alcohol Services in a letter to AHPRA dated 3 September 2012. In it he reports that Ms Parsons self-presented at Port Macquarie Drug and Alcohol in March 2012 and was seen by Dr Samara, a Staff Specialist, on 14 March. Dr Samara commenced Ms Parsons on Suboxone before she transferred to Kempsey on 20 March.

 

23Ms Parsons commenced work as an enrolled nurse at Kempsey District Hospital in early May 2012. Mr McCarthy states that she had stabilised on a dose of 16mg of Suboxone; ""and presented motivated in her quest to re-establish her life"". He also reported that she had provided clean urine drug samples and was eligible for take away doses (meaning that she did not have to come every day to a clinic to receive her doses of Suboxone).

 

24However, he went on to report that in early July 2012 Ms Parsons' partner was released from custody and, despite ""warnings of apprehension"" by those knowing her, Ms Parsons ""returned to him"". Mr McCarthy further reported that on 15 August 2012, Ms Parsons disclosed that she had, at a wake of a friend, relapsed. She was very remorseful and claimed it to be a one off. However, a urine sample conformed that she had used methyl amphetamine (Ice).

 

25When Ms Parsons contacted the Council by phone, she stated that she couldn't afford either the time or the money to attend the appointment with Dr Samuels. However she was advised that flights and accommodation could be provided for her at the expense of the Counsel. These were in fact booked and Ms Parsons was advised if this by email. Nevertheless, Ms Parsons did not attend the appointment and did not use either the flights or accommodation booked for her.

 

26On 28 August 2012, Ms Parsons was driving a car south, in the direction of Sydney, on the F3 freeway when she was stopped for a breath test. She was asked to produce her driver's licence, but was unable to do so. The further enquiries carried out by the police revealed that her licence had been suspended for non-payment of fines. She was charged and convicted of the offence of driving while her licence was suspended. As already noted, she did not report either the charge or the conviction as required by s130 of the National Law.

 

27The matter of the suspension of Ms Parson's registration as an enrolled nurse will be dealt with below. But at the hearing of her request for a review of the suspension of her registration, held on 6 September 2012, Ms Parsons stated that she did get to Sydney but ""really late"" on the night of 28 August and that the next day she; ""was so completely anxious"" that she couldn't go to the appointment with Dr Samuels. In his letter of 3 September 2012, Mr McCarthy reported that Ms Parsons saw Dr Samara, we assume in Port Macquarie, on 31 August 2012 and told him that she had not gone to the appointment in Sydney because she became very anxious. Mr McCarthy also noted in that letter that Ms Parsons and her partner had completed applications to attend Benelong's Haven Rehabilitation Centre and that they were scheduled to be admitted on 10 September 2012 where Ms Parsons would continue to have the support of Kempsey Drug and Alcohol services in relation to the slow reduction of Suboxone.

 

28Ms Parsons' last day of work as an enrolled nurse was on 26 August 2012 at Kempsey District Hospital, two days before she travelled to Sydney and was caught on the F3 freeway driving while her licence was suspended.

 

29On 30 August, the Council conducted an inquiry and suspended Ms Parson's registration with immediate effect. However, Ms Parsons sought a review of that suspension and at that review, held on Thursday 6 September 2012, stated that she found out that her registration had been suspended from staff at Kempsey District Hospital when she reported there for work. At that review Ms Parsons noted that she had advised the hospital of her drug and alcohol issues and that she was on an opioid substitution program at the very beginning of her employment there. In a letter ""to whom it may concern"" and dated 5 September 2012, the Director of Nursing at the hospital noted that Ms Parsons had worked full-time from 14 May 2012 and was on the opioid substitution program. Her report of Ms Parson's work at the hospital was positive starting with a reference to many favourable reports about Ms Parson's good patient care and work performance.

 

30At the end of the review, the delegates of the Council appointed to conduct the review told Ms Parsons that they were continuing her suspension but that they wanted her to report back after her period at Benelong's Haven. They were looking forward to her period of rehabilitation there being successful. They specifically asked her to keep away from sources of illicit drugs and any of the places where she thought she might be tempted.

 

31Despite the anxiety about Ms Parsons teaming up again with her partner, there were hopes that the period in rehabilitation at Benelong's Haven would have a good outcome. On 5 September 2012, Mr McCarthy wrote to Centrelink advising them that it was anticipated that Ms Parsons would be at Benelong's Haven for two to three months. He also noted that Ms Parsons would be able to resume full-time employment at Kempsey District Hospital after she had completed her stay at Benelong's and her suspension had been lifted.

 

32However, Ms Parson's progress notes from Kempsey Community Health Drug and Alcohol show her admitting on 31 August 2012 that she had been using amphetamines once or twice weekly for the last three weeks. Her progress notes for 11 September 2012 show that between 31 August and 9 September 2012 she was using up to $300 of heroin daily and for amphetamines $200 daily.

 

33On Monday 10 September 2012 Ms Parsons did go to Benelong's Haven with her partner. However he discharged himself on Saturday 15 September and she discharged herself the next day, Sunday 16 September. The Director of Nursing at Kempsey District Hospital brought that matter to the notice of the Council by a letter dated 26 September 2012. She also noted that the Kempsey and Other Drugs Counsellors had not been able to contact Ms Parsons or her partner. The Director of Nursing also went on to note her concern about Ms Parson's then current ability to practice as an enrolled nurse being aware that she had taken some illegal drugs since going to the Council earlier in the month. She also said that she currently supported the suspension of Ms Parson's registration as an enrolled nurse.

 

34Kempsey Community Health Drug and Alcohol closed their file on Ms Parsons on 9 October 2012.

 

35On 24 October 2012, Ms Parsons was driving what the police described as a vehicle of interest in Port Macquarie. When she did not indicate before turning, the police stopped her and discovered that she did not have a licence to drive because it was still suspended. The licence of another woman driver was found in the pocket of a jacket that belonged to Ms Parsons that was in the car. She was charged again with driving while her licence was suspended and also with stealing the driver's licence. She was convicted of both charges.

 

36After Ms Parson's suspension, the matter was then referred to be dealt with via the impairment pathway, but in February 2013 it was redirected to the HCCC for investigation.

 

37The HCCC's Complaint in this matter was received at NCAT on 5 February 2014 and, after two directions hearings, it came on for hearing on 18 August 2014.

 

38Port Macquarie Community Health provided an ""Update of D & A assessment details"" dated 19 February 2014 as well as progress notes from 2012 and April to June 2014 (CE 41). This material indicated that Ms Parsons had another attempt at rehabilitation either late in 2012 or early 2013 at ""Transformations Christian Rehabilitation"". Whether that attempt was completed or had any success is not known. However Ms Parsons moved from Port Macquarie to Kempsey and from there to Sydney arriving in Sydney in April 2013. She is recorded as indulging in polysubstance use, using opioids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines for three months before entering into treatment at Rankin Court in July 2013. She is then reported as having relapsed again briefly in November 2013 using heroin, MS Contin (morphine), Ice and benzodiazepines. The report states that she denied using ""any substance"" since late November 2013 and is noted as being stabilised on a set dose of methadone.

 

39The update described Ms Parsons as, ""happily single at present"" and focussed on her children. She had the hope to practise nursing again once fully stabilised. Also she had, ""nothing before the courts at present"".

 

40Her progress notes from February, April and May 2014 show her attending appointments or otherwise being in touch with Port Macquarie Community Health. However, in June 2014 there was an incident when police found others in a car but in possession of tablets dispensed to her. She had an explanation for how this happened and the notes, from the last entry on 9 July, show her intending to go the the police station to pick up her confiscated tablets and return them to the pharmacy that dispensed them to her.

 

NCAT's findings in relation to the complaints

 

Complaint one - Criminal conviction

 

41The particulars of complaint one set out the seven criminal offences which the HCCC relied on to prove that Ms Parsons had been convicted of criminal offences. The evidence demonstrated that the particulars had been proved so that we found that the subject-matter of the complaint, and complaint one itself, had been proved.

 

42We note that it was not part of the HCCC's case to allege, under s 149C(1)(c) of the National Law, that the circumstances of any of the offences, or the offences considered together, were such as to render Ms Parsons unfit in the public interest to practise nursing.

 

Complaint two - Impairment

 

43The definition of impairment, as it applies to health professionals (and others) under the National Law, has two parts - see s 5. The first part requires that the health professional, here a nurse, to have a physical or mental impairment, disability, condition or disorder (including substance abuse or dependence). The evidence in this case makes it clear that Ms Parsons has been using illicit and other substances, some over many years, in ways that indicate substance dependence, if not on some occasions, substance abuse.

 

44The second part of the definition requires that the impairment that meets one or more of the descriptions in the first part must also either, in fact, detrimentally affect or be likely to detrimentally affect the health practitioner's capacity to practise their profession.

 

45In this case the evidence shows that Ms Parsons has been using amphetamines ""on and off"" since age 15. She began using heroin in 2011. Her progress notes from 31 January 2012 note that she started using heroin a year ago and had been using it, ""at least three times daily since "". There was also evidence of uses of Ice and benzodiazepines. Although there were periods when she was not using drugs, there was also evidence that, between April and July 2013 she was using opioids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines for three months. She had another, apparently brief, relapse in November 2013 and was using heroin, MS Contin (morphine), Ice and benzodiazepines.

 

46While Ms Parsons' failure to attend her appointment with Dr Samuels could be seen as an example of drug use actually affecting her capacity to practise nursing by failure to meet one of the requirements statutorily imposed on her practise of nursing, there is no evidence of her drug dependence actually affecting her ability to work as an enrolled nurse. Nevertheless, we considered that it was a matter of common sense that her substance dependence was likely, at any time she tried to work as a nurse when she was using drugs, to detrimentally affect her capacity to practise nursing. Consequently we were satisfied that Ms Parsons did have an impairment. Furthermore we were satisfied that Ms Parsons still had the impairment at the time of this hearing. We agree with Ms Talbert's submission that, based on the totality of the evidence, it was a reasonable and available inference to draw that Ms Parsons' substance dependency remained in place. The evidence showed that she has had forms of drug dependence since age 15. Also since 2011 at least she had episodes of heroin use which, since 2013 have also included use of amphetamines, benzodiazepines and more recently morphine. While there is no evidence of a further relapse in 2014, there is no evidence that she has made any progress in overcoming her substance dependence and occasional periods of abuse.

 

47We were satisfied that the subject-matter of the particulars of complaint two were proved and that complaint two was proved.

 

Complaint three - Lack of competence

 

48What is alleged in this complaint is that Ms Parsons is not competent to practise nursing because she does not have sufficient physical capacity, mental capacity, knowledge and skill to practise nursing. This is because, it is alleged in the particulars, that she has substance dependence and further that she failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction from the Council to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels on 29 August 2012. The relevant provisions of the National Law are ss 144(c), 139(a), 145E(1) and 145F(a).

 

49Particular 1 of complaint 3 relates to the fact that Ms Parsons currently has an impairment, namely substance dependence. While that finding of fact led us to find complaint two proved, it also led to us finding that Ms Parsons did not currently have sufficient mental capacity to practice nursing. Our finding that her substance dependence, which is a mental impairment, was likely to adversely affect her capacity to practise nursing necessarily leads, in the context of this case, to a finding that she lacks the mental capacity to practise nursing. This is because her substance dependence is made up of opioid dependence which includes methadone, which she is currently being treated with, and heroin, her amphetamine dependence which is of very long standing, probably benzodiazepine dependence and now possibly morphine dependence. Dependence on these drugs, or even just some of them, makes it much more likely than not that her mental capacity would be affected to such an extent that it would be insufficient for her to practise nursing should she seek to do so.

 

50Particular 2 of complaint 3 alleges that she failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction from the Council to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels on 29 August 2012. The evidence shows that she admitted this to both Dr Samara on 31 August 2012 and to the delegates of the Council who took evidence from her, on 6 September 2012, in relation to her application for a review of the Council's decision, made on 30 August 2012, to suspend her registration as an enrolled nurse.

 

51Section 145F(1) states that, for the purposes of the National Law and any inquiry conducted under it, the failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the direction to see Dr Samuels, is evidence that Ms Parsons did not have sufficient mental capacity to practise nursing. We accepted that evidence as sufficient evidence of that matter to find that the subject-matter of Particular 2 to be proved.

 

52We accept Ms Talbert's submission that there is a statutory connexion between a complaint of impairment and a complaint of incapacity. We also note the views of members of the Court of Appeal in Lindsay v Health Care Complaints Commission [2010] NSWCA 194. Although this case was decided before the coming into force of the National Law, the provisions it deals with are, as noted in 2013 by the then Nursing and Midwifery Tribunal in Health Care Complaints Commission v Cieslak [2013] NSWNMT 5 at [84] ""broadly analogous in concept"" to the relevant provisions of the National Law. At paragraph [168], Sackville AJA stated:

 

There is clearly a close relationship between a finding of impairment, based on the existence of a disorder which is likely to detrimentally affect a practitioner's mental capacity to practise medicine, and a finding of lack of competence to practise medicine based on a want of sufficient mental capacity to practise medicine. Accordingly, a finding of impairment of that sort may very well lead to a finding that the medical practitioner is not competent to practise medicine within the meaning of [what is now s 64(1)(a) of the Act.

 

53We also note the comments of Giles JA at paragraph [2]:

 

With reference to [paragraph] [169] and following of his Honour's reasons, I respectfully do not think that there was any arguable deficiency in reasons in the Tribunal moving from impairment to the appellant not being competent to practice medicine. Reading the reasons as a whole, the basis for finding impairment inevitably led to incompetence to practice medicine. It was not a case where detailed explanation of the step from impairment to incompetence was necessary.

 

54Taking the subject-matter of both particulars, particularly particular 1, to be proved, we were satisfied that complaint three itself was proved.

 

55We also note that the approach we have taken in this case is consistent to the approach taken by the then Nursing and Midwifery Tribunal in Health Care Complaints Commission v Cieslak [2013] NSWNMT 5 at paragraphs 85 to 103 in accepting the connexion between a complaint of impairment and a complaint of incapacity.

 

Complaint four - Unsatisfactory professional conduct (s 139B(1)(b))

 

56Complaint four alleges that Ms Parsons is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct because she has contravened a provision of the National Law. That provision is s 130. Particular 1 alleges that Ms Parsons failed, within seven days of becoming aware of the fact, to disclose to the National Board on each of seven different occasions that she had been charged with an offence that she was required to disclose that fact to the National Board.

 

57Particular 2 alleges that Ms Parsons failed, within seven days of becoming aware of the fact, to disclose to the National Board on each of seven different occasions that she had been convicted of an offence when she was required to disclose that fact to the National Board.

 

58The subject-matter of both particulars is set out in detail in the summary of the evidence above. We were aware, from Ms Dinahan's evidence, that Ms Parsons had stated recently that she did not appreciate that even when her registration to practise nursing was suspended, she still had the obligation to disclose those matters to the National Board. If that was Ms Parsons' understanding, she was mistaken. A health practitioner whose registration is suspended is still registered during the entire period of suspension and is still bound by any statutory obligations of a registered practitioner such as those set out in s 130 of the National Law.

 

59The evidence of these contraventions of the National Law is clear. Consequently we were satisfied that the subject-matter of the particulars, and the complaint, was proved.

 

Complaint five - Unsatisfactory professional conduct (s 139B(1)(l)) 

 

60Complaint four alleges that Ms Parsons is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct because she engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the practise or purported practice of nursing. The only particular to the complaint alleged that Ms Parsons she failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction from the Council to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels on 29 August 2012. That matter is clearly established by the evidence. Consequently we found that the subject-matter of this complaint and the complaint itself was both proven.

 

Complaint six - Professional misconduct. 

 

61The allegation in complaint six is that the instances of unsatisfactory professional conduct found to be proved in relation to complaints four and five, either separately or taken together, show that Ms Parsons engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct of such a serious nature as to justify suspension or cancellation of Ms Parsons' registration as an enrolled nurse.

 

62The particulars of complaint six were first those of complaint four repeated. These were that Ms Parsons failed to give notice to the National Board that she had been charged with and then convicted of certain charges as required by s 130 of the National Law. The second was the single particular of complaint five repeated, namely her failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels.

 

63The particulars of complaint six did not allege that Ms Parsons was guilty of professional misconduct arising from the fact she had an impairment. However Ms Talbert did submit to the panel that if Ms Parson's failures to act, which were the subject-matter of both particulars, were to be seen as arising from her impairment, it was well established that a finding of impairment was no barrier to a finding of professional misconduct.

 

64As Ms Talbert noted, this matter was dealt with by the NSW Court of Appeal in Reimers v Health Care Complaints Commission [2012] NSWCA 317, at [11] to [13] in particular. In that case it was argued that if it was established that the health practitioner had an impairment then he or she cannot be guilty of professional misconduct. However Basten JA, with whom Campbell and Hoeben JJA agreed, pointed out that that proposition elided two ideas which need to be separated. The first proposition was that conduct which results from an impairment cannot be professional misconduct. The second was that it is manifestly unreasonable to treat misconduct which is the result of an impairment as professional misconduct.

 

65Basten JA stated that the first proposition was untenable because, as were the facts in that case, gross, repeated, incompetent medical practice did not cease to be such because it was caused by an addiction to alcohol, heroin or other drugs. The practitioner was not unaware of his condition or its consequences, and because he continued to practice as an anaesthetist whilst unable to exercise the necessary care, skill and judgment, his conduct could reasonably be found to constitute professional misconduct. Basten JA also found the second proposition to be untenable.

 

66In this case there was no evidence about the conduct of Ms Parsons during her actual work as an enrolled nurse other than ""many favourable reports ... [of her] good patient care and work performance"". While we accept Ms Talbert's submission, the issue was not relevant to this case. What we had to decide was whether or not the particulars alleged, either separately or together, amounted to professional misconduct. As already noted, the panel found the alleged conduct to be unsatisfactory professional conduct. Such a finding is a significant blot on a nurse's professional record and the panel confirms the obligation of a nurse or other health practitioner to comply with the requirements of s 130 of the National Law. However, given the nature of the offences and the particular facts constituting each of those offences in this case, we did not consider, either separately or together, they were of a sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension or cancellation of Ms Parsons' registration as an enrolled nurse.

 

67We also considered Ms Parsons' failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels as a serious example of unsatisfactory professional conduct. Again we confirm the obligation of a nurse or other health practitioner to comply with the requirements of s 145E of the National Law when directed to do so. However, given the circumstances of her failure to comply with the direction, the context of this case and her admissions of her failure to comply, we did not consider, either separately or together with the failures to comply with s 130 of the National Law, this particular example of failure to comply with the requirements of s 147E was of a sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension or cancellation of Ms Parsons' registration as an enrolled nurse.

 

68Given these considerations, we were not satisfied that the subject-matter of complaint six was proved.

 

Complaint seven - not a suitable person

 

69Complaint seven alleged that Ms Parsons was not a suitable person to hold registration as a nurse under the National Law. As in complaint six, the particulars of this complaint were that Ms Parsons failed to give notice to the National Board that she had been charged with and then convicted of certain charges as required by s 130 of the National Law. A further particular was that she failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels.

 

70The HCCC did not include in its particulars of complaint seven a reference to Ms Parsons having an impairment. As Ms Talbert noted during her oral submissions to the panel, the only particulars to complaint seven related to Ms Parsons' breaches of s 130 and her failure to attend to undergo an examination by Dr Samuels.

 

71As Ms Talbert noted in her written submissions to us, the content of the ""suitable person"" complaint is not defined in the National Law. However, she went on to submit that assistance in determining the content of that complaint can be obtained by considering s 55 of the National Law which sets out a number of grounds upon which a National Board may decide whether or not a person is suitable to hold general registration in the health profession it is the National Board of. The first of these is that the National Board may refuse registration if it forms the opinion that the applicant has an impairment that would detrimentally affect that person's capacity to practise the profession to such an extent that it would place or may place the safety of the public at risk - s 55(1)(a).

 

72As we have already noted, there is no evidence of Ms Parsons' substance dependence actually affecting her ability to work as an enrolled nurse. Our finding of impairment was based on her substance dependence being ""likely to detrimentally affect"" her capacity to practise nursing. There is a difference between the wording of the definition of impairment in s 5 which makes a distinction between an impairment which ""detrimentally affects"" and one which ""is likely to detrimentally affect"" and s 55(1)(a) which refers only to ""would detrimentally affect"".

 

73We also note that s 144 of the National Law sets out five forms of complaint that can be made about a registered health practitioner. After the complaints based on criminal conviction, conduct, lack of competence and impairment come the final ground of complaint ""otherwise not a suitable person"". The word ""otherwise"" may suggest that the suitable person complaint is intended to apply to circumstances not covered by the other four complaints. However, we did not consider that we needed to form a view about these matters in order to determine whether or not complaint seven was proved because we resolved that question by other means.

 

74Ms Talbert submitted that the offences Ms Parsons committed showed issues of dishonest and violence and a disrespect for the law. She also noted that the failure to attend the appointment with Dr Samuels showed a disrespect for authority. She also referred us to a list of factors that were seen as useful in relation to whether or not a health practitioner was of good character, the form of complaint replaced by the ""suitable person"" complaint. Insofar as those factors are still relevant, we accept that Ms Parsons' actions which led to some of her convictions were not isolated episodes. There was insufficient evidence before us to determine whether Ms Parsons' criminal convictions arose from a defect of character or whether they were errors of judgement, sometimes significant.

 

75The panel notes that it was not the HCCC's case that the circumstances of the convictions set out in the particulars to several of the complaints rendered Ms Parsons unfit in the public interest to practise nursing. There was little evidence before the panel about Ms Parsons' motivations in relation to the matters contained in the particulars to complaint seven. However there was evidence of her attempts to deal with at least some episodes of her substance dependence.

 

76Having considered the evidence relevant to the issue of whether or not Ms Parsons was currently a suitable person to practise nursing, we could not be satisfied that she was not a suitable person. Consequently we found complaint seven not proven.

 

Protective orders 

 

77After being directed to the relevant evidence in the documents tendered to us and after receiving Ms Talbert's written submissions and hearing her oral submissions on whether the seven complaints in this matter were proved, we adjourned to make our findings. After we announced our findings in general terms and continuing in the opinion that Ms Parsons did not wish to take part in these proceedings, we asked Ms Talbert to address us on the question of protective orders and costs.

 

78Ms Talbert submitted that because if our finding that Ms Parsons was not currently competent to practise nursing, we could, under s 149C(1)(a) of the National Law, make an order cancelling Ms Parsons' registration as an enrolled nurse. She advised that the HCCC requested such an order on the grounds that Ms Parsons' problems could not be overcome in a way that was safe for the public by the imposition of conditions on her registration. She also submitted that cancellation of her registration for at least two years was required for the protection of the public

 

79In making her submissions, Ms Talbert referred us to Health Care Complaints Commission v King [2012] NSWMT 9 in which the Medical Tribunal summarised the considerations to be taken into account when determining what protective orders to make. In that case the tribunal rejected the practitioner's submission that it may order deregistration only if it finds that the practitioner is permanently unfit to practise. It took the view that the health and safety of the public could be protected only if its decision addressed current unfitness, rather than limiting its consideration to permanent unfitness - see [25]. The tribunal continued in [27]:

 

The jurisdiction of [now NCAT] is protective rather than punitive. The protection of the public is associated with the protection of the profession. The protection of the health and safety of the public encompasses a range of considerations. First, there may be a need to protect the public against further misconduct by a practitioner. Second, there is a need for general deterrence. Third, the high professional standards of the profession must be reinforced and transgressions must be denounced. Fourth, public confidence in the profession must be maintained. Fifth, it may be desirable to make available to the public any special skills possessed by a practitioner. It may be that the circumstances of a particular matter require [NCAT] to give greater weight to some of these considerations, or to consider other matters bearing on the health and safety of the public.

 

80We took all these considerations into account, except the fifth one, in determining to accept Ms Talbert's submission and cancel Ms Parsons' registration as an enrolled nurse. We were of the view that the fundamental basis for Ms Parsons' current situation was her substance dependence which rendered her currently not competent to practise nursing because of impairment. However, we took a more positive view of Ms Parsons' current situation than submitted by Ms Talbert. Ms Parsons has stated a wish to return to nursing, but before she will be able to she will need to overcome her substance dependence and show that she is able to remain drug free for a substantial period. She will also need to show what she has done to revive her nursing competencies, or practical proposals to revive them. She will also need to show what she has done, and is continuing to do to rebuild and maintain her continuing professional development. These are key matters she would have to deal with, not an exhaustive list of the matters she may have to address before she would be allowed to return to nursing.

 

81We considered that Ms Parsons would need a minimum of two years to attend to all these things. Consequently we ordered that at least two years elapse before Ms Parsons could apply to NCAT to review the orders made by us and thus clear her pathway back to the nursing profession.

 

82We considered that, given the circumstances of this case, including the fact that Ms Parsons did not take part in the hearing or any part of the processes involving NCAT, she be required to demonstrate to NCAT, to the appropriate standard of proof that she is able to return to nursing. In doing so she would need to provide evidence from appropriate health professionals that she is both ready and able to return to nursing and to make her case to NCAT, including being questioned by it and other parties taking part in her application for a review and a reinstatement order.

 

83Ms Talbert submitted that we should reprimand Ms Parsons. We did not consider that a reprimand would do anything to protect the public or assist Ms Parsons in any attempt she may make to overcome the difficulties that lie between her and a return to nursing.

 

Costs

 

84Ms Talbert sought costs on behalf of the HCCC and submitted that the HCCC, as the successful party was entitled to its costs and had done nothing to preclude an order for the full costs that it was entitled to.

 

We accepted that submission and ordered that Ms Parsons pay pay the HCCC's costs of the proceedings, as agreed or assessed.

 

Orders

 

85The Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New South Wales (NCAT) made the following orders:

 

1. The tribunal cancelled the registration of Amity Kim Parsons on the register of health practitioners, in relation to nurses, kept by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia and maintained by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA).

 

2.The tribunal ordered that at least two years elapse, from the date of the order in this matter, before Ms Parsons may apply (make an application for a review under s 163A of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) (the National Law) to the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New South Wales (NCAT) to be registered as a nurse on the register of health practitioners maintained by AHPRA.

 

3.The tribunal ordered that Ms Parsons pay the HCCC's costs of the proceedings, as agreed or assessed.

2764792,Ghosh v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd & Ors; Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 4) [2014] NSWDC 151,"Judgment

The defendants' application

1This is an application by the defendants, pursuant to a Notice of Motion filed on 1 September 2014, seeking the dismissal of defamation proceedings commenced by the plaintiff, Dr Ratna Ghosh, on the following bases:

(a)Pursuant to rr 12.7 and 13.4 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""), due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute the proceedings with dispatch;

(b)Pursuant to ss 56 - 62 (and in particular s 61) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), on the basis that the plaintiff's failure to comply with court directions renders the proceedings an abuse of process, in the sense that the interest at stake is disproportionate to the resources of the Court and of the parties that will have to be expended to determine the plaintiff's claim.

2The defendants rely upon:

(a)The procedural history of the plaintiff's defamation claims (including the consolidated file, file number 2013/88183), as set out in the affidavits of Mr Paul Svilans sworn 1 and 5 September 2014;

(b)The pleadings (including the current statement of claim, filed on 27 June 2014); and 

(c)The defendants' requests for particulars of the statement of claim dated 15 November 2013 and 18 July 2014 as well as follow-up correspondence. No formal answers to particulars are provided, although Mr Dibb provided a draft on his own letterhead on 9 September, the day before this motion was heard.

3The 54 assorted claims for defamation brought against the defendants range in dates from 2009 to 2013. 53 of them are listed in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 2) [2013] NSWDC 145, which was one of a series of judgments I handed down in relation to objections to the statement of claim: see Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63; Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 206; Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 180. Proceedings commenced in Queensland in 2010 for 4 of these publications have been struck out for want of prosecution: Ghosh and Anor v NBN Ltd and Ors [2014] QCA 53. There have been eleven versions of the statement of claim to date, nine of them filed in proceedings 2013/88183 and two (including the current version) in proceedings 2014/63022.

4The defendants submit that, throughout this litigation, the plaintiff has displayed ""a wholesale failure to engage with the processes of the court which reveals an arrant disregard for the importance of doing so"" (Templar v Britton (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 587 at [37] per McCallum J). Her failure to provide particulars of the statement of claim is simply the most recent example of this failure. The defendants submit that, ""after countless versions of the Statement of Claim and interlocutory hearings, the defendants are still in a position that they are met with an inadequate pleading"" (written submissions, paragraph 3). While some leeway was afforded to the plaintiff while she was self-represented, the inability to bring her proceedings into order since counsel and solicitors have represented her has continued (written submissions, paragraph 4).

5Any application to strike out proceedings on the basis of abuse of process requires an examination of the circumstances ""with great care"" (Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [161] per McColl JA), including the history of the pleadings and all other relevant circumstances.

The statements of claim filed in these proceedings

6The current statement of claim, the eleventh such document in these proceedings, was filed on 27 June 2014 and pleads imputations arising from two broadcasts and three Internet publications, between 5 March and 5 June 2013. The history of these successive pleadings illustrates the issues raised by the defendants in their application.

(a) The statement of claim filed on 22 March 2013

7The plaintiff commenced proceedings in the Newcastle Registry of the District Court claiming unspecified damages for ""repeated slander and defamation of 15 Bundall Road Surfer Paradise in the media"" (see Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63 at [13]). This pleading failed to comply with any of the requirements of UCPR r 14.30. The defendants' first application for summary dismissal pursuant to UCPR rr 13.5 and 14.28, filed on 17 April 2013, is set out at [3] of that judgment (UCPR r 14.28 is not relied upon in this application: Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWSC 897 at [50]). The plaintiff was not ready to proceed on the hearing date allocated and the matter was adjourned to 8 May 2013.

(b) The second and third statements of claim - 8 May 2013 and 17 May 2013

8As is set out in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors [2013] NSWDC 63, two days before the adjourned return date on 8 May 2013, the plaintiff faxed to the court a 56-page draft amended statement of claim which dropped the claim against Ninemsn Pty Ltd, joined two new defendants, NBN Limited and Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd and repleaded her claim as four actions for defamation on 21 December 2009 to 22 May 2010, 28 November 2011, a ""series of television shows"" in November 2011 and the claim for the broadcast of 5 March 2013. As the plaintiff did not provide a copy of the draft amended statement of claim to the defendants, the motion could not be heard on 8 May 2013. At the hearing the plaintiff handed up a different statement of claim to that which had been provided. As was the case with all the plaintiff's pleadings, none of the changes were underlined.

9The defendants' summary dismissal motion was stood over part-heard to 17 May 2013. I struck out parts of the statement of claim, including a claim for breach of privacy (Maynes v Casey [2011] NSWCA 156; Sands v State of South Australia [2013] SASC 44 at [612]-[614]) and for criminal defamation brought under s 257 Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) (a full list of the claims struck out is set out at [48] of my judgment). I also transferred the proceedings from the Newcastle Registry to the Sydney Registry Defamation List. I made an order for the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs on an indemnity basis because of the maze-like structure of the successive draft statements of claim, the scandalous matters in the particulars of aggravated damages and the bringing of a claim for criminal defamation (at [60]). 

10I will not set out all the orders I made on 17 May 2013, but it is relevant to note that the plaintiff's leave to amend in her next pleading was restricted to the following actions:

(a)The 13 June 2012 publication ""Crackdown on party houses"";

(b)Any claim for Internet publication of ""Crackdown on party houses"";

(c)The 13 June 2012 publication ""New powers to shut down Gold Coast party houses"";

(d)Any claim for Internet publication of ""New powers to shut down Gold coast party houses"";

(e)The 13 June 2012 publication ""Party House"";

(f)Any claim for Internet publication of ""Party House"";

(g)The 5 March 2013 ""A Current Affair"" broadcast;

(h)Any claim for Internet publication of the 5 March 2013 ""A Current Affair"" broadcast;

(i)The 6 March 2013 email from Stayz Pty Ltd;

(j)The 22 March 2013 publication ""Party houses a big pain on Gold Coast"";

(k)Any claim for Internet publication of ""Party houses a big pain on Gold Coast"";

(l)The 3 May 2013 publication ""Party House RIP"";

(m)Any Internet publication of ""Party House RIP"". 

11I directed the plaintiff to file and serve an Amended Statement of Claim in 21 days conforming to the requirements of UCPR r 14.30 as set out at [49] of my judgment. I also made an indemnity costs order in favour of the defendants.

12Over this period, the plaintiff indicated on each court date that she would be seeking interlocutory injunctive relief. I made orders for any such application to be made by Notice of Motion, returnable for the next directions hearing on 21 June 2013. That application was finally brought on 16 August 2013 and dismissed.

(c) The fourth statement of claim - 14 June 2013

13A fourth statement of claim was handed up in court on 14 June 2013. In the course of a long directions hearing, I directed a further statement of claim to be filed by reason of the matters complained of being out of order chronologically as well as the failure to attach transcripts of the many of the matters complained of, which made dealing with the substantive complaints impossible.

(d) The fifth statement of claim - 8 July 2013

14The fifth statement of claim is the subject of my judgment of 17 August 2013. I have set out the list of 53 matters complained of (taken from [4] of my judgment in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 2)) because examination of the dates of publications reveals that not only was the plaintiff exceeding the leave granted, but continuing to bring claims for proceedings which had been struck out as out of time and also in relation to the four publications which were the subject of proceedings in Queensland, which was an abuse of process: Maple v David Syme & Co Ltd [1975] 1 NSWLR 97.

15The defendants' objections included the pleading of up to 30 imputations for some publications, unidentifiable causes of actions such as breaches of the ""Voyeurism Act"", and failure to provide particulars of identification. The orders I made were as follows:

(1)The plaintiff's application for leave to file the proposed amended statement of claim is refused, but with leave to serve (but not file) a further draft statement of claim by 20 September 2013 in relation to publications 29, 30, 39, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46, 51 and 52.

(2)The plaintiff is to provide a transcript of such part of the 39th and 40th matters complained of which are in her possession and the first and second defendants are directed to make enquiries to locate the remainder of the publication.

(3)Proceedings against Stayz Pty Ltd and News Ltd are dismissed. The defendants in these proceedings are Ninemsn Pty Ltd (as first defendant), NBN Ltd (as second defendant) and Miss Katie Gregory (as third defendant).

(4)Plaintiff denied leave to commence any proceedings in relation to these publications against Justin Butterworth, Fairfax Media and Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd. 

(5)The particulars of aggravated damages and special damage are struck out with leave to replead.

(6)Pages 94 to 103 of the proposed amended statement of claim are struck out pursuant to r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) as embarrassing.

(7)Plaintiff's notice of motion filed on 16 August 2013 seeking interlocutory injunction dismissed.

(8)The plaintiff pay Ninemsn Pty Ltd, NBN Ltd and Miss Katie Gregory's costs of the application.

(9)Plaintiff to pay the costs of Mr Justin Butterworth, Fairfax Media, Stayz Pty Ltd, Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd and News Ltd, such costs to be their costs of these proceedings.

(10)Matter stood over to Thursday 10 October 2013 in the Newcastle Registry at 10:00am.

The sixth statement of claim - 20 September 2013

16This is the subject of my judgment of 10 October 2013: Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 206. The orders I made included the striking out of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh and Eighth publications, on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to particularise extrinsic facts sufficiently capable of identifying her and had failed to set out sufficient details of the person(s) who identified her in each of the matters complained of. Once again, I ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs, and in view of the hopelessness of the plaintiff's pleadings I ordered that such costs to be assessable and assessed forthwith.

The seventh statement of claim - 30 October 2013

17At a directions hearing on 1 November 2013 the plaintiff was granted leave to file in court a draft statement of claim served on 30 October 2013. The filed copy contained some minor amendments made between 30 October and 1 November 2013. A consent timetable was entered into for the defendants to request particulars by 15 November 2013 and for the plaintiff to respond by 29 November 2013. The plaintiff's notice of motion was stood over to 28 February 2014.

18This timetable never proceeded beyond the request for particulars administered by the defendants as the plaintiff has never answered this. 

19Unknown to the defendants, on the same day the parties were in court (1 November 2013), the plaintiff filed a notice of intention to appeal from the earlier judgment, despite being out of time (the plaintiff ultimately filed three appeals in the Court of Appeal; two of these were dismissed and one, relating to other defamation proceedings, was abandoned). Despite being in court with the defendants on the day that this occurred, the plaintiff kept from the defendants the fact that she had filed an appeal, which was not served until 21 January 2014. 

The eighth statement of claim - 28 November 2013

20This pleading is set out at page 259 of the affidavit of Mr Svilans. At the time that the plaintiff filed the eighth statement of claim (for which leave was not granted by the defamation list judge), the request for particulars sought of the previous pleading remained unanswered and the plaintiff had not informed the defendants that she had filed an application for leave to appeal.

21The special damages pleaded in this statement of claim are the damages upon which the plaintiff relies in relation to her current pleadings, according to the answers to particulars provided the day before the hearing of this application. Whereas the current (eleventh) statement of claim gives only an unexplained amount of $600,000 special damages, the particulars in the eighth statement of claim set out a series of claims as follows:

""B. Damages including special damages total claimed $555,500.00

Particulars of special damages as against all defendants:

(i) The plaintiff's loss of business and earnings from the holiday rental business as a result of the defamation and subsequent inability to rent out both of her houses

- $250 000.00 per annum for both houses ($500 000.00 per annum total) since 5 March 2013

- projected loss of rental income: $500 000.00 per annum total for both houses

(ii) The plaintiff's loss of business and earnings from communication of the defamation to subsequent listing holiday rental websites, resulting in each website removing the listing and forcing the plaintiff to refund all booked guests

- Stayz - $14898.00 refunded by plaintiff to guests in 2010

- Wotif - $9050.00 refunded by Wotif to guests cancelled by Wotif

(iii) The plaintiff's tax losses for both rental properties (attached)

- Financial Year ending 30/6/2012 $40 831.00.00 [sic] for 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise$24 969.00 for 26 Snowwood St

- Financial Year ending 30/6/2013 
$52 790.00 for 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise$19 559.00 for 26 Snowwood St

- QTRI 30/6/2014$12 427.00 for 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise$3 945.00 for 26 Snowwood St

- Projected tax losses: $60 000.00 per annum for 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise$30 000.00 per annum for 26 Snowwood St

(iv) The plaintiff's loss of business and earnings from her professional surgery business as a result of the defamation and subsequent threats from anonymous callers received by voicemail at the surgery

- $5000.00 per week since 5 March 2013

- Projected loss of professional income: $5000.00 per week for the duration of the current proceedings since 5 March 2013""

22The amounts claimed by the plaintiff in the eighth statement of claim for special damages equate to approximately $500,000 per annum for both the Bundall Road and Snowwood Street properties alone (the basis for any loss in relation to the Snowwood Street property is unexplained). The claim for the losses she suffered from reduced income from her medical practice up until 28 November 2013 adds up to $190,000 and continuing, which would currently be approximately $395,000 and continuing. The claim is confusingly presented; there is no explanation for the calculation of the sum of $355,500 for general damages, and the separate claims for each property and the loss of income from the medical practice since 2009 all add up to a sum well in excess of the jurisdictional limit of this court.

The ninth statement of claim - 26 February 2014

23The ninth statement of claim was served on the defendants, again without leave, on 26 February 2014 (the text of this document is set out on page 329 of Exhibit A). 

24The proceedings had been stood over from the previous year to 28 February 2014. In the intervening period, the defendants had been served with the plaintiff's applications for leave to appeal (which were filed out of time: Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 180 at [1]). The proceedings had to be stayed until these appeals could be dealt with. The orders made by Bozic DCJ on 28 February 2014 were:

(1)The Court notes: 

(a)The statement of claim filed by the plaintiff on 28 November 2013 was filed without the leave of the Court. 

(b)On 26 February 2014 the plaintiff provided the defendants with a copy of a proposed amended statement of claim and associated documents.

(c)The defendants oppose the plaintiff's application for leave to amend in the form of the proposed amended statement of claim.

(d)The plaintiff has commenced an appeal in the Court of Appeal in relation to, inter alia, the judgment of Gibson DCJ given on 10 October 2013 which concerned an earlier version of the plaintiff's statement of claim.

(2)Order that the plaintiff's application for leave to amend in the form of the proposed statement of claim be adjourned pending the outcome of the plaintiff's appeal referred to in 1 (d) above.

(3)Matter is stood over to Friday 16 May 2014.

(4)Liberty to apply on 7 days notice.

25What the plaintiff did not disclose to the court, or to her opponents, was that on that same day, the plaintiff or her legal advisers filed in the Registry a completely new set of proceedings against the defendants, being the proceedings in the 2014 court file numbered 2014/63022. These fresh defamation proceedings, although only brought against TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd and Nine Network Australia Ltd, consisted of five of the publications from the 2013 proceedings (for which no leave had been sought under s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)).

26It is these proceedings which currently form the plaintiff's case before the court. The first two publications are the broadcast of 5 March 2013, in which the plaintiff is not named, and its publication on the Internet, for which identification of the plaintiff by four persons are provided. The third publication is the 5 June 2013 broadcast of A Current Affair in which the plaintiff is named and interviewed. The fourth and fifth matters complained of are the Internet publication of this broadcast and the viewer comments on the Internet site about it.

27Mrs Barnett points out that the viewer comments have been the subject of a previous strike-out, and that leave had not been granted in relation to the bringing of a claim for this publication (see order 8(g) of my orders of 10 October 2013 striking out a reference to these comments, which was set out as part of the narrative but not as a separate publication). I cannot see a reference to this specific publication in my list of the 53 matters complained of in my judgment of 17 August 2013; the Internet publication of 5 June 2013 referred to there is the fourth matter complained of in the 2014 proceedings, namely the Internet publication of the third matter complained of. This is, therefore, the plaintiff's 54th pleaded claim for defamation. There has been no ruling on the complex issue of whether viewer comments on an Internet publication form part of the earlier Internet publication or should be sued upon separately, or on the imputations pleaded. 

28As is set out in more detail below, the bringing of these fresh proceedings resulted in a further application by the defendants for summary dismissal of the whole of the 2014 proceedings as an abuse of process, by reason of the fresh commencement of proceedings over the same subject matter without seeking leave pursuant to s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Act""). 

29On the day of the hearing of the defendants' motion to strike the proceedings out as an abuse of process, the parties agreed to the consolidation of the 2013 and 2014 proceedings, and I made the following orders:

(1)By agreement between the parties, proceedings number 2013/88183 and 2014/63022 be consolidated.

(2)The plaintiff is to pay the costs of and incidental to the Notice of Motion filed on 16 May 2014 and the Amended Notice of Motion filed on 16 June 2014, such costs to be assessable and assessed forthwith.

(3)Notices of motion otherwise dismissed.

(4)Matter listed for directions on Friday 4 July 2014 in the Defamation List.

30There are two matters arising from this application relevant to the history before me. The first is that, while this was a settlement of the defendants' s 23-based complaint of abuse of process, the plaintiff fought until the last moment. As is set out in the affidavit of Mr Svilans of 5 September 2014 at paragraphs 16 to 20, the plaintiff resisted until the last in relation to the consolidation application, and orders were made on 4 April and 2 May 2014 on that basis. The second is that the agreed costs orders reflect the unmeritorious nature of the plaintiff's conduct.

The tenth statement of claim - 28 February 2014

31On 3 March 2014, the plaintiff's solicitors in the 2014 proceedings served the statement of claim filed on 28 February 2014 which is set out as annexure K to the affidavit of Mr Svilans of 5 September 2014. This pleading claims damages for the five publications currently relied upon, but brings proceedings against only TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd and Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd. Mr Dibb told me he could not explain why the plaintiff would serve one statement of claim in the 2013 proceedings on 26 February 2014 and then file another, substantially different in form, on 28 February 2014 in the new 2014 proceedings, as another barrister, Mr Rasmussen, had appeared for the plaintiff at that time. 

32The amendments are, as usual, not underlined. It identifies the name of the firm of solicitors for the plaintiff as Carters. The changes included, in relation to special damages, the statement ""particulars to be supplied"". 

33On 2 June 2014 the New South Wales Court of Appeal handed down its judgment dismissing the plaintiff's summons for leave to appeal: [2014] NSWCA 180.

The eleventh statement of claim - 27 June 2014 (the current claim)

34The current claim was filed on 27 June 2014. The failure to answer the request for particulars dated 18 July 2014 in relation to this pleading has led to the current application. 

35Those particulars were, firstly, a request for clarification of the identities of the publishers (unhelpfully described as ""the defendants"" on all issues, without any delineation of which defendant was the publisher), and secondly for particulars of the ""vendetta"" from ""December 2009 and continuing"" referred to in the aggravated damages as well as of the special damages pleadings. 

The current complaint

36The defendants sent reminders to the plaintiff's solicitors concerning the outstanding particulars on 4, 8 and 28 August 2014 (affidavit of Mr Svilans, 1 September 2014, annexures ""B"", ""C"" and ""D""). The plaintiff's solicitors never replied.

37On 1 September the defendants filed a Notice of Motion returnable for 5 September 2014 and served written submissions. (This date was, apparently by coincidence, a date allocated to the proceedings in an earlier timetable for the previous summary judgment in relation to the s 23 argument which had since been resolved.)

38On Friday 5 September 2014 I expected, whether or not the argument proceeded, to see a copy of the answers to particulars. Counsel for the plaintiff instead sought an adjournment because he was briefed in an application in another court, and because of what he called the ""complexity"" of the proportionality issue being raised. Although I adjourned the proceedings at his request, I pointed out that the best answer to the complexities of the application was to provide the particulars in question. 

39The plaintiff's answers are now before the court. The plaintiff complains that the nature of the request for particulars invokes the proportionality principles in her favour, in that the courts should not permit the defendants to engage in what Kirby J has described as ""trial by interlocutory ordeal"": Favell v Queensland Newspapers [2005] HCA 52 at [22]. The defendants rely upon this response, and the inadequacy of the answers to particulars, as further evidence of the ""arrant disregard"" (Templar v Britton (No 2), at [37]) displayed by the plaintiff to her obligations as a litigant in these proceedings.

40As previously noted, the nature of the relief sought by the defendants requires a close and careful examination both of the claim by the plaintiff and the particulars sought and answered. I shall start by setting out the subject matter of the proceedings.

The claims brought by the plaintiff and the request for particulars

41The claims may be broadly summarised as follows:

Publications on 5 March 2013 on Channel Nine ""A Current Affair"" and online

42The first matter complained of sets out that A Current Affair was first contacted by the neighbours back in 2011 about the circumstances in which the plaintiff gave holiday lettings to short-term tenants whose partying antics and noise upset neighbours. Those neighbours filmed these activities and sent the footage to A Current Affair. The matter complained of states that ""since then, they've been dragged through court by the owner of this house"". The footage of these partygoers is shown again. Mr Campbell Newman and the Gold Coast Mayor, Mr Tom Tate, are heard to be calling for extra police patrols for what Ms Gregory calls ""around 500 party houses"" in ""residential areas of Queensland"". The local MP, Mr Ray Stevens, says local government planning restrictions are necessary. 

43The imputations pleaded are:

(a)The plaintiff, as a Newcastle home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting, in deliberately booking continuous twenty-four-hour Bucks Parties every weekend for four long years;

(b)The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was selfishly indifferent to the interests of her neighbours, who had become prisoners in their own homes;

(c)The plaintiff was knowingly permitting criminal behaviour to continue in her house, although police were called multiple times;

(d)The plaintiff was ruining and devaluing neighbours' houses by running a non-stop party house next door; 

(e)The plaintiff was responsible for sleep deprivation, anger and mental illness to her neighbours by deliberately permitting nudity, drunkenness and urination in full view of the neighbours, and loud noise twenty-four hours a day.

44In Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3) I struck out the 5 March 2013 publications on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to particularise extrinsic facts sufficiently capable of identifying her and had failed to set out sufficient details of the person who identified her. The plaintiff has now provided the names of four persons who identified her property from the brief shots of young persons enjoying themselves around a swimming pool on her property, next to the house. The extent of publication is, therefore, limited, in relation to both publications.

45Although I made extensive rulings on imputations in October 2013, Mrs Barnett informs me that there have been changes made to the pleaded imputations since that time, and a further imputations argument will be necessary in the future.

Publications on 5 June 2013 on Channel Nine ""A Current Affair"" and online

46These are, firstly, the television and online publications the text for which is set out in Schedule B to the statement of claim. Neighbours of the plaintiff are shown complaining about the partying and saying short-term rentals should be banned. The plaintiff is named and interviewed. The imputations are:

(a)The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her party house from hell during the entirety of weekends, every weekend;

(b)The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns;

(c)The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting;

(d)The plaintiff was callous in subjecting neighbours to non-stop loud music, adult behaviour and nudity right in their faces daily and continuously for 24 hours in a non-stop party nightmare;

(e)The plaintiff was a constant, vexatious litigator harassing her law-abiding neighbours with multiple identical court cases across different States until she manipulated and forced the verdict she wanted;

(f)The plaintiff was the real criminal, and committed a crime by photographing the third defendant outside the Newcastle Court House;

(g)The plaintiff falsely alleged she was a victim, when the neighbours are real victims [sic];

(h)The plaintiff was answering the third defendant's honest, fair, unbiased and factual questions with incoherent and irrelevant ""bizarre rants"";

(i)The plaintiff was cowardly in hiding in court for forty minutes to escape commenting on the false allegations she had made about her victim neighbours in Court;

(j)The plaintiff was initially telling lies to his evidence of constant 24 hour Bucks Parties at her house, but changed her story to a bizarre rant when confronted with proper video evidence;

(k)The plaintiff was knowingly permitting criminal behaviour to continue in her house, although police were called multiple times. 

47The imputations previously pleaded were the subject of rulings by me in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3) (see paragraphs [66] - [75] and order 5). Many required redrafting. The defendants indicated, in relation to the imputations pleaded for all publications, that there were still issues requiring rulings in relation to these redrafted imputations.

48Comments were made online shortly after this programme went online by viewers who claimed to have observed the plaintiff removing either a medical parking exemption or a disabled parking exemption from the dashboard of her car. One such comment was: ""Dear ACA, I just watch [sic] this story and was wondering why a DOCTOR [sic] needs a handicap parking spot, who [sic] walks quite briskly?"" 

49This is the subject of the fifth publication, which is annexure ""C"" to the eleventh statement of claim. The imputations pleaded at paragraph 12 of the statement of claim are:

(a)The plaintiff is dishonest because she uses a disabled parking permit on the car when she is not disabled.

(b)The plaintiff fraudulently uses a disabled parking permit.

(c)The plaintiff is a cheat.

(d)The plaintiff acts unfairly to genuine disabled persons by using a disabled parking permit to which she is not entitled.

50The plaintiff identifies four persons who downloaded this Internet publication.

51This brings me to the particulars sought by the defendants of the statement of claim.

The defendants' complaints about the correct identification of the publishers

52The particulars sought by the defendants require the plaintiff to identify with precision which defendant is being sued, and on what basis. The careless language of the drafting should, one would think, result in the statement of claim being redrafted by the solicitors with carriage of the matter, in accordance with their obligations under s 347 Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW). Instead, Mr Dibb's submissions set out a general answer, conceding, for example, that the first defendant is not asserted to be a broadcaster and the fifth defendant is not asserted to be liable for the Internet publication (contrary to what is set out in the pleading).

53The objections of the defendants on this issue are matters of tidying up the pleadings. The obligation of a party to plead his or her case with precision has been explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Kirby v Sanderson Motors Pty Ltd (2001) 54 NSWLR 135. 

54The defendants' objections are minor matters that would be responded to by any responsible practitioner with a repleading to identify the parties responsible as requested. Instead, the defendants' correspondence, including the follow-up letters, were ignored. What is more, the defendants had sought similar particulars in November 2013 and never received a reply. What the defendants point to here is the attitude of the plaintiff, which is asserted to be another example of the ""arrant disregard"" referred to by McCallum J in Templar v Britton (No 2), at [37].

55The remaining portions of the pleading for which particulars are sought are the claims for aggravated and special damages. The defendants' complaints here are of a more serious nature.

The claim for aggravated damages

56The plaintiff's prior claims for aggravated damages were struck out in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 2) and Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3), with leave to replead. Nevertheless, as late as in the 28 November 2013 statement of claim, the plaintiff was still seeking aggravated damages on the same bases of alleged serious criminal acts by the defendants, including spoliation (xiv), attempting to pervert the course of justice (xii), promoting civil unrest and causing warfare within the community (x), and stalking and harassment (ix). Some particulars were incomprehensible, such as particular (xix), which referred to: ""The defendants promoting of ""backyard battles"" in jungle law, where communities are Judge, Jury and Executioner"". Some did give a glimpse of the case the plaintiff plans to run, such as the 28 November 2013 pleading which recites (at (iv)) that the plaintiff relies upon ""continued, repetitive publication of slander from December 2009 to November 2013 despite the plaintiff's repeated complained to Press Council, ACMA, the editors and even Court Action in 2010 and 2013"" (see also particulars (v)(xv), (xvi), (xvii)). How these events constitute matters capable of entitling the plaintiff to claim aggravated compensatory damages is, however, not identified.

57The currently pleaded aggravated damages claim is made firstly on the standard basis of knowledge of the falsity and, secondly, on the bald statement that there were prior publications which amounted to a ""vendetta"". The only particulars given in Mr Dibb's draft answers about this ""vendetta"" is the nomination of publications 1, 2, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29 - 34 and 37 - 40 from the list of publications in my judgment of 17 August 2013 (which is why I have set this list out in full above). 

58I note that these are the broadcasts by the respective defendants dated 21 December 2009, 23 November 2011, 15 December 2011, 13 June 2012, 17 December 2012 and 5 March 2013. Only the 5 March 2013 publication survived being struck out. Closer analysis shows the inadequacy of this list. First, items 39 and 40 in my list were in fact the first and second matters complained of. This publication cannot also be evidence of a ""vendetta"" unless some link with the previous publications can be established, and the ""vendetta"" then explained in the context of conduct warranting the award of aggravated damages, rather than as going to malice, which is where claims of a ""vendetta"" are generally found. Whether as a basis for claiming aggravated damages or malice, where a ""vendetta"" is alleged, the relevant particulars (not the bare ipse dixit) must be stated. In Harrigan v Jones [2000] NSWSC 814 at [46], Levine J explained that a bare plea of ""vendetta"" was impermissible because such particulars were:

""...examples of the necessity to specify facts, matters and circumstances from which it will be argued that there was a ""vendetta"" against the plaintiff which actuated Mr Jones in publishing, as part of that vendetta, the material complained of. Without any such particulars these two [particulars] disclose nothing to the defendant.""

59In Harrigan v Jones, the offending particulars of the Reply and of aggravated damages were struck out in their entirety as ""grossly deficient"" (at [75]). 

60The next problem is the carelessness with which this list has been put together. It consists of:

(a)The first and second matters complained of (i.e. numbers 39 and 40 in Mr Dibb's list) are asserted to be part of the ""vendetta"", but not the remaining three publications. Why have these been excluded? Are they not part of the vendetta? Or have the first and second matters complained of been listed by accident?

(b)In my judgment of 17 August 2013, I struck out the claims based on the 33rd and 34th publications because the plaintiff could not prove that these broadcasts had ever been made. As I noted in my judgment, evidence was led by the defendants that no such broadcasts ever existed. What publications are in fact intended to be referred to here?

(c)Publications 1, 2, 23, 24 27 and 28 were published outside the limitation period. While it is possible to claim aggravated damages for other publications that are not the subject of proceedings, it is uncertain whether aggravated damages can be claimed on the basis of publications which are statute-barred, and/or which have been struck out on the basis of lack of identification (as is the case with the 2010 Queensland proceedings and many of the proceedings in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 2) and Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3).

61The plaintiff's continued failure to plead the particulars of aggravated damages with precision, after earlier pleadings were struck out, is of greater concern than would be the case if this were the first complaint. The answers to particulars now provided make no attempt to comply with the longstanding requirements set out by Levine J in Harrigan v Jones. The inadequacy of these answers is such that these particulars would have to be struck out, and the question would be whether the plaintiff would be given leave to replead.

62The principles upon which aggravated damages may be claimed are reviewed in detail by Applegarth J in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2013] QCA 33. As his Honour notes (at [41]), an award of damages in excess of the cap is permitted if the circumstances of publication warrant an award of aggravated compensatory damages. Where such a claim is made, a defendant must be vigilant to ensure readiness to meet the claim as pleaded. The defendants have been requesting details of the claims for aggravated compensatory damages since 15 November 2013 without success (see paragraph 16 of Exhibit B).

63Where a plaintiff fails to provide particulars of the statement of claim at all, including failing to respond to correspondence over a long period of time, the court may summarily dismiss the proceedings: Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244. In those proceedings, while the principal reason for the dismissal of the appeal was that the trial judge had not accepted the plaintiff's explanation for failing to attend court when the application for summary dismissal was brought, it is implicit in their Honour's findings that a continued failure to provide particulars of the statement of claim should be viewed seriously.

64Mr Dibb submitted that if I were inclined to strike out the claim for aggravated damages, the harm could be contained by a refusal to grant leave to replead. I have dealt with this submission in more detail below.

The special damages claim 

65The special damages claim, like the aggravated damages claim, was struck out with leave to replead in my earlier judgments. The changes in the pleading of this claim have been vast, ranging from particulars of millions of dollars (the 28 November 2013 pleading) to no particulars at all (the statement of claim filed on 28 February 2014 - see page 363 of the affidavit of Mr Svilans of 5 September 2013), to the latest statement of claim, where a figure of $600,000 is given, on the basis that particulars will be provided.

66On 15 November 2013 the solicitors for the defendants made the following objections (this relates to the claim as constructed prior to the 28 November 2013 particulars):

""17.1 As to the claim for economic loss, that claim is presently inadequately particularised and does not inform our clients of the case they are required to meet. No comprehensible calculation of the sums alleged appears to have been attempted. Further, the claim appears to attempt to seek damages in respect of loss occurring from December 2009 and (separately) in 2010 (each well before the date of the first publication sued upon in these proceedings). The particulars, in attempted [sic] to establish a quantifiable loss, make no provision for negative gearing or other expenses associated with the maintenance of a property as a holiday rental. Further, a claim for lost business earnings together with a claim for tax losses appears to be a double claim for the same loss. The alleged loss in respect of the operation of the surgery again is wholly unparticularised.

17.2 Please be put on notice that our clients require full and detailed particulars of the alleged economic loss, so as to lay a framework for establishing that the alleged loss was relevantly caused by the publications alleged in these proceedings. We further require you to provide us with copies of all documents that you rely upon in support of the claim for economic loss, including ledgers, banking records, tax returns, invoices, receipts and relevant correspondence.

17.3 We note that programs were critical of Gold Coast ""party houses"" in general, and in that respect it is arguable that you cannot ascribe any loss solely to our clients' alleged publications, particularly where (as you are well aware) there were other publications (such as the Gold Coast Bulletin) also reporting on the issue which will have had a significant impact upon an alleged causation. As an illustration of the serious problems your economic loss claim faces in circumstances such as this, we refer you to the decision in Born Brands Pty ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (no 6) [2013] NSWSC 1651, particular [sic] paragraph 173.

17.4 In the event you fail to provide full particulars of your alleged economic loss, which clearly demonstrates how the loss has been calculated and how causation is to be established, out clients will be forced to apply to have the economic loss claim struck out.""

67The only answer to this letter was the filing (without leave) of the statement of claim of 28 November 2013, which was in turn replaced with statements of claim stating firstly only that particulars would be supplied and then, in the latest claim, providing an unparticularised claim for $600,000. It was this latest claim which resulted in the latest request for particulars, which the plaintiff has similarly ignored up until the hearing of this motion.

68The problems may be summarised as follows:

(a)The current pleading contains a bald statement of $600,000 and states that further particulars will be provided. The failure to provide any particularisation of such a significant claim until the day before this hearing is unacceptable.

(b)The plaintiff claims far more than $600,000, as Mr Dibb's submissions (relying on the 28 November 2013 statement of claim calculation) make clear, and any special damages claim is likely to be for an amount in excess of the jurisdiction of this court.

(c)The plaintiff now answers these longstanding requests merely by referring to the 28 November 2013 statement of claim as if those particulars are set out here (see the final paragraph of Mr Dibb's draft answers to particulars). I have already noted this pleading's assertions of $355,500 general damages, $555,000 special damages and a further $5,000 per week since 5 June 2013 (approximately 66 weeks to date, which equates to $330,000, and continuing) and $2500 a week since 21 December 2009 (approximately 244 weeks to date, which equates to $610,000, and continuing) although the extent of publication is limited in relation to 4 of the 5 publications. How can these sums relate to 5 publications in 2013? Can a plaintiff claim for economic loss not only predating the matter complained of but falling outside the limitation period?

69Although the amount the plaintiff seeks in special damages is minuscule in comparison to the amount sought by Dr McGrane (McGrane v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2012] QSC 133 at [45] - [47]: claim for $95 million), it is just as fanciful. The ambit of Dr McGrane's claim for damages was one of the principal reasons for his defamation claim being struck out. Courts are increasingly giving short shrift to poorly pleaded claims for economic loss: Lighthouse Forward Planning Pty Ltd v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2014] QSC 217 at [42] - [49].

70Mr Dibb conceded that the claim for special damages (like the ""vendetta"" plea in the claim for aggravated damages) was unacceptably pleaded, to the extent that the court would be justified in striking these out without leave to replead. He submitted that any unfairness to the defendants could be met by striking out the claim for special damages entirely and that the matter could proceed to trial without these deficiencies standing in the way of a fair trial.

71In RB (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] 2 AC 110 Buxton LJ stated, at [136]:

""A trial that is fair in part may be no more acceptable than the curate's egg.""

72The defendants submit that the piecemeal removal of hopeless causes of action, inadequately pleaded or time-barred defamation claims and scandalous particulars cannot continue. Costs orders are no sanction, and the costs burden for the defendants continues to mount. There is delay at every stage of the litigation, even in relation to such a relatively simple matter as answering a request for particulars. They submit that the time has come when the fairness of the prospective trial is in jeopardy, and the proceedings should be struck out, on one or both of the bases set out at [1] above, as an abuse of process.

Abuse of process and summary dismissal

73Abuse of process is a doctrine of considerable breadth (Smith v Marshall [2014] WASC 185). It is necessary to focus closely upon both the factual background and pleadings in order to identify with precision the character of the alleged abuse of process complained of, as the remedy is available only in the most exceptional or extreme cases.

74In Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, McColl JA set out these principles at [78] - [80]:

""[78] The term ""abuse of the process of the Court"" (of which Anshun estoppel, the third principle referred to in Dow Jones, forms part) is used in many senses. What amounts to abuse of court process is insusceptible of a formulation comprising closed categories: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW); Batistatos v Newcastle City Council [2006] HCA 27; (2006) 226 CLR 256 (at [1], [9]) per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ. While accepting this proposition, in PNJ v R [2009] HCA 6; (2009) 83 ALJR 384 (at [3]), French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said that many cases of abuse of process exhibited at least one of three characteristics:

(a) the invoking of a court's processes for an illegitimate or collateral purpose;

(b) the use of the court's procedures would be unjustifiably oppressive to a party; or

(c) the use of the court's procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

[79] The power to stay proceedings permanently on the ground that they are an abuse of process should be exercised with caution (Moore v Inglis (1976) 50 ALJR 589 (at 593) (upheld on appeal (1976) 51 ALJR 207) per Mason J (as his Honour then was)) and only in the most exceptional or extreme case: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; (1993) 177 CLR 378 (at 392) per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ (approving the Court of Appeal's formulation of the test in Gill, Herron and Gardiner v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190). The onus of satisfying the court that there is an abuse of process lies upon the party alleging it, it is ""a heavy one"": Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; (1992) 174 CLR 509 (at 529) per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ.

[80] A decision to stay or dismiss proceedings on the basis that they are an abuse of process involves the exercise of discretion in the sense that ""although there are some clear categories, 'the circumstances in which proceedings will constitute an abuse of process cannot be exhaustively defined and, in some cases, minds may differ as to whether they do constitute an abuse' "". Accordingly ""as with discretionary decisions, properly so called, appellate review of its exercise looks to whether the primary judge acted upon a wrong principle, was guided or affected by extraneous or irrelevant matters, mistook the facts, or failed to take into account some material consideration"": Batistatos (at [7]) referring to R v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; (2002) 213 CLR 635 (at [73]) per Gaudron and Gummow JJ.""

75The circumstances in which proceedings will be summarily dismissed as an abuse of process should not be confused with summary dismissal under UCPR r 13.4 (as to which see Hamzy v Commissioner of Corrective Services (2011) 80 NSWLR 296 at [13] - [15]).

76Nor should such an application be confused with the complaint that a plaintiff is a vexatious litigant. However, the definition of abuse of process in Attorney-General v Altaranesi [2013] NSWSC 63 at [18] sets out a checklist which bears a chilling resemblance to the conduct of these proceedings by the plaintiff:

""What amounts to an abuse of process is insusceptible to a formulation comprised of closed categories: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (2006) 226 CLR 256; [2006] HCA 27 (""Batistatos"") at [9]. But an abuse of process can be defined inclusively. The concept includes: the pursuit of proceedings that have no prospects of success or no real prospect of resulting in a remedy of substance but which involve: (1) unjustifiable expense or use of judicial resources, Attorney General v Crocker [2010] NSWSC 942 (""Crocker"") at [17], per Fullerton J; (2) the pursuit of concurrent proceedings for substantially the same relief, or the pursuit of fresh proceedings after a remedial defeat in previous proceedings (Crocker at [17]); (3) the determination to persist in futile appeals in the face of repeated judicial observations that arguments were doomed to failure (Crocker at [133]); and, (4) causing others to incur legal costs in responding to hopeless applications in circumstances where the defendant has disregarded cost orders already made against him (Crocker at [134])."" 

77I shall first consider the application for summary dismissal under UCPR rr 12.7 and 13.4. 

The application under UCPR rr 12.7 and 13.4

78The principal basis upon which the defendants bring their application is pursuant to UCPR r 12.7, as applied in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1850 (see especially at [28]). In the course of dismissing the appeal (Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288), Ward JA, with whom Emmett and Gleeson JJA agreed, stated (at [101] - [103]):

""[101] The submission that there was an intentional and contumelious default on the part of Dr Dank echoes the statement in Birkett v James [1978] AC 297 at 318 to the effect that the power to dismiss proceedings for want of prosecution should be exercised only in such a case or where there has been inordinate or inexcusable delay giving rise to a substantial risk that a fair trial would not be possible or of serious prejudice to the defendant.

[102] Having regard to the introduction of ss 56-60 of the Civil Procedure Act, it has been suggested that the above statement of principle must be seen as having been modified (see for example State of New South Wales v Plaintiff A [2012] NSWCA 248 at [17] per Basten JA; Hobbs v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2013] NSWCA 432 at [52] per Barrett JA).

[103] The authorities make clear that what is involved in the exercise of the power under rule 12.7 is a balancing exercise, in the course of which a variety of factors may be considered (see, for example, Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527).""

79In Dank, the issue was not delay but failure to engage in the litigation process. 

80Applications to strike out for want of prosecution have traditionally been brought on the basis of delay. An example of the changing views as to what constitutes delay may be seen in Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWSC 338; Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174 at [62]. The matter complained of was written in 1993; proceedings were commenced in 1996 but did not go to trial until 2005, by which time the defendant was too ill to give evidence; an application for permanent stay was refused on the basis that it was not an abuse of process for the plaintiff to proceed (Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246). However, the introduction of case management rules, and the court's approach to their enforcement, has resulted in a shift of emphasis from delay to failure to engage fairly in the litigation process. 

81Delay alone is still relevant: in Ghosh and Anor v NBN Ltd and Ors [2014] QCA 53, the Queensland Supreme Court took a different view to that taken in the Court of Appeal in Dank, where the Court approved the principles set out in Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527. In Ghosh and Anor v NBN Ltd and Ors, the plaintiff, who is also the plaintiff in these proceedings, commenced proceedings in 2010 but thereafter took no steps for two years. This was sufficient for her claim to be struck out. By comparison, in Hoser v Hartcher, the plaintiff similarly commenced proceedings by filing a statement of claim and took no further steps for three years, apparently because he was in gaol for part of that time. During the three years of inaction, the government of which the defendant was a member went out of office and the department of which he was Minister was reorganised, and when the action was reactivated they had problems locating documents and witnesses. Simpson J held that the failure of the defendants to take steps to pursue the proceedings, and to collect and retain evidence for the hearing, was fatal and outweighed all other considerations, including the likely weakness of the plaintiff's case and his own delay. 

82Is Hoser v Hartcher still the appropriate test, or is it too generous to the claimants? In Bi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 17, Sackville AJA stated at [41]:

""[41] The Judicial Registrar stated the principles governing the application in terms which recognise that the ultimate question is whether, having balanced the prejudice to each party, justice demands that the application be dismissed. On one view, the statement of principle derived from the judgment of Simpson J in Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527 may be somewhat too generous to the claimants: cf Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd v Cassar [2009] NSWCA 230; Aon Risk Services Pty Ltd v Australia National University [2009] HCA 27; 239 CLR 175; Civil Procedure Act, ss 56-60. In any event, her Honour's statement of the relevant principles reveals no error.""

83Allsop P concurred at [46] with Sackville AJA's additional comments and went on to state at [49]:

""[49] In particular, I would like to add that careful attention to the Civil Procedure Act and ss 56-60 is what is required in each case. While I in no way criticise the terms of Hoser v Hartcher as laid down at the time that decision was made and without wishing to be critical in any way of it, I would say that the surest guide to be employed in any exercise of the discretion of this kind is a careful attention to the terms of the Civil Procedure Act, in particular ss 56-60.""

84Sackville AJA at [39] noted the comments of Judicial Registrar McDonald in proceedings with a similar, but lesser, degree of delay as being one where the case had reached the point where the court must say ""enough is enough"". This statement was repeated by Mrs Barnett in her oral submissions for the defendants in these proceedings, as the first basis upon which their application for summary dismissal was brought.

85Sackville AJA's more case-management-orientated approach to delay has been applied in other defamation proceedings. In Hanshaw v Seven Network (Operations) Ltd [2014] NSWSC 623, McCallum J referred to the principles enunciated in Bi v Mourad and struck out proceedings where failure to engage in the litigation process had occurred. 

86However, Hoser v Hartcher continues to be cited with approval, most recently in Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288 at [103], so I have taken its strictures into account. I am satisfied that the defendants have been meticulous in discharging the burden Hoser v Hartcher imposed upon them, by assisting the plaintiff when she was self-represented in order to help with compliance with timetables, by sending follow-up correspondence when she failed to do so, and by relisting the matter when there was default. Their proactive approach has, however, been criticised, as Mr Dibb submits that the interlocutory ordeal she has had to undergo means the proportionality principle should be exercised in her favour. 

87This litigation has been expensive for the defendants. Although costs assessable forthwith have been awarded, these are not yet payable. Mr Svilans' affidavit refers to assessed costs currently amounting to $72,000. Mr Dibb states that there are no outstanding costs payable by the plaintiff, in that these costs are currently in the process of assessment or appeal. All this does is to emphasis that in addition to the burden of defending these proceedings, the defendants face what is sometimes called ""satellite litigation"" in relation to disputed issues of costs (Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Ltd (2005) 63 NSWLR 300). As I have noted in earlier judgments, the defendants (including those no longer in this litigation) to date have shared representation, in an effort to keep their costs down. The likely hearing costs are unknown and, in view of the continuing interlocutory problems, impossible even to guess.

Summary dismissal of proceedings where failure to comply with orders is a factor

88The length of the delay and the number of attempts to correct a pleading, are not mere mathematical exercises, nor are they determinative of the relevant issues. The approach to take to complaints of abuse of process generally are explained in Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club [2014] NSWCA 288 at [125] - [126], [156] and [158]. McColl JA has additionally explained the fact-finding task in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd at [161] and [210]. The exercise of the power to dismiss proceedings summarily will always be used with the utmost caution, as her Honour notes at [79], citing Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392 and Johnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm) [2002] 2 AC 1 at 31 (see also McGrane at [50], where Boulton J refers to Spencer v Commonwealth (2010) 241 CLR 118 per French CJ and Gummow J at [24]).

What is the nature of the prejudice?

89Abuse of process may also arise where there is want of constructive activity, and not merely want of activity, if the result is that the fairness of the trial process is compromised. The above history of the disordered nature of the pleadings and erratic progress of this defamation claim resembles that seen in Al-Shennag v Woodcock [2013] NSWSC 696, where McCallum J noted (at [110] - [111]):

""[110] The present case is unusual in that the plaintiff has not been dilatory. However, the discretion conferred by the rule is not confined to cases of delay caused by inaction. The prejudice faced by Mr Woodcock is that he must remain active in litigation which is slow to be brought to finality, not for want of any activity on the part of Mr Al-Shennag, but for want of any constructive activity. The prejudice of being required to face Mr Al-Shennag's numerous specious claims and allegations is manifest. As noted in Micallef, the rule contemplates the possible termination of a case without determination of an issue between the parties.

[111] In the present case, there is a more compelling reason for taking that course than in the case of mere dilatoriness. In my view, there is a substantial risk that, even assuming the plaintiff is successful, the costs of the action have already become disproportionate to any award of damages Mr Al-Shennag may receive. The claim for economic loss is substantial but most probably ambitious. Leaving that part of the claim aside, and for present purposes disregarding the defences, the cost of the ill-conceived applications Mr Al-Shennag has lost along the way is not warranted by any likely award of general damages for defamation and thereby offends the proportionality of costs principle enshrined in s 60 of the Civil Procedure Act.""

90The same pattern of conduct is apparent here. The defendants point to the whole of the conduct of the litigation, but in particular:

(a)The eleven statements of claim in these proceedings containing 54 claims, nearly half of them out of time, and 48 of which have been struck out;

(b)The circumstances in which, faced with a stay pending appeal of the 2013 proceedings, the plaintiff commenced the 2014 proceedings without leave pursuant to s 23 and without notifying the defendants or the court during the 28 February 2014 directions hearing;

(c)The two applications for leave to appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal which were commenced out of time and hopeless in content;

(d)The circumstances in which the defendants have filed a series of Notices of Motion seeking to have proceedings struck out as an abuse of process in relation to the 2013 and 2014 files for nearly the whole of the time that these proceedings have been on foot, in circumstances where their complaints have been well-founded and resulted in increasingly harsh costs orders against the plaintiff, without these abuses ceasing;

(e)The substantial costs incurred to date, and which are likely to increase significantly;

(f)The ""arrant disregard"" (Templar v Britton (No 2), at [37]) evident in the plaintiff's refusals to provide particulars of the statement of claim, and the unsatisfactory nature of the draft ""answers"" provided the day before this application was to be heard;

(g)The inconsistent and unparticularised claims for what could be millions of dollars in special damages;

(h)The continued hopelessness of the pleadings and the plaintiff's inability, after eighteen months, to get any further than a statement of claim which clearly requires a twelfth amendment;

(i)The failure of costs orders, including indemnity costs and costs payable forthwith, in encouraging the plaintiff and her legal advisers to provide proper pleadings and particulars in a timely fashion. 

The plaintiff's submissions

91Mr Dibb submitted that I should disregard the plaintiff's past history, most of which is attributable to her being a litigant in person, in that her conduct of the litigation while there are solicitors on the record indicates that she has, in colloquial terms, ""turned the corner"". The defendants submit, however, that the most serious abuses of process (the commencement of the 2014 proceedings, the failure to provide particulars of her claim and the unsatisfactory answers put before me today) have occurred while the plaintiff has been represented. 

92Mr Dibb also submits that his client is being subjected, in these proceedings, to ""trial by interlocutory ordeal"" (Kirby J in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 52). This is a common, and often justified, complaint in defamation proceedings, as a number of judgments in Western Australia, notably Buckeridge v Walter [2006] WASCA 22 at [4] (Steytler P) and [23] (Pullin JA) have recorded. (In fact, Mr Walter became so discouraged by delay in his defamation action in the ensuing years that he discontinued the proceedings in 2011: Walter v Buckeridge (No 4) [2011] WASC 313). In Gray v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2007] WASC 274 at [28], Newnes J warned ""that excessive refinement of pleading issues is to be discouraged and courts should discourage, or minimise, the impediment to a fair trial presented by the process of 'trial by interlocutory ordeal', which is especially prevalent in defamation proceedings"". 

93However, that is not the case here. The complaints of the defendants do not reveal attempts at excessive refinement of pleadings by defendants intent on running up the costs. Examination of the eleven statements of claim filed in these proceedings shows sustained and serious breaches, not only of the rules of pleading, but also of fairness. Any impediment to a ""fair trial"" in these proceedings arises from the plaintiff's conduct rather than the defendants' applications to strike out pleadings which were hopeless on their face, particulars which were either incomprehensible or never provided, and to bring to the court's attention asserted breaches of rules of procedural fairness and/or statutory requirements, such as their complaints about the commencement of the 2014 proceedings.

Conclusions

94In the farsighted decision of Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37, Spigelman CJ (at [28] - [32]) explains the interaction of the provisions of s 3(d) in both the repealed Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) and current Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and their reinforcement by the principled enunciated in ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW): the Court's expectation is that court resources should be used efficiently, and these provisions are a significant qualification on the right to amend. By logical extension, misuse of the court's resources in a sustained and significant fashion of the kind that has occurred here, whether careless or deliberate, should be capable of resulting in proceedings being struck out in their entirety.

95Nor should it be the case that there are exemptions for persons who conduct their own litigation. Although flexibility should be shown to litigants in person, they are not immune from criticism where they indulge in conduct of the kind demonstrated here. Furthermore, the plaintiff is not a litigant who genuinely, but misguidedly, believes in the correctness of her conduct, but a tertiary-educated person, represented for the past nine months by lawyers with extensive experience in defamation. When faced with justified requests for information or complaints about her pleadings, the plaintiff and (at times) her solicitors have responded inappropriately, by filing fresh pleadings without leave, commencing concurrent proceedings in two jurisdictions as well as two sets of proceedings in this court, bringing claims and appeals out of time, and displaying a combative refusal even in relation to such uncontentious matters as a request for particulars of the statement of claim. At the same time, like Penelope's shroud for Odysseus (Odyssey, Book 2, l. 95 - 110), her case never seems to proceed further.

96The factual material upon which the defendants bring this application is unchallenged, beyond Mr Dibb's submissions that the 2014 proceedings are a fresh start and that the plaintiff's earlier failures should be glossed over because she was a litigant in person. However, the same pattern of conduct has continued.

97The plaintiff's attitude to this application is further evidence of her contumeliousness. The defendants, and the court, should not be subject to this continuing disregard of the obligation to conduct litigation in accordance not only with the rules of court, but with the basic courtesies. Courts must be vigilant to safeguard the fairness of the trial process, particularly in defamation proceedings, where the impact of Internet and social media publication means that large and complex defamation claims will be increasingly likely in the future, and where the public views the judicial process with a higher degree of scrutiny.

98For the above reasons, and conformably with the principles enunciated by McCallum J and the Court of Appeal in Dank, the 2013 and 2014 consolidated proceedings should be struck out as an abuse of process under UCPR r 12.7. 

The application brought under ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act and UCPR r 13.4

99I have set out above that these proceedings should be struck out as an abuse of process under UCPR r 12.7, which is the first limb of the defendants' application. The defendants alternatively bring an application for dismissal on the grounds of proportionality: Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWSC 897. The proportionality issue, although widely used in the United Kingdom, had never achieved acceptance in a court of record in Australia prior to McCallum J's decision. Essentially the defendants rely upon the finding of McCallum J in Bleyer v Google Inc at [62] that ""in an appropriate case"", the court has the power to stay or dismiss proceedings due to lack of ""proportionality"", where the resources of the court and the parties that will have to be expended to determine the claim are ""out of all proportion to the interest at stake"". The defendants rely upon the same evidence to submit that these principles, in addition or alternative to the submissions based on Dank, are appropriate in a case such as the present. The plaintiff opposes that characterisation of this litigation, and argues that principles of proportionality have found no favour at appellate level as well as being rejected in a series of decisions in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

100The application before McCallum J was based on what are called the ""Jameel principles"": Dow Jones & Co Inc v Jameel [2005] EWCA Civ 75; [2005] QB 46 (""Jameel""; referred to in her Honour's judgment, in the headnote authorities list and at [14], as Jameel (Yousef) v Down Jones & Co Inc). The Jameel proportionality principle followed on from earlier decisions on proportionality such as Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission [2000] EMLR 296 (where the proceedings were hopeless) and Wallis v Valentine [2002] EWCA Civ 1034 (where the publication was to one person and the proceedings considered a vendetta).

101The arguments that attracted the Jameel proportionality principle in Bleyer v Google Inc were:

(a)The very limited nature of the publication, in that Google was only a publisher of its search engine results for one person (at [65]-[85]): In these proceedings, the defendants point out that the internet publications are to four persons (with considerable overlap between them) as the ""outer limits"" (Bleyer v Google Inc at [21]). One of them is the plaintiff's husband. The plaintiff in these proceedings was named in the 5 June 2013 broadcast and I accept Mr Dibb's submission (paragraph 7) that there is no parallel with Jameel on this issue either; there is no need to define the extent of publication (cf Bleyer v Google Inc, considering Goldsmith v Sandilands [2002] HCA 31 at [2]; Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 33).

(b)The merits of the defence case, particularly the potential success of the defence of innocent dissemination (at [86] - [88]): While the defendants in the application before me had little to say about the success of the defences here, the facts in the matters complained of are largely not in dispute. These publications essentially consist of criticism of the plaintiff for allowing short-term letting of her rental property to noisy partygoers. However, neither side made submissions on the merits of their respective cases, so I have not taken this into account.

(c)The unenforceability of an Australian judgment in the United States (at [89] - [94]): This is irrelevant to the issues in this case. 

Support for the principle of proportionality 

102This principle receives some support from paragraph 23 of Practice Note No SC CL 4, Supreme Court Common Law Division - Defamation List (5 September 2014) which states:

""Proportionality

In determining any matter in the Defamation List, including any show cause hearing under clause 21 or 22 above, the Court will have regard to the principle of proportionality reflected in s 60 of the Civil Procedure Act.""

103Proportionality on Jameel principles has been applied in costs cases. McCallum J notes the application of the Jameel principles by Brereton J in Grizonic v Suttor [2008] NSWSC 914, a decision which was cited in Vizovitis v Ryan [2012] ACTSC 155. In Vizovitis v Ryan [2012] ACTSC 155, proceedings for declaratory relief concerning a costs agreement followed a ""lengthy and complex"" path to a hearing estimated at 1 - 2 days. On the 19th day of the hearing an application was made that the proceedings be summarily dismissed on Jameel principles (at [42]). Noting the approach taken by Brereton J in Grizonic v Suttor, Harper M (at [37]) referred to Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203, where ""the costs had been massively disproportionate to the damages"", but refused the Jameel dismissal application.

104Proportionality issues have been referred to on appeal, particularly in relation to the costs consequences of further proceedings. In Bellingen Shire Council v Colavon Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 34, Beazley JA adverted to ss 59 and 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) in proceedings where, if the appeal were allowed, it would involve a third trial (see also Tey v Optima Financial Group Pty Ltd [2010] WASCA 219 and Bi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 17). However, these cases do not refer to the Jameel principles and do not provide any support for the application of such a principle.

105There are very rare cases where public policy issues arise, and the plaintiff's entitlement to bring the proceedings must be weighed against the wrongful or criminal conduct involved (Calabro v Zappia [2010] NSWDC 127, discussing the Jameel principle). In Emanuele v Hedley (Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, Higgins J, 7 March 1997), Higgins J struck out a number of causes of action, including defamation (on the basis of the ex turpi causa non oritur actio principle), noting at 22 that:

""...in relation to the enforcement or otherwise of tortious liability involving criminal conduct, the seriousness of the illegality and the public policy in favour of denying recovery must be weighed against the right said to be violated and the consequences of that violation. 

The factors against the applicability of Jameel principles

106As the cases discussed below make clear, there is effectively no support in courts of record for the Jameel principles. The defendants in these proceedings additionally face a series of high hurdles in seeking to make out what McCallum J calls the ""rare"" case for the summary dismissal of these proceedings on such a basis. 

107Firstly, apart from the fact that four of the five publications were made to a limited audience, there is very little similarity between the factual issues raised as being relevant to proportionality in these proceedings and the issues put forward in Bleyer v Google Inc. 

108Secondly, the defendants specifically did not identify other grounds referred to in Jameel, these being issues not put forward in Bleyer v Google Inc, but which may have had applicability here:

(a)Other failed proceedings: In Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission, proceedings against the BBC were stayed because the plaintiff had settled (on adverse terms) similar proceedings against other media defendants during a trial, when it became clear he was going to lose. In Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, McColl JA at [153] - [156] and [160] - [161] distinguished Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission, on the basis of the ""very unusual"" facts of the case and because there was no doubt Mr Habib was seeking to vindicate his reputation in proceedings with reasonable prospects of success. Despite the plaintiff's unsuccessful proceedings in Queensland, the defendants do not submit that the Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission, line of authority is applicable. (This means that the difficult issue of whether Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, and Thomson v Lambert [1938] 2 DLR 545 (see Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, at [129] - [141]) have been overtaken by legislation (Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Cummings [2012] ACTCA 36 at [42]) can be put aside.) 

(b)Ulterior purpose: Nor do the defendants submit that these proceedings are a ""vendetta"" (Wallis v Valentine, discussed in Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, at [155]), or that the plaintiff is not pursuing these proceedings in order to vindicate her reputation (Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, at [160]).

(c)Serious harm and human rights: The defendants do not submit that the imputations are not serious. Even if they did, as Mr Dibb points out, there are significant differences between the law of defamation in Australia and in the United Kingdom, in part because of the impact of the European Convention of Human Rights, and in part because of the development of summary dismissal of defamation claims under the common law and s 8 Defamation Act 1996 (UK) (repealed), now enshrined in r 24.2 and Part 53 of The Civil Procedure Rules (UK) and ss 1(1) and 5, Defamation Act 2013. (UK)). These differences were noted by Basten JA in Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [41]. While it may be the case that the Jameel principle was not novel, in that it had been discussed (and dismissed) in Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, and that the proportionality argument can in fact be raised at trial (cf Miller v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC 3721 (QB) at [112] - [119]) and Vizovitis v Ryan [2012] ACTSC 155), his Honour noted the differences between the English and New South Wales procedural provisions and the impact of the European Convention on English law which made such considerations inappropriate in Australia. Those observations, although obiter, are compelling. 

109Thirdly, the approach taken by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in three recent decisions has shown a marked reluctance to accept Jameel principles:

(a)In Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, at [146] - [157] McColl JA rejected a claim of abuse of process based on Jameel principles, at [31], [112] - [120] on the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). At [210] McColl JA held that no issue arose ""which would call for the District Court proceedings to be struck out for efficiency reasons"", referring specifically to ss 56 - 59 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corp [2008] NSWCA 37 and Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission. This decision is discussed in detail below.

(b)As noted above, in Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [38] - [41] Basten JA refused leave to permit a Jameel argument on the basis that it was novel (Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, was not referred to), should be brought as a summary dismissal application and not a trial argument (but cf Miller v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC at [112] - [119]) and involved consideration of ECHR principles which have no place in Australian law. McCallum J (at [48]) considers that this decision was ""not determinative"" but the gravamen of his Honour's comments seems to have been that these principles have no place in a legislative framework providing a triviality defence. 

(c)In Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 180 at [16], an appeal was brought on the basis that I, as the first instance judge, had erred in taking into account the question of proportionality and/or ss 56 and 60. As the Court of Appeal considered I had not done so, leave was not granted:

""The only ground of appeal relied upon in respect of the proposed appeal is that the primary judge erred ""in taking into [account] the question of proportionality and/or the provisions of ss 56 and 60 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005"". It was conceded in oral argument that this ground was not relied upon by the primary judge and it was not submitted that the grounds which had been relied upon involved error.""

Implicit in this paragraph, and in the Court's discussion at [15] - [16], is that it would have been wrong to do so. 

110Fourthly, as to comity issues, the Jameel principles have been decisively rejected in two first instance decisions (Bleyer v Google Inc, at [43] - [48]:

(a)In Manefield v Child Care NSW [2010] NSWSC 1420 at [185] - [187] Kirby J rejected a Jameel argument on the basis that English legislation had ""no relevance"" in Australia, and went on to award $150,000. McCallum J considered (at [44]) that its relevance was doubtful because it was a submission at the trial and substantial damages were awarded. However, submissions have been made in such circumstances in English trials where the judge went on to award substantial damages: Miller v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC 3721 (QB) at [112] - [119] (damages of £65,000 awarded). 

(b)In Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 431 the plaintiff brought proceedings in relation, inter alia, to three conversations an American resident had, while in the United States, with three potential witnesses in dismissal proceedings brought by the university. The proportionality argument arose from the limited nature of the publications, the American defendant's limited finances, the lex loci delicti defences and the enforceability of any judgment in the United States. Garling J at [116] - [147] dismissed the relevance of Jameel principles entirely, although noting at [147] that no Reply had been filed and that it was inappropriate to deal with the argument ""at this stage"" (which makes it difficult to determine, given Basten JA's rejection in Bristow v Adams of the bringing of such applications at trial, just when they should be brought).

111Fifthly, the issue of proportionality must also be viewed through the prism of the statutory framework of the uniform legislation. There are two relevant provisions: the defence of unlikelihood of harm (s 33) and the special costs provisions set out in s 40:

(a)Unlikelihood of harm: While caution must be exercised in drawing inferences from refusals of leave to appeal, it is noteworthy that the continued failure of the defence of unlikelihood of harm has attracted no interest in the High Court, in that all applications for leave to appeal in relation to the current statutory defence (and its predecessor) have been refused. It is an increasing feature of defamation claims brought in Australia and litigated to the highest level of our court system is that many actions arise from publications to one (Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon (2011) 243 CLR 298) or a handful (Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203) of persons; both resulted in effectively nominal awards of $5,000. In both these cases, defences of unlikelihood of harm failed; in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon the defence failed so abjectly that it was not even mentioned beyond the first instance judgment, despite being one of the grounds of appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal. However, any attack on the utility of the defence in its present form in the age of mass electronic communication is unlikely to be successful: Adams v Bristow at [41]. 

(b)Costs: Concerns about the high cost of defamation proceedings have been raised in Australia since 1886, when Mr G Reid MLA moved a second reading of a bill in the Legislative Assembly to limit defamation costs for trivial verdicts (NSW Hansard, 11 October 2003, p. 4027). Following a defamation award of $5,000 in 2004 in circumstances attracting wide news coverage, costs reforms were effected in defamation legislation (Mr N Newell MLA, Hansard, 11 March 2004, p. 7134; Mr D Barr MLA, Hansard, 12 October 2005, p 18,518) which has now resulted in the enactment of s 40 in the uniform legislation. Notwithstanding the Jameel principle in the United Kingdom, defamation costs remain a feature of defamation actions in the common law countries of Europe: ""A comparative Study of Defamation Costs Across Europe"", Oxford University, 2008 (http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/sites/pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/files/defamationreport.pdf: UK libel costs 140 times higher than libel costs in civil law countries). There can be no doubt the cost of defending a defamation action to trial is beyond the resources of the majority of Australian working families, let alone the financially disadvantaged. The question is how the court determines whether these high costs are ""out of all proportion to the interest at stake"" (Bleyer v Google Inc, at [62]), taking into account the resources of the court and the parties.

112The uniform legislation also contains many statutory provisions drawn from the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) concerning abuse of process, but I note that, in Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, McColl JA considered such provisions irrelevant. McColl JA dismissed the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and their application to Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation as having no relevance to abuse of process, in that the proceedings in Dennis were not struck out but allowed to proceed (albeit without the benefit of the amendment the subject of the appeal). McColl JA appears to rule out both the Schellenberg/Jameel and Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) arguments decisively. However, Mrs Barnett draws my attention to McColl J's concluding remarks at [210], submitting that her Honour has, in Mrs Barnett's words, ""not closed the door"" to such principles where for ""efficiency reasons"", such a remedy may be possible. 

113It is to these arguments of the defendants, and to the careful examination of their applicability to proportionality in defamation litigation by McCallum J, that I now turn.

Proportionality and the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)

114Australian courts have not been prepared, in the face of previous technological innovations such as radio and television, to consider the single publication rule (Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Waterhouse (1991) 25 NSWLR 519 at 537; Jones & Anor v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (1996) 26 NSWLR 732 at 736), and have treated the Internet as raising the same issues as did television (Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [38] - [39]) or international trade of motor cars (at [186] per Callinan J). Nor has there been any further development of implied rights of freedom of speech, or other common law doctrines. The uniform legislation does not cover the field, but it seems clear, from the High Court's refusal of leave to appeal in cases such as Habib, that there is no likelihood of judicial development of a Jameel-style principle of proportionality at common law. Any answer must come from the application of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).

115The question is whether there will be cases where proceedings should be struck out for what McColl JA in Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd, calls ""efficiency reasons"" (at [210]), citing Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Commission, and ss 56 - 59 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Mrs Barnett submits that, although this apparently positive sentence at [210] is swimming in a paragraph of assertions which appear to negate it (such as the entitlement of a plaintiff to bring more than one set of proceedings against different defendants for similar subject matter), there must be examples of conduct giving rise to efficiency reasons, or her Honour would not have referred to the possibility.

116Once the court acknowledges that ""efficiency"" reasons may result in the dismissal of proceedings under the principles enshrined in ss 56 - 62 and 67 Civil Procedure Act, a picture of the kind of action which could be dismissed for such a reason begins to emerge. Such a cause of action would be one where there is a pattern, not simply of neglect of litigation in the Hoser v Hartcher sense, but rather the kind of ""arrant disregard"" (Templar v Britton (No 2), at [37]) and failure to engage in the court process in such a way as to ensure a fair trial.

117In Bleyer v Google Inc at [51], McCallum J states:

""[51] Can it seriously be doubted that the power conferred by s 67 can properly be exercised to stay proceedings in which the resources required of the court and the parties to determine the claim are vastly disproportionate to the interest at stake? That appears to be the position taken on behalf of Mr Bleyer. It was noted on his behalf that the principle of proportionality is expressly part of the overriding objective of the English Civil Procedure Rules, stated in cl 1.1 as follows:

(1) These Rules are a new procedural code with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly.

(2) Dealing with a case justly includes, so far as is practicable:

(a) ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing;

(b) saving expense;

(c) dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate:

(i) to the amount of money involved;

(ii) to the importance of the case;

(iii) to the complexity of the issues; and

(iv) to the financial position of each party;

(d) ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly; and

(e) allotting to it an appropriate share of the court's resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.""

118Her Honour went on to note at [54] - [57]:

""[54] Google Inc cited a number of decisions in which it has been said that, notwithstanding differences in language between the provisions in the two jurisdictions, the provisions of ss 56 to 58 of the Civil Procedure Act and r 1.1 of the English Civil Procedure Rules are substantially the same: Delta Electricity v Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc [2010] NSWCA 262; Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231; Owners Corporation - Strata Plan 61732 v TR Druce Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1024; Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure NSW at [60.15].

[55] However, Mr Smark noted that none of those authorities states that the express principle of proportionality in the English Rules is also contained (by implication) within s 56 of the New South Wales Civil Procedure Act.

[56] It is not, of course, a question of concluding that, noting the provisions of the English rules, the New South Wales Parliament decided expressly to exclude such a principle. As submitted by Mr McClintock, as instructive as it is to consider the law of England, it is not necessary to resort to that body of law in order to determine what is an abuse of the process of this Court. Sections 56 and 60 of the Civil Procedure Act are not to be read disjunctively. Further, there is ample authority in this jurisdiction for the proposition (for which no authority is needed in any event) that the just allocation of the finite resources of the court is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the court's authority, at least in civil matters.

[57] Once it is recognised that proportionality between the resources required to determine a claim and the interest at stake is relevant to the exercise of the court's procedural powers, it is a small and logical step to conclude that there will be cases in which the disproportion is so vast as to warrant the stay or dismissal of the proceedings. The converse proposition, that the court must always determine every claim on the merits, is expressly rejected by r 13.4 of the UCPR.""

119Her Honour considered (at [61]) that proportionality was a norm of justice which informed the question whether the court's jurisdiction had been regularly invoked and that (at [63]) the primary function of the court was to determine cases ""properly"" brought before it according to the law and to the merits of the case.

120The plaintiff seeks to invoke the processes of the court to vindicate the alleged harm to her reputation in circumstances which are wholly out of proportion to that vindication. The resources of the defendants in these proceedings have been tested far more than was the case in Bleyer v Google Inc, in that the costs in that case (a prospective trial costing $370,000) could be exceeded here for the interlocutory steps alone, if the plaintiff continues to conduct these proceedings as she has to date. Additionally, the resources of this court are strained by the need to deal with gross pleading errors, repeated listings and long directions hearings, where, after a series of judgments and two applications for leave to appeal, the statement of claim is still not in satisfactory form.

121McCallum J's concluding remarks in Bleyer v Google Inc (at [95] - [97]) refer to the disproportionate costs for the vindication of the plaintiff in the eyes of one person, where there were no prospects of enforcement of a financial damages award. However, proportionality, like abuse of process, is a broad concept. The facts of this case fit readily into the more traditional concepts of abuse of process which are referred to in proportionality on costs issues, but should also be factors to take into account if proportionality is to be a relevant factor in case management of defamation proceedings. As defamation cases become even more complex due to Internet and social media publication, and court proceedings increasingly open to the public gaze, the role of case management will become an increasingly vital tool in ensuring the fairness of the litigation process. 

122Accordingly, pursuant to ss 60, 61 and 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), I would alternatively order that the proceedings be dismissed on the principles of proportionality.

2764798,R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273,"Judgment
1HAMILL J: Alan John Hines stands for sentence in relation to one count of murder. The victim of the crime was Aaron Jones and he died as a result of a single stab wound to the chest inflicted by the offender. The stab wound penetrated Mr Jones's heart and he died quickly. The offence occurred in the early hours of 19 February 2013 in the town of Wilcannia.
2At around 2 pm on 19 February 2013 Mr Hines surrendered himself to the police at Wilcannia. By that stage he had been identified by a number of witnesses as the person responsible for the killing of Mr Jones. He refused to answer any questions, was charged and bail was refused. He has been in custody since then and the sentence that I impose will commence on that date.
3As I understand it, there was no contested committal hearing.  I am not sure whether Mr Hines waived his right to a committal hearing or whether he was committed for trial on the papers.  Either way, once the prosecution brief was served, the matter progressed quickly through the Local Court.  
4He was arraigned in this Court on 29 May 2014 and his trial was listed at Broken Hill with an estimate of 3 to 4 weeks. There were in excess of 50 witnesses including something like 20 witnesses who were in the immediate vicinity of the incident. At a call over on 9 May, counsel indicated that they were working together to reduce the number of witnesses and that the trial would conclude comfortably within the three-week estimate.
5On 29 May 2014 I heard an application by the accused to sever a count on the indictment relating to an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Teegan Jones (the partner of the offender and sister of the deceased).  That count was severed: R v Hines [2014] NSWSC 701. In the course of the application, Mr Wilson SC who appeared for the offender at the trial, indicated that further reductions had been made to the witness list.
6The trial was conducted efficiently and quickly, largely as a result of the co-operative stance taken by the offender.  For example Exhibit 1 is a list of formal admissions under s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) within which the offender admitted the following matters: (1)AARON JONES, the deceased, died on the 19th of February 2013.
(2)The deceased died as a result of injuries sustained when a knife penetrated his chest.
(3)At the time the knife penetrated the chest of the deceased it was being held by the accused.
(4)The incident during which the knife penetrated the chest of the deceased took place outside Hood Street Wilcannia NSW.
(5)This incident took place sometime between 1:10 am and 1:30 am of the 19th of February 2013.
(6)The accused obtained the knife from the premises in which he resided at 12 Hood Street Wilcannia immediately following an incident which involved both the accused and the deceased and carried it back across the street.
(7)There was a confrontation outside 13 Hood Street Wilcannia between the accused and the deceased at which time the deceased sustained the fatal injury. 
7The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter on arraignment at the commencement of the trial.  The witness list had been reduced to 17 and the evidence of three witnesses was adduced by reading their statements.  
8The evidence concluded within five days and on two of those days the court sat for only half a day because of logistical difficulties in getting witnesses to court.  At the close of the prosecution case, I directed a verdict of not guilty in relation to a count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a child known as ""CJ"".  The addresses of counsel took place on Monday 30 June 2014 and the jury retired to consider its verdict on Tuesday 1 July 2014.  It returned with its verdict of guilty to murder on Wednesday 2 July shortly before 4pm.  
9I set out the above matters in order to demonstrate that the offender has to a substantial degree facilitated the administration of justice by disclosure of his defence in advance of the trial, by narrowing the issues to be placed before the jury and by the economic use of the court's time.  Pursuant to s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) the offender should receive a lesser penalty than would otherwise be imposed.  However the penalty cannot be reduced to a degree whereby it is unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: s 22A(2).  Further, the reduction cannot sensibly exceed the lower limits (5-10%) that an offender might receive if he entered a guilty plea.  
The circumstances of the offence
10This is an intensely sad case. The citizens of Wilcannia had on the day before the murder buried a young man called Jason Wilson.  Around the town groups of people had gathered to remember him and to mourn his loss.  Two such gatherings were at 12 Hood Street (the home of Teegan Jones and the offender) and 13 Hood Street (the home of Owen Whyman).  
11Some time around midnight the offender, who had had a great deal to drink, became agitated and attempted to get people at his home to leave. In the course of that activity he became engaged in an argument with his de facto wife.  He assaulted her by throwing a chair which hit her and caused bruising to her back. The offender admits that offence, along with an offence two days earlier, and asks that that they be taken into account pursuant to the provisions of s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  I indicate that I have taken those offences into account in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Hines.
12The evidence was scanty as to what occurred between the time of the assault of Ms Jones and the time of the murder of her brother. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Hines was in an aggressive frame of mind for that whole period. It was upon this basis that I came to the conclusion that the count should be severed. 
13However at some time around 1:30 am an argument developed between Mr Hines and two of his sisters during which Mr Hines became abusive towards them. It seems that the argument arose because one of the sisters attempted to retrieve a mobile telephone from Mr Hines' house.  For reasons that are unexplained and inexplicable, he became enraged. He used words of abuse, telling her to ""get your black cunt out of my house"".  
14It is clear that by 1:30 am Mr Hines was, as he was described by the learned Crown Prosecutor in his closing address, ""an angry man"". Why he became so angry is a mystery to me. His anger appeared to be quite irrational and I have little doubt that it was fuelled to a significant degree by a combination of grief and alcohol.
15Alice Shepherd, the half sister who was involved in the argument with Mr Hines, was in a de facto relationship with the deceased at the time of his death. It seems that Mr Jones intervened in order to protect his partner. In any event the situation was soon out of hand. The evidence of precisely what happened at this point is confusing and contradictory but what is clear is that Teegan Jones and Alice Shepherd became involved in a physical fight which was described in various ways by the witnesses. That fight included Alice Shepherd throwing a can of Jim Bean bourbon and Aaron Jones throwing a bottle of Mishka vodka at Teegan.  
16It was at about this time that Aaron Jones and Alan Hines came into conflict. It seems that each man was intervening on the part of their respective de facto partners.
17Within minutes Aaron Jones was dead.
18In the course of the confrontation between the deceased and the offender the deceased both threatened and abused the offender. The accused conducted his case partly on the basis that the words of abuse and threats would lead the jury to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter either on the basis of provocation or on the basis of excessive self-defence.
19It is tolerably clear that the deceased said words to the effect of ""don't be a big man mooch"" and ""I'll bash you"" or ""I'll bash the both of you.""  Some of the witnesses heard him say that the bashing would take place tomorrow.  Teegan Jones gave evidence that poor Aaron Jones called the offender a ""pussy"".  It seemed that her memory was that this occurred later in the incident.  
20Almost immediately the offender ran across the road to his house and retrieved a kitchen knife. While the evidence is not certain, it seems that this involved running for something like 20 or 30 metres across the road, entering the kitchen, retrieving the knife and running back again. 
21While the precise timing of events is unclear, the deceased at about that time went to the rear of 13 Hood Street and retrieved a large iron bar. That iron bar was something like a metre and a half in length and was part of a trampoline that had been dismantled and was lying against the fence at the side or rear of the premises at 13 Hood Street.
22Neither Mr Jones, with his one and a half metre iron bar, nor Mr Hines with his large kitchen knife thought it appropriate either to stay at their respective premises or to retreat from the area altogether. On the contrary they then approached one another outside the premises at 13 Hood Street.
23Once again the evidence is unclear as to precisely what happened but the preponderance of evidence is that it was the deceased, not the offender, who attempted to strike the first blow.
24I am satisfied that the deceased raised the iron bar either above his shoulders or to the side and swung the bar at the offender. I am satisfied (on the basis of some medical evidence) that the iron bar struck a glancing blow on the offender. It did not strike him hard and in swinging the bar the deceased fell to the ground.  He was, in that moment, helpless and alone.  
25There was a conflict in the evidence as to whether Mr Hines then fell on top of the deceased or whether he leapt down onto him and deliberately stabbed him. The defence argued that the ""stabbing"" occurred as a result of the offender falling or stumbling.  In my opinion, the verdict means that the jury rejected the suggestion that Mr Hines fell. In any event, giving effect to the jury's verdict, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that once Mr Jones struck the blow with the bar and fell to the ground, that Mr Hines immediately jumped on top of him and stabbed him in the chest. 
26Nobody at the scene knew that Mr Jones had been stabbed, let alone that he had been fatally wounded. The offender jumped to his feet, grabbed the iron bar and swung another blow up a blow at the deceased. Again the medical evidence supports the proposition that this blow made contact with the deceased's arm. There was a fracture to his right ulna (which is the bone in the forearm) and a slight abrasion to the skin in that area. It seems most likely that the injury was a defensive one in the sense that Mr Jones was attempting to shield himself from the blow which he must have seen coming.
27The offender then ran from the scene.  Friends and relatives of Mr Jones went to his aid and when they rolled him over they realised that he had been stabbed. They attempted to stop the bleeding by using items of clothing. They were unsuccessful. A short time later, perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, an ambulance arrived.  Mr Jones was showing no sign of life. He was taken by ambulance to Wilcannia Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  According to the pathologist, death was caused by the loss of blood haemorrhaging from the heart.  This was caused by a single stab wound.  
Findings inherent in the jury verdict
28I have already said that the verdict of the jury means that the jury rejected the proposition that the stabbing was caused as a result of the offender falling onto the deceased.  In summing up I directed the jury that unless it excluded that possibility, it could not convict the offender of murder.  
29In the manner in which the trial was conducted the following findings are inherent in the jury's verdict of guilty of the crime of murder.
30FIRST, the jury must have found that the accused had an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Jones.  Mr Wilson SC attempted to raise a reasonable doubt as to this issue by reference to the evidence of a child (SJ) who said that he had seen the offender slip and fall. SJ also said that he had not seen a stabbing motion. The case was put to the jury on the basis that it was an essential component of the Crown case that the action was a deliberate stabbing one and that if there was any doubt as to whether the offender had fallen it should find him not guilty of murder. Accordingly, the jury must have concluded that SJ's evidence of the fall was wrong or that he simply did not see the stabbing motion.  Two other children (CJ and OW) described a stabbing motion.  The jury must have reconciled that evidentiary conflict in favour of the Crown.  I am bound to give effect to that finding.  
31SECOND, the jury must have rejected the suggestion that the offender acted in self defence.  Self defence was put to the jury on the basis of Mr Jones's threats to bash the offender and also on the basis of his action in swinging the iron bar at him.  The defence placed reliance on the relative sizes of the men.  The evidence showed that Mr Jones was significantly larger than the offender.  The verdict means that the jury rejected self defence. In particular the jury must have rejected the assertion that the offender believed that it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself. No doubt, the jury was influenced by two significant matters of evidence. First, the uncontested evidence that the offender ran across the road and obtained a knife. Second, the fact that having swung the iron bar, the deceased fell to the ground and was at that moment defenceless.
32THIRD, the jury must have rejected provocation.  Provocation was put to the jury on the basis of the words of abuse and threats that had preceded the two men arming themselves and also on the basis of the abuse and actions immediately prior to the stabbing. Plainly the jury rejected provocation as a defence. The most likely basis upon which the jury rejected the defence of provocation was in relation to the third component of that defence - namely that an ordinary person in the offender's position could have so lost their self-control as to form an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. Whilst care must be taken in attempting to divine the jury's reasoning by reference to its questions, it is consistent with that conclusion that the jury asked a specific question as to the meaning of ""ordinary person"". 
33In any event, the evidence that Mr Jones conducted himself in a provocative manner is very strong, if not overwhelming. The evidence that the offender lost self-control was not overwhelming but the evidence was clear that his action followed immediately after the words of abuse and violent actions of the deceased.  I am satisfied that the accused lost his self control as a result of the provocative conduct.  In coming to that conclusion I am conscious of the fact that the offender was already angry.  
Objective seriousness
34There is no offence more serious than murder. The law holds human life to be sacred. The taking of human life recklessly or negligently is met with condign punishment. When life is taken intentionally, or when it is taken with an intention to inflict really serious injury, the community expects that offenders will be subject to extremely lengthy terms of imprisonment.
35The seriousness of the offence is reflected in both the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 20 years.  My observations as well as the statistics and case law show that there has been an increase in sentencing for murder since the introduction of the standard non-parole period.  
36I take both the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period into account in concluding that the offence of murder is at the very top of the pyramid of offences contemplated by the criminal law.
37However, objectively this case has a number of significant matters of mitigation. 
38First, the offence occurred over a very short space of time. Whilst it could be said that going and obtaining the knife showed a degree of planning and premeditation, I am of the view that any such planning or premeditation was minimal. In fact I am inclined to the view that there was no planning or premeditation at all. The offender snapped and lost control in the face of the abuse that he was receiving and the assault (as he perceived it to be) on his partner Teegan. 
39Secondly, I must consider whether the offender intended to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. The prosecution submits that the offender acted with an intention to kill.  It relies on the action in obtaining the knife and in stabbing Mr Jones with sufficient force to penetrate his sternum.  It also relies on the fact that the offender has previously been convicted of murder and that the cause of death in the earlier homicide was a single stab wound to the chest.  The prosecutor submits that Mr Hines was ""in a unique position of well knowing the consequences of stabbing a person in the chest.""  Mr Wilson SC submits that I should not find an intention to kill.  
40The fact that there was a single wound militates against a finding that the offender intended to kill.  On the other hand the location and force of the stab wound gives rise to an inference that there was an intention to kill.  The fact that he went to get the knife and the fact that he struck the deceased with the bar after the stabbing are, at most, neutral.  Hitting him with the bar (again, on one occasion) suggests that the offender did not believe that he had fatally wounded the deceased.  The state of the offender's intoxication and the suddenness of the act itself are also important considerations.  In referring to the state of intoxication, I am not in any way taking it into account as a mitigating factor per se.  Rather, it is one of many facts that have to be considered in determining whether there was an intention to kill.  A critical point made by Mr Wilson SC is that there was ample opportunity for the offender to stab Mr Jones more than once and he failed to do so.  
41The question must be resolved by circumstantial reasoning and by reference to the criminal standard of proof.  If there is a reasonable inference or hypothesis inconsistent with the offender having formed an intention to kill, I should draw the alternative inference.  
42Having considered the evidence closely, I find that the evidence does not exclude the alternative inference namely that the act was committed with intention to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than to kill.  
43Accordingly, the offender will be sentenced on the basis that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm.
44In Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98 I said at [21]:""While every case will turn on its own facts, and while no categorical proposition can be discerned from past murder cases, it is generally the case that murders involving a lack of intention to kill and a lack of premeditation are likely to be less serious than those in which there is established premeditation and an intention to kill.""
45I do not understand that to be a controversial proposition and the learned Crown Prosecutor has not contended otherwise.  Indeed he referred to the case of R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [34] in support of the proposition that a murder involving an intention to kill is generally regarded as more serious than one involving an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
46The third significant issue in mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence is that, while the jury rejected the legal defence of provocation, I am satisfied that there was a substantial degree of provocation on the part of Mr Jones and that accused lost control as a result.  As I have said, I am of the opinion that the jury's rejection of the defence was based on its rejection of the suggestion that an ordinary person could have lost control and formed a murderous intention.  
47There are many cases which indicate that provocation falling short of a defence under s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) remains and important matter of mitigation: see, for example, R v Bell (1985) 18 A Crim R 19; 2 NSWLR 466 at 485 (Lee CJ at CL); R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739 and R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951.  Section 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that if the ""offender was provoked by the victim"" this is to be taken into account as a mitigating feature. 
48The lack of planning and premeditation, the lack of intention to kill and the  degree of provocation amount to significant matters of mitigation. The fact that the offender was drunk at the time does not. The offender's intoxication is relevant to an analysis of these three mitigating features but the fact that an offence is fuelled by alcohol is not a mitigating feature and in some circumstances is considered to be an aggravating feature: R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [94]-[101] and see also s 21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
49The prosecution submitted that the offence falls ""slightly below the middle level of objective seriousness"".  Mr Wilson SC submitted that ""the offence lies in the lower range of objective seriousness"".  In so far as it is useful or necessary to use relative terms such as mid range, upper range and low range, it is my view that the present offence falls substantially below the mid range of objective seriousness for the crime of murder.  However, it is not in the lowest range.  
50Having said that, there is no offence of murder that is not, by its very nature, extremely serious and requiring of extremely severe punishment.
Subjective circumstances of the offender
Criminal and custodial history
51A disturbing feature of this case is that the offender has previously been convicted and sentenced for murder. While the circumstances were entirely different and while the offender was a juvenile at the time, it is the fact that the injury causing death and the manner in which it was inflicted was exactly the same as in the present case. That is to say the victim of the offender's previous murder charge died as a result of a single stab wound to the chest.
52The offender also has a record including a number of offences of violence.  His criminal history commences when he was a child of 15 and he had a number of offences dealt with in the Children's Court.  At the age of 17 years he was sentenced to a control order for assault and breaching an apprehended domestic violence order.  The most serious offences on his record were committed in 1994 when he murdered his girlfriend who he suspected of being unfaithful and in 1996 when he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault.  He received a minimum term of 2 years for the sexual assault and the sentence for murder commenced at the expiration of that period.  In approximate terms it seems he was in custody for around 11 or 12 years between 1995 and 2006.  He was released to parole in April 2007 but committed an assault on his partner for which he received a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  He was also returned to gaol for a time because that offence was committed while on parole.  His parole was revoked on other occasions based on allegations of assault.  I note that the criminal history refers to only one proven allegation of assault since his release to parole although the custodial history suggests that there was another allegation.  What happened to those is unclear although the prosecution accepts that it was not proved.
53It needs hardly be said that this criminal record disentitles the offender to leniency. It also makes it impossible rationally to come to a conclusion that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
54The prosecution contends that the offender's criminal history should lead me to conclude that the offender presents a future risk of danger to the community and that this would lead me ""to impose a sentence greater than that required by the objective seriousness of the offence alone"".  I will return to this submission in due course.



Family and personal history
55Tendered on behalf of the offender were a number of affidavits and reports that were prepared for his sentencing proceedings in 1995.  In my estimation, that body of evidence goes a very long way to explaining how it is that the offender came to spend a large amount of his late adolescence appearing before the Children's Court in places like Bourke, Broken Hill and Lake Cargeligo.
56The affidavits were sworn by his Grandmother, Eileen Hines, his mother Susan Hines, his foster father, Peter Hines and his auntie (and foster mother), Josephine Wightman.  Each of those people played a part in ""rearing up"" the offender.  He moved between them from time to time and moved with their families from town to town.  He lived at Wanaaring with his grandmother and mother for a time.  His mother recalls that it was a tin house down the back of another family's house.  There was no bathroom or water connected - they used the kitchen and bathroom of the other family.  His mother said she used to drink a lot in those days.  Her sister and mother used help look after Mr Hines when he was a child.  
57He moved to the Bourke Mission and into a new house.  This house had utilities.  However, his grandmother said ""it was a terrible life for the kids in Bourke"".  The family moved to Dubbo for a while when Mr Hines was about 7 or 8.  They only stayed there for a few months before moving back to Bourke.  His mother said they ""didn't really settle down"" and were back and forth between Bourke and Wanaaring.  He lived between his mother, his aunty and his grandmother.  He stopped going to school at about 13 years of age.  
58Peter Hines gives a slightly different history but its central and critical features are the same.  He recalled that the offender came to live with him and Joesphine Wightman when he was still a ""little fella - couldn't walk"".  That was in Wanaaring and in a two bedroom tin hut.  There was no electricity and the only running water was a tap outside.  To take a bath, people went down to the river.  To cook, they had an open fire outside.  Not long after the family ""got Alan"" they moved to a bigger new house with ""everything on - hot water, electricity"".  The family then moved to Bourke because Peter Hines' old mother was sick.  They lived in a tin hut with no water and electricity.  At some stage they got ""a good house with everything on - electricity and hot water"".  
59I pause to note that the housing conditions that I am describing existed in a first world country in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  
60A report of Dr Richard Furst was prepared to explore the offender's fitness to plead and the defence of substantial impairment.  I accept the history provided in that report.  A similar history was provided by the offender to an experienced psychologist, Ms Robilliard.The material in those reports is hearsay but it is generally consistent with the direct evidence from the offender's family.  I accept as fact the history provided by the offender.  
61The offender started drinking daily when he was just 14 years old.  He was exposed to alocohol and some violence from an early age.  There is little evidence of his obtaining gainful employment.  This is not surprising given the towns that he was living in, the itinerant nature of his family life and his lack of education. However, he sometimes got work with the Commonwealth Development Employment Program (CDEP) and cleaned up the Bourke reserve.  I note in passing, and with unqualified dismay, that I have been informed that this programme has recently been abolished.This information came from elders of the Kamilaroi people on a Judicial Commission visit to Walgett on 13-14 September 2014.  The Kamilaroi elders expressed their deep concern at the closing of the programme that had provided youth in towns like Walgett, Wilcannia, Brewarrina and Bourke with a rare opportunity to do work of which they were justifiably proud.  
62The case gives rise to a consideration of the recent High Court cases of Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600. In R v Booth [2014] NSWCCA 156 I discussed those cases noting that each of them ""gave rise to similar and profound issues concerning the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders who come from deprived, dysfunctional and marginalised backgrounds"".  The present case, and the evidence to which I have just referred, also gives rise to those issues in a stark and distressing way.  I reproduce what I said in Booth from paragraph [20]:""20. The High Court emphasised in both decisions that offenders are not to be treated differently because of their ethnic or racial background. Unlike the situation in Canada, there is no legislative warrant to do so: contra R v Gladue [1999] 1 SCR 688, R v Ipeelee [2012] 1 SCR 433. 
21. In Bugmy v The Queen French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ said at [36]:'There is no warrant, in sentencing an Aboriginal offender in New South Wales, to apply a method of analysis different from that which applies in sentencing a non-Aboriginal offender. Nor is there a warrant to take into account the high rate of incarceration of Aboriginal people when sentencing an Aboriginal offender. Were this a consideration, the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders would cease to involve individualised justice.'
22. In Munda v Western Australia French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ said at [53]:'Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed 'to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence.' It would be contrary to the principle stated by Brennan J in Neal to accept that Aboriginal offending is to be viewed systemically as less serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities. To accept that Aboriginal offenders are in general less responsible for their actions than other persons would be to deny Aboriginal people their full measure of human dignity. It would be quite inconsistent with the statement of principle in Neal to act upon a kind of racial stereotyping which diminishes the dignity of individual offenders by consigning them, by reason of their race and place of residence, to a category of persons who are less capable than others of decent behaviour. Further, it would be wrong to accept that a victim of violence by an Aboriginal offender is somehow less in need, or deserving, of such protection and vindication as the criminal law can provide.'
23. The reference to the 'principle stated by Brennan J' is a reference to what his Honour said in Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 326:'The same sentencing principles are to be applied ... in every case, irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group. But in imposing sentences courts are bound to take into account, in accordance with those principles, all material facts including those facts which exist only by reason of the offender's membership of an ethnic or other group. So much is essential to the even administration of criminal justice. That done, however, the weight to be attributed to the factors material in a particular case, whether of aggravation or mitigation, is ordinarily a matter for the court exercising the sentencing discretion of first instance or for the Court of Criminal Appeal.'
24. Similar sentiments were articulated by Wood J in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 63:'[I]n sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender.'This passage was referred to with approval in Munda v Western Australia at [51]. 
25. In Bugmy v The Queen the joint reasons at [37] commended the following observations of Simpson J in Kennedy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 260 at [53]:'Properly understood, Fernando is a decision, not about sentencing Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social disadvantage that frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender) precedes the commission of crime.'
26. The High Court observed at [37] that ""an Aboriginal offender's deprived background may militate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate"" noting that the same principle applies to a non-Aboriginal offender. The joint reasons went on to say at [43]:'The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.'
27. And at [44]:'An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.'
The Court adopted remarks that had been made by Gleeson CJ in this Court in relation to the sentencing an offender with a mental condition: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68."" 
63In helpful written submissions both the Prosecutor and Mr Wilson SC provided similar summaries of the effect of the High Court's decision in Bugmy v The Queen and Munda v Western Australia.
64I accept that the offender's personal history of social deprivation and early exposure to alcohol and violence explains to a significant degree his criminal history and the unfortunate path that his life has taken.  The public, fully apprised of the circumstances, would understand that he is not an ideal vehicle through whom to send messages of general deterrence.  In Munda v Western Australia the majority said at [55]:""It may be argued that general deterrence has little rational claim upon the sentencing discretion in relation to crimes which are not premeditated. That argument has special force where prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced communities so demoralised or alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within those communities to be controlled by rational calculation of the consequences of misconduct. In such cases it may be said that heavy sentences are likely to be of little utility in reducing the general incidence of crimes, especially crimes of passion.""
65In making those remarks I record that I am conscious of, and have applied, the provision in s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  I have not taken into account Mr Hines' self-induced intoxication as a mitigating feature.  However, his history of deprivation and exposure to alcohol and violence are so intrinsically connected to his current predicament that his moral culpability is diminished.  These matters are relevant to a proper assessment of an appropriate and just sentence in accordance with what has fallen from the High Court in both Bugmy v The Queen and Munda v Western Australia.
66On the other hand, the offender has now murdered two members of his own community, who no doubt lived similar lives of social deprivation, alienation and dysfunction.  The case is one where both general and personal deterrence remain relevant in assessing the appropriate and just sentence for the terrible crime that he has committed.  More importantly, sentencing is about more than sending messages.  The state has a ""long-standing obligation to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence. Further, one of the historical functions of the criminal law has been to discourage victims and their friends and families from resorting to self-help, and the consequent escalation of violent vendettas between members of the community"": Munda v Western Australia at [55].
The pain and suffering of victims
67I turn to consider the pain and suffering that has been caused by the offender's actions.  
68I have received evidence from Aaron's mother, two of his sisters and his partner of 10 years who is also the mother of two of his children.  To Brenda Riley, Teegan Jones, Leteesha Jones and Alice Shepherd I say thank you for your courage in providing me with at least some understanding of the pain that this terrible crime has caused you and your loved ones.
69I have learned from you that Aaron Jones was a greatly loved son, father, nephew and uncle. He was a shy kid growing up and a gentle giant as an adult.  He was a good footballer and a role model in the community.  His youngest daughter (Ashantie) has a severe disability.  She cannot speak or walk or crawl and she will need to be cared for throughout her life. Aaron was the only one who could make her make her laugh and smile.  Even now, Alice says he sometimes ""shows himself"" to Ashantie and Ashantie will look over Alice's shoulder and smile.   
70Mrs Riley, I acknowledge your grief.  An American President (Dwight D Eisenhower) once said:""There's no tragedy in life like the death of a child. Things never get back to the way they were.""
And he was right.  I hope in time you will find peace.  
71Teegan, I acknowledge the pain that Aaron's death has caused you, your loss of trust in people and your judgment and the horrible memories of your father's death that all of this has brought back.
72Leteesha, you say that you will never get over Aaron's death.  I can only hope that you do.  If you follow through on your decision to get counseling, I hope that it helps.  
73Alice, I wish you strength in caring for the children you had with Aaron.  Cherish your memories of him and I hope he will continue to show himself to Ashantie and that his memory brings you and your children some joy.  
74To each one of you: I know that nothing that I do in sentencing Alan Hines will ease your pain.  I can only hope that you find some closure and that your grief and anger subsides over time.  
75The law now allows me to take your statements into account in determining the appropriate penalty if I consider it appropriate.  The harmful impact of this murder - like the harmful impact of all violent deaths - ""is an aspect of harm done to the community"": s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown has asked me to take the impact on each of you into account in determining the appropriate penalty.  This is because your harm is an aspect of the community's harm. Alan Hines, through his senior counsel and experienced solicitor, agrees that I should take it into account.  He recognizes that Aaron was the father of two little girls, one of whom is severely disabled and that the whole community will be affected in the long run by the care required for Ashantie.  He acknowledges that Wilcannia is a small, close-knit community and that Aaron was admired as a good football player and young member of that small community. 
76I accept that your grief and the harm that you have suffered is an aspect of the harm done to the community.  I accept that it is appropriate to take your suffering into account in determining the appropriate sentence and I will do so. 
The new legislation
77It is appropriate that I say something, briefly, about the amendments to s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The legislation is in the following terms:""28. When victim impact statements may be received and considered
(1) If it considers it appropriate to do so, a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after it convicts, but before it sentences, an offender.
(2) A victim impact statement may also be received and considered by the Supreme Court when it determines an application under Schedule 1 for the determination of a term and a non-parole period for an existing life sentence referred to in that Schedule.
(3) If the primary victim has died as a direct result of the offence, a court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family victim and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate.
(4) A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.
(4A) Subsection (4) does not affect the application of the law of evidence in proceedings relating to sentencing.
(5) A court may make a victim impact statement available to the prosecutor, to the offender or to any other person on such conditions (which must include conditions preventing the offender from retaining copies of the statement) as it considers appropriate.
(6) Despite any other provision of this section, a court must not consider or take into account a victim impact statement under this section unless it has been given by or on behalf of the victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecutor.""
78Nothing in the legislation explains how a sentencing Judge is to determine when it is ""appropriate"" to take into account the harmful impact on a victim's family the ""determination of the punishment"" in a homicide case.  Nor does it shed any light on when a victim's suffering is ""an aspect of harm done to the community"".  I have read the second reading speeches and find no guidance there.  Those speeches make it clear that the amendment is designed to ""change the law"" as it was declared by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.   However, the second reading speeches did not address the observation by his Honour (at 86) that:""It is regarded by all thinking persons as offensive to fundamental concepts of equality and justice for criminal courts to value one life as greater than another"".  
79This statement reflects the notion that all human life is precious and goes back to biblical times.  The Bible said (Galations 3:28):""There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are alone in Christ Jesus.""
80Pope Francis said in September last year ""there is no human life more sacred than another"".  
81All civilised societies treat all life and all people as equal.  As Thomas Jefferson put it in drafting the United States' Declaration of Independence:""We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal ... and endowed with certain inalienable rights: that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""
82This became the cornerstone of Dr King's ""I have a dream"" speech in 1963.
83In R v Dang [1999] NSWCCA 42 Adams J contemplated the position of a friendless man without a family and said at [25]-[26]: ""Assume the deceased was friendless; assume the deceased had no family. It would be monstrous to suggest that that meant for some reason killing her should attract a lesser sentence than would be the case if, as is the situation here, she had a loving family and grieving relatives. Essentially, then, the reason that victim impact statements in cases involving death are not taken into account in imposing sentence is that law holds, as it must, that in death we are all equal and the idea that it is more serious or more culpable to kill someone who has or is surrounded by a loving and grieving family than someone who is alone is offensive to our notions of equality before the law.""
84The reality is that homicide and other crimes where people are killed have devastating and long-term effects in every case. The exception may be a friendless or homeless member of the community.  Is the law to regard a homeless, unloved person's life as less valuable than another's?  This strikes me as being philosophically offensive.
85However, it is unnecessary for me to enter further into that debate in the present case.  I am satisfied that I should accept the thoughtful, considered and most decent concession made by Mr Hines.  I am particularly persuaded by the fact that the small and isolated community of Wilcannia is greatly affected by the needless cutting short of Mr Jones' life and by the fact that he brought joy to the life of a disabled child whose future care will now be much more reliant on the resources of the state.   
Future dangerousness
86It is very difficult when an offender is to be sentenced to an extremely long sentence for a court to come to any conclusions, let alone any certain conclusions, as to the likelihood that they will offend again. As Kirby J said in Fardon v Attorney General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575 at  [124]:""Experts in law, psychology and criminology have long recognised the unreliability of predictions of criminal dangerousness.""
87However, in the same case Gleeson CJ said at [12]:""No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of Veen shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles ... permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release.""
88Plainly, the fact that this offender has previously been convicted of murder raises the question in a particularly stark way.  The Crown contends that the sentence on the offender should be extended because he poses a future risk to the community.  Mr Wilson SC says that before I could come to such a conclusion, I need be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender presents - or more correctly, will present - a significant risk to the community.   The Crown says that the criminal standard does not apply to this issue.  He relies on the case of R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310 and particular the judgment of Handley JA at [40] where his Honour said:""A sentencing judge is not bound to disregard the risk that a prisoner would pose for society in the future if he was at liberty merely because he or she cannot find on the criminal onus that the prisoner would re-offend. The view that the risk of future criminality can only be determined on the criminal standard is contrary to all the High Court decisions since Veen (No 1).""
89Mr Wilson SC relies on the fact that this is an ""aggravating feature"" because it centres around the provision in s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which refers to an aggravating feature as existing where an offender has a record of previous convictions, particularly in cases where an offender is being sentenced for a serious offence of violence and has a record for such offences.   As an aggravating feature, Mr Wilson SC says the matter must be established beyond reasonable doubt.  He relies on Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270 and Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 360.  
90The matter is not free of controversy as the following passage from R v McNamara [2004] NSWCCA 42 shows:""20. The raising of this issue led to debate about the standard of proof to be applied by a sentencing judge in order to make a finding of future danger to the community which an offender represents. Observations by members of this Court, differently constituted from time to time, are not entirely harmonious.
21. In R v Barton, unreported, NSWCCA 28 July 1995 Kirby ACJ (Dowd J concurring, Allen J in a separate judgment making no reference to onus) said:
'However, individual deterrence may take into account, in a general way, the need to protect the community from the propensities demonstrated, or the character manifested, by the particular crime which brings the prisoner before the court.
It is important that this Court should say firmly that such use of deterrence should never be expanded into orders in the nature of preventive deterrence by the back door. Proof of matters relevant to deterrence are factors which may aggravate the seriousness of the case. The onus of establishing the nature of the deterrence alleged and the level of any propensity lies on the prosecution. It must establish contested matters to the criminal standard of proof.
When I look at what Badgery-Parker J said in the course of his reasons I consider, with respect to his Honour, that he may have fallen into error. His Honour said this:
'The savagery of the killing suggests the need for a substantial sentence not only because of the need from the community point of view to punish such behaviour but because it is strongly suggestive that she is likely after her release to represent a source of danger to others. It is always difficult to predict dangerousness, and particularly to predict what such a person as this may be like when released into the community at the end of a necessarily fairly substantial period of imprisonment. The same lack of maturity and control which led to this killing could all too easily recur should she at some future time find herself under threat. The question of possible future dangerousness was examined at length in the course of the sentencing proceedings, and three psychiatrists gave oral evidence, Dr Barclay and Dr Lucas called on behalf of the prisoner and Dr Shand called on behalf of the Crown.'
It seems to me that it is here that his Honour may have taken an approach which led him to take into account his perspective of future dangerousness by a standard which was less rigorous than that which the law requires.'
22. In R v Gieselmann, unreported NSWCCA 13 July 1998 Mason P (Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J agreeing) remarked:
'In considering the significance of the evidence touching on whether the applicant would remain a danger to others in the future by reason of her mental disorder, and for how long in the future, the learned judge reminded himself that the Crown must prove this matter beyond reasonable doubt.'
23. However in R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310 Handley JA (Sully and Buddin JJ agreeing) after reference to authorities including Veen v The Queen (No 1) 1979 143 CLR 458; Veen v The Queen (No 2) 1988 164 CLR 465; Chester v The Queen 1988 165 CLR 611; Bugmy v The Queen 1990 169 CLR 428; Mitchell v The Queen 1996 184 CLR 333 and Boughey v The Queen 1986 161 CLR 10 concluded:
'Thus a finding that a prisoner is likely to re-offend does not even require a finding that it is more probable than not that he will do so, let alone a finding that this has been established beyond reasonable doubt.'
24. Counsel for the respondent referred to The Queen v Olbrich 1999 199 CLR 270 where in the joint judgment (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ) there was express adoption of what was said by a majority in R v Storey 1998 1 VR 359 that a sentencing judge ""may not take facts into account adverse to the interests of the accused unless the facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt"".
25. In regard to Olbrich, I agree with Handley JA's observation in SLD that the decision should be seen as limited to ""facts"" and that future probabilities or possibilities are not ""facts"" in any meaningful sense.
26. I record that the Court has been informed that application by the offender SLD for special leave to appeal to the High Court is presently pending.
27. Counsel for the respondent contended that the test is ""whether the offender poses the risk of relevant future conduct"" and that the correct approach is for a judge to determine whether he is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such risks exist. With respect to the contender, I do not find that formulation useful.
28. In the span of human affairs risk can always be postulated and of its mere existence there can be no doubt. For example, there is risk that an aircraft may crash, that a ship may sink, that motorcars may collide, that a person of previously unblemished character may commit a crime, that a convict may offend again. The elimination of risk is something which is viewable only from hindsight. The aircraft did not crash etc. The convict, to the end of his life, did not re-offend. What is of concern to a sentencing judge is, in my opinion, not the existence of risk - that I would see as a given - but a degree of risk. That does not require the certitude of proof beyond reasonable doubt nor the exercise of balance to determine what is more probable than not.
29. On that approach, references to proof beyond reasonable doubt or proof on the balance of probabilities become otiose. This is demonstrable by reference to the latter. That a mere ""tilt"" on the balance of probabilities would lead to one offender having the likelihood of future offence taken into account (adversely) but another, falling just short of a ""tilt,"" being found unlikely to offend does not reflect an even handed application of justice.
30. It follows that I prefer the views expressed by Handley JA in SLD to the contrary expressions in Barton and Gieselmann."" 
91The fact that Mr Hines has a prior record for serious offences of violence is not in dispute.  This includes, critically, a previous offence of murder.  He has also been convicted of rape and offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  He has admitted two separate offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to be taken into account in these proceedings.  This satisfies me beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(d) is established. 
92However, that finding does not change the assessment of the objective gravity of the present crime. It is that for which the offender is to be sentenced.  
93I find difficult the assessment of the offender's future dangerousness and the extent to which I should, as the Crown submits, ""impose a sentence greater than that required by the objective seriousness of the offence alone"".  I feel that I am bound by the preponderance of authority to approach the matter in the way discussed in SLD and McNamara. To be clear, I am unable in the face of the authorities to accept the submission that I must be satisfied to the criminal standard that Mr Hines presents a future risk to the community.  Both parties urged on me the question posed by McCallum J in R v Gittany (No. 5) [2014] NSWSC 49 at 58:""The critical question is whether the prior offences inform the extent to which a sterner sentence may be required in order to meet the objects of sentencing, including deterrence and the protection of the community.""
94Dr Furst has assessed the offender as being ""probably in the high range"" of risk of future violence.  Ms Robilliard has administered a self appraisal test which placed the offender in the ""High to Moderate risk of re-offending range"".  I find neither of those assessments of much help but I take them into account.  
95Of more assistance is the analysis of Ms Robilliard who notes Mr Hines' deep regret at Mr Jones' death, his sound intelligence and inquiring mind and the absence of violent infractions during his period in custody.  Ms Robilliard is of the view that he will benefit by learning vocational skills.  I agree with the psychologist that his prospects are linked closely with his ability to abstain from alcohol or to control his drinking.  Both experts agree that he will require structured programmes while in custody and will benefit from supervised support when he comes to re-enter the community. I also note that neither Dr Furst nor Ms Robilliard has found any evidence to suggest that the offender suffers from a psychiatric or other condition that makes him more prone to violence.  This distinguishes the case from cases such as Veen v The Queen (No. 2)(1988) 164 CLR 465 and Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229. 
96Taking all relevant factors into account I have reached the conclusion that Mr Hines presents a significant risk of committing further offences of violence particularly if he returns to similar patterns of drinking which preceded both this offence and the murder of his partner in 1994.  
97However, for the reasons articulated in the submissions of Mr Wilson SC and the report of Ms Robilliard, he has some prospects of rehabilitation.  In considering the protection of the community, I will do two things.  First, I will slightly increase the total sentence that I would otherwise have imposed.  Secondly, I will find special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and adjust downwards the custodial component of the sentence.  In my view, the community's interest and protection lies in the rehabilitation of this man after he serves what will be a very long time in gaol.  That objective will best be served by a longer than usual period of parole. The Crown Prosecutor fairly concedes this may be appropriate.  
98I am conscious of the length of the parole period, or balance of term, that I will impose and have come to the conclusion as to the appropriate proportions after considerable and troubled contemplation.  
99Further, risk assessments will obviously need to be made by the relevant authorities when the question of the offender's parole comes to be assessed.  There is also the prospect that he will be subject to the provisions of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).   I am required by statute to advise Mr Hines that he may be subject to applications for orders under that Act.  
Contrition and remorse
100Part of my reason for coming to the conclusion that there is some prospect of rehabilitation is the fact that Mr Hines has shown a degree of insight into his actions and has also demonstrated some remorse.  When he first went into custody, an officer observed that ""he was coping okay but was very upset over the death of the victim"".  He has at all stages during these proceedings acknowledged his responsibility for the death of Mr Jones.  He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on arraignment and his demeanour, as I observed it, during the reading of the victim's impact statement showed genuine empathy.  I have taken this into account in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation.
101However, I am unable positively to be satisfied on balance that the mitigating feature under s 21A(3)(i) is established. Mr Hines has not fully accepted responsibility for his actions.  He appears to deny the intention required for a conviction for murder.  He described his action in getting the knife as no more than a ""stupid"" act.



The use of a weapon
102I accept the Crown Prosecutor's technical submission that the use of a weapon is an aggravating feature for the purposes of s 21A(2)(c).  However, that is a matter of very little moment in this particular murder case. I agree with the comments of RA Hulme J in R v Aytugrul [2009] NSWSC 275 at [23].  
Statistics and other sentencing cases
103I have received the statistics relating to offences for murder since the introduction of the standard non-parole period. They provide very little guidance due to the vast range of sentences imposed. 
104Counsel have tendered summaries of cases that provide some guidance as to sentences that have been passed in cases with some common features to the present.  In Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98 at [35] I considered the sentences imposed in a number of murder cases where there was no premeditation and no intention to kill.
105The correct approach to such material was articulated by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 and by Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [304]-[305].  In Hili and Jones, it was said at [54]:""In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence' (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, 'it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned'.""
As the plurality said in Wong;""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""
106R v Potts (supra) was a case involving somewhat similar offending although there were some particularly troubling aspects of the offence, some of which occurred after the victim was dead.  The case concerned a dispute with a prostitute over money and, while the victim first produced the knife, the offender overpowered her.  The offender had previously been convicted of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. His significant psychiatric condition made him a high risk of future violent conduct.
107The closest cases are probably R v Anthony Jones [2012] NSWSC 1433, R v Beldon [2012] NSWCCA 194 and R v Barlow [2013] NSWSC 217.
108None of these cases are on all fours with the present case.  There were different pleas and different subjective circumstances.  None relieve me of the duty to synthesise all of the relevant evidence and information and to determine intuitively the sentence to be imposed for this most serious offence on this individual offender.  
Sentencing 
109I have taken into account the principles of sentencing developed by the common law over many years, the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period and the provisions of s 21A of the Act.
110I have read the facts of the two offences on the Form 1.  Each is a reasonably serious offence of domestic violence which, if charged alone, would carry a maximum penalty of 5 years when prosecuted on indictment or 2 years if dealt with summarily.  In accordance with the Attorney General's Reference No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 and Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115, I have taken them into account in considering questions of retribution and personal deterrence.  I have not added any additional penalty to the sentence specifically referable to them.  I have been careful about this because the offences have formed part of my consideration of the question of future dangerousness which has resulted in a slight increase in the total sentence. 
111But for the matters giving rise to a reduction in the penalty under s 22A, I would have imposed a total sentence of 25 years.  I have reduced that by 1 year to reflect the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the conduct of the defence.  By the standard operation of s 44 the non-parole period would be 18 years.  I have found special circumstances for the reasons I have earlier identified and made a significant adjustment to the non-parole period.  The non-parole period will be 16½ years and will be back-dated to the date that the offender went into custody.    
112Before I pass sentence I wish to place onto the record my appreciation to the four legal practitioners who have appeared for the prosecution and defence. I have been greatly assisted, as was the jury, by their diligence and cooperation throughout the trial and sentencing proceedings.  Each is to be commended. 
113Alan John Hines for the murder of Aaron Jones you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 16½ years commencing on 19 February 2013 and expiring on 18 August 2029.  I set a balance of term of 7½ years commencing on 19 August 2029 and expiring on 18 February 2037. You will become eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
114Pursuant to s 25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act I advise you of the existence of that Act and the fact that it applies to you and to this offence.

2764801,McKay v R [2014] NSWCCA 187,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offences and sentence
The applicant was tried in the District Court of New South Wales before Huggett DCJ and a jury from 16 - 24 April 2013 upon two counts as follows:

Count 1: Recklessly cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900 and in the alternative,

Count 2: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59 Crimes Act 1900.

2The jury acquitted upon the first count and convicted upon the second. Her Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 15 June 2011.

3The applicant initially appealed against conviction only on the following grounds:

Ground 1: The verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported by the evidence and/or

Ground 2: The jury has adopted an inappropriate line of reasoning in seeking to differentiate between the elements of the two counts, when upon the evidence, there was no basis to do so, and there has been a miscarriage of justice accordingly.

4During the course of oral argument, the applicant was granted leave to amend his Grounds of Appeal to add an additional ground by way of seeking leave to appeal against sentence as follows:

Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances generally and in particular:

(i) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the assault involved the injury to the victim's eye; and/or

(ii) Her Honour erred in not finding the offence was constituted by the admitted punch to the rear of the victim's head resulting in a haematoma and/or

(iii) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the injury (to the eye) was caused by an object in the applicant's hand.

5Since the conviction grounds of appeal raise issues of fact, it is necessary for the applicant to obtain the leave of the Court in order to pursue these grounds. Because the grounds of appeal do raise arguable issues, I would grant that leave.

The Crown and defence cases

6It was the Crown case that the applicant and the victim were inmates at the Outer Metropolitan Multi-Purpose Correctional Centre (OMPC) on 15 March 2011. They were working in the laundry. The victim saw the applicant spraying some cigarette bumpers (cigarette butts) with Mortein and putting dirty underwear in the locker that belonged to Mr Morris, another inmate. The victim confronted the applicant about this. In response the applicant hit the victim on the back of the head and as the victim turned around, the applicant punched his eye. It was the Crown case that the applicant was holding a sharp object at the time and that this perforated the victim's eye. The victim was taken to hospital where the eye was removed.

7It was the applicant's case that he tried to play a prank on Mr Morris. The victim saw him and approached him about it. The victim started a physical altercation with him and hit him in the face. While they were scuffling another inmate, Mr Lee, came up and tried to separate them. Mr Lee was holding a pen. The victim was injured and went down onto the ground holding his eye. The applicant punched him in the head and then went outside the laundry. The applicant denied stabbing the victim in the eye.

Factual Background
The Victim

8The victim gave evidence that in March 2011 he was working in the laundry of the OMPC. On the day of the incident, there were about 15 inmates working there. One of those was a Mr Morris whom he had befriended. Mr Morris used to collect bumpers and would roll them up into cigarettes to smoke.

9The victim said that he saw the applicant spraying Mortein on the bumpers in the ashtrays in the laundry at about 10.30am and at about 12.30pm he saw the applicant putting dirty underwear in Mr Morris' locker. The victim said that he challenged the applicant and said ""Leave Red [Mr Morris] alone. Pick on someone your own size."" He said that the applicant made a dismissive response but when he turned away, the applicant hit him twice in the back of the head. The victim said that as he turned around, the applicant ""lunged at him with his hand, with his fist closed, there was something hanging out the end, and hit him in the right eye with it"". The victim said that the item in his fist was silver and metal. He felt excruciating pain and went straight to the toilet. He then became aware that he had blood on his face, looked in the mirror and saw that he had a cut in his eye. The victim was taken to the clinic by a correctional officer.

10The victim told the officer that he fell over and hit his head on a table. He said this because he did not want to be labelled a ""dog"". He told the people in the clinic that he fell over. He was taken in an ambulance to the Nepean Hospital. After 15 minutes he was transferred to the Westmead Hospital where he underwent surgery. In the ward after surgery, the victim told Mr Jones, a corrective services officer, that he had been hit in the back of the head and hit in the eye by the applicant.

11The victim knew an inmate called Mr Lee. Mr Lee also worked in the laundry. The victim said that Mr Lee was not near him when he was hit by the applicant. Before the assault, he said that he last saw Mr Morris outside smoking near the back roller door of the laundry. Later, the victim described the object in the applicant's hand as ""a sharp long object that was in his hand"". He denied that he had challenged the applicant to a fight. He denied that he had spoken to Mr Morris after he returned from the hospital and denied that he had tried to influence Mr Morris in any way.

12In cross-examination the victim denied that he was really angry and had challenged the applicant. He said that the hit to the back of his head was very hard. He said that he was dazed by it. He saw something sticking out of the applicant's fist but did not know how far out. The victim said that his nose was not hit and the fist went straight to his eye. The injury was to the white part of the eye between the pupil and the edge of his nose. He denied that Mr Lee stepped in between him and the applicant to break up the fight.

13Later in the cross-examination the victim agreed that he had not mentioned that the object in the applicant's hand was silver or that it was metallic before the trial. He agreed that approximately a week after the incident when making a statement to the police he said that the weapon was definitely not a pen. By that time he had heard some rumours around the prison that Mr Lee had stabbed him with a pen. He did not tell the police anything about it being metallic or a silver object at that time. He did not tell the police that it was shaped like a key. He agreed that until he gave evidence in the trial, he had not described the object. He agreed that he did not know what object had hit his eye.

14He was cross-examined as to what he had told the corrections officer at the Nepean Hospital. The victim said he could not remember the detail of what he had said but agreed that he did not tell the officer about a weapon being used by the applicant. The victim agreed that when he spoke to officer Fraser-Jones at Westmead Hospital he did not tell him that the object was metallic or a key, nor did he describe it as 6 - 7 centimetres long.

15The victim denied that he had sought to influence Mr Morris or bribe him by offering him drugs and by offering to provide him with a residential address so that he was better able to obtain parole.

Mr Morris

16Mr Morris gave evidence. His evidence in chief was as follows: On the day of the incident he was working in the laundry but stated that he did not recall seeing anything happen between the applicant and the victim in March 2011. He had lied to the police and most of what he told them in his interview with them was a lie. He lied to help out a friend. He lied when he told the police that the applicant had hit the victim from behind and that he had a key.

17Mr Morris was then cross-examined by the Crown pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act 1995 in relation to the statement which he had made to the police. Mr Morris agreed that he was concerned about the other inmates knowing that he had spoken to the police because they did not approve of anyone giving evidence as a prosecution witness. He said that he knew that the victim was defending him and that he wanted to do the right thing but still denied seeing the applicant hit the victim.

18When Mr Morris was shown a DVD of his recorded police interview he said that it was all made up because he wanted to assist the victim. He agreed that he smoked bumpers and that he regularly collected them from other inmates.

19When cross-examined on behalf of the applicant, Mr Morris said that he did not see the actual fight and that he was coached on what to say to the police by the victim and other people. He said that he was friendly with both the victim and the applicant. He said that the applicant did not put any pressure on him and no-one had threatened him on behalf of the applicant. He said that he had been offered inducements if he said the ""right thing"" to the police. He said that he was not told to tell the police about a key. That was just something that he heard from others.

Mr Lee

20Mr Lee gave the following evidence. He was in his mid to late sixties in March 2011 and worked in the laundry at the OMPC five days a week. He knew the applicant because they were in the same wing, but they were not friends. He did not know the victim. He was sitting outside the laundry at the time of the incident. He knew that something had happened because people told him about it. After the incident there was a muster and he spoke to the police and told them that he did not see the incident. He told the police that he did not assault the victim. 

21Evidence was given by correctional officers Bristow, Moorhouse, Greenfield, Szegedi, Silvano, Fraser-Jones, Robinson and Hooker. Their evidence did not advance the Crown case significantly. Officer Bristow was in the laundry when the incident occurred but did not see it. When he spoke to the victim, he was told that he fell. He and other correctional services officers did not believe that story and the inmates in the laundry at the time were mustered and searched, as was the laundry area. 

22Officer Moorhouse conducted a more detailed search of the laundry on the day following the incident and found a piece of melted biro in the bin outside the toilets. It was not concealed in the bin. He did not see any blood on the biro. It looked like a pen that had been through the dryer. He said that fly spray was kept in his office and he did not recall the applicant asking for fly spray on 15 March 2011. He said that when the inmates were mustered, all that the search found was a paper towel with blood on it in a bin in the toilet area. This was not the same bin where the biro was located.

23Officer Greenfield said that she spoke to the victim who told her that he had fallen. When she spoke to the applicant on the day of the incident, she noticed that he had a mark on his face. She arranged for him to be strip searched and locked up. His clothes were removed in case they were required for evidence. She thought the mark on the applicant's face was consistent with him being in a fight. She agreed that he was strip searched and segregated because she suspected that he might have been involved in a fight with the victim. 

24Officer Szegedi gave evidence about how keys were kept in the gaol. He said that each inmate had a key for their cell and that they generally kept it with them when they were not in the cells. He said that each key had the cell number printed on it and that there were two keys per cell in case one got lost. The inmates were just given a key and not a key ring. They could choose to wear it on a chain, keep it in their pocket or just leave it in their cell. The dimensions of the key were about 6.5 cms long, 9 mms wide, with the top of the key being about 2.8 cms wide. The narrowest point on the key which opened the lock was about 5 mms and the broadest part of the point was about 8 - 9 mms. He was not able to say when the inmates were searched but the keys or pens would not have been regarded as weapons. 

25Officer Silvano was told by the victim that he hit his face on the corner of a bench in the laundry. He also saw the applicant and noticed some redness on his face, which the applicant said were allergies.

26Officer Fraser-Jones spoke to the applicant in the holding cell where he was kept after the incident. He asked about the mark on his face and the applicant said that he did not know how it got there. On 17 March he was an escort for the victim at Westmead Hospital. According to his notes, it was there that the victim told him that he was assaulted by the applicant.

27By reference to his notes, officer Fraser-Jones said that the victim told him that the appellant was bullying ""Red"" and that he had stood up for him. He told the applicant to stop being a pest and harassing inmates who could not stand up for themselves. He confronted the applicant and then turned away. He then got a heavy knock to the back of the head. He turned around and saw the applicant standing there. He was hit in the eye by the applicant's right hand with an object that he could not identify.

28Officer Robinson said that she spoke to the applicant on 16 March 2011 in the holding cells. She was the Acting Superintendent for the day. The applicant told her that there was evidence in the laundry that would prove his innocence and that he was concerned that it would be destroyed by the inmates if they were allowed into the laundry. He said that there was a blue biro that was used to stab the victim in the bin in the toilet area. He also said that Mr Lee from F Unit was the assailant. The applicant then told her ""off the record"" that he got into a fight with the victim and that Mr Lee yelled and said that he was going to help and then he saw Mr Lee with the pen. He did not see Mr Lee stab the victim.

29Dr Kerdraon was an ophthalmologist. When the victim was admitted to the Nepean Hospital there was an open wound to his eyeball. He observed a small 3 mm L-shaped wound on the nasal side of the white of the eye. His evidence was that the injury would have been caused by a sharp object and that it was unlikely that a fist could have caused it. He was shown a photograph of a key and said that the key was more likely to have caused the injury than the pen casing.

30In cross-examination Dr Kerdraon agreed that 5 - 6 mm, being the width of the key, was longer than the wound in the victim's eye. He said that the sharp object need not be an L-shape itself. He said that with the skin of the eye stretching, the object could have been about 4 mm wide. He agreed that the size of the cut did not tell much about the force that was used to cause the injury. He agreed that the history, which the victim gave to another doctor, was:

""Allegedly assaulted with a single punch to the right eye, falling backwards, hitting his head in the shower where he sustained swelling and bleeding to the right eye, as well as the loss of vision.""

31Because of the way in which the appeal hearing proceeded, it is necessary to set out in more detail the actual evidence of Dr Kerdraon:

""Q. In your expert opinion what did you consider might have made such a cut?
A. I would expect a sharp instrument, possibly pointy. Not so much a blunt instrument.

Q. So when you say blunt something like a fist, could a fist make that injury?
A. I could never say never.

Q. All right, yes?
A. But unlikely.

Q. Unlikely. So for that injury to occur I think it was described earlier as a penetrating injury, is that suggestive that something has actually gone into the eye?
A. Yes but a blunt injury can also cause an open globe just like a soccer ball being run over by a car can rupture and cause a blunt open injury but that was fairly small and there are certain places, weak spots in the eyeball that a rupture if caused by a punch or blunt injury would tend to break at and that was not one of them.

Q. So if you were asked, based on your assessment, to consider whether it was more likely that the injury you saw would have been caused by something like a key as opposed to, perhaps if the doctor could be given exhibit G, just take a moment doctor to look at what's inside but please don't take it out, and I just want to give you a photograph doctor and then I want to ask you a question. Now I have given you a photograph which is a photograph of a key and I have given you a plastic bag that has the outer casing of a pen, are you able to offer an opinion, in terms of your experience and what you observed, as to which would be more likely to cause the type of injury that you saw?
A. I would probably lean towards the key but only marginally 60/40 sort of --

Q. All right and why do you say that though?
A. Just because the injury was more elongated and the pen I presume, but I could be wrong, the pen had a metal tip at the time.

Q. No?
A. It was only the --

Q. Assume you are looking at the item as it is--
A. All right as is, unlikely then, I'd probably increase those odds to 80/20 to say it was the key, in favour of the key.

Q. And that's because?
A. That's because the key seems to have a sharper edge to it and that's on the scale of the eyeball a fairly blunt instrument, sorry the pen on the scale of the eyeball is a fairly blunt instrument."" (18.4.2013 - T.69-17 - 70.11)

""Q. And I think on the previous occasion it was your opinion, was it not, that the key itself as you look at it, the key part of it had a width of something like half a centimetre, 5 or 6 millimetres, which was in fact longer than the wound you saw or measured in Mr Sharp's eye?
A. That's correct.

Q. So it was wider than the wound itself?
A. That's right.

Q. But of course as you suggested it's possible that the tissue stretched whilst it was being injured?
A. That's correct.

Q. If the tissue stretched whilst it was being injured do you then the next step is to assume that it has come back to its original state after the injury. Is that right?
A. That's right.

Q. So in order for something of this width to cause that injury one must first assume a stretching and then I guess a reversion back to its original state?
A. That's right.

Q. If the skin was stretched as a part of this traumatic injury is it possible that it would have remained in that stretched state?
A. That would - it's variable, so it can - it's somewhat elastic.

Q. Yep?
A. Meaning that it will revert back to its original size, original state, but also it's a laceration which is a part of the tissue that's actually touched and that won't close up.

Q. So it could just as well be that the thing that caused the injury, whatever it was, you've been given a choice of two things, but whatever it was had a width of 3 millimetres. That's also a possibility, isn't it?
A. That's a possibility."" (18.4.2013 - T.71.46 - 72.29)

""Q. But again in order for it to have been a key just like this there had to have been some stretching of the tissue. Is that right?
A. Yes, there would've been.

Q. So I come back to my original proposition, sir. If we leave aside those variables, the assumption that there was some stretching and then the tissue came back to its original size, those two steps, if you left them out, if that didn't occur, the key you see here is too big to have caused that injury, isn't it?
A. If there were no stretching of the tissues?

Q. Yes?
A. That's correct.

...

Q. Can you tell the angle at which the sharp implement that caused this injury hit the eye?
A. No.

Q. Can you tell whether it was a puncture or a slicing motion that did it?
A. No.

Q. It could well have been more of a slicing motion?
A. It could have been.

Q. So going forwards and slightly sideways at the point of impact?
A. Possibly.

...

Q. The eyeball, if I could just take a step back, is a very thin piece of tissue, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. I think you described a soccer ball as a good analogy. It's a closed unit. It's like a ball?
A. That's right.

Q. Which contains liquid, a jelly-like substance?
A. Amongst other things.

Q. Amongst other things, but it's a closed unit?
A. Yes.

Q. You describe there being a difference between a rupture and a laceration?
A. That's right.

Q. Could you just explain to the members of the jury what that difference is?

... 

A. Sorry. So a laceration implies the use of a sharp instrument to actually make a cut through the tissues of the eye whereas a rupture implies no sharp instrument, just a sudden increase in the pressure of the eyeball that causes it to explode essentially.

Q. So I think you used the analogy of running over a soccer ball. So for the eye it would be something pushing against the eyeball so much so that there was a rupture?
A. That's right.

Q. It blew out?
A. That's right.

Q. So it wasn't that in your opinion?
A. It is not likely to be that, no.

Q. Blunt force trauma can cause injuries that look remarkably like lacerations, can't it?
A. Yes.

Q. Especially if the tissue is in some way forced to fold or back onto itself or pushed in an unusual way?
A. The eyeball is fairly slippery so it would be difficult. If you're insinuating that you can fold over the tissue of the eyeball, I think that would be fairly unlikely.

Q. A punch to the eye is quite a great deal of force on the eye, is it not?
A. At what --

Q. A punch to the eye?
A. At what force?

Q. Yeah, is a great deal of force on --
A. A great deal, yes.

Q. And that can result in injuries that look like lacerations?
A. It's always possible, yes.

Q. Was there anything in the look of this injury that allowed you to conclude it was not a laceration - I'm sorry, was not a rupture. I'm sorry about that. 
A. So like, as I said before, I can't be 100 per cent certain that it wasn't a rupture but a rupture tends to occur at specific parts on the eyeball where there are weak spots such as the stitching of the soccer ball and this part where this wound was was not one of those weak spots.

Q. And that's relative to the other parts of the eyeball, is it not?
A. That's right.

Q. But the eyeball itself, what's holding it together is a fairly thin piece of tissue, is it not?
A. Yes."" (18.4.2013 - T.73.11 - 75.37)

""Q. Doctor, you were asked many questions about what may be possible, correct?
A. That's right.

Q. And anything that's not impossible is possible. Is that correct?
A. That's right."" (18.4.2013 - T.79.39)

32Detective Senior Constable Stephen Crimston gave evidence but that evidence did not advance the Crown case beyond that already established by other witnesses.

The Applicant

33The applicant gave evidence in the first trial. That evidence was recorded and the audio recording was played to the jury as Exhibit O during the second trial. The applicant said that he used to work in the laundry at OMPC, operating the washing machines. He knew the victim and he knew inmates Morris and Lee. He had assisted Mr Lee to move from H Wing where he was unhappy, to F Wing. After that Mr Lee used to cook him meals and they were friends.

34On 15 March 2011 he tried to play a prank on Mr Morris by putting some female underwear from a nursing home in his locker which was in the kitchen area. The victim saw what he had done and a verbal exchange occurred between them. He walked out of the kitchen area but when he looked back he saw that the victim was following him.

35The applicant described what then occurred as follows: the victim approached him and said ""Do you want to have a go do you?"" and then hit him on the right side of his face. He grabbed the victim's hands and they struggled. He hit the victim on his left cheek and they continued to wrestle. Mr Lee then came up on the applicant's right side and he was holding a pen. Mr Lee tried to separate them. He pushed Mr Lee away against the wall and looked at the victim and noticed that he was ""going down"" and holding his right eye. When he was going down, he hit the victim twice in the back of the head and then walked outside. He did not see Mr Lee stab the victim with the pen. He did not have a pen of his own, or any other stabbing implement. He did not stab the victim in the eye. 

36The applicant said that following the fight, he and other inmates were brought together for a muster. He was separated from the other inmates, strip searched and taken to a holding cell. Nothing was removed from him during the search. His injuries included a swollen eye and some marks on his arms and chest.

37In cross-examination the applicant said that he saw Mr Lee holding a black biro in his right hand. He denied that he ""invented this story to involve Mr Lee in the fight"". He was intimidated by the victim because the victim was much heavier than him. Even though he was scared of the victim, he responded to his taunt in the kitchen because he would have appeared ""weak"" had he not done so. He agreed that in gaol the inmates like to sort things out between themselves and not involve the correctional officers. He agreed that Mr Morris was younger than most of the other inmates and also smaller.

38He denied spraying Mortein on the bumpers and said it was not a low act to put the underwear in Mr Morris' locker. He said it was a joke because they were friends. He denied bullying Mr Morris. He denied that Mr Lee was vulnerable, or that he was a convenient fall guy. 

39The applicant did not have his key with him on the day of the fight. He did not lock his cell as he was in a privileged wing and no-one would steal from his wing. When the cells were locked, they could easily be opened with a butter knife. He denied having anything sharp in his hands or striking the victim with anything sharp. He denied hitting the victim in the back of the head. Mr Lee did not say anything when he was trying to break up the fight but he had a frantic look on his face. He did not tell the truth to the officers about the red marks on his face because he did not want them to think that he had been in a fight.

Mr Wu

40Mr Wu gave evidence in the applicant's case. He knew Mr Lee as they had been in other gaols together. He was housed in F Wing with the applicant and Mr Lee. He understood that the applicant had assisted Mr Lee in moving to F Wing. Mr Wu used to work in the laundry as a folder and he knew Mr Morris and the victim. Mr Lee was the storeman and he counted the stock in the laundry. He used to write down figures on a piece of A4 paper with a pen. When he was not using his pen, he would put it in the pocket of his jacket.

41Mr Wu said that on 15 March 2011 he and the applicant were teasing Mr Morris and calling him ""a bum"" because he used to pick up cigarettes from the floor. He did not see the applicant spray Mortein on the cigarette butts and he did not see him put underwear in Mr Morris' locker. He never saw the applicant lock or unlock his cell with a key. He could not remember if he ever saw the applicant wearing his key around his neck.

42Mr Wu said that when the incident occurred, he was outside the laundry. He heard the victim say ""Why don't you pick on someone your own size?"" and he made reference to ""Red"". The applicant then called the victim a ""fat cunt"". They continued to verbally abuse each other and then it became physical. They said ""Let's have a go"" and walked inside the front of the storeroom. There were punches being thrown by both of them. He saw that Mr Lee was on the right side of the inmates who were fighting. Mr Lee was trying to get between them. The applicant had his fist clenched, but he could not see if he was holding anything. When the applicant walked out, Mr Wu saw his hands and there was no blood anywhere, nor did he see the applicant holding anything.

43In cross-examination Mr Wu said that when he was talking to Mr Lee in the yard, Mr Lee used to say ""If anyone messed with me, he'd stab them with a pin"". Mr Wu said that he had a good view and watched the incident unfold. He did not see the victim fall down after the incident and he did not see blood on his face or see a tissue on his face. He denied that the applicant was a good friend of his but that he was just an associate. Mr Lee was not a good friend of his, but he remembered that Mr Lee used to have three or four pens in his pocket because it was boring in gaol. Mr Morris could not afford to buy cigarettes because he used his money for drugs. Mr Wu thought it was disgusting to pick up cigarette butts from the floor and he found it very funny. He agreed that when the applicant sprayed water on the floor, it made the butts useless to Mr Morris.

44By way of further background, it is necessary to deal with a question received from the jury during their deliberations. The jury note (MFI 13) read:

""What is the relationship between the allegations in count 2 and the elements? That is, the elements do not refer to something in his hand.""

After discussing the matter with counsel, her Honour responded to the jury as follows:

""Can I say this, members of the jury, you have before you the document that contains the elements for count 1 and the elements for count 2. And none of the elements for either count 1 or count 2 contain or include an element involving something in the accused's hand, the elements are as per this document. 

The Crown's case and the evidence of David Sharp [the victim] was that there was something in the accused's hand but the elements are as per the document that you have been provided with. So all I can say is if you focus on the evidence and the way the Crown's run its case, we are not talking about theoretical possibilities here. The evidence is what is before you and I have told you not to speculate and not to guess and matters of that sort, so if you focus on the elements in the document that has been provided to you, that is what the Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt.""

45In order to understand that direction, it is also necessary to set out her Honour's directions as to the elements of the offences. In relation to count 1, her Honour said:

""The elements that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be convicted of Count 1 are as follows. 

(1) That the accused cause grievous bodily harm to David Sharp. The words ""grievous bodily harm"" mean really serious bodily injury. Such injury need not be permanent, but it must be more than trivial or trifling. There is no dispute in this trial that David Sharp did in fact suffer grievous bodily harm as a result of an incident that occurred in the laundry on 15 March 2011.

...

The second element that the Crown must prove in relation to Count 1 is that the accused was reckless. 

...

Grievous bodily harm is caused recklessly, and this is referred to on your document, if the accused realised that grievous bodily harm may possibly be inflicted upon David Sharp by his actions yet he went ahead and acted as he did anyway. 

...

The accused cannot be found to have acted recklessly unless the Crown proves that he actually thought about the consequences of his act and at least realised the possibility of grievous bodily harm occurring.""

46In relation to count 2, her Honour's directions were:

""The elements or ingredients that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt before you can convict the accused of Count 2 are as follows. Firstly, that the accused was the person who assaulted David Sharp. Obviously you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused as opposed to any other person such as Anthony Lee who assaulted David Sharp.

There are four elements which constitute an assault. They are:

(a) a striking or a touching or the use of force by the accused to another person. 

(b) That such conduct of the accused was without the consent of the complainant, Mr Sharp.

(c) That such conduct was intentional or reckless in the sense that the accused realised that David Sharp might be subject to immediate and unlawful violence, however slight, as a result of what he or she was about to do but took the risk anyway and went ahead. 

(d) That such conduct was without lawful excuse. 

There is no dispute here at all that to punch someone in the eye whether with something in your hand or not is an assault. There is no issue that it was unwanted. The real issue is whether it was the accused who did this as opposed to any other person such as Anthony Lee.""

47When the jury delivered its verdict and her Honour sought to reconcile their reasoning between count 1 and count 2, she did so as follows:

""Given the jury's resolution of the issue regarding identity in a manner adverse to the offender in Count 2, the jury's verdict of not guilty to Count 1 indicates either that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the loss of the eye, constituted grievous bodily harm, a scenario which I reject, or the jury was not sufficiently satisfied that when the offender inflicted the injury to the victim's right eye that he acted recklessly. That is, the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender realised that grievous bodily harm may have possibly been inflicted to the victim by his actions.""

Conviction Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1 - The verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported by the evidence and/or

Ground 2 - The jury has adopted an inappropriate line of reasoning in seeking to differentiate between the elements of the two counts, when upon the evidence there was no basis to do so, there has been a miscarriage of justice accordingly.

48Although Ground 1 is expressed in terms of the verdict of the jury being ""unsafe and unsatisfactory and incapable of being supported by the evidence"", the applicant accepted that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was him and not Mr Lee who inflicted the injury on the victim. The real gravamen of the grounds of appeal is that once the jury had reached that conclusion, there was no rational basis in the evidence for the jury to acquit on Ground 1 but convict on Ground 2. The applicant submitted that the overwhelming inference was that the jury engaged in an impermissible line of reasoning and delivered a compromise verdict. The applicant submitted that it was in that way that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and could not be supported by the evidence. 

49The applicant submitted that support for that ground of appeal emerged from the way in which the Crown put its case, i.e. that the only real issue was the identity of the person who injured the victim's eye.

50In that regard, the applicant called in aid the warning given to the jury by the trial judge:

""It would be quite wrong of you to find the accused guilty of count 2 simply because you could not all agree on the same verdict for count 1.""

51In making that submission, the applicant properly accepted that a jury is permitted to determine for itself what it considers to be the issues, quite apart from those determined by the parties and the trial judge, but that it can only give substance to such a consideration if there is evidence properly before it. The applicant did not challenge in any way the directions given by the trial judge as to the elements of the offences raised by the two counts.

52The applicant put the same submission in a slightly different way. He asked (rhetorically) whether there was any evidence to differentiate between the mental element in count 1 and the mental element in count 2. If there were no proper basis for such differentiation, he submitted that the jury must have had a doubt about whether it was the applicant who struck the victim in the eye or whether he struck the victim in the eye with an object and either way, there was no proper basis for the jury to convict him on count 2 as opposed to count 1. He submitted that in order to do so the jury must have engaged in an inappropriate process of reasoning and that there had been a resulting miscarriage of justice.

53The applicant submitted that at trial his counsel at no time submitted to the jury that if he was the person who stabbed the victim in the eye with an object, he might have done so without the requisite intent. The applicant submitted that this was because such a submission was not available in the circumstances. The applicant submitted that if he had stabbed the victim in the eye with an object, it was obvious in the circumstances that he must have done so with at least the realisation of the risk of serious injury.

54In that regard, the applicant submitted that her Honour's attempt to reconcile the jury's verdict, (i.e. that the finding of guilt on the second count meant that the jury were not satisfied as to the mental element necessary to establish the first count) was simply not available on the evidence. The applicant submitted that such a distinction was not open despite the fact that the Crown had made a submission to that effect at trial when in the course of his address, the Crown said:

""If you have something sticking out of your fist and you punched someone in the face in the area of the eye, you realise the possibility that you can cause really serious harm but he continued nevertheless. And as you know Mr Sharp did suffer really serious harm. Members of the jury, the Crown submits when you carefully consider the evidence, you would be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the first count on the indictment. If you have some concern about Mr McKay's state of mind but you're satisfied he punched Mr Sharp in the face causing the injury, then you will move on to count 2 and you were told and no doubt would be reminded the Crown must prove that he struck him as a result of which actual bodily harm was occasioned. No doubt the injuries, more than actual bodily harm, so if you accept that Mr McKay struck him in the face and you don't accept that he realised the possibility of what kind of injury could be imposed but nevertheless accept that he did, than you would return a verdict of guilty in relation to the alternative count."" (23.4.13 - T.37.25 - .39)

Consideration

55Because the first ground of appeal is expressed in the way in which it is, it is necessary to say something about that ground in its terms. It was common ground that the relevant principles as to how a Court of Criminal Appeal should approach the question was set out by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The guidance there provided by their Honours was:

""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal


11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

... 

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""

56There is no issue that there was evidence to support the jury's finding that it was the applicant who struck a blow to the victim's right eye. There was conflicting evidence. The evidence in support of the Crown case was that of the victim, the statement made by Mr Morris to the police and in a negative sense, the denial of any involvement by Mr Lee. The applicant's case consisted of his evidence and that of Mr Wu. This was not one of those cases where a Court of Criminal Appeal could take into account objective evidence, or inherent improbabilities or probabilities arising from the evidence. The only independent evidence was that of the ophthalmologist, Dr Kerdraon, and even that evidence was not unequivocal.

57This trial involved issues of credit which were fundamentally for the jury to determine. This Court has not had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. Suffice it to say that on a proper analysis of the evidence, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who struck the victim in the right eye. It follows that looked at on its own and in its terms, ground 1 has not been made out.

58The next issue is whether there was a rational basis for the jury's acquittal of the applicant of the offence in count 1 and their conviction for the offence in count 2.

59Assistance is provided by the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) in Mackenzie v R [1996] HCA35; 190 CLR 348 at 366:

""3. Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. A judgment of Devlin J in R v Stone is often cited as expressing the test:


""He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand.""


4. Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries. The early history of New South Wales was affected by English juries which, in the face of clear evidence, declined to find the value of goods stolen sufficient to attract the punishment of death, thereby affording to the offender the alternative punishment of transportation. Australian decisions have acknowledged that the role of the jury continues to be ameliorative in this respect. In R v Kirkman, in the Supreme Court of South Australia, King CJ (with the concurrence of Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ) observed:

""[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.""

We agree with these practical and sensible remarks.


5. Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ""It all depends upon the facts of the case"".""

60In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 the plurality (Gleeson CJ; Hayne and Callinan JJ) made observations to similar effect:

""33 In MacKenzie v The Queen, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated a number of general propositions concerning the significance that may properly be attached to what is sometimes referred to as factual inconsistency between verdicts. In that respect, it is to be noted that, where an accused is charged with multiple offences, differences between the verdicts may not, in truth, involve inconsistencies even of a factual kind. In the present case, if there had been a verdict of guilty on count 2 and not guilty on count 3, where the charges were supported by substantially the same evidence, then there would have been factual, even though not technical or legal, inconsistency. However, the evidence in support of counts 7 and 8 was materially different from the evidence in relation to counts 1 to 6 and count 9. The complainant was, to a significant extent, supported by MA.

34 Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in Mackenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.

35 It appears from the review of decisions of trial judges and intermediate appellate courts undertaken in Markuleski that some judges have taken Jones as authority for the proposition that where multiple offences are alleged involving the one complainant, then verdicts of not guilty on some counts necessarily reflect a view that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, and that an appellate court should consider the reasonableness of guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant is a person of damaged credibility. That view is erroneous. It overlooks the attention to factual detail in the reasoning of Jones. It also overlooks the principles stated in MacKenzie, which were not qualified in Jones, and the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph in these reasons. Jones is not to be understood as establishing a set of legal propositions, separate or different from the test formulated in M, which must be applied in deciding whether a conviction on one or more counts of sexual offences, when the accused was acquitted on other counts, is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.

36 The test established by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is unreasonableness, not inconsistency. In the present case, there is an obvious explanation of the differences between the verdicts on the various counts in the indictment. ...""

61Applying those principles, can the acquittal on count 1 and the conviction on count 2 be explained on the basis put forward by the Crown in its final submission and as explained by her Honour in her remarks on sentence - i.e., that the jury were not satisfied as to the mental element in ground 1, on the basis that the jury did not accept that the applicant realised that grievous bodily harm might possibly be inflicted on the victim, if he struck him in the right eye with an object in his fist. In my opinion it can. The reasoning would be that the jury thought that in the context of what seems to have been a fight between the applicant and the victim, where the victim was a very large person, no thought was given by the applicant to the possibility of serious harm being inflicted on the victim's eye. 

62On the evidence it was open to the jury to see a distinction between an assault with the deliberate use of a weapon against the eye, which would have sustained count 1, and an assault in which the applicant was holding an object but did not deliberately direct it at the victim's eye. There was no suggestion in the victim's evidence that the applicant took up an object by way of weapon for the purpose of hitting the victim with it. The victim's evidence went no further than that there was something hanging out from the end of the applicant's fist when he was struck.

63The jury could well have entertained a reasonable doubt about the applicant's state of mind concerning the possibility of grievous bodily harm while accepting the victim's evidence that the applicant was in fact holding an object in his hand at the time he punched him.

64Alternatively, the jury may not have been satisfied that the applicant had anything in his fist when he punched the victim. That this was a concern of the jury appears from the question which they asked. Their concern was not without a basis. The evidence of the victim from when he first disclosed that he had been struck in the eye by the applicant up to the time of trial, was that he thought the applicant had something in his hand but he did not know what it was. The more detailed description which suggested a key came from the victim for the first time at trial. There was otherwise no evidence at all that a key was involved, except for the fact that each inmate had access to a key. The evidence as to a biro shell (as distinct from an intact biro with a sharp point) was based on a rumour in the gaol and the finding of a biro case in the laundry bin. Testing of the biro case showed no trace of blood. Accordingly, there was no clear evidence as to what, if anything, the applicant had in his hand when he struck the victim in the right eye.

65The victim's evidence was that he was struck a hard blow to the head which caused him to turn around, at which time he was struck in the right eye. There was no suggestion in the evidence that when the first blow was struck, there was anything in the applicant's hand. If it be the case that the applicant had something in his hand, he must have obtained it or placed it there between the time of the first blow and that of the second. The time between the two blows seems to have been very short and that may well have been a matter that the jury took into account.

66Finally, the medical evidence was not decisive. Dr Kerdraon thought it more likely than not that a sharp object had caused the wound to the eye, but he could not exclude the biro case or a heavy punch. When one has regard to the unsatisfactory evidence as to the object being a key, the other possibilities which Dr Kerdraon accepted as real, come into play.

67It follows that the jury's verdicts can be rationalised on either of those bases. It was open to the jury to find that the applicant was holding an object but did not deliberately direct it at the victim's eye or alternatively, it was open to the jury to have a doubt as to whether the applicant had any object in his hand at the time he struck the victim in the right eye. Either alternative provided a reasonable basis for an acquittal on count 1 but a conviction on count 2. On that basis, I am not satisfied that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

Application for leave to appeal against sentence.
Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances generally and in particular:

(i) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the assault involved the injury to the victim's eye; and/or

(ii) Her Honour erred in not finding the offence was constituted by the admitted punch to the rear of the victim's head resulting in a haematoma; and/or

(iii) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the injury (to the eye) was caused by an object in the applicant's hand.

68In relation to the first two particulars of this ground of appeal, the applicant submitted that it was not open to her Honour to reconcile the two verdicts in the way in which she did, nor was it open on the evidence to find that the jury could have had a reasonable doubt that the applicant had an object in his hand when he struck the victim's eye. Accordingly, the only explanation for the jury's verdict was that they did not regard the blow to the eye as the action which constituted the offence in count 2.

69That submission can be quickly dealt with. The blow to the back of the head, other than being described by way of background to the injury to the eye, played no part in any of the contested issues at trial. There were no submissions made in relation to it and it clearly formed no part of the jury's consideration. I have already indicated why it was open to the jury to acquit in relation to count 1 but still find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant caused the injury to the victim's eye. 

70This leaves the third part of this ground for consideration. The applicant submitted that if contrary to his primary position, the Court were satisfied that there was a basis in the evidence for the jury having a reasonable doubt as to whether the applicant had something in his hand when he struck the victim's right eye, it was not open to her Honour to find beyond reasonable doubt that such was the case.

71The precise findings by her Honour are to be found in her remarks on sentence as follows:

""Reacting to this hit the victim turned back around towards where the offender had been standing prior to him, the victim, having turned his back and the offender lunged at the victim with a closed fist and with ""something"" in his hand. The victim was hit once to the area of his right eye."" (ROS 5.5)

""Notwithstanding resolution of this factual issue in the offender's favour, I am nevertheless satisfied that the offender while standing in close proximity to the victim made a deliberate movement toward the victim's face which landed in the area of his right eye and caused the injury to the offender's eye."" (ROS 10.7)

""Based upon the evidence of Dr Kerdraon and the evidence of the victim, I accept beyond reasonable doubt that something was in the offender's hand, although I am unable to determine exactly what that item was."" (ROS 11.5)

72Although her Honour made that finding, she was very conscious of the lesser seriousness of the offence for which the applicant had been convicted. In that regard, her Honour said:

""Of course the offender must not be sentenced for an offence for which he has not been convicted. Nor can I take into account for the purpose of increasing the otherwise appropriate sentence a circumstance that would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence than the one for which the offender stands to be sentenced. Accordingly, the offender must be sentenced on the basis that although he deliberately and intentionally assaulted the victim whilst something was in his fist, he did not intend to cause harm amounting to grievous bodily harm. To make this clear the offender cannot and will not therefore be sentenced on the basis that he recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to the victim which would of course constitute a more serious offence. He cannot and will not be sentenced on the basis he realised the grievous bodily harm may have possibly been inflicted by his actions. The Court must sentence the offender on the basis that the deliberate assault he occasioned to the victim caused injury of an extremely serious kind to the victim's right eye."" (ROS 11.8 - 12.4) 

73As indicated, the jury acting rationally could well have entertained a reasonable doubt about the applicant's state of mind concerning the possibility of grievous bodily harm while accepting the victim's evidence that the applicant was in fact holding an object in his hand at the time he punched the victim. It follows that it was open to her Honour in the sentence proceedings to make that finding beyond reasonable doubt. The fact that there was another rational alternative available to the jury did not preclude her Honour making such a finding. Accordingly, the third part of this ground of appeal has not been made out.

74For the above reasons, in relation to both the conviction appeal and the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

2764802,Matthews v R [2014] NSWCCA 185,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Hamill J.

2FULLERTON J: I agree with Hamill J.

3HAMILL J: Shaun Harvey Matthews (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him on 13 November 2013, and adjusted on 14 November 2013, by his Honour Judge McLoughlin SC in the District Court. The applicant raises two grounds of appeal. The first ground is a discrete technical one while the second is based on the general proposition that the sentence imposed on him was manifestly excessive and unjust. 

4On 13 November 2013 the applicant stood for sentence in relation to 2 offences of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Those offences were charged pursuant to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The facts of the offences involved the applicant using charge cards in other people's names to purchase goods from stores in the Charlestown Square shopping complex. The first offence involved obtaining goods to the value of just under $900 and the second involved obtaining goods in the amount of around $245. In relation to the second offence the applicant asked that two further offences under s 192E(1)(b) be taken into account pursuant to the provision in s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The total amount of the property obtained in respect of the matters on the Form 1 was a little less than $100.

5The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence. On 13 November 2013 the applicant was sentenced as follows:
(1)Imprisonment for 2 years and 4 months commencing 11 August 2014 and expiring 10 December 2016 with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months expiring 10 May 2016.

(2)Imprisonment for 2 years and 4 months commencing 11 November 2014 and expiring 10 March 2017 with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months expiring 10 August 2016.

6It will be seen that the primary Judge imposed the same sentence in respect of each offence, made the sentences largely concurrent but accumulated them by a period of three months. In the result there was a total effective sentence of 2 years and 7 months with a total effective non-parole period of 2 years.

7The sentences came to be adjusted the following day because the sentence imposed upon the applicant was contrary to law. It was not open as a matter of law for the sentencing Judge to commence the first sentence on 11 August 2014. His Honour appears to have chosen that date based on the fact that the applicant had breached parole and his parole had been revoked. However, it was open to the applicant to re-apply for parole at the expiration of an un-related sentence for an offence of break enter and steal which was due to expire on 28 May 2014 (""the pre-existing sentence"").

8Commencing the sentence partway through the balance of term created the practical difficulty that there may have arisen a gap in the applicant's period in custody. It was also contrary to s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That section concerns the commencement dates of sentences and is in the following terms:
""47 Commencement of sentence
(1) A sentence of imprisonment commences:
(a) subject to section 71 and to any direction under subsection (2), on the day on which the sentence is imposed, or
(b) if the execution of the sentence is stayed under section 80, on the day on which the court decides whether or not to make a home detention order in relation to the sentence.

(2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:
(a) is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or
(b) commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.

(3) In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2) (a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, any of the offences to which the sentence relates.

(4) The day specified in a direction under subsection (2) (b) must not be later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of the information currently available to the court) that the offender:
(a) will become entitled to be released from custody, or
(b) will become eligible to be released on parole,
having regard to any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject.

(5) A direction under subsection (2) (b) may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment (or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment) imposed on an offender who is serving some other sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention if:
(a) a non-parole period has been set for that other sentence, and
(b) the non-parole period for that other sentence has expired, and
(c) the offender is still in custody under that other sentence.

(6) A sentence of imprisonment (or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment) starts at the beginning of the day on which it commences or is taken to have commenced and ends at the end of the day on which it expires.""

9Accordingly, it was open to the Judge to commence the sentence on the 29 May 2014 (that is to say the day after the expiration of the pre-existing sentence) or on an earlier date. It was not open to the Judge to impose a sentence commencing at any time after 29 May 2014. It appears that the parties did not bring the provisions of s 47 to his Honour's attention during the course of the sentencing proceedings.

10When the error was realised, the parties jointly applied to the Judge to reopen the sentencing proceedings and to make an adjustment to the commencement date of the sentences or sentence. This occurred on 14 November 2013. The sentencing Judge adjusted the commencement date for the first offence to the 29 May 2014 (that is, the day after the expiration of the sentence for the unrelated break and enter). However, his Honour did not adjust the commencement date in respect of the second sentence.

11Thus, the date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole remained the same even though the commencement date was brought forward by a period of around 2 ½ months. The practical result of this (by my calculation) was that the total effective sentence was increased to 2 years 9 months and 13 days and the total effective non-parole period was increased to 2 years 2 months and 13 days. The extent of accumulation between the two sentences was increased from 3 months to 5 months and 13 days.

12Contrary to the submissions of the respondent in this Court, counsel for the applicant at first instance did not agree or consent to this course. He did acknowledge that it would be open to the sentencing Judge as a matter of law to take this approach. Whether that concession was well founded is not a matter with which I need to concern myself. It was certainly open as a matter of construction of the statute but whether it was open, giving proper effect to principles of totality and finality, is a different matter.

13The applicant contends that the adjustment of the sentence and its increase offended the findings as to totality made by the sentencing Judge on 13 November 2013. 

14His Honour referred to the principles of totality and it is apparent that his application of that principle was concerned solely with the two offences with which he was dealing. His Honour had no evidence before him as to the facts of the unrelated break enter and steal offence. Nor did his Honour have any evidence before him as to the offence for which the applicant was on parole at the time. Accordingly, it was not possible for his Honour to have come to any conclusion concerning the totality of all of the applicant's offending. The only application of the principle of totality was with respect to the two offences with which he was dealing and the matters on the Form 1.

15His Honour was of the opinion that he was dealing with the matter pursuant to the common law ""slip rule"". However, it was probably more accurate to say that he was dealing with the matter pursuant to the jurisdiction in s 43 to reopen sentencing proceedings and to correct penalties that were imposed ""contrary to law."" The distinction between the operation of the common law ""slip rule"" and s 43 was discussed by the High Court in Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10. The High Court noted that the provision in s 43 had a wider application than the common law ""slip rule"". The distinction does not need to be considered further here as both parties agreed then, and both parties agree now, that his Honour had the power to adjust the sentences in order to correct the error that occurred when sentence was imposed on 13 November 2013. 

16The applicant has relied upon the decision of this Court in Thompson-Davis v R [2013] NSWCCA 75. In that case, a sentencing Judge called upon to adjust a commencement date of a sentence, increased the length of the sentence in order to maintain the release date that had originally been set. This Court (Beazley P, Hall and Campbell JJ) held that the sentencing judge erred in taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely his previous determination that the sentence should not expire until a particular date. Thompson-Davis concerned a single sentence, and an adjustment to that sentence, relating to a single offence. I can see no relevant distinction to the present case, in circumstances where the sentencing Judge had reached a final conclusion as to the appropriate total effective sentence and total effective non-parole period by reference to his consideration of the totality of the criminality in the matters that came before him.

17In my opinion, his Honour fell into error in adjusting the sentences in such a way that the applicant was exposed to a total sentence (and non-parole period) of 2 ½ months longer than had originally been considered appropriate. 

18Accordingly the Court must intervene to correct that error.

19It is conceded by the applicant that correction of that error is a discrete matter and would not enliven the Court's jurisdiction to re-sentence the applicant to a term that the Court considers appropriate.

20However, the applicant raises a ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I am of the opinion that this ground should also be upheld.

21The offences with which the applicant was charged involved a relatively small amount of money. The section under which he was charged captures offences which can run to defalcations in the millions of dollars: cf R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435. The total amount of property obtained by the four deceptions encompassed by the charges and Form 1 matters here was just over $1,200. The offending itself was unsophisticated and involved very little planning. Whilst credit card fraud of this kind must be deterred by the imposition of substantial penalties, in the present case the imposition of a custodial sentence to be served in full time custody adequately reflects the need for deterrence. Sending messages of general deterrence does not involve the imposition of sentences disproportionate to the criminality involved in the particular offence.

22I am conscious of the fact that the ground of appeal here contended is one which requires the Court to come to the conclusion that the sentence imposed below was manifestly wrong or plainly unjust: cf Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321. I am equally conscious of the fact that ""there is no single correct sentence"" (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [27]) and that an intermediate appellate court will generally allow a sentencing Judge a wide discretion in determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed in any given case. 

23A matter which plainly operated upon the sentencing Judge's mind was the criminal history of the applicant. His criminal history is a very bad one and includes many offences of dishonesty. That record commenced when the applicant was a child and has continued, more or less unabated, since that time. He was sentenced to a control order in the Children's Court for larceny and break and enter in 2002. Again in 2003 he was sentenced to a control order in the Children's Court for offences of dishonesty. He has twice been subject to sentences of imprisonment in the District Court including a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4.5 years in 2008 for what was obviously a serious offence of aggravated break enter and commit a serious indictable offence whilst armed.

24While that criminal record disentitled the applicant to leniency, he was not to be sentenced again for his criminal history. Nor did his criminal history, justify the imposition of a sentence disproportionate to the criminality of the offending: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

25On the other hand, the fact that the offences were committed when the applicant was on parole was an aggravating feature properly to be taken into account in assessment of the objective criminality and the proper sentence. 

26The sentencing Judge said that he took the early plea of guilty into account. Assuming a discount of around 25%, the starting point for each sentence must have been around 3 years. In my opinion that starting point and the total effective sentence of two years and seven months with a non-parole period of two years is plainly unjust given the objective criminality of the present offence and taking into account the principles of sentencing, maximum penalties and purposes of punishment.

27The learned sentencing Judge did not make a finding of special circumstances whereby the non-parole period would be adjusted in spite of the fact that the sentences were accumulated upon a pre-existing sentence. The result of this was that the total period of parole was only about 13% of the total effective sentence (that included the pre-existing sentence for break enter and steal). It has been held on many occasions that accumulation of sentences may amount to special circumstances and that in some cases it is erroneous for the learned sentencing Judge to fail to find special circumstances when there is such accumulation if no reasons are given: see, for example, R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 at 61 (Hunt CJ at CL), Perry v R [2006] NSWCCA 351; (2006) 166 A Crim R 385 at [16] (Rothman J) and Ghamaraoui v R [2009] NSWCCA 111 at [20] (Grove J) and [28] (Howie J). 

28There is no specific ground of appeal asserting error in that regard. However, in re-sentencing the applicant I will make a finding of special circumstances based on the accumulation between the current sentences and the pre-existing sentence. My objective is to ensure that the applicant has a period on parole whereby he can re-adjust to community life and be subject to supervision. 

29In my opinion the appropriate sentence for each offence, taking into account the Form 1 matters in respect of the second offence and noting that the first offence involved a greater sum, is one of 2 years. I would find special circumstances in the accumulation and impose a non-parole period of 12 months. Like the sentencing Judge, I would accumulate the sentences to a degree of 3 months. The total effective sentence for these two offences would become 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months. 

30I would make the following orders: 
(1)Application for leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal allowed.

(3)The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed and in lieu thereof the offender is sentenced: 

(a)In respect of sequence 1, to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 29 May 2014 and expiring on 28 May 2015 with a balance of term of 12 months.
(b)In respect of sequence 2, to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 29 August 2014 and expiring on 28 August 2015 with a balance of term of 12 months expiring on 28 August 2016 

(4)The applicant is to be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period for sequence 2.

2764803,MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183,"Judgment1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Bellew J.
2ADAMSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J:  On 6 October 2005 MLP (""the appellant"") appeared for sentence before his Honour Judge Garling in the District Court, having been convicted by a jury of an offence contrary to s. 66A of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that between 1 February 2003 and 1 July 2003, near Forster in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with a person then under the age of 10 years.  The victim of the offending was the appellant's daughter who was then aged 9.
4An offence contrary to s. 66A carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment is prescribed. 
5The appellant was sentenced by Judge Garling to a non-parole period of 12 years imprisonment, with an additional term of 4 years, both to date from 12 May 2005.  
6The appellant subsequently sought leave to appeal to this Court against his sentence.  Leave was granted and the appeal was allowed.  The head sentence of 16 years imprisonment was confirmed but the non-parole period was reduced to 11 years: MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93.  The appellant is presently eligible for parole on 11 May 2016.
7The sentences determined by Judge Garling and by the Court of Criminal Appeal were imposed prior to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  Following the decision in Muldrock, the appellant made an application pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  The basis of that application was that both Judge Garling and the Court of Criminal Appeal had, contrary to the decision in Muldrock, engaged in a two-stage process of sentencing, and/or had given the standard non-parole period primary or determinative significance.  Error on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal was conceded by the Attorney-General on that application.  Accordingly, the application was granted and the matter was referred to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: Application by MLP pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 390.  
8In the hearing before this Court the Crown, consistent with the position previously taken by the Attorney-General, accepted that error was established.  In these circumstances, the sole issue to be determined by this Court is whether some other sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s. 6(3). 
THE FACTS9The following is taken from the sentencing remarks of Judge Garling (commencing at ROS 2):
""(MLP) was the natural father of (the victim).  She was born on 12 January 1994.  She was aged nine years at the time of the commission of this offence.  At the time of the commission of this offence the prisoner and his wife were separated.  The prisoner had taken his three children .... on a camping trip in a Kombi van to an area near Forster.  The children lived with their mother, but the prisoner had access visits from time to time.  The prisoner and the children were preparing to go to bed.  There was one large bed in the van.  The prisoner gave his children a cuddle before they went to sleep.  (The victim) was the last.  The prisoner pulled down her pyjama pants and inserted his penis into her vagina.  She said, and I accept:  ""His penis was hard, it hurt, he left it in me for about ten seconds"".  This occurred with the two other young children in the van.  On 12 July 2003 (the victim) told her mother and subsequently the police were involved.  
Dr Birkby, who examined (the victim) gave evidence.  She said that the young girl's hymen had been torn.  This would normally occur with first sexual intercourse and had been caused by an adult penis being inserted into (the victim's) vagina"".  
10His Honour continued (at ROS 9):
""The prisoner was thirty-seven years of age at the time.  His daughter was nine years of age.  There was actual penile penetration to the extent that the hymen had been torn.  The victim said that his penis was hard and it hurt.  It was in her vagina for about 10 seconds.  She was his daughter.  He was her father.  She had gone to him for an access visit and, for what could only be described as his own sexual gratification, he had sexual intercourse with this young girl.  It happened at night.  It happened in the van with two other children present.  It happened, as I recall, in a fairly quiet area.  He was not, he says, affected by alcohol.  I do not know what effect I has had on this young girl, but I do know that it will have had some effect and perhaps a considerable effect"".  ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BEFORE THIS COURT11Counsel for the appellant read the following affidavits without objection: 
(i)the appellant of 17 June 2014; 
(ii)xxx (the appellant's sister) of 18 June 2014;
(iii)xxx (the appellant's father) of 18 June 2014;
(iv)Steven Eccleshall (the appellant's solicitor) of 4 July 2014.
12I have referred to this evidence in more detail below.
SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT13Counsel for the appellant emphasised that in order to find that some other sentence was warranted it was not necessary for this Court to conclude that the applicant's sentence was manifestly excessive:  Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237 at [10]-[12] per Spigelman CJ.  Counsel's fundamental submission was that when all relevant facts were taken into account, the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and unwarranted.
14Counsel for the appellant turned firstly to the circumstances of the offending. Counsel emphasised, in particular, that the offending was isolated (and thus not representative of a pattern of behaviour) and of short duration.  It was further submitted that such matters were relevant to an assessment of the appellant's moral culpability, but were not reflected in the sentence imposed, adequately or at all.  
15Secondly, counsel relied upon the affidavit evidence.  It was submitted that such evidence established (inter alia) the following relevant circumstances:
(i)the appellant had served the entirety of his sentence in protective custody;
(ii)he remained at risk of assault;
(iii)he had been generally well-behaved whilst in custody;
(iv)had undertaken such rehabilitative programs as had been offered to him;
(v)he had been employed; and 
(vi)he had a number of health issues including (in particular) Depression, Barmah Forest Virus and Hepatitis C (the last being a condition for which he underwent surgery in May 2013, and in respect of which he continued to suffer ongoing difficulties).
16Counsel for the appellant also relied on the fact that in 2010 the appellant's mother died following complications from what was originally anticipated to be routine surgery.  It was submitted that the affidavit evidence established that the appellant's father was now elderly, in poor health and adversely affected by his wife's death.  It was submitted that all of these matters, in combination with the health issues of the appellant's siblings as set out in the affidavit material, combined to impact adversely upon the frequency of the appellant's contact with his family generally.  It was submitted that such matters weighed heavily on the appellant, and rendered his conditions of custody more onerous.  
17It should be emphasised that counsel for the appellant did not submit that these matters resulted in exceptional hardship being visited upon the appellant's family as a consequence of his incarceration: R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222.  Rather, the submission was that the effect of such matters upon the appellant himself was a relevant factor in determining whether or not some lesser sentence was warranted.  
18Finally, counsel for the appellant took the court to sentencing statistics, along with a number of sentences imposed in other cases of offending contrary to s. 66A.  It was submitted that such statistics, and the outcomes of the cases to which the court was referred, demonstrated that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was unduly harsh and unwarranted.  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN19The Crown submitted that the factors relied upon by the appellant did not support a conclusion that some other sentence was warranted.  In terms of the offending itself, the Crown emphasised that the actions of the appellant constituted a serious breach of trust.  The Crown also relied upon the fact that the offending involved full penile/vaginal penetration, albeit only for a short period.  
20The Crown also relied on the fact that the appellant continued to deny the offending.  It was pointed out that in these circumstances he could not have the benefit of a finding that he had demonstrated contrition or remorse.  
21In terms of the affidavit evidence the Crown submitted, in effect, that the circumstances which had impacted upon the appellant's contact with his family were not substantially different to the situation faced by the majority of people in custody.  
22In terms of the appellant's reliance upon sentences imposed in other case, the Crown stressed the need for care to be taken in engaging when comparing the outcome of one case to another.  
23At the conclusion of oral argument the Crown was provided with an opportunity to refer the court to further authorities in response to those relied upon by the appellant.  The Crown took that opportunity and referred the Court to sentences imposed in cases which, it was submitted, supported a conclusion that the sentence remained appropriate.   

CONSIDERATION24In light of the circumstances in which the appellant's case has again come before this Court, it is appropriate to commence by referring to the principles applicable to sentencing for offences in respect of which a standard non-parole period is prescribed.
25The approach to be adopted in such cases is set out in Muldrock (supra).  The Court must reach a determination having regard to the range of applicable factors, both aggravating and mitigating, which bear upon the determination of an appropriate sentence.  In particular, the Court must not engage in a process of sentencing which involves asking whether or not there are factors which warrant some departure from the standard non-parole period.  The Court must also ensure that it does not give the standard non-parole period primary or determinative significance.  
26At the same time, it is important to recognise that the standard non-parole period, along with the maximum penalty, constitute the two legislative guide posts which are relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence: R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 at [62].
27With these matters in mind, I turn firstly to consider the circumstances of the appellant's offending.  
28On any view, the offending was objectively serious.  On the facts found by the sentencing judge the appellant forced his penis into the vagina of his daughter who was then only 9 years of age.  The offending occurred in the immediate presence of the appellant's other children.  
29As the victim's father, the appellant was in a position of trust.  The victim was entitled to feel safe in his presence.  The appellant's actions betrayed that entitlement and his position of trust was seriously abused.  
30I accept that the duration of the offending was short.  I also accept that this is a factor relevant to a determination of the objective seriousness of the offending.  However in my view, the more important factor is that whatever its precise duration, the offending occurred over a sufficient period of time, and with sufficient force, to tear the victim's hymen.   
31Moreover, even accepting that the offending was limited to a short period of time, the resultant effect upon the victim is not similarly limited.  The importance of taking into account the ongoing effect, upon a young victim, of offending such as this was recently emphasised by this Court (Leeming JA, Johnson and Hall JJ) in R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110]-[112]:
""This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the ""long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do"". The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].
111. This factor no doubt contributes to the setting of the heaviest maximum penalty known to the criminal law for s.66A(2) offences, accompanied by a standard non-parole period of 15 years. It is important that sentences for s.66A(2) offences reflect this grave element implicit in the offence itself. 
112. This is an important feature in the present case. Young child victims are especially vulnerable. It is important that sentences passed for s.66A(2) offences recognize the harm done to the victim of the crime: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""
32In my view, those observations are apposite to the present case.  Concentrating upon the duration of sexual offending has the capacity to minimise, if not ignore, the significance of the long term effect of such offending upon a young victim.        
33The appellant denied (and apparently continues to deny) the offending.  That was, and remains, his right.  It is not an aggravating factor, but it necessarily means that expression of contrition and remorse is not something that the appellant can have taken into account in his favour.   
34Counsel for the appellant properly pointed out that a failure to express remorse does not disentitle an offender to a finding that his prospects of rehabilitation are good: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [84] per Johnson J (Hodgson JA and Rothman J agreeing), citing Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [65] and Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 at [48].  However, remorse remains a major factor in determining whether an offender is likely to re-offend.  Its absence renders it difficult to reach such a determination:  R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [41].
35In terms of the affidavit evidence which was relied upon, two particular observations should be made. 
36Firstly, ill health does not necessarily require that a sentence be mitigated from that which would otherwise be appropriate.  One of the relevant factors in determining what, if any weight, should be given to that factor will be the seriousness of the offence.  Another will be whether the medical condition existed at the time of the offence and whether it has deteriorated in the period between the offence and sentence:  R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 per Howie J at [18] (Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing) citing R v Kier [2004] NSWCCA 106 and R v L (NSWCCA unreported 17 June 1996).  
37In the present case, the offending is obviously serious.  Moreover, at least some of the appellant's health issues are of long standing, and pre-dated the offending.  In particular, when giving evidence before Judge Garling in the sentencing proceedings in 2005, the appellant said (inter alia) that he had previously:  
(i)contracted Barmah Forest Virus;
(ii)contracted hepatitis C in or about 1997; and
(iii)been diagnosed with depression (for which he had been medicated since 1997).  
38Further, this is not a case in which the appellant has asserted that the treatment which has been administered to him in custody has somehow been inadequate.  On the contrary, the medical records annexed to the affidavit of Mr Eccleshall tend to establish that the appellant has received appropriate medical treatment, including referral for specialist treatment when that has been considered necessary.     
39I accept that the circumstances surrounding his mother's death are necessarily the source of considerable anxiety for the appellant.  I also accept that the age and health of his father, the location in which he resides, and the health issues of the appellant's siblings all combine to render it difficult for the applicant to have regular contact with his family.  However it is not uncommon for those in the prison population to have elderly parents: Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 25; (2009) 193 A Crim R 190 at [51] per Latham J.  Moreover, separation from family members is an inevitable consequence of incarceration.
40That then brings me to consider the appellant's reliance upon sentencing statistics, along with a series of decisions in other cases of offending contrary to s. 66A, a combination of which was said to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was harsh and unwarranted.  Before doing so, it is necessary to refer to a number of statements of principle.
41Firstly, consistency in sentencing is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence.  What is sought is consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [48]-[49].  
42Secondly, in seeking consistency, other cases may establish a range of sentences which have been imposed.  But the sentences imposed in other cases do not mark the outer bounds of the permissible sentencing discretion.  They stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence.  What is important are the unifying principles which such sentences reveal and reflect: Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 305 ALR 323 at [41].  
43Thirdly, the presentation of sentences passed in the form of numerical tables and graphs is of limited use: Hili (supra) at [48].  This is because reference to the lengths of sentences passed says nothing about why the sentences were fixed as they were.  
44Consistent with such statements of principle, this Court has emphasised the need to adopt a careful approach when asked to utilise statistics:  R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153 at [117] per Kirby J, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Johnson J agreeing.  A similarly careful approach is required when the Court is asked to compare a sentence imposed in one case with a sentence imposed in another: RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [132] per Bellew J, McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing.  The need to take care in each instance arises, in part, from the fundamental fact that there will inevitably be differences, both in terms of the objective circumstances of offending and the subjective circumstances of the offender, between one case and another.
45In the present case, counsel for the appellant took the court to sentencing statistics which, it was submitted, demonstrated the harshness of the sentence which had been imposed upon the appellant.  It was pointed out, in particular, that only three other offenders charged with offending contrary to s. 66A had received a sentence greater than 14 years imprisonment.  It was also pointed out that each of those cases involved multiple offending, compared with that of the appellant which involved an isolated instance.  
46Even if such conclusions are supported by the statistical material, they do not lead to the further conclusion that some other sentence is warranted in the present case.  The sentence imposed upon the appellant might well be the highest imposed for a single instance of offending contrary to s. 66A.  That does not demonstrate that the sentence is unduly harsh.  As a matter of common sense, there will always be one sentence which constitutes the longest sentence imposed for particular offending:  Jolly v R [2013] NSWCCA 76 at [75].  In my view, the statistical material put before the Court in the present case does not support a conclusion that some other sentence is warranted.  
47I have considered the cases to which the Court was referred in which sentences were imposed for similar offending and which were said to demonstrate the harshness of the sentence imposed upon the appellant.  I am not persuaded that they support the conclusion that some other sentence is warranted, nor am I persuaded that they establish that the sentence imposed upon the appellant is at odds with some established sentencing range.  
48I do not propose to undertake an analysis of each and every case to which the Court was referred.  I need only refer to two in order to demonstrate the difficulties which are prone to arise from comparative exercises of this kind.    
49In RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235 the offender was convicted of one offence contrary to s. 66A and was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non parole period of 9 years.  Once again, that sentence was substantially less than that imposed upon the appellant.  The complainant in that case, who was 5 years old, had been playing with the offender's son.  The offender forced his penis into the complainant's mouth.  The offender was obviously supervising the complainant at the time but he was not her parent.  Moreover, the offender was found to have borderline intellectual functioning and his prospects of rehabilitation were assessed as being reasonable.  None of those factors apply in the case of the appellant.    50In Jones v R [2012] NSWCCA 262 the offender was sentenced in respect of two offences contrary to s. 66A on the basis that they formed part of the one continuous act.  The offender performed fellatio on a 12 year old boy, and then penetrated the boy's anus with his own penis.  The sentence imposed upon the offender, one of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years, was obviously substantially less than that imposed upon the appellant.  Equally, the offender was not the victim's parent, he was only 20 years of age, and he had the benefit of a finding of good character.  Again, none of those factors form part of the present case.  
51Although the offending in each of those cases was contrary to the same statutory provision as the appellant's offending, an examination of those two cases demonstrates that they were not really comparable at all.  In fact, they were materially different from the appellant's case in several important respects.  The presence of such differentiating factors explains, at least in part, why the sentence imposed in each case was less than that imposed upon the appellant.  All of these considerations demonstrate why it is that sentencing is not, and can never be, directed towards achieving numerical equivalence.   
52There is no doubt that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was stern.  However, having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant, I am not persuaded that some other sentence is warranted.  In coming to that view, I have had regard to the two legislative guideposts to which I previously referred.
53I propose the following order:
(1)The appeal is dismissed.

2764814,R v Villalon [2014] NSWSC 1261,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
 
1                    HIS HONOUR:  Michael Villalon has been found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter of his stepfather Keith Owen Chaney on 28 February 2012.  The jury acquitted him of the deceased’s murder. 
 
2                    The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. 
 
3                    The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.  The value the community places upon the preservation of human life is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (NSWCCA 12 December 1995, unreported).  The starting point in the present sentencing exercise, as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Keith Owen Chaney has been unlawfully taken:  R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA 12 December 1995 unreported). 
 
4                    During the trial and proceedings on sentence, Mr G Tabuteau appeared for the Crown and Ms J Manuell SC for the offender.  
 
5                    The offender did not give evidence during the trial or the proceedings on sentence.
 
6                    It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374.  Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. 
 
7                    Although the jury was instructed that in order to find the offender guilty of murder, the Crown was obliged to negative self-defence and provocation beyond reasonable doubt, the real issue in the trial concerned the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind which I am satisfied that the offender established on the balance of probabilities. 
 
8                    Accordingly, the offender is to be sentenced upon the basis that at the time he killed the deceased he was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental condition and the impairment was so substantial as to warrant the offender’s liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
 
9                    In order to make findings of fact that are consistent with the jury’s verdict, it is necessary to refer briefly to some of the evidence in the trial.  
 
10               The offender was born in the Philippines on 29 August 1984. He came to Australia on 1 April 2009 to live with his mother and the deceased at Mascot. The relationship between the deceased and the offender subsequently deteriorated and the deceased became antagonistic towards him. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased’s behaviour involved nagging, threats, physical assaults, and inappropriate behaviour. The assaults included the deceased punching the offender in the jaw in about late December 2011 and on another occasion hitting him with a towel. The deceased hit him on other occasions. 
 
11               The deceased displayed pornographic material in the lounge room of the home and made the offender watch pornographic videos and convert them into CD’s. The offender found the deceased’s behaviour to be offensive and considered him to be a pervert.  The offender was particularly concerned about the deceased’s inappropriate sexual conduct towards Chelsy, his younger sister.  
 
12               The offender had been a happy outgoing young man in the Philippines who had completed a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and was studying nursing. He was an active member of a church youth group. After being in Australia for about three months, the offender’s personality began to change.  His disclosures to relatives included hearing a woman crying or sounds inside the house such as a baby crying, hearing voices and feeling that something was falling out of the sky. He believed that the deceased had buried a lady under the house and was contaminating the water in the fridge. His medical records (ex N) revealed that he told a doctor on 1 July 2009 that when he slept he felt that his feet were biting and his hands had been cut. 
 
13               On the morning of 28 February 2012, a dispute arose between the offender and the deceased about the bathroom door and the front and back doors of the dwelling being left open or closed.  The deceased had often argued with him about the doors.  
 
14               The deceased went to touch the offender in the chest area, so the offender pushed him back. He struck the deceased with a figurine, then stabbed him with a knife a number of times in the abdomen, then below the right eye, penetrating through the spinal cord, which was partly severed. This was the fatal blow due to consequent neurological shock. The offender left the knife in situ. 
 
15               Using a second knife, the offender inflicted deep wounds to the deceased’s chin and neck.  The chin had a vertical wound of 13cm, and there was a horizontal cut across the neck, which had severed the trachea, the oesophagus, the right carotid artery, and the internal jugular vein. On it’s own, this would have been a fatal injury.
 
16               The offender then used a hammer to inflict seven lacerations to the top of the head.  Three of the lacerations involved skull fractures. There were other lesser injuries, including defence-type injuries to the deceased’s left arm.  The offender’s attack upon the deceased was deliberate, brutal and sustained.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the deceased. 
 
17               The forensic psychiatrists Dr Allnutt, Dr Westmore and Dr Furst, all of whom gave evidence during the trial were of the opinion that the offender was suffering from an underlying psychotic illness when he killed the deceased.  Dr Allnutt, who was called in the Crown case, believed that the psychotic illness was either a schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia. Dr Allnutt considered that as a consequence of the underlying psychotic illness, the offender experienced an abnormality of mind (persecutory beliefs, referential thoughts and auditory phenomena).
 
18               When dealing with the question of impairment, Dr Allnutt told the jury (T401 L45-50; T402 L1-10; T 402 L31-38): 
 
“If it is accepted that at the material time that at least some of the beliefs about the deceased were erroneous or distorted by a paranoid bias, then there are grounds to conclude that at the material time that the alleged offending occurred the defendant was suffering from an underlying condition, that is, that he had an undiagnosed or early signs of psychotic disorder that, as a consequence of his underlying condition, he experienced an abnormality of mind, persecutory beliefs, referential thoughts and auditory phenomena around that time.  It is probable that his abnormality of mind impacted on his capacity to understand events, making illogical and erroneous interpretation of some events relating to the deceased that led him to believe that the deceased was conspiring with others to have him harmed in a serious manner.  That the deceased was putting various medications into the drinking water and milk, attempting to harm his mother, in hearing a baby cry next door or hearing a woman saying, 'Help help'.
 
It is probable that these beliefs and perceptions would have contributed to a sense of justification with regard to his attack on the deceased.  Driven by underlying feelings of anger, fear and indignation at what he had seen as provocative behaviour on the part of the deceased.  On this basis, he would be regarded as compromised in his capacity to judge right from wrong, but his capacity was not completely negated given evidence of knowledge of wrongfulness immediately afterwards.”
 
 
19               Dr Allnutt concluded that “it is more likely than not that [the offender] commenced experiencing psychotic symptoms a number of years ago” and “was manifesting symptoms of a developing mental illness” (T 401).
 
20               Dr Westmore had no doubt that the offender was mentally ill at the time he killed the deceased. His differential diagnosis was a paranoid schizophrenic illness or a psychosis occurring in the context of a depression.  Dr Westmore was of the opinion that the offender’s medical records (ex N) revealed in 2009 symptoms of a deteriorating mental state which transpired to be a psychotic illness and an abnormality of mind. 
 
21               Dr Westmore said that the abnormality of mind would have impaired the offender’s capacity to think normally. Dr Westmore opined that the offender’s capacity to interpret, deal with, understand and manage whatever situation he was in would have been compromised. His capacity to fully assess what was occurring, comprehend it and deal with it in an effective way was impaired. His thoughts and feelings about the deceased because of his disturbed mental state would have influenced his behaviour. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that there was a loss of control component in the offender’s behaviour resulting from his mental illness. 
 
22               Dr Furst’s primary diagnosis was that the offender was suffering from schizophrenia, paranoid type at the time of the deceased’s death. Dr Furst said that the offender’s underlying schizophrenic illness significantly adversely affected his capacity to understand ordinary everyday events; the reason being that the offender may misinterpret things and look at them with a paranoid perspective. He opined that the underlying schizophrenic illness probably impacted on the offender’s ability to reason about his actions and their wrongfulness. Dr Furst was of the opinion that the offender knew that he was killing the deceased and probably realised after the killing he had done the wrong thing. Dr Furst considered that the offender’s lack of capacity to control himself was his clearest impairment.  Dr Furst told the jury that the offender’s impairment was significant.  
 
23               The jury was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time the offender killed the deceased, his capacity to understand events, to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying schizophrenic illness. The jury was further satisfied that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant (applying community standards) his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
 
24               The offender’s substantial impairment reduces his moral culpability for the killing: s 21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  However, it neither negates his moral culpability entirely: R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [34], nor does it entirely excuse his deliberate acts which were committed with an intention to kill: Blacklidge at p5.  
 
25               The deceased’s antagonistic conduct towards the offender which involved nagging, threats, physical assaults and inappropriate behaviour allows in my view for an assessment of provocation under s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Provocation by the deceased is a mitigating factor that I take into account in determining the appropriate sentence. 
 
26               Another matter that mitigates the seriousness of the offence is that it was not planned but was committed on the spur of the moment: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, the offence is objectively serious as the offender unlawfully took the deceased’s life.
 
27               I take into account as a mitigating factor that the offender does not have a record of previous convictions in the Philippines or in Australia: s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. When the offence was committed he was 27 years old and is now 30 years old.  The offender’s academic record, membership of a church youth group and his relatives’ evidence during the trial lead me to conclude that he was a person of good character, which is a mitigating factor: s 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
 
28               Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them.  By his plea of guilty to manslaughter, the offender has accepted responsibility for his offending. Upon all of the evidence, I am unable to find on the balance of probabilities that the offender has acknowledged the injury, loss or damage caused by his actions. His sentence is not to be increased for that, but no allowance in mitigation can be made for remorse. 
 
29               Whilst the proceedings were in the Local Court, the offender’s solicitor wrote on 12 December 2012 to the Director of Public Prosecutions enclosing a copy of Dr Westmore’s report and advised that the offender intended to plead not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment.  The offender’s intention to plead guilty to manslaughter was confirmed at the committal hearing on 2 April 2013.  The Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the offender’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. Upon arraignment on 7 June 2013, the offender pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter which he confirmed before the jury in the first trial and the trial before me. In these circumstances, I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 20 per cent. 
 
30               The offender’s schizophrenic illness has the consequence that he is an inappropriate vehicle for making an example for others. Nevertheless, considerations of general deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194. I do, however, give little weight to general deterrence. 
 
31               The Crown invites me to find that there is a significant risk of re-offending and future dangerousness. Ms Manuell submits that the offender’s risk of re-offending is low. 
 
32               A finding of future dangerousness does not need to be established beyond reasonable doubt: R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310; (2003) 58 NSWLR 589. It is sufficient if the Crown establishes that there is a risk of re-offending: R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314.
 
33               In a report dated 25 August 2014, Dr Furst referred to the evidence given at trial that the prodromal stage of schizophrenia is the most dangerous period. He stated that the statistics indicate a much reduced rate of homicide and serious violence in people who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated.  Dr Furst cautioned (p6):
 
“However, the overall rate of homicide is still above community baseline rates, approximately three-fold, suggesting the need for ongoing monitoring and assertive treatment.”
 
34               Dr Furst reported that the offender’s mood has improved and he is more reactive. He was no longer showing any signs of delusions, hallucinations or acute mood disturbance. He has improved insight and there were no indication that he had been violent, threatening or had self-harmed since his arrest. The offender’s current medication is Seroquel XR (Quetiapine) 400mg orally at night.  
 
35               Dr Furst observed that the offender’s illness had responded better to treatment with Seroquel XR than previous antipsychotic medications with noted improvements in his mood. He said that the offender does not entertain any current violent fantasies. He considered given the severity of the offender’s delusional beliefs, persistence of psychotic symptoms for over 18 months after his arrest, and fluctuating levels of insight, a Community Treatment Order was probably warranted. Dr Furst described the offender’s insight as “partial”, but said that the offender accepted the need for future psychiatric treatment with medication and community follow-up. In Dr Furst’s opinion, the overall risk of re-offending was low, especially if the offender adheres to the proposed psychiatric treatment plan upon release that is detailed at page 7 of the report. 
 
36               Affidavits sworn by Maria Villalon, the offender’s mother (ex 10), Chelsy Villalon, his sister (ex 9) and Angelina Le Mene, his aunt (ex 11) demonstrate that the offender continues to have the support of his family. Since the offender’s trial, these family members have a better understanding of schizophrenia and the offender’s need for ongoing psychiatric care and management. Upon release, the offender will be able to live with Chelsy and her boyfriend. 
 
37               I am satisfied that the offender’s risk of re-offending is low provided he continues to take his medication and adheres upon release to the proposed psychiatric treatment plan. Much will depend upon the support of his family and the offender’s continued acceptance that the maintenance of his medication and psychiatric treatment are essential. In these circumstances, the offender’s mental illness does not eliminate the need for specific deterrence to which I give modest weight in the sentence. 
 
38               During the proceedings on sentence, various cases were cited by counsel. I have found all of this material helpful, but each case depends on its own facts. 
 
39               I find that special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence being the offender’s need for ongoing psychiatric treatment. I have determined that a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63]. 
 
40               Taking into account all factors that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence I consider is 10 years. The sentence is reduced by 20 per cent to 8 years. 
 
41               The offender has been in custody since 28 February 2012 which is the agreed date for the commencement of the sentence. 
 
42               Michael Villalon for the offence of manslaughter, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months commencing on 28 February 2012 and expiring on 27 August 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 28 August 2017 and expiring on 27 February 2020. 
 
 
 
43               The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 
27 August 2017. 
 
44               The offender’s release to parole and conditions of that parole are a matter for the New South Wales State Parole Authority, but I recommend that a condition upon his release is his adherence to a community based psychiatric treatment plan. I ask the Registrar of the Court to forward a copy of these sentencing remarks and Dr Furst’s report dated 25 August 2014 to the State Parole Authority. 
 
45               I ask Ms Robinson to advise the offender of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offence for which he has been sentenced.

		18 September 2014",2014-09-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764818,R v Seller; R v McCarthy (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1290,"Judgment


	
	On 22 August 2014, I made orders disposing of identical notices of motion filed by the two accused. These are the reasons for those orders.
	
	
	The orders sought were as follows:
	



	
	An order that Quincy Tang be prohibited from giving evidence in these proceedings in accordance with his three statements dated 3 November 2009 and his statement dated 30 June 2010.
	
	
	An order that all persons (including legal practitioners) who have read or listened to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material be prohibited from (a) giving evidence in these proceedings; (b) assisting the Commonwealth DPP in the preparation and conduct of these proceedings; (c) being retained or engaged by the Commonwealth DPP in the conduct of these proceedings.
	
	
	The CDPP identify:
	



	
	the name of all persons who have had access to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material whom the Crown proposes to call as witnesses or who have assisted;
	
	
	in the preparation and conduct of these proceedings [sic];
	
	
	what Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material those person(s) have had access to;
	
	
	when those person(s) have had access to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material.
	



	
	An order that the ACC Accusatorial Process Material and Indirect Accusatorial Process Material be returned to the Australian Crime Commission.
	
	
	[Not pressed]
	
	
	An order temporarily staying these proceedings pending:
	



	
	The CDPP's compliance with paragraph 3 of this Notice of Motion;
	
	
	The engagement of other counsel and CDPP personnel who have not read or listened to the Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material; and
	
	
	The filing and serving of a Crown case statement (howsoever called) and particulars of the charge which have not been derived from Accusatorial Process Material or Indirect Accusatorial Process Material.
	



	
	Such other orders as the Court deems fit.
	
	
	Any proceedings on the indictment presented on 14 March 2012 against Ross Seller be stayed.
	



	
	The notices of motion also provided:
	


For the purposes of this notice of motion:

“Accusatorial Process Material” means transcripts, recordings or notes of any officer of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP), Australian Crime Commission (ACC) in respect of compulsory examinations of either accused at the ACC and documents and other materials compulsorily produced by either accused to the ACC.

“Indirect Accusatorial Process Material” means material obtained indirectly by the ACC or the CDPP from use of the Accusatorial Process Material.


	
	I made order one in a slightly adjusted form, and dismissed all of the other orders.
	
	
	The motions raised difficult questions about the interrelationship between, on the one hand, compulsory examinations of citizens by bodies such as the Australian Crime Commission (the ACC) and compulsory production of items by citizens to such bodies and, on the other hand, the right of such citizens to a subsequent fair trial according to law.
	


Some preliminary matters


	
	Mr McCarthy was represented by senior counsel. Mr Seller was represented by counsel. As I have indicated, the notices relied upon were relevantly identical. Counsel for Mr Seller adopted the submissions of senior counsel for Mr McCarthy. In this judgment, I shall draw no distinction between the legal submissions of the two accused.
	
	
	A similar but by no means identical motion was determined by Garling J in R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2012] NSWSC 934; (2012) 269 FLR 125. The findings of fact made by his Honour were not disturbed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in an appeal against the permanent stay granted by his Honour: R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42; 273 FLR 155. In a separate extemporaneous judgment of 29 July 2014, I rejected the proposition of the two accused that, on the hearing of this different motion, the findings of fact made by his Honour could not be controverted by any party. It follows that I have made my own findings of fact based upon the evidence placed before me, some of which was before Garling J.
	
	
	The Crown and the two accused were content for me to focus my analysis of legal principle on four decisions:
	



	
	R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] (delivered 1 March 2013);
	
	
	X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92 (delivered 26 June 2013);
	
	
	the refusal of special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: Seller v The Queen; McCarthy v The Queen [2013] HCATrans 204 (6 September 2013); and
	
	
	Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 656 (delivered 21 May 2014).
	



	
	For convenience, I shall refer compendiously in this judgment to the transcripts of the compulsory examinations and the documents compulsorily produced by the two accused as the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	The two accused relied upon material that was tendered on the motion to which the Crown did not have access; namely, the compulsorily acquired material. Despite my expressed reservations, the Crown was content to make submissions in the absence of that access on its part, and for me to determine the motion in those circumstances. Exhibits to which the Crown did not have access on the hearing of the motion were marked as confidential exhibits.
	


Background


	
	The two accused have each been arraigned in this Court on two counts. The first count is of conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth between 22 March 1999 and 23 May 2001 contrary to ss 29D and 86(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The second count is of conspiring with the intention of dishonestly influencing a Commonwealth public official between 24 May 2001 and 30 June 2004 contrary to s 135.4(7) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Each accused has pleaded not guilty, and a joint trial by jury is listed to commence before me shortly.
	
	
	To state the Crown case with great succinctness, it is alleged that Mr Seller, a solicitor, and Mr McCarthy, an accountant, were involved in the setting up of a number of “schemes” that were founded on the purported production of whisky in Scotland (the whisky schemes) and that were designed to obtain significant tax deductions for investors. Although the Crown case asserts that the schemes possessed aspects of dishonesty, that dishonesty is not the focus of the Crown case. Rather, the Crown case in a nutshell is that the two accused entered into a criminal agreement to defraud the Commonwealth by misleading it about salient aspects of the schemes, and that the sundry misrepresentations made by the two accused to officers of the Australian Tax Office (the ATO) are the overt acts evidencing the conspiracy (see “Outline of the case the Crown will present at trial”, filed 23 March 2012).
	


Undisputed facts


	
	The following is derived from a document entitled “Agreed Facts” that became exhibit 1 on the motion.
	
	
	Mr McCarthy gave evidence at the ACC compulsory examinations on 14 to 17 May, 30 July, and 12 to 13 September 2007. He also produced certain documents to the ACC under compulsion.
	
	
	Mr Seller gave evidence at the ACC compulsory examinations on 13 and 14 September 2007. He also produced certain documents to the ACC under compulsion.
	
	
	The transcripts of the compulsory examinations of the two accused were disseminated by the ACC to the Commonwealth DPP on 18 December 2007, and documents identified as exhibits shown to the two accused at their examinations were disseminated by the ACC to the Commonwealth DPP in January 2010.
	
	
	That dissemination was unlawful having regard to the requirements of s 25A(9) of the Austrailan Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth). That provision provides:
	


(9)  An examiner may direct that:

(a)  any evidence given before the examiner; or

(b)  the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or

(c)  any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or

(d)  the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.


	
	Mr Quincy Tang was one of the principal investigators of the whisky schemes, including investigating the conduct of the accused. He was largely responsible for the compilation of the financial material which underlies an understanding of the whisky schemes. As the principal financial investigator, he played a significant role in the preparation of flow charts that show fund flows between entities said to be associated with the whisky schemes.
	
	
	The following matters were not in dispute at the Bar table.
	
	
	No member of the current Crown legal team (comprising a solicitor, junior counsel and senior counsel) has read or otherwise had direct access to any of the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	No person who had had access to that material had, in conference, informed any of those lawyers of the contents of it in any explicit sense.
	


Order one


	
	To state the submissions of fact and law of the two accused in support of order one with great succinctness, they were as follows.
	
	
	Mr Tang, a forensic accountant proposed to be an expert witness in the Crown case, was present at the lengthy compulsory examinations of both accused. Mr Tang has had extensive access to the transcripts of the compulsory examinations, and also to the documents produced compulsorily by the two accused. The understanding of Mr Tang of the whisky schemes, and as a result his proposed evidence, has been substantially enhanced by the compulsorily acquired material. It would be extremely difficult to cross-examine Mr Tang effectively about his analysis without the inadmissible compulsorily acquired material being revealed to the jury. The reception in those circumstances of the evidence of Mr Tang in a criminal trial would be contrary to the principles discussed by the High Court of Australia in X7 v Australian Crime Commission and Lee v The Queen [2014], and the principles discussed in R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] by Bathurst CJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed, Rothman J providing additional reasons). Accordingly the evidence should be excluded, either by way of an implicit mechanism of the trial being stayed if his evidence were to be led, or, in the alternative, pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Generally, I have accepted those submissions.
	


(i) Disputed facts with regard to order one


	
	By the end of the oral submissions, the parties were in agreement that the access by Mr Tang to the compulsorily acquired material assisted his understanding of the whisky schemes in some way; the question was one of degree. The Crown submitted that the assistance was negligible. The two accused submitted that it was very substantial. That dispute can be broken down into a number of constituent parts.
	
	
	First, the two accused submitted that a detailed consideration of the financial analysis undertaken by Mr Tang shows that, in his understanding of movements of funds around the globe as part of the whisky schemes, he had been explicitly assisted by particular aspects of the compulsorily acquired material. The Crown resisted that proposition, and sought to demonstrate that each example proffered by the two accused could be explained by material that had been available to Mr Tang years before the compulsory acquired material was available to him.
	
	
	Secondly, the two accused submitted that, by having access to the compulsorily acquired data in the financial management software MYOB of Mr McCarthy, the understanding of Mr Tang of movements of funds and the purposes (or purported purposes) of those movements had been enhanced.
	
	
	The Crown resisted that proposition on three bases. The first was that MYOB and similar software tell one little beyond what one can tell from bank statements and the like. The second was that the material in such software is dependent upon the data that has been entered into it; it tells one nothing about the objective financial reality. The third basis was that, in any event, Mr Tang did not have access to computers that permitted him to interrogate MYOB with any facility.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the evidence to be given by Mr Tang in accordance with his statements will be mechanistic and not analytical. Indeed, at one stage of the hearing the Crown posited the theory that the evidence of Mr Tang is not that of an expert pursuant to s 79 of the Evidence Act, but rather merely evidence that takes advantage of the facilitative provision in s 50 of the same Act: see transcript of motion (TOM) 73. The Crown submitted that Mr Tang in his proposed evidence will say nothing as to whether various funds transfers were noteworthy, or unusual, or redolent of dishonesty. All that Mr Tang will give evidence of is the movement of funds to and from various accounts.
	
	
	To the contrary, the two accused submitted that, even if one limits oneself to consideration of the contents of the statements of Mr Tang, they cannot be characterised as merely mechanistic, and therefore readily derivable from the documents that were available to Mr Tang from sources other than the compulsorily acquired material. For example, I was informed that the question of whether or not entities to which funds were allegedly transferred to the benefit of the two accused were indeed under their control is a matter that will be sharply disputed in the trial. To the extent that the funds flow diagrams that form an important part of the evidence of Mr Tang baldly assert that funds ended up being transferred to the two accused, they submitted that that assertion is by no means mechanistic.
	


(ii) Resolution of the disputed facts with regard to order one


	
	It is true that the efforts in cross-examination by the two accused to demonstrate that particular aspects of the compulsorily acquired material specifically informed (in an arithmetical sense) the statements of Mr Tang were not crowned with great success.
	
	
	It is also true that the bulk of the contents of the statements that set out the evidence that Mr Tang will give are mechanistic and not analytical.
	
	
	I regard each of those matters as significant, but not determinative.
	
	
	Despite those two findings of mine, I have come to the view that Mr Tang’s understanding of the whisky schemes underpinning his proposed evidence was informed to a not insubstantial degree by his access to the compulsorily acquired material. That is so for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, Mr Tang said words to that effect during his cross-examination. At the end of that process, the following exchange occurred (at TOM 353.21- 354.1):
	


Q. I want to suggest to you that it's a reasonable possibility that the section 28 summons material, including the service agreement, including the MYOB files and the evidence that Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller gave in the compulsory examination, has assisted you in your knowledge of Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller's involvement in the whisky schemes?

A. Yes.

Q. That material ‑ I won't repeat it all ‑ but that material has assisted you in knowing about their explanation of how the schemes work?

A. Yes.

Q. That material has assisted you in particular knowing their explanation about the role promissory notes had to play in the schemes?

A. Yes.

Q. That material assisted you in knowing their explanation of the status of various entities, including Grant McKenzie Hong Kong and Chambers Finance?

A. Yes.

Q. That material assisted you in knowing their explanation of their relationship between those various entities?

A. Yes.

Q. That material has assisted you in knowing the role of those entities in the whisky schemes ventures?

A. Yes.

Q. And that material has assisted you in knowing Mr McCarthy's explanation of the reason why Eon received payments from Grant McKenzie Hong Kong?

A. Yes.


	
	It is true that in re-examination, the following exchange occurred (at TOM 375.18-40):
	


Q. With respect to Chambers Finance, the party which on your analysis, as stated in your statements, purported to be making the loans evidenced by promissory notes?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you dependent upon anything that you gained from the answers given in the compulsory examinations of the accused, or from any documents that they produced under compulsion?

A. No.

Q. To ascertain Chambers Finance role in the structure?

A. No.

Q. For the purposes of ascertaining what part Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy personally had played in arranging the structure and causing the transactions to be undertaken and implemented and the like, did you depend upon anything that they had said under compulsion or any documents they produced under compulsion?

A. In relation to the statements?

Q. In relation to the part they had played in implementing and putting into effect the structure that you tracked in your statements?

A. No.


	
	I accept the truthfulness of all of those answers. However, to my mind there is a clear distinction between one’s understanding being assisted by material, and one’s understanding being dependent upon material. I accept the correctness of the evidence of Mr Tang that his understanding did not depend upon the compulsorily acquired material; such acceptance does not gainsay the proposition that his understanding was not insubstantially informed by it.
	
	
	Secondly, it is true that, in light of the way that the Crown frames its case, the whisky schemes are not the focus of the Crown case. The focus is on the things allegedly said and done by the two accused to mislead the ATO. Still and all, the whisky schemes will be an important part of the Crown case at trial. They cannot be characterised as mere background.
	
	
	Thirdly, without of course revealing the contents of confidential exhibits in this judgment, it can be seen that the compulsory examinations of the two accused were lengthy, probing and detailed. On occasions both men gave very detailed answers. Nothing about the compulsory examinations was cursory.
	
	
	Fourthly, a very large number of documents were compulsorily produced by the two accused.
	
	
	Fifthly, Mr Tang was present at much of the compulsory examinations. I accept his evidence that part of his reason for being present was in order to assist counsel who was cross-examining each examinee. But I also consider that he took an intellectual and personal interest, not only in the questions asked, but also in the answers given. He said as much in cross-examination before me at TOM 180.6.
	
	
	Sixthly, Mr Tang repeatedly accessed the compulsorily acquired material for extended periods between the time when it was compulsorily obtained and the preparation of his statements. On 31 July 2007 he uplifted a CD containing either a video or oral recording of Mr McCarthy’s compulsory examinations on 14 to 17 May 2007 for a period of seven days (Exhibit 44). On 4 September 2007 he uplifted a CD containing MYOB files compulsorily produced by Mr McCarthy for a period of around four hours (Exhibit 42 page 23; Exhibit 43 page 23). On 11 September 2007 Mr Tang accessed an electronically stored copy of the Service Agreement (Exhibit 39) compulsorily produced by Mr McCarthy (Exhibit 25 ACC item 7 page 313; Exhibit 22 ACC item 14 page 690). He accessed that document again on 7 May 2008 (Exhibit 25 ACC item 7 page 575; Exhibit 22 ACC item 14 page 707) and on 24 March 2009 (Exhibit 25 ACC item 7 page 1036; exhibit 22 ACC item 14 page 720). On 3, 12, 15 and 18 October 2007, 5 November 2007, 15 September 2008, 25 November 2008 and 11 December 2008 Mr Tang accessed electronically stored transcripts of compulsory examinations of the two accused (Exhibit 27).
	
	
	I accept that some of that access may have been for other purposes. But in light of the interest of the authorities in the two accused; their alleged centrality to the whisky schemes (see TOM 203.33-35; 388.35); and the sums allegedly involved, I am satisfied that a substantial proportion of that access was to do with analysing the whisky schemes and the roles of the two accused within them. In cross-examination Mr Tang agreed that he accessed the transcripts of the compulsory examination transcripts “because [he] regarded [them] as being of some importance” (at TOM 207.45-58).
	
	
	Seventhly, Mr Tang created a number of documents that collated and analysed the compulsorily acquired material. He did not merely read or view the material without conducting any subsequent documentary analysis. It is noteworthy that Mr Tang accessed the Service Agreement between two entities said to be associated with the two accused (which became Exhibit 39) for the third time on 24 March 2009, very shortly before he created a draft statement with regard to Mr McCarthy’s involvement in the whisky schemes (annexure marked “PH20” to Exhibit 41, which was attached to an email dated 30 March 2009 that became Exhibit 16; see TOM 484). In cross-examination Mr Tang agreed that there was a “reasonable possibility” that he accessed the Service Agreement to assist in the draft statement: see TOM 351.18-21.
	
	
	Eighthly, I do not accept that MYOB and personal accounting software, as compared to bank statements, does not provide additional information to an analyst. Indeed, the purpose of such software, and the reasons why members of the community are prepared to pay substantial sums for it, is because it provides the facility to analyse one’s financial affairs with far greater ease than simply by way of bits of paper. It is well known, and demonstrated by the evidence in this case, that part of the advantage of such software is that it permits characterisation of transactions, and not just their bald quantification.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Tang was a little confused as to whether or not he was indeed able to interrogate the MYOB files effectively; that confusion is perfectly understandable, in light of the passage of many years since the events about which he was giving evidence. It is also true that there was evidence of a general nature about the rudimentary nature of the computers available to Mr Tang when it came to interrogating MYOB. I accept that Mr Tang’s ability to interrogate the software was not optimal. Nevertheless, the fact that he repeatedly accessed it leads me to infer that there was some utility in him doing so. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the compulsorily acquired MYOB files played a role in the enhancement of the understanding of Mr Tang of the whisky schemes that went beyond the negligible.
	
	
	Ninethly, I accept that Mr Tang is honestly of the opinion expressed in his affidavit of 24 July 2014 that became exhibit D, in light of the other material available to him, the compulsorily acquired material has not been of significance in the enhancement of his understanding of the whisky schemes. But I do not accept that one can accurately analyse one’s own thought processes, in particular with regard to complex evaluative judgments, and determine with accuracy the degree to which a particular piece of data has played a role in the determination of one’s final evaluation. That is no criticism of Mr Tang: I do not believe that any person is able to undertake that self-analysis of his or her unconscious mental processes. In particular, I do not consider that a person can state with certainty whether he or she would have come to the same conclusion if he or she had not been provided with data with which the person has in fact been provided.
	
	
	Tenthly, my understanding of the issues that are in dispute, and the real issues in the trial is, of course, undeveloped at this stage. But for the purposes of the motion, I have accepted the assurance of senior counsel for Mr McCarthy that the question of whether or not funds were ultimately transferred to the benefit of the two accused is by no means a mechanistic one but rather analytical or evaluative, and that therefore that aspect of the funds flow diagrams that form the nub of the proposed evidence of Mr Tang cannot be dismissed as nothing more than an analysis of financial statements.
	
	
	In summary, I accept that Mr Tang had a very good understanding of the whisky schemes separate from and indeed prior to the provision to him of the compulsorily acquired material. Nevertheless, as a finding of fact I have come to the view on the balance of probabilities that his understanding of those schemes has been substantially enhanced by the compulsorily acquired material. No particular factor or piece of evidence is determinative with regard to that factual conclusion of mine; as in a circumstantial case, the combined effect of the whole is greater than the sum of its ten parts. And I also accept that, as a result, it would be extremely difficult to cross-examine Mr Tang about his analysis without the jury becoming aware of the inadmissible compulsorily acquired material. That is because it will be impossible to “disentangle” the bases of his understanding and analysis of the whisky schemes.
	


(iii) Application of legal principle to these findings of fact


	
	It is noteworthy that the vast bulk of the final written and oral submissions made on behalf of the Crown did not address legal principle with regard to order one. They focused very markedly on the factual questions that I have determined above.
	
	
	The two accused accepted the proposition that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, derivative use immunity has been abolished by the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (NSW) (“the ACC Act”). However, their submission was that a reading of the judgment of Bathurst CJ in Seller v R; McCarthy v R [2013], and the recent decisions of the High Court to which I was invited, demonstrates that that is not the end of the matter.
	
	
	On one level, X7 v Australian Crime Commission and the related case of Lee v NSW Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 87 ALJR 1082 were exercises in statutory interpretation; namely, whether that aspect of the principle of legality that calls for great clarity or an inference of necessary intendment before a court should regard a statute as abolishing a fundamental common law right had been made out. In X7 v Australian Crime Commission, the majority of the High Court of Australia held that it had not, and that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the ACC Act does not permit the compulsory examination of a citizen before the ACC when the subject matter of the examination will include the circumstances of a criminal offence with which the citizen has been charged. In Lee v NSW Crime Commission [2013], a majority of the High Court held that it had, and that the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the CAR Act) does permit such an examination before the Supreme Court of NSW in identical circumstances.
	
	
	But to my mind, those cases, and the subsequent unanimous decision of the High Court in Lee v The Queen [2014], are about far deeper principles, about which there was little or no disagreement in the High Court. Those principles are that a criminal trial is accusatorial, and the Crown bears the onus of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt without compelled assistance from the accused.
	
	
	Here, of course, the two accused had not been charged with any offence at the time when they were compulsorily examined and compelled to provide documents. But I accept the submission of the two accused that, at the time of those compulsory processes, there was at the least a significant possibility that they would be charged with an offence arising from the whisky schemes: see TOM 181.20 and 394.32- 42. And whatever may have been the situation in the past, Lee v The Queen [2014] demonstrates that issues to do with whether compulsory processes have “infected”, or could “infect”, the fairness of a criminal trial are not to be determined by way of reference to the simple bright line of whether at the time of the compulsory process the accused had or had not been charged with an offence: see Lee v The Queen [2014] at [2] and [6].
	
	
	Nor do I accept the submission of the Crown that there is a simple bright line between the provision of such material to prosecuting lawyers (in the circumstances considered in R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] and Lee v The Queen [2014]) and the provision of such material to important prosecution witnesses. It is true that a witness, amongst many other things, does not shape the Crown case, or decide which witnesses to call, or engage in cross-examination or address. And it is also quite true that the ACC Act, by its terms, contains no derivative use immunity. But I cannot accept that the portion of the judgment of the Chief Justice in R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] that commences at [76] and concludes at [107], and the principles enunciated by the High Court in Lee v The Queen [2014], are to be read as applying only to the dissemination of compulsorily acquired material to prosecuting lawyers, and as having no application to their dissemination to witnesses who are subsequently to be called by those lawyers, and whose evidence has been informed by that material, as I have found the evidence of Mr Tang to be.
	
	
	If that were the case, [115] would not form part of the judgment of Bathurst CJ. And nor would two Justices of the High Court sitting on the special leave application have invited Queen’s Counsel then appearing for Mr McCarthy to that very paragraph.
	
	
	Lee v The Queen [2014] concerned s 13(9) of the CAR Act, which is highly analogous to s 25A(9) of the ACC Act. In that case the High Court unanimously said at [29]:
	


The making of a direction under s 13(9) was not the first, or the only, occasion on which the Commission was required to consider the possible effects of a compulsory examination on a person’s trial. Section 13(5) required that the Commission determine who should (and, it would follow, who should not) be present at the private hearing. It could set at nought the protection afforded by s 13(9) if persons associated with the possible prosecution of the person giving evidence were present. [Emphasis added]


	
	It was said at [44]:
	


The purpose of s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act was to protect the fair trial of a person who might be charged with offences. It supported the maintenance of the system of criminal justice referred to in X7 and the trial for which that system provides, in which the prosecution has a defined role and the accused does not. The protective purpose of s 13(9) would usually require that the Commission quarantine evidence given by a person to be charged from persons involved in the prosecution of those charges. It would require the Commission to make a direction having that effect and to maintain the prohibition in the face of requests for access to the evidence. That purpose was not met in the present case, with the consequence that the appellants’ trial differed in a fundamental respect from that which our criminal justice system seeks to provide. [Emphasis added]


	
	I do not accept that the references in the emphasised sentences above are only directed to prosecution lawyers. I consider that they extend to significant prosecution witnesses as well.
	
	
	In short, I consider that the fundamental right of the two accused to a fair trial according to law in which it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove its case unassisted by compelled self-incrimination of the two accused calls for the exclusion of the evidence of Mr Tang.
	
	
	As a matter of procedure, that is achieved by the implicit underpinning of my order being my acceptance of the proposition that, if Mr Tang were called and examined in accordance with his statements, I would regard that as creating an unfair trial that should be stayed.
	
	
	In the alternative, and if it be the case that I am mistaken in my analysis of the availability of that implicit remedy, in accordance with the principles that I have discussed I would regard the evidence of Mr Tang as having been improperly obtained, and exclude it pursuant to the balancing exercise contained in s 138(1) of the Evidence Act. I have considered the factors in s 138(3), and regard them as soundly calling for exclusion. Because this second foundation of my order is an ancillary one, I shall not proceed to analyse those factors in detail.
	
	
	To be clear, my order and these reasons do not constitute the slightest fetter on the Crown qualifying and calling a forensic accountant to give evidence about any aspect of the whisky schemes, so long as his or her evidence is not founded on any compulsorily acquired material. So much was accepted as correct by the two accused, if the other orders sought by them were to be rejected. Nor do I suggest that there is any impropriety in, or fetter upon, Mr Tang confidentially using the compulsorily acquired material for an investigative, analytical or educative purpose. The contravention of principle arises from the Crown seeking to use as part of its proof of guilt in a criminal trial expert opinion evidence that has been substantially derived from compelled self-incrimination.
	


The other orders sought


	
	Turning to the other orders sought in the notices of motion, all of which I have refused to make, I respectfully consider that they can be dealt with somewhat more concisely.
	
	
	Proposed order two was based on a number of propositions.
	
	
	First, compulsorily acquired materials, and summaries of those materials, were unlawfully disseminated to the Commonwealth DPP.
	
	
	Secondly, this dissemination occurred in a context characterised by a “whole of government approach” that encouraged collaboration, co-operation, and information sharing between governmental departments, and preceded the concern with quarantining compulsorily acquired material prompted by X7 v The Australian Crime Commission and Lee v NSW Crime Commission [2013].
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Tang and a Ms Simpkin (an officer of the ACC who was the case officer with regard to the whisky schemes and who will not be called as a prosecution witness) had recourse to the compulsorily acquired material, and were intimately involved in assisting the prosecution team determine the criminal charge or charges that ought to be laid against each accused in the Local Court, and the particulars thereof.
	
	
	Fourthly, even accepting that no member of the current prosecution legal team had read the compulsorily acquired material or been told of its contents, the two accused submitted that it is more probable than not that, unknowingly, they had been “infected” by it as a result of the involvement of Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin. It was said that the many documents created by Mr Tang and Ms Simpkin would have been based, at least indirectly and to some degree, upon the compulsorily acquired material. It was submitted that at least some of those documents must have been read and absorbed by the current prosecution team. Further, it was submitted that it is quite possible that, in legal conference, Mr Tang or Ms Simpkin has expressed to a member of the prosecution team an opinion or an analysis founded, to some degree, upon the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	Fifthly, in those circumstances it is likely that the Crown was materially assisted by compulsorily acquired material in determining what charges ought to be laid and how they should be particularised.
	
	
	Finally, the evidentiary gap that arises from the claim of privilege by the Crown upheld by me in the course of the hearing of the motion with regard to documents evidencing the meetings and communications between Mr Tang, Ms Simpkin and other officers, and the Commonwealth DPP and its counsel, means that I cannot be satisfied that the prosecution against the two accused had not been infected by the compulsorily acquired material.
	
	
	On that basis, it was said that a fresh prosecution solicitor must be instructed and fresh counsel briefed, and that all of the functions already performed, such as formulation of an indictment, the identification of particulars of the counts, and preparation and provision of a Crown case statement, must be set at nought and begun afresh.
	
	
	I respectfully reject that proposition of the two accused. It is one thing to say that there is a direct use immunity in the ACC Act; that, although there is no explicit derivative use immunity in that statute, there will be circumstances (such as I have found to exist here) where evidence that is derived from compulsorily acquired material must not be part of the prosecution case; that prosecuting legal teams must not have access to compulsorily acquired material with the express intention and result of informing themselves about possible defences and other forensically highly useful matters (as occurred in Lee v The Queen [2014]: see [15]); and that, if the latter occurs, then those lawyers should not prosecute the matter further. But it is quite another matter to assert that lawyers who have expressly refrained from reading the compulsorily acquired material, and whose assurance that they have not been provided with that material in conference or otherwise has been accepted, must nevertheless be prohibited from appearing further in the matter.
	
	
	The contention of the two accused is that the current prosecution team may have been unknowingly, unconsciously, indirectly and amorphously provided with some opinion or analysis ultimately derived from the compulsorily acquired material: see TOM 549.41-46.
	
	
	Even accepting, for the sake of argument only, the proposition that that may have occurred, I do not consider that the judgment in Lee v The Queen [2014], or any other judgment to which I was invited, calls for the relief sought. To my mind, that would constitute a very large extension of the principles discussed in Lee v The Queen [2014], including at [44]. And I consider persuasive the submission of the Crown that, if this contention of the two accused were correct, then the High Court in Lee v The Queen [2014] would have spoken not only of the necessity of a new team of prosecuting lawyers, but also of the necessity of a new team that was to have nothing to do with any witness, or investigator, or other person who may have read the compulsorily acquired material, or some report or analysis based upon it.
	
	
	I turn now to the submission made in support of proposed order two that Mr Tang or Ms Simpkin played some role in the finalisation of the charge in the Local Court and the formulation of its particulars at that stage. Again, even accepting that proposition for the sake of argument only, it is well known that after committal prosecuting counsel exercises his or her independent judgment with regard to the finding of a bill of indictment, its particularisation, the drafting of a Crown case statement, and countless other functions of a prosecuting advocate. Even accepting for the sake of argument only that Mr Tang or Ms Simpkin exercised some function at an early stage of the proceedings that could be classified as prosecutorial or quasi-prosecutorial, I do not regard that as overly significant, let alone determinative, with regard to the extremely broad second order that I was asked to make.
	
	
	Turning to proposed orders three, four, and six, they were ancillary to proposed order two, and do not require further analysis.
	
	
	As I have noted, proposed order five was not pressed.
	
	
	Proposed order seven was not the subject of elaboration.
	
	
	Proposed order eight was founded on a two page written submission entitled “Summary of Argument on Permanent Stay”.
	
	
	In a nutshell, it was based upon the proposition that the “investigation phase” with regard to the whisky schemes ended on a particular date in August 2007; and separately that the purpose of Ms Simpkin, with regard to the compulsory examination of Mr McCarthy, was to “lock him in” to various versions. In those circumstances, it was submitted, the compulsory examinations that occurred well after August 2007 were unlawful.
	
	
	Furthermore, the submission invited my attention to the judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 v Australian Crime Commission at [124]. In short, the proposition was that the accusatorial process had been fundamentally altered by the mere giving of the answers to the questions at the compulsory hearing by the two accused. It was said that that prejudicial alteration was “not remediable” and that, as a result, in all of the circumstances the proceedings should be permanently stayed.
	
	
	I respectfully reject that submission.
	
	
	Turning to the circumstances of the compulsory examinations, simply because one officer of the ACC at one stage expressed the opinion that the investigation process had concluded is hardly significant. No doubt many officers of the ACC were working on the whisky schemes, and all of them had their own opinions about the characterisation of what was occurring at various stages. And in any event, it is clear on the evidence that the investigative process was not over in August 2007; Ms Simpkin herself subsequently travelled to Hong Kong as part of the investigation.
	
	
	I take the same view with regard to whatever opinion that individual officer had at some stage about the purpose of compulsory questioning. In any event, because of the operation of statute, none of those answers will be admitted in the trial; because I have made order one, nor will any of the expert opinion evidence of Mr Tang that is based to some degree on that material.
	
	
	As for the final basis of proposed order eight, it may be accepted that the answering of the questions at the compulsory examinations operates to circumscribe the subsequent forensic choices of the two accused, in the ways discussed in X7 v Australian Crime Commission and Lee v The Queen [2014]. But it is worth recalling that the latter case was founded on clearly wrongful dissemination of material to prosecution counsel, and that the former case was founded on compulsory questioning that was to take place after charges had been laid. Neither circumstance pertains here. Furthermore, in X7 v Australian Crime Commission the order granted was a prohibition on the continuation of a compulsory examination, not a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings. Nor in Lee v The Queen [2014] did the High Court put an end to the criminal proceedings: the convictions were quashed and a new trial ordered.
	
	
	Separately, as was recently discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in TS v R [2014] NSWCCA 174 at [1] and [61]-[64], the refusal of a court to exercise jurisdiction with regard to an allegation of very serious criminality by way of a permanent stay is an extreme remedy; indeed, a remedy of last resort. I am by no means satisfied that anything that has occurred here calls for a permanent stay of the proceedings against the two accused.
	


Orders


	
	It is for the foregoing reasons that I made the following orders:
	



	
	Quincy Tang is prohibited from giving evidence in the trial in accordance with his three statements dated 3 November 2009 and his statement dated 30 June 2010.
	
	
	Dismiss all of the other orders sought in the further amended notice of motion filed 5 August 2014 and the identical notice of motion filed by Mr Raphael.

2764847,New South Wales Crime Commission v Maxwell [2014] NSWSC 1382,"Judgment
1By summons of 23 September 2014, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) ('the Act') in relation to the interest in property of the defendant, Leigh Wayne Maxwell. Ancillary orders under s 12(1) of the Act were also sought, as well as orders under s 27. 
2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 23 September 2014 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission's Director, Financial Investigations and authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.
3For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
4The property in question is identified in a schedule to the summons. It includes one property located at Wilton and another located at Berridale, of which the defendant is a joint tenant, as well as funds held in an account held in ING Direct and a share held in Maxwell Investments (Aust) Pty Ltd.
5Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Maxwell had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, ""supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 
6Mr Spark gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts Sheet prepared by Detective Piggott of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Maxell's arrest on 16 June 2014; answers provided to questions he asked of Detective Piggott about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers the COPS, ASIC and LPI databases and documents produced to the Commission by ING. 
7This material disclosed that Mr Maxwell has been charged with offences under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act after an investigation into the involvement of a co-accused in the supply of drugs. Police surveillance recorded Mr Maxwell and his co-accused discussing cannabis ordered by Mr Maxwell and on later arrest, bags containing cannabis totalling 20 pounds were found in the boot of his car, together with other items of interest, mobile phones and cash. After arrest, Mr Maxwell made admissions to police as to the purchase of the cannabis for some $58,000 and provided a signed witness statement. Further investigations resulted in the discovery of other cannabis and large amounts of cash.
8Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Maxwell is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 
9Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 
10I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought. 
11On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 
12Given that Mr Maxwell is but one of the joint tenants of the Wilton and Berridale properties, I take the view that the orders which I propose to make should also be served upon the other joint tenants of the two properties and that they, too, should be given liberty to apply to the Court on 3 days' notice. In coming to that view, I have had regard to their rights under s 10C of the Act.
Orders
13I accordingly make orders in the terms sought and also order and direct that:(1)The orders be served on the other joint tenants of the Wilton and Berridale properties.
(2)They have liberty to apply to the Court on 3 days' notice.
(3)That a copy of these reasons be served with the orders.

		14 October 2014",2014-09-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764856,Allen v R [2014] NSWCCA 193,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of R A Hulme J.  I agree with his Honour's reasons and with the orders he proposes.
2R A HULME J:  Andrew Charles Allen (the applicant) was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge Frearson SC on 13 December 2013 for an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of the drug known as ""ecstasy"".  
3The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 20 years (ss 25 and 33 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)).  There is also prescribed a standard non-parole period of 10 years (Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)).
4The learned judge imposed a sentence of 2 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months.  It was back-dated to the date of the applicant's arrest when he was refused bail, namely 21 March 2013.  He will be entitled to be released on parole when the non-parole period ends on 20 November 2014.
5The sentence was reduced by 25 per cent from what it otherwise would have been to give credit for the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea of guilty.
6The grounds of the appeal are that the judge erred in characterising the applicant's role as being above that of a ""mere courier""; the sentence is manifestly excessive; and there is insufficient disparity with the sentence imposed upon a co-offender, Jade Reberger.
Facts
7The facts relating to the applicant's offending were agreed. 
8Police were intercepting the telephone service of Nathan Martin.  On 20 and 21 March 2013 they intercepted conversations between Martin and Jade Reberger (the applicant's brother-in-law) relating to arrangements for Reberger to travel from Ulladulla to Sydney to purchase 1000 tablets of ecstasy for $10,000 from a person identified as ""Aaron"".  Half of the tablets were for Reberger and the other half were for a man identified as ""Tony from Huskisson"". 
9The applicant drove Reberger in the applicant's car to Sydney in the afternoon of 21 March.  They stopped at Daceyville and the pair alighted and spoke with ""Aaron"".  They returned to the car and left.  Several hours later they returned and another car arrived. Two occupants of that car alighted and spoke with the applicant and Reberger.  One of those men then drove away, leaving the other with the applicant and Reberger.  The man who had driven away returned a short time later, alighted and approached the applicant and the other man who were standing at the front of the applicant's car with the bonnet up.  The applicant received the drugs and they were placed into the air filter of his car so as to conceal them.  Reberger handed over $10,000 in cash.  He and the applicant then drove away. 
10Police stopped the car a short distance away.  After some hesitation the applicant showed them where the drugs were secreted.  Subsequent analysis revealed that there were in excess of 1000 tables comprising 304.7 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine with a purity of 14 per cent.  (The commercial quantity for this drug is 125 grams.)
11The pair were arrested.  They were taken to a police station where the applicant is said to have made ""full and frank admissions"".  He told police that he had driven Reberger to Sydney to meet some people.   He confirmed that he told police at the scene of the arrest that the drugs comprised about 1000 tablets.  He believed they were ecstasy.  He said he did not pay for them; that they did not belong to him; and that he was just the driver.  He said Reberger had approached him earlier in the week and asked him if he wanted to drive to Sydney to make some money.  He ""assumed it would be something illegal, drugs"".  He was to be paid $500 for his involvement. 
12In oral evidence at the sentence hearing the applicant said that he did not know what type of drug was involved, nor how much (although he then conceded that he had overheard that it involved 1000 tablets).  He was not involved in the purchase.  His role was just to drive the car to Sydney and back in exchange for payment of $500.  He was in financial difficulties at the time.
The sentencing remarks concerning the facts
13There was a joint hearing of the applicant's case on sentence and that of his co-offender Reberger.  
14In relation to the co-offender there was a separate statement of facts to which the judge referred in his sentencing remarks. It detailed how Reberger had numerous communications with Nathan Martin involving discussion of Martin's arrangement with ""Aaron"" for Reberger to be supplied with the 1000 tablets.  500 of the tablets were for Reberger to on-supply and the balance were for ""Tony"" to do likewise.  Information derived from telephones seized by police following the arrests persuaded the judge that Reberger was substantially involved in the supply and distribution of drugs in the preceding six months.  Accordingly, the offence for which he was to be sentenced was ""not an isolated one"". 
15His Honour accepted that Reberger suffered from anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder but concluded that this ""cannot weigh too heavily in the sentencing process"".  It was ""blatant and substantial drug dealing for profit in circumstances in which the offender was fully aware of the gravity [and consequences] of his conduct"".  He accepted that his motivation was to pay off a drug debt; ""it was clearly for financial gain"".  It was submitted that Reberger was ""an underling"" and the judge said, ""in one sense he was an underling, but he was a vital cog in a drug distribution network"".
16As to the applicant, the judge found beyond reasonable doubt that he ""knew very well"" what he was asked to be involved in.  He referred to submissions that were made by the solicitor on the applicant's behalf about the objective seriousness of the offence.  His Honour said:
""The ultimate contention is this is really at the very bottom of the range for the offence it is.  I do not accept it is at the bottom of the range.  He was a courier, that is true, but I do not describe him as a mere courier.  When one looks at what he physically did and the organisation involved, he was there present at the actual transaction; he did the driving; he was present when the drugs were placed into the air filter, and it seems to me that he has played an important physical role in the drug offence for financial gain.
I consider it is between the bottom and the mid range, probably closer to the mid than the bottom.  On any view, he took part in this substantial drug venture for profit.""  (AB 23) (Emphasis added)
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in characterising the appellant's role as being above that of a ""mere""courier
17The submissions made to the judge did not employ any characterisation of the applicant as being either a ""courier"" or ""mere courier""; they were focused upon what the applicant actually did.  As can be seen from the above extract, his Honour used those two terms but then immediately looked at what the applicant actually did. 
18I see no error in this approach.  The role of an offender in drug supply offences is better determined by focussing on what an offender actually did, rather upon trying to assign a label or categorising the role of the offender in a drug enterprise:  Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; 219 A Crim R 104 at [135].  As was observed by the majority in The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [19]:
""Characterising the offender as a 'courier' or a 'principal' must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did.""
19In oral submissions, Mr Miller, counsel for the applicant accepted that it was difficult to know what the judge meant when he referred to a ""courier"" and a ""mere courier"".  He also accepted that the judge had proceeded to correctly identify the physical activities of the applicant that constituted his involvement in the offence.  He agreed that the complaint with which this ground was concerned was more directed to the judge's assessment of the seriousness of the offence.
20There was no challenge to the findings of fact by the primary judge.  They were clearly based upon the material in the statement of agreed facts.  In short, in return for a promise of payment of a modest sum, the applicant deliberately provided material assistance to a person acquiring a substantial quantity of a prohibited drug for what must obviously have been the purpose of on-supplying it.  
21There is an element of imprecision about the expression by the judge of his conclusion as to the level of objective seriousness of the offence (""between the bottom and the mid range, probably closer to the mid than the bottom"").  However, I am not persuaded that the ground has been made out.  The matters raised in support of it remain relevant to the determination of the next ground. 
Ground 2 - the sentence imposed upon the appellant is manifestly excessive
22It was submitted that ""in the light of the limited role that the appellant played in relation to the offence, the strong subjective case of the appellant, the good prospects of rehabilitation and the finding that the appellant would be unlikely to reoffend, the non-parole period imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive"" (AWS [58]).   Judicial Commission sentencing statistics were said to support the submission.
23The statistics simply demonstrate that the sentence of 2 years 9 months is within the bottom 13% of sentences passed for this offence in the period January 2007 to December 2013.  The non-parole period is within the bottom 41% in that period.  Similar figures are derived when focussing only upon cases in which there was a plea of guilty (90 out of 96 cases).  Without any information about the circumstances of any of those cases, the statistics do not advance the applicant's case.
24The applicant had a number of subjective matters that were taken into account in his favour.  His criminal record contained only relatively minor matters.  His fiancée remained supportive of him.  He had an offer of employment in the mining sector in Queensland.  His stepfather gave evidence in which he spoke highly of him. The judge accepted that he was a person of otherwise good character and had many positive attributes.  He accepted that he was remorseful; had good prospects of rehabilitation; and was unlikely to re-offend.  He had pleaded guilty.
25The judge found special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and reduced the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period by about 5 months.  He did so ""principally on the basis it is his first time in custody and the pre-sentence custody as well as the custody being more onerous"".  There was no evidence about custody being more onerous; his Honour appears to have accepted a submission that conditions of custody for remand inmates are more onerous than for sentenced prisoners because ""there are no courses"" and ""it's certainly been a very unpleasant experience"".  
26The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence (20 years) is of reduced significance as a yardstick for an offence that, in my view, was of a comparatively low level of seriousness having regard to the matters discussed in the context of the previous ground.  However it is not something that can be completely ignored.  Likewise the 10 year standard non-parole period.  There is also a particular need for general deterrence in drug supply cases.  A sentence of 2 years 9 months, and a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months, is not, in my view, unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25].  I would reject this ground.
Ground 3 - The sentence imposed by his Honour on the appellant offends the parity principle
27The parity principle is so commonly invoked on appeals to this Court that it does not need to be recited.  Generally, see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28].
28The essence of the applicant's complaint is that his co-offender Jade Reberger received a sentence of 4 years 5 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years 8 months.  He was more significantly involved in the transaction than the applicant but the applicant's non-parole period is only one year shorter than he received. 
29The written submissions for the applicant helpfully set out a summary of the subjective features of each offender.  The differences between them were few and the overall mitigating effect was not significantly dissimilar.
30The findings of the sentencing judge to which I earlier referred make clear that Reberger's offence was at a significantly higher level of objective seriousness.  But the finding of special circumstances in his case was for more compelling reasons than in the applicant's case.  There was evidence that Reberger suffered from anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder whereas the basis for finding special circumstances in the applicant's case was generous, to say the least.
31There is no complaint raised under this ground about the extent of the difference between the head sentences imposed upon the two offenders.  The complaint is confined to an assertion that the applicant's non-parole period is not less than that imposed upon Reberger by a greater extent.  But the finding of special circumstances in each case resulted in the setting of non-parole periods that are an identical proportion (60 per cent) of the head sentences.  That is unlikely to have been a coincidence; I assume it was intended by the judge as a matter of consistency and fairness.
32In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that there is any legitimate and objective basis for the applicant to be aggrieved that his non-parole period was only 1 year less than that imposed upon his co-offender.
 Orders
33I propose the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
2. Appeal dismissed.
34GARLING J:  I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J, and with his Honour's reasons.

2764861,R v Nguyen [2014] NSWDC 357,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Giang Nam Nguyen appears today for sentence in relation to an offence alleging that he, on 5 day of June 2013 at Bondi Junction in the State of New South Wales, did supply a prohibited drug, to wit, three kilograms of methylamphetamine, being an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. That matter came to this Court by way of committal for sentence. It is agreed that the prisoner entered the plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. The prisoner is thus entitled to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence, in accordance with the judgment of Thomson and Houlton, to recognise the utilitarian benefit of that plea of guilty.
	
	
	The offence to which the prisoner pleaded guilty is created by s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty of $550,000. It has a standard non parole period of 15 years’ imprisonment, in accordance with the provisions of Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The prisoner has been in custody since 5 June 2013, the date of his arrest. All time spent in custody up until the present time will naturally be taken into account in sentencing the offender for the offence. There is a matter on a s 166 Certificate, as I understand it, of possessing prohibited drugs, which I will direct in due course to be dismissed.
	
	
	This prisoner comes forward for sentence in the context of my having sentenced a co accused, Mr Birnie, on 13 March 2014, having heard the evidence and the submissions the previous week on 5 March 2014. My judgment in relation to that matter, and the orders I made sentencing that offender to a term of imprisonment of six years and five months with a non parole period of three years and ten months, is set out in a decision that may be found on the District Court’s database at [2014] NSWDC 146.
	
	
	Mr James QC who as usual skilfully represents his client’s interests in this matter, has made the point - although there is much in common in the sentencing of this offender with that sentencing exercise undertaken in relation to Mr Birnie - that there are particular facts upon which this prisoner is to be sentenced that may, to some extent, be different from the basis upon which this prisoner was identified and implicated in the offending set out in the facts relating to Mr Birnie. I have taken that submission into account as I must properly do. It will be the case, however, when I turn to some matters of principle, and particularly the issue of comparative sentencing, that I will not be required in this matter to reiterate some of the analysis I undertook of what were said to be comparative cases to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The facts are, if I might add to perhaps what is set out in the facts “sheet” relating to this prisoner, that Mr Birnie had been recruited in Canada some weeks before an importation of 2.98 kilograms of methylamphetamine into Australia, to come to Australia and remain in Australia for a number of days as a type of ‘sleeper’, to be activated to take possession of the drugs that were imported, in order to transfer them to another person. The other person to whom he ultimately transferred these drugs was this prisoner.
	
	
	The circumstances in which this prisoner came to be arrested were that Mr Birnie had rented a room at a commercial apartment block in Bondi Junction, and was contacted by this prisoner via text messaging, and arrangements were made for the two men to meet late in the day of 5 June 2013.
	
	
	Unbeknownst to this prisoner and Mr Birnie, the telephone communications, of whatever form they were, that took place between this prisoner, Mr Birnie, this prisoner and others, as I would understand it, were the subject of a police operation involving telephone intercept activity. Mr Birnie requested the prisoner to bring an empty backpack with him, and the prisoner in these proceedings attended upon the premises at 26-30 Spring Street, Bondi Junction, with that backpack at around 6.45pm.
	
	
	Unbeknownst to Mr Birnie and the prisoner, not only were their telecommunications contacts intercepted by police, but they were the subject of physical surveillance. Mr Nguyen was seen to carry a backpack into the building, the prisoner met with Mr Birnie obviously inside the building, and ultimately the prisoner was intercepted by police some time shortly after 7.10pm, in possession of a black Nike backpack.
	
	
	He was arrested. A search of his backpack revealed he was in possession of a package wrapped by red coloured wrapping paper, having a yellow envelope attached to it. Inside this wrapping there were three resealable plastic bags containing an off white crystallised substance. The three bags were wrapped in a white bath towel. It was subsequently discovered that each of the bags found weighed 990.5 grams, 995.8 grams and 997.3 grams, representing a total weight of 2.98 kilograms.
	
	
	I have read the analyst’s certificate. One bag was analysed, it was found to be methylamphetamine in crystalline form, otherwise known as ‘ice’, and one bag that was tested for purity had a purity level of 85.5%. It could be reasonably concluded that the other bags were of similar purity.
	


I just pause for a moment, Mr Crown, there’s an obvious mistake in the facts that I didn’t pick up. At the bottom of the last line of the first page of the facts it refers to the bags being 990.5 kilograms, 995.8 kilograms and 997.3 kilograms. That’s why I paused when I was reading it out from the facts, that should be grams of course as I’ve read onto the transcript. I’ll have the facts amended accordingly, but it’s noted in my judgment and what I have just said will be part of the remarks on sentence.


	
	Mr Birnie was in due course arrested inside the apartments, and I need not dwell upon his arrest and what followed from that. It is all set out in my judgment.
	
	
	This prisoner was prepared to enter into an interview with police and in that interview he did not tell, in my view, the entire truth, about his state of knowledge of relevant matters concerning his visit to Mr Birnie and the contents of the backpack. I accept that, from what has been put from the bar table, and my now wider understanding of the police investigation, the prisoner did nominate a person who he described as a friend of his who was known to the police, as being the recipient of the parcel, and that he the prisoner was to receive $1,000 for picking up the contents of the backpack and delivering those contents to the person that he nominated.
	
	
	Whether of course he knew the full name of the person or only the name “Bobby” he gave to the police, to my mind, ultimately is neither here nor there, in the sense that, objectively, I am assured that police were already aware of the identity of that person, and that person was subsequently arrested, not through the efforts of the prisoner, but because of the wider scope of the police investigation.
	
	
	It is correct, as I pointed out in the course of the submissions, that the rejection of any part of the prisoner’s account to the police, in the interview that was conducted after his arrest, does not in some respects assist me in relation to fact finding; I cannot fill in gaps with idle speculation. Ultimately, it has been submitted on behalf of the prisoner - and in my discussion with the learned Crown Prosecutor I did not understand him to demur to the submission made by learned senior counsel for the prisoner - that this prisoner can be categorised as an internal courier and not the primary person to whom the methylamphetamine was to be provided for ongoing distribution.
	
	
	Of course, the prisoner’s role in acting as this type of intermediary was a significant role or an important role; it was a mechanism by which the prohibited drugs could be passed on to others for the purposes of wider distribution into the community. In many respects the prisoner’s role was very similar to that of Mr Birnie, and I do not propose to again dwell on the analysis I made of Mr Birnie’s criminality. It seems to me, in the context of a comparison of the objective circumstances pertaining to Mr Birnie and this prisoner, that whilst their roles were similar, this prisoner’s objective involvement was somewhat less than Mr Birnie’s, for two reasons that I can identify, based upon the facts available in both cases.
	
	
	Mr Birnie had a greater period to contemplate his involvement in this matter. He had come to Australia a couple of weeks after first being approached, he had come to Australia solely to commit the crime that he was arrested for and convicted of, albeit he also came here for something of a holiday, and on the evidence available to me he was to receive greater remuneration than this particular prisoner. These matters are matters that distinguish the criminality of the two prisoners favourably to this prisoner.
	
	
	In summary, it might be said in the context of what has been put to me about issues of parity and appropriate disparity, that Mr Birnie’s subjective circumstances were slightly more favourable than those of this prisoner in several respects. He was an older man with a clear criminal history and proven history of industry over a longer period of time than this particular prisoner.
	
	
	This prisoner, I bear in mind, in the context of assessing the comparative culpability of the offenders and the relevant comparative subjective circumstances, has findings of guilt in Victoria in July 2002, for obtaining property by deception, for which he was convicted and placed on a community based order for eight months, attempting to obtain property by deception and obtaining a motor vehicle driver’s licence by misrepresentation, for which he was convicted and placed on another community based order for eight months. He also had a finding of guilt at the Sunshine Magistrate’s Court on 29 October 2001 for obtaining property by deception, handling, receiving or disposing of stolen goods and attempting to obtain property by deception, for which he received an aggregate fine of $800 without conviction.
	
	
	It must be fairly said, in the scheme of things of course these matters are relatively minor findings of guilt, and they are, it must be fairly said, of some antiquity by relationship to the offending with which I am concerned. But it is to be borne in mind that this prisoner came to Australia in 1999, as I understand the chronology, for the purposes of undertaking further study, and had committed these offences in Victoria within a couple of years of his arrival in this country.
	
	
	Coming back to the objective circumstances, so far as they may distinguish this prisoner from Mr Birnie, the “co-accused”, it is also to be fairly said in favour of this prisoner, as opposed to Mr Birnie, that Mr Birnie had come from a foreign country to commit a serious crime in our country, whereas this prisoner was, at the time of the commission of the offence, a permanent resident and had a legitimate reason for being here. I have endeavoured to take those matters into account as they are relevant in assessing the distinction, if any, that needs to be drawn between the two men.
	
	
	The issue of “parity of sentencing” has been the subject of discussion by a number of authorities. Particular authorities from the High Court of significance are of course the decisions of Lowe v R which in one judgment deals with the issue of a justifiable sense of grievance, which can be a fulcrum for a successful appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the case of Postiglione and in particular the judgment of Gaudron and Dawson JJ is of significance. That last case is of significance when one looks at a more recent decision of Jimmy, a decision of Campbell JA, Howie and Rothman JJ, to identify the judges by their order of seniority, in which they respectively discuss parity principles, both in the context of dealing with cases of like nature, and proper bases for distinguishing between offenders. The matter, in my view, was probably most aptly encapsulated by his Honour Rothman J in his judgment when he spoke of Aristotlean principles of equality, particularly that alike shall be treated alike and the unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of their unalikeness. That phrase, which I have paraphrased with far less eloquence than his Honour and Aristotle, neatly sums up the essence of parity or disparity in sentencing of offenders charged with common offences particularly.
	
	
	Of course, the matter is concerned not just with the objective facts; there is the general subjective case that has been presented on behalf of the prisoner. I have the evidence of the prisoner’s mother by video recording, which I have seen today, and I accept it as evidence as if the mother was in Court, although the Crown has not had a chance to cross-examine her. She describes the prisoner's background. He is one of three sons, his good behaviour at primary school and high school, his attempts to further his education in Vietnam, particularly by entering university. He was unsuccessful on a number of occasions, although ultimately, a few years before he came to Australia, he was able to enter what I understood to be a mining university where he studied for two years.
	
	
	He was encouraged by his mother and his family to come to Australia to better his education, and I understand he came to Australia and undertook some course in English initially. He has a daughter who was born in 2003, as I understood the mother’s account. He has a wife who he married in Vietnam in 2008. She has visited the prisoner in custody. She said that his conduct has greatly disappointed her and made her very sad, which I would expect. The prisoner has expressed his regret and sorrow to her and his apology for his breach, which is a very serious breach, of Australian law, and she points out that whilst he is in custody he is unable to care for his daughter or his wife, and she would wish that the Court would extend to him leniency and mercy in its sentencing.
	
	
	These are admirable matters to take into account in every sentencing exercise, but of course in endeavouring to exercise proper sentencing discretion the Court is also constrained by various legal principles emanating from legislation and the decisions of superior courts in fixing an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	I have other material that I have taken into account. I have taken into account evidence from the prisoner’s wife in the form of a letter to the Court, talking about the good qualities of the prisoner, his support for his family before he came into custody, the difficulty of his being moved from one prison to another over a period of time, the loss of him as a father and husband whilst he is in custody, and pleading for the opportunity for him to have early return to his family. I have the letter of the prisoner to the Court in which he apologises for his conduct, saying that he was naïve and did not think carefully about what he was doing. He says he understands that what he did was “really wrong”. He has contemplated his circumstances whilst in custody and has undertaken courses, including the Getting Smart program, as I would understand it, and English courses to which his learned senior counsel referred from the bar table.
	
	
	I bear in mind, in dealing with the prisoner’s letter to the Court, what was said from the bar table about the prisoner being industrious when having the opportunity. Although, as I have pointed out, he has been moved from gaol to gaol and this has disrupted his opportunity to be involved in industry based work, I accept that whenever he has been, for example, at the MRRC or other custodial institutions where work is available, he has taken it up.
	
	
	He spoke about missing his family and learning a great lesson about life in general from his experience in relation to this matter. He understands, as I would read his letter, the significance of the criminal conduct with which I am concerned. I have also read the letter that he has written to his wife and daughter, which speaks of his misery at being in custody and his regret for the impact he has had upon his family.
	
	
	There is also available in the evidence given to the Court two reports, one from the Probation and Parole Service which sets out some history of the prisoner, and a psychological report dated 24 March 2014.
	
	
	Dealing with the report that was tendered as part of the Crown case, the report of the Community Corrections Service. It notes, based upon the information provided by the prisoner and confirmed by the evidence from the prisoner’s mother, that the prisoner had a stable upbringing and a supportive family, and that he is currently in a relationship with a child. It sets out the details of his family history, again, I hasten to say, confirmed by the material contained within the mother’s videotaped interview, and I do not propose to reiterate that. It notes the fact that the prisoner started using ecstasy periodically in 2006.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out that the prisoner was born on 11 December 1974, so on that chronology, firstly, he is now aged 39, was 38 at the time of the offending, but started using prohibited drugs when he was 32, which is an unusual situation.
	
	
	He used ecstasy for recreational purposes. However, in 2012 he started using methamphetamines, as they are described “on the weekend” and that his drug use had escalated, and this had exacerbated the circumstances in which he came to be lured into committing the crime with which I am concerned. He admitted to the Community Corrections officer that he was aware the backpack contained illicit substances, which is somewhat different than the account that he gave to the police. I accept as part of the factual matrix that he was a man without a substantial criminal history, intercepted by police, trying to some extent to talk his way out of the circumstances which he was in, which is a natural instinct in these circumstances where a person who is not a practised criminal is arrested in relation to serious criminal offending.
	
	
	He told the Community Corrections officers that he was transporting the drugs “for financial gain and to support his drug use”. He also indicated that he was taking responsibility for his offending behaviour, and the assessment of the Community Corrections officer is that part of the reason for his offending was the escalation of his drug use up until the time of the offence, and some issues in relation to his marriage. It is suggested by Community Corrections that his use of drugs would be a particular matter to be targeted when he is released from custody.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report gives a far more details account of the upbringing of the prisoner. Again it is supported by the account given by the prisoner’s mother, although it provides a great many more details as far as dates of travel to Australia and return to Vietnam and the like.
	
	
	It is to be pointed out that the prisoner lived in Australia from his first arrival here in 1999 until 2005. He returned to Vietnam for four years, during which time he, as I said, married the woman who is now his wife, who I take from all the material to be a person he met in Australia. Then he returned to Australia in 2009 and has permanent residency.
	
	
	He told the psychologist that he had reasonably regular employment, working as a packer in a factory, and was employed by Toll, a transport company. Learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner, through his solicitor, provided to the Court informally a great deal of material, some of which has not been actually tendered in this Court. Part of that material was notification of the prisoner’s membership of a superannuation fund that was transport based. I have taken that to be evidence that confirms his previous employment in the transport industry. Also, the tax return material confirms his employment as a shop assistant at a newsagency in the period of time between November 2011 and his arrest in June 2013.
	
	
	I turn away from the psychological report for one moment to point out that I have a reference from that employer who confirms that employment, and also speaks of the prisoner’s industry and reliability whilst working for him, the shock of his arrest in relation to this matter, and the willingness of that employer to continue his employment on his release to custody. That material, in addition to the other material that I sighted that was not formally tendered, gives support to the proposition advanced by his counsel, which I accept, that the prisoner’s role in this matter was not that of a distributor of methylamphetamine, but an internal courier.
	
	
	To get back to the psychologist’s report, though, ultimately, in the context of no significant medical history, no significant history of mental disorder or mental illness, although some history of drug use and dependency, the psychologist concluded that the prisoner had some symptoms of anxiety that were consistent with his stress at being in custody and awaiting sentence. He had no symptoms of a major depressive disorder, mania, psychosis or post traumatic stress. He had not struggled with anger management or attempted or considered suicide.
	
	
	Although no psychometric testing was undertaken, on clinical examination he was thought to be of average intelligence and there was no notable psychopathology or personality dysfunction. He thought that the prisoner’s interpersonal style was a key contributor to his offending.
	
	
	There was some instability in his domestic circumstances, as I pointed out, at the time of the offending and substance use by him which, in the opinion of the psychologist, had likely disinhibited him and affected his judgment to some extent. He said in summary, Mr Nguyen’s interpersonal style and substance use seem to be at the crux of his offending, but additional factors including associating with antisocial associates, marital discord and housing instability at the time of the offending are identified as risk factors. He is a generally prosocial individual both in personality and history, and it was recommended that on his release from custody he should engage in a community based treatment with a forensic psychologist. He will also need assistance in relation to monitoring his peer connections and also matters relating to his family relationships.
	
	
	There is nothing in this material that speaks of a mental illness or a disorder that might warrant consideration of those principles summarised by the former Chief Judge of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court, McClellan J, in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194.
	
	
	With regard to the sentencing of Mr Birnie, of course as I said, that is a matter of significance, as was made clear in the very helpful submissions of Senior Counsel for the prisoner. It provides a very strong reference point, bearing in mind the two offenders are being sentenced in relation to the same offence, although with different aspects of culpability to be considered.
	
	
	In the judgment I gave in relation to Mr Birnie, I went through a number of authorities that were brought to my attention by Mr Boulten SC who appeared for Mr Birnie, and my analysis of those judgments appears at [44] [53]. I adopt that analysis here that I undertook of those cases.
	
	
	The decision of Buttrose, to which I referred in that judgment, particularly at [44] [46] of that judgment [2011] NSWCCA 35, involves an examination again by McClellan CJ at CL, in his usual helpful way as was undertaken by him in De La Rosa, of a range of comparative cases, all involving criminality of course far more significant than the criminality of this matter, if that could be said, bearing in mind, if one looks at one aspect, that is the quantity of drugs that were involved in the various cases discussed in Buttrose.
	
	
	What is clear from reading Buttrose and the analysis undertaken by the learned Chief Judge in the context of the need to have regard to Pt 4 Div 1A, as I found in relation to Mr Birnie, is the fact that, given the role of this prisoner, allowing for all the other objective factors, this offending was below that of the middle range of objective seriousness. As I say, the helpful analysis of McClellan J in Buttrose demonstrates that to be clearly so.
	
	
	I am also very mindful of what I discussed in Birnie, where there was a standard non-parole period, to have regard to s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) of the Act, the amended sections in Pt 4 Div 1A following upon the High Court judgment in Muldrock. The current legislation emphasises the need to ensure that the standard non-parole period is not of determinative significance in the sentencing exercise, but one of a number of factors that are required to be considered, particularly in the context of the principles set out by the High Court in the decision of Markarian (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J, discussed in greater detail of course in Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120. This I do.
	
	
	The other authorities that I was taken to today are of course not of the same power as the persuasive comparative sentencing authorities to which I have otherwise referred, particularly the judgment cited in the judgment of Birnie. One is reminded of the remark of Roden J when he was on the Supreme Court, having brought to his attention a judgment of his own when he was a Judge of the District Court, saying to the Queen’s Counsel appearing before him, who I think is the same Queen’s Counsel as in this matter, “But Mr James, why should I be bound by the reasoning of a mere District Court judge?”
	
	
	But one of the judgments I was referred to is the decision of HL involving sentencing an offender for a greater objective criminality than here, but which included an offence very similar to the offence with which I am concerned. In that matter, it is to be fairly said that the sentence imposed for that offender for the relevant offence had to be considered in the context of the need to accumulate a sentence for a more serious Commonwealth offence. Thus the line that may be drawn between the appropriate non-parole period and the like is not quite as persuasive.
	
	
	I have also read the judgment of Judge Payne in the decision of Nghe involving, as I would understand it, a co accused of HL. Those judgments of course are helpful and I have taken them into account in the assessment of this matter.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as I pointed out in the case of Mr Birnie, as applies here, aspects of the purposes of sentencing that arise for consideration here are the need for the prisoner to be adequately punished and to deter him and others from committing similar offences. In fact, one might think, in sentencing offenders involved in the supply of large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs, that that aspect of the purposes of sentencing is a constant presence. I need to promote the rehabilitation of the offender and make him accountable for his actions, to denounce his conduct. There is no particular harm done to any particular victim in this matter because of the intervention of the authorities, for which they must be commended.
	
	
	I do not believe there is a need to give particular weight to protecting the community from the offender. I do not regard him as a danger to the community, although of course it might fairly be said that the conduct in which he engaged, albeit at the level at which he did participate in this criminal enterprise, had the potential for harm to the community.
	
	
	That brings me to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown very helpfully sought to bring to my attention an aspect of the supply of prohibited drugs, particularly in particular levels of purity, that is, the risk to the safety of the community, if I might use that expression, as reflecting an aggravating factor, more eloquently identified in s 21A(2). The particular authority to which the learned Crown prosecutor took me was not an authority that I was drawn to in the case of Birnie. If it had relevance it would have had equal relevance to Mr Birnie’s situation. However, in the scheme of things, as I discussed with the learned Crown, the reference to it by the learned Crown was not particularly pressed.
	
	
	We discussed the practicalities, that I know as a sentencing judge from seeing many, many of these cases on almost a weekly basis in sentencing exercises, knowing that the drugs of this high purity would most likely be significantly cut, that is, reduced in purity to increase the volume of the quantity of the drug to maximise the profit that would be ultimately realised. 
	
	
	Of course, I am fully aware of the role this prisoner plays in allowing that to occur, and the risk to the community by the use of these drugs is to be borne in mind but I do not conclude this as an aggravating factor particularly against this offender. We here as judges are all the time dealing with people committing crimes, some of dishonesty, some of violence, that have their genesis in many respects in the use of, or the addiction to, or the abuse of, prohibited drugs like crystal methylamphetamine. It must be understood that one of the reasons that the legislature has provided for penalties such as maximum penalties of life imprisonment for the particular crime for which this offender admits his guilt, is because of the recognised damage to the community that we see on a daily basis here in this Court, with sad consequences for victims and for prisoners themselves, whose lives are irretrievably ruined by their addiction to these pernicious substances.
	
	
	Ultimately, such observations as I made about aggravating factors in this criminality in relation to Mr Birnie are pertinent to this particular prisoner. It is to be fairly said, as I believe I analysed in Mr Birnie’s matter, really the facts of the case that speak of their own aggravations and matters that might tempt one to make an adverse finding against the prisoner are very much integral to the character of this type of offending, recognised by the legislature with the maximum penalties that are appropriate. It thus is the fact in such cases, by and large, except for people that can be legitimately identified as planners and principles, that additional aggravating factors that might be permitted to be found under s 21A(2) are not necessary to be identified because the offending itself speaks of its own seriousness.
	
	
	So far as mitigating factors are concerned, obviously there was ultimately no injury, emotional harm, loss or damage, other than the cost to the community of the investigation, which is not to be forgotten. I accept that the prisoner does not have any significant record of previous convictions. I am prepared to accept the prisoner was a person of good character. I am prepared to accept that the salutary lesson that he has learned from his arrest means he is unlikely to reoffend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I accept that he has expressed remorse and taken responsibility for his actions. His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor. I accept that there was co operation with the authority or assistance in a general sense, as identified by his counsel, but it is not the type of assistance of course that should lead to any discrete discount. The only discrete discount to which the prisoner is clearly entitled is the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	In the context of the sentence I imposed upon Mr Birnie, I have concluded, having regard to the relevant objective features of this matter and the subjective features of this prisoner, as were considered obviously in the fixing of the appropriate sentence for the co accused, that the starting point of any sentence I should impose for this prisoner should be eight years’ imprisonment, in the context, of course, of giving proper weight as one must to the maximum penalty to be imposed for this offence when one is dealing with the worst category of this offence committed by the worst category of offender. That starting point is reduced by 25%. That means that the total sentence to be imposed is a total sentence of six years.
	
	
	I have made a finding that there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These special circumstances include in this matter the need for an extended period of supervision to enable the prisoner to adjust to community living. He needs assistance, as the psychologist and the Community Corrections officer identified, in respect of counselling against drug use. It is clear from the greater detail of the psychologist’s report that he needs assistance in relation to the maintenance of his domestic relationships, and he will need direction, it seems to me, in respect of his associates.
	
	
	The sub-text of this matter, that is, the prisoner’s association with other offenders, is not entirely clear. It must be fairly said the prisoner has not made that entirely clear by some of his obfuscation when he was interviewed by the police, but I would be concerned that he would receive at least some direction to avoid the “anti-social” contacts that are referred to in the psychologist’s report.
	
	
	I earlier indicated when I gave an indication to the prisoner of the sentence that was to be imposed, immediately after hearing the last of the submissions and not taking time to go off the bench, that the non-parole period in relation to this prisoner should be three years and four months. I have given that matter some consideration as I have been working my way through the material. Admittedly much of it, in the context of the submissions made by the parties, obviously fresh. Perhaps the judge should give himself or herself at least 15 minutes to reflect upon these matters every time. I have concluded that I should fix a non-parole period of three years and three months rather than the three years and four months that I foreshadowed, to enable the prisoner to have a period of supervision of two years and nine months. In my view, that period is the appropriate period for which the prisoner, in the context of the total sentence to be imposed, should have the benefit of Community Corrections supervision. Could you stand up please, sir?
	
	
	In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentence to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of three years and three months, to commence on 5 June 2013 and to expire on 4 September 2016. In relation to that sentence I impose a balance of sentence of two years and nine months which will expire on 4 June 2019. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you will be released to parole, but if you are of good behaviour in custody, it is likely you will be released to parole at the expiry of your non-parole period. You can take a seat, thank you.
	
	
	I do not propose to fix any conditions of parole. I think the Parole Authority with, hopefully, the benefit of my judgment when it is revised, and the assistance of course of Community Corrections, will be better placed than I to fix particular conditions of parole at that particular time.
	
	
	In relation to this matter concerning the certificate pursuant to s 166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, I exercise the powers available under s 167 of that Act to dismiss the charge, possess prohibited drug, reflected in H54288581/2 which I take to be sequence 2. Is that convenient, Mr Crown?
	
	
	FINLAY: Thank you very much, your Honour.
	
	
	JAMES: I think your Honour’s made the drug destruction order.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I did make the destruction order so I would not forget it, but I order again to give it greater emphasis that the drugs that were seized be destroyed. I probably did that when Mr Birnie was sentenced, too. But they can be destroyed a second time if that is humanly possible.
	
	
	JAMES: Your Honour - it’s the second time or third time ..(not transcribable)..
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you very much Mr Crown for your assistance. That judgment that you referred to from the bar table, would you be able to provide me with a copy of that if I may see it?
	
	
	FINLAY: You can have this copy, your Honour. Yes, certainly.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I adverted to it in my judgment of course. I was just going to put on the record its citation, out of deference to the fact that it was raised. This is R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135, and may I keep the judgment if I may?
	
	
	FINLAY: You certainly can, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else from you Mr James?
	
	
	JAMES: No, if your Honour pleases.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Interpreter, could you tell Mr Nguyen that the total sentence I have imposed is six years’ imprisonment, the non-parole period is three years and three months imprisonment, and those orders, those sentences, which are intimately connected, commence from the time that the prisoner came into custody, 5 June 2013. Could you tell the prisoner, I cannot direct that he be released to parole at the end of the non-parole period. His release to parole will be dependent upon the Parole Authority. I have taken into account his good behaviour in custody, and if he remains industrious and of good behaviour in custody, it is likely that he will be released to parole at the expiry of the non-parole period. Given the character of the offence, he would not be required to undertake any special courses, such as a sexual offender, before he was released to parole. Can you ask the prisoner if he understands what I’ve said?
	
	
	SPEAKER: Yes, I do.

1HER HONOUR: These are proceedings brought under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Orders were made in the proceedings by Garling J in September 2011 under s 10A of the Act restraining the disposal or attempted disposal of property identified in that order.

2By orders made by Davies J on 11 December 2013 the fourth defendant became a party to the proceedings and orders were made in respect of the disposal of the assets (see New South Wales Crime Commission v Brendon Phong Tran (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1854).

3The plaintiff now seeks a variation of the restraining order against the fourth defendant to permit the property, the subject of the restraining order made by Davies J, to be varied for the purpose of paying money owing by the fourth defendant to the Water Corporation, in relation to property specified in Schedule 2 to the order. The fourth defendant consents to that order.

4In the circumstances presently before the Court, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to vary the order earlier made in the proceedings as I have described, in the terms agreed by the parties.

5Accordingly, I make orders in the terms agreed.

2764865,DO v R [2014] NSWCCA 189,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  The applicant, DO, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Maiden SC in the District Court at Newcastle on 12 August 2013.
2The applicant had pleaded guilty on 25 February 2013 to the offence of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that she was in the company of her then partner) contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The victim of this crime was a family friend.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 12 years imprisonment.  
3The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 10 February 2015 and a balance of term of 18 months expiring on 10 August 2016.  
4The applicant's partner was also charged with the same offence.  He pleaded guilty on 19 August 2013.  On 7 March 2014 Maiden DCJ sentenced the co-offender to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year 4 months and 6 days.  
Grounds of appeal
5If leave is granted, the proposed grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant are as follows:
(1)His Honour erred in failing to take into account the applicant's intellectual disability in relation to her moral culpability.
(2)His Honour erred in failing to consider the diminished need for general deterrence.
(3)His Honour erred in finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was between the middle and the top of the range. 
(4)The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed on her co-offender.
6The essential challenge raised by these grounds is that the sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with the psychological evidence relating to the applicant's limited intellectual capacity and her vulnerability to manipulation by the co-offender. 
Circumstances of the offence
7The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts.  It is necessary to refer to the facts in some detail as they shed light on the different roles of the applicant and her co-offender in the offending conduct which amounted to a joint criminal enterprise.
8The uncontested facts are that the applicant and her co-offender were in a de facto relationship and had three children under the age of 4.  The victim was a family friend of the applicant who had regularly babysat the applicant's children since about June 2010.  
9On the afternoon of 19 February 2011 the victim arrived at the applicant's home to babysit the children and it was arranged that the victim would stay the night.  The victim was then aged 15 years and 10 months and the applicant was 31 years old.  They spent the afternoon together during which time the applicant received a text message from her co-offender, which she read, and then said to the victim ""xxxx (the co-offender) wants to know if you would like to have a threesome tonight"".  The victim replied ""No"".  Nonetheless the applicant sent a text back to her co-offender in which she stated ""She probably will later because you know what she's like when she's got alcohol in her.""  His Honour correctly observed (at ROS 1) that the applicant's response could not be said in any way to have adequately stated the victim's denial of the proposition of group sex.
10The applicant and the co-offender left the house at about 8:30pm and returned around 1:10am the following day at which point both were intoxicated.  The victim was still awake and watching television.  After the co-offender had a shower, he joined the applicant and the victim in the lounge room.  At some point the applicant left to go to bed after she and the co-offender had an argument.  The victim went to the kitchen.  The co-offender then entered the kitchen and made a threat to the victim stating ""If you don't have sex with me, I'll hit xxxx (the applicant) and you"".  The victim headed to the applicant's bedroom out of fear that she would be physically assaulted. 
11When the victim entered the bedroom the applicant was in bed, under the sheets, and was naked.  The co-offender entered the room and took off the victim's outer clothing and told her to sit on the bed.  He told the victim to sit or lay down.  The victim lay on the bed facing the wall.  The applicant then began to kiss the victim and took off the victim's bra at the request of the co-offender.  Whilst this was happening the co-offender also undressed and got into bed and told the applicant to start ""doing stuff"" to the victim, but she replied ""No"".  He then proceeded to kiss the victim, remove her underwear, digitally penetrate her, and have penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with the applicant whilst kissing both the victim and the applicant.  During this time the applicant continued to touch and suck on the victim's breasts.  The victim attempted to move away, but the co-offender pulled her body back towards him.
12After about 10 minutes the co-offender ceased having intercourse with the applicant and then proceeded to commence intercourse with the victim.  The applicant then left to go to the bathroom and when she returned the co-offender was continuing to have intercourse with the victim.  The applicant and her co-offender then had penile-vaginal intercourse with each other whilst the victim was on the bed.  After a couple of minutes they stopped, and the co-offender had intercourse with the victim again.  The applicant again left for a few minutes, and then returned and watched television whilst the co-offender continued to have intercourse with and eventually ejaculated in the victim.  After this the co-offender left to go to the bathroom and the victim left and went into one of the children's bedrooms. Soon after the co-offender and applicant followed the victim into that bedroom and asked whether the victim had ""had enough"".  The pair then left to go to sleep.
13The next day, at about lunchtime, the applicant was sitting with the victim and asked her ""Did you enjoy last night?"" to which the victim replied ""No. it was horrible.""  The victim left the house later that day.  About a week later the victim came to the applicant's house to visit the children and the applicant asked her ""Would you like to do it again?""  The victim responded ""Don't ever mention it to me again"". 
14About one month later the victim made a complaint to her mother about the matter and reported it to the police.  That afternoon the applicant and co-offender attended a friend's place and discussed the incident, during which the applicant made comments that ""I did help him. I know what I done was wrong and I shouldn't have done it"". 
15Over the next few months the police undertook covert surveillance of the applicant and the co-offender, including using listening devices to record conversations between the victim and applicant.  In one conversation, on about 2 June 2011, the applicant was recorded as saying that the co-offender did not make her do it.  In other conversations with the victim on 9 June 2011, the applicant was recorded as saying that:
the incident ""didn't bother me""; the victim should ""know what males are like""; the applicant had not been concerned about getting into trouble with the co-offender if she hadn't done it; and the victim needed to think of the kids and the consequences to them if the co-offender went to prison. 
16At some point between 14 March and 16 July 2011 the applicant sent a text message to the victim saying ""You little bitch. You're getting xxxx (the co-offender) charged ..."".
17On 16 July 2011 the applicant and her co-offender were arrested and interviewed.  The applicant denied ever having engaged in sexual activity with the victim or any sexual impropriety.  The applicant was initially committed for trial on 8 February 2012 on four counts.  On 25 February 2013, on the morning of her trial (after two earlier trial dates had been vacated), the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual intercourse.  Subsequently, on 12 July 2013, the applicant agreed to give evidence against her co-offender and made a statement to that effect on 12 August 2013 in preparation for his trial date of 19 August 2013.  As already mentioned, the co-offender pleaded guilty on this trial date.
18One further matter should be mentioned.  In a signed statement dated 12 August 2013 (AB 29-31), which the applicant gave to the police in connection with the prosecution against her co-offender, the applicant stated that when she was in the taxi with her co-offender returning home on the night of the offence her co-offender raised the suggestion of a ""threesome"" with the victim, and the applicant responded ""No I don't want to"".  The co-offender then said to her ""Well if you don't go through with this, I'm gonna hit you like I'm gonna hit her"".  The transcript of the sentencing hearing records that the applicant's statement was provided to his Honour by the Crown (T 3, line 20).  
 The applicant's subjective case 
19The applicant was 31 years of age when she offended and 33 years when sentenced.  The applicant had no prior criminal history.  She did not give evidence during the sentencing hearing.
20The applicant left school at the end of year 10 and completed a Certificate II in Hospitality at TAFE.  It seems that the applicant gave conflicting information to the authors of the pre-sentence report and the psychological reports as to whether she attempted to complete years 11 and 12 at TAFE.  Ultimately nothing turns on this.  The applicant was employed in a factory work position at the age of 17 for a period of approximately one year until the position was made redundant.  She had been unemployed since that time.  
21The applicant had been in a relationship with the co-offender since about 2006 and, as mentioned above, had three young children with him.  
22The unchallenged evidence, in psychological reports from Ms Hopkins, was that the applicant's full-scale intelligence was assessed as being in the first percentile for her age group and in the extremely low to borderline range.  She had very poor verbal competence and non-verbal reasoning skills.  Despite the applicant's low intellectual functioning, Ms Hopkins did not diagnose any intellectual impairment.  She considered that the applicant was able to function adequately due to the moderating effect of her adaptive function skills, likely learned through experience and repetition.
23In her first report dated 8 April 2013, Ms Hopkins noted that the applicant had reported that her relationship with the co-offender was positive and she denied any difficulties with domestic violence or with the co-offender attempting to control or bully her.  
24Nonetheless Ms Hopkins expressed the view that the applicant's problematic social functioning and naivety would make her particularly malleable to the influence of others.  Ms Hopkins concluded that:
""Her offending seems best understood in the context of her alcohol intoxication, low intellectual capacity, likely malleability to her partner's actions, and seemingly poor understanding of appropriate sexual boundaries."" (AB 45)
25In her second report dated 8 August 2013, having reinterviewed the applicant by telephone, Ms Hopkins noted that the applicant had provided a relationship history with the co-offender which was inconsistent with the earlier history which she had given.  The applicant reported a relationship punctuated by verbal arguments approximately once a month, that the co-offender had been verbally aggressive, and that she had been scared of him and remained fearful of him.  She told Ms Hopkins that her partner had asked her on several previous occasions if they could engage in a ""threesome"" but she was not interested in doing so.  She explained to Ms Hopkins that on the evening of the offence she agreed to do so out of fear that her partner might ""bash"" her or assault her, although he did not verbalise these threats.  (By contrast the applicant had reported to the author of the pre-sentence report, dated 12 June 2013, an actual threat of violence by the co-offender.  The applicant reported that while in the taxi, on the way home on the evening of the offence, the co-offender said ""he would hurt both me and xxxx (the victim) if I don't and I didn't want her to get hurt so I did it"".)
26Ms Hopkins concluded that the earlier history of a positive relationship was motivated out of a desire to protect herself and her partner, and potentially out of fear of disclosing the difficulties she had in her relationship.  
27Ms Hopkins' updated assessment of the applicant was that:
she was fearful of her partner's volatility due to previous periods of verbal aggression by him and the precariousness of their union; there seemed to be a power differential between the applicant and her partner; her decision-making would have been impacted by her low intellectual functioning and the fact that she had consumed a quantity of alcohol; and she was immature and naïve with regard to sexual boundaries.
Reasons of the primary judge
28The sentencing judge found that the objective seriousness of the offence was somewhere between the ""middle and the top of the degree of seriousness"" (at ROS 4).  In reaching this conclusion his Honour took into account the following circumstances relating to the offending:
the victim (who in fact was aged 15 years and 10 months) had made it clear to the applicant that she did not wish to engage in group sex but her will was overborne by the co-offender and the applicant; the applicant had gone along with the demands of the co-offender; the applicant had abused a position of trust; the applicant's behaviour shortly after the offence showed a lack of compassion for the victim and limited signs of remorse.
29His Honour took into account the two reports from the psychologist, Ms Hopkins, which he noted indicated that the applicant had limited intellectual capacities and possibly some depressive risk.  He also noted that the second report gave greater insight into the mind of the applicant - that she was a person who was confused because of her affection for her partner (the co-offender) who was the father of her three children, and seems to have been easily manipulated by him.  However his Honour did not regard these matters as lessening the applicant's moral culpability and found that the sentence must give effect to general deterrence in relation to the conduct in which the applicant was engaged (at ROS 5).
30Taking into account that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""higher than mid range"" and called for general deterrence, his Honour found that no other sentence other than a custodial sentence was appropriate (at ROS 6).  
31His Honour found special circumstances, given the applicant ""has been manipulated by the co-offender"" (at ROS 5).  
32His Honour noted the applicant's expression of remorse.  He observed that the fact that the applicant had continued to live with the co-offender and ""that she has not been able or willing to embark upon a course that would cause her to avoid any possible threat of retribution by her partner which has been shown in the psychological reports"" possibly reflected her degree of confusion (at ROS 5).  
33His Honour also noted that the presentence report confirmed the matters in the psychological reports, in particular that the applicant was scared of the co-offender.  He observed however that the applicant had not taken the opportunity to remove herself and her children from the influence of the co-offender (at ROS 6).
34His Honour allowed a 10% discount for the applicant's late plea of guilty and a 15% discount for assistance to authorities.  (The applicant had agreed to give evidence against her co-offender.)  No complaint is made in relation to these discounts.  
35His Honour considered that a head sentence of 4 years was an appropriate starting point.  Allowing for the 25% discount, he arrived at a head sentence of 3 years, and, having found special circumstances, imposed a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 18 months (at ROS 6).  The non-parole period represents 50% of the total sentence.
Sentence imposed on co-offender
36On 19 August 2013 the co-offender pleaded guilty to the offence of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 14 years and below the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in the company of his then partner, the applicant - contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act.  
37As already mentioned the co-offender was also sentenced by Maiden DCJ.  His Honour found the objective seriousness of his offending was near to the higher end of the scale (at ROS 6).  He considered the issue of parity between the applicant and the co-offender, and concluded that the facts found in the applicant's case were different to the facts in the co-offender's case, in that the co-offender was the ""prime mover"" in respect of what had occurred (at ROS 1).  
38His Honour did not accept the co-offender's explanation, in which he blamed his behaviour on his consumption of alcohol (at ROS 6).  He also gave little weight to the co-offender's expression of remorse which was belated and had followed the refusal of bail for some period.  He observed that the co-offender had not shown an understanding of his actions and the damage caused to the victim (at ROS 7).  
39The co-offender was aged 26 years at the time of the offending and 28 years when sentenced.  He had no prior convictions.  He was assessed as having a low to moderate risk of reoffending.  His Honour found that there was a need for both general deterrence and specific deterrence.  He concluded that the circumstances of the offence were explained purely by the co-offender's desire for sexual gratification. 
40His Honour considered that the appropriate starting point was a head sentence of 6 years and 6 months.  He allowed a discount of 10% for the late plea of guilty and found special circumstances.  As already mentioned, the co-offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year 4 months and 6 days.
Ground 1 - Suggested failure to take into account the applicant's intellectual disability in relation to the moral culpability
41It should be said immediately that the reference in ground 1 to the applicant's ""intellectual disability"" is inaccurate.  It is clear from the applicant's written submissions that this ground is directed to the applicant's limited intellectual capacity.  On no view of the evidence did the applicant have an intellectual disability as such.  Counsel for the applicant did not contend otherwise.  Ground 1 should be approached on this basis.
42The relevant passage of his Honour's judgment in respect of which complaint is made is as follows (at ROS 5):
""There are two reports which are of relevance from psychologist Danielle Hopkins, a psychologist with the Lennings Seidler Collins group, a group well known to this court and whose reports are of assistance. The first report given in April of this year indicated a woman with limited intellectual capacities and possibly some depressive risk.
The second report which although done by telephone appears to give greater insight into the mind of this offender, that is, a mind which was confused between the affection for her partner who is the father of her three children and a person who has in the past limited social skills and appears to have been easily manipulated by her partner in the past and perhaps continuing.
That, of course, is not an answer to what was the wrong that she partook in and in respect of that, this court must consider general deterrence in relation to these facts and that is, that if people wish to involve a third person against their will, and although their level of touching might be seen to be minor, it did allow a fifteen and a half year old girl to be raped by her partner.
It is always unfortunate where a young mother who has had what would seem to be a difficult upbringing with limited verbal and written skills to make her way in society.  I do find that she has been manipulated by her co-offender and thus in terms of the subjective factors I find special circumstances and give her the benefit of a lengthy probation."" 
43Counsel for the applicant contended that his Honour erred in not taking into account the evidence of the applicant's limited intellectual capacity in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, the applicant's role in the offence, and in considering the appropriate head sentence.  In particular it was said that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced, to some degree, by the manipulation of the co-offender and that this should have been reflected in the head sentence.  In supporting this ground, reference was made to the unchallenged psychological evidence that the applicant was fearful of the co-offender's volatility; that there was a power differential in the relationship; and that her decision to acquiesce in her co-offender's request should be understood in the context of a limitation on her intellectual ability to understand appropriate sexual boundaries and to resist the influence of her co-offender.
44The Crown submitted that the psychological evidence was included in the instinctive synthesis undertaken by his Honour and was taken into account in accordance with the submissions made on the applicant's behalf.  It was submitted that this evidence was only relied upon by the applicant before the sentencing judge as being relevant to establishing special circumstances and not in relation to the question of moral culpability.  Reference was made to the submissions on this topic by the applicant's counsel at the sentencing hearing (T 4, lines 29-35).  
Consideration
45There are difficulties with the Crown's submissions.  
46First, the applicant's counsel at the sentencing hearing (who was not the counsel who appeared on this application) did not confine his submissions based on the psychological evidence to the issue of special circumstances.  The transcript records that this material was relied upon by the applicant's counsel both on the issue of special circumstances (at T 4, lines 29) and more generally (at T 8, lines 10-12).  The latter transcript reference records the submission by the applicant's counsel that what was important in this case was:
""... the combination of the plea, the assistance, the applicant's role in the offending, her previous clean record, and what was described as her intellectual functioning"". 
47The transcript then records (at T 8, lines 12-14) the concession made by the applicant's counsel, quite properly, that the applicant had not been diagnosed as having an intellectual disability and that her case did not approach the level of intellectual handicap as in Muldrock v R (Muldrock) [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  Nonetheless the submission which was made (at T 8, lines 15-19) was that the psychological evidence of the applicant's level of functioning:
""... is quite telling, not only of her general makeup but also the way that she participated in this offence and in my submission what your Honour can draw from all of this material, the influence that was played by Mr xxxx (the co-offender), so its something that your Honour can - your Honour ought take that into account.""
48The applicant's counsel then referred (at T 8, lines 21-28) to possible sentencing options, in particular a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  (This would have first required a conclusion that a sentence of 2 years or less would have been appropriate.)  
49Thus, contrary to the Crown's submissions, the applicant did not rely on the psychological evidence solely as being relevant to establishing special circumstances when setting the length of the non-parole period.
50Secondly, it should be accepted that his Honour did not have regard to the applicant's limited intellectual capacity (nor consider this matter as being relevant) when assessing her moral culpability.  This is evident from his Honour's remarks (reproduced above at [42]) that the evidence of the applicant's vulnerability to manipulation by her co-offender was not an answer to the offence that she took part in.
51The psychological evidence was clearly relevant to an assessment of the applicant's moral culpability.  There was unchallenged evidence before his Honour, which he failed to relevantly consider, that the factors which explained the applicant's offending included her low intellectual capacity and likely malleability to her co-offender's actions.
52It follows, in my view, that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the applicant's moral culpability.  Ground 1 is made out. 
Ground 2 - Suggested failure to consider the diminished need for general deterrence 
53The applicant contended that his Honour erred when considering the need for general deterrence by limiting his consideration to the facts of the offence and his finding as to the objective seriousness being higher than mid range.  It was said that his Honour failed to consider whether the need for general deterrence ought to have been moderated in light of the applicant's ""mental disability"".  Specifically, it was contended that the applicant was a less than appropriate vehicle to deter others from offending taking into account his Honour's finding that the applicant had been manipulated by her co-offender.  
54The Crown submitted that the premise of this ground - that the applicant had an intellectual disability which made her vulnerable to manipulation by the co-offender - was incorrect because there was no finding to this effect by his Honour, nor did the psychological evidence support a finding of intellectual impairment.  
55The Crown further submitted that, having regard to the way in which the applicant presented her case to the sentencing judge, she ought not to be permitted, so it was said, to reformulate her case on appeal.  Reference was made to Zreika v R (Zreika) [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80]-[81].  The Crown repeated its submissions in relation to ground 1, that the applicant only relied on her limited intellectual functioning as being relevant to establishing special circumstances.  
56In oral argument counsel for the applicant put this ground slightly differently, accepting as she must that the applicant did not have a mental disability.  It was contended that Zreika had no relevance because here counsel for the applicant had raised before the sentencing judge the issue of manipulation by the applicant's co-offender, his Honour had made a finding to that effect, and this necessarily raised an issue for general deterrence.  The error was said to be that his Honour had failed to take that matter into account when considering general deterrence. 
Consideration
57It may be accepted that the approach in Zreika has been consistently emphasised and applied by this court in circumstances where reliance is sought to be placed on appeal on aspects of the offender's mental condition which have been expressly eschewed by counsel at sentencing hearing: see Beldon v R [ 2012] NSWCCA 194 at [36].
58Here however I would not regard ground 2 as an improper attempt to revise and reformulate the applicant's case as presented to the sentencing judge.  Insofar as the applicant's written submissions in this Court referred to a ""mental disability"", the applicant's counsel clarified in oral argument that this was not intended to put the case any higher than had been advanced before the sentencing judge.
59Viewed in this light, the unchallenged psychological evidence supports the applicant's contention that, notwithstanding the fact that she had some appreciation that what she did was wrong, her intellectual limitations made it difficult to reason as an ordinary person might, and made her vulnerable to pressure from her co-offender.  
60In terms of the weight to be given to general deterrence, the central question is whether the offender is an appropriate vehicle to deter others from offending: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; Muldrock at [53]-[55].  
61It is evident however, from his Honour's remarks (at ROS 5), that in considering general deterrence he did not take into account his earlier finding (at ROS 5) that the applicant had in fact been manipulated by the co-offender.  Notwithstanding that finding of manipulation by the co-offender, his Honour said:
""that, of course, is not an answer to what was the wrong that she partook in and in respect of that, this Court must consider general deterrence in relation to these facts ..."" (at ROS 5).
62It may be accepted, by analogy with the authorities dealing with offenders suffering from some mental impairment or disability, that there is no presumption of a more lenient sentence for an offender (such as the applicant) who has limited intellectual functioning.  As Simpson J explained, in a different context, in Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114 at [34]: 
""It remains necessary for the sentencing court to examine the relevant facts in order to determine whether, in the specific case, the mental condition has the consequence contended for.""
63Here it was not suggested by the Crown that the applicant's limited intellectual functioning meant that she was a danger to the community (indicating a need for community protection).  Rather the Crown simply submitted that the applicant's ""mental state"" was not such as to mandate that less emphasis be given to general deterrence.  This however ignores the significance of his Honour's finding that the applicant was manipulated by her co-offender.  That finding was based on an acceptance of the psychological evidence that the applicant's limited intellectual functioning made her vulnerable to manipulation by her co-offender.  It follows, in my view, that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider whether this had the consequence that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. 
64Ground 2 is made out.
Ground 3 - Finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was between the middle and the top of the rangeGround 4 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed on the co-offender
65Grounds 3 and 4 may be dealt with together, as the applicant relied upon ground 4 not as a standalone ground, but as indicator (together with the matters in grounds 1 and 2) of error in his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending.
66The applicant contended that his Honour's finding of objective seriousness being ""between the middle and the top of the degree of objective seriousness"" was erroneous, particularly when viewed in light of the offending by her co-offender who, as already mentioned, his Honour later described as being the ""prime mover"" when sentencing him.  
67The Crown did not concede that the assessment of the applicant's offending was erroneous, but took the approach in submissions that if the Court were to find error, then no lesser sentence is warranted at law.  This was said to follow when one has regard to the sentence actually imposed, the objective seriousness, and all other factors in the case.  
Consideration
68In Muldrock at [27], where a standard non-parole period was provided for an offence, the High Court said at [27]:
""The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders.  It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""
69It has been observed in this Court that the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock has left somewhat opaque the meaning of the term ""objective seriousness"": R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCAA 288 at [19]-[21].  Nonetheless, as subsequent decisions of this Court have stated, it remains part of a sentencing judge's function to consider the objective gravity of the subject crime and the moral culpability of the offender: Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 at [39]; Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259 at [169]; Zreika at [47].  
70The issue was considered in McLaren v R (McLaren) [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [27]-[29] (McCallum J; McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing).  There the contention had been advanced that Muldrock renders impermissible any consideration of the applicant's state of mind in assessing objective seriousness of the offence in question.  McCallum J explained why Muldrock does not derogate from the requirement on a sentencing judge to form an assessment as to the moral culpability of the offending in question.  This assessment includes consideration of the offender's ""mental state"" or, as in this case, the applicant's limited intellectual functioning.  Most recently in Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 at [34], Beazley P (R A Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing) endorsed the observations of McCallum J in McLaren. 
71The applicant relied on two matters as indicating error in his Honour's assessment of objective seriousness.  First it was said that his Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration (at ROS 5), namely, that the applicant's participation in the offending allowed a young girl (in fact aged 15 years and 10 months) to be raped by her co-offender.  His Honour's reference to the offence of rape is to be taken as a reference to the offence of sexual assault contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act.  This offence involves, as an element of the offence, the absence of consent to sexual intercourse.  This offence also carries a higher maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  It was not in dispute that his Honour incorrectly made reference to an offence with which the applicant had not been charged.  
72In my view, his Honour's reference to the offence of rape (sexual assault: s 61I Crimes Act) should not be regarded as merely infelicitous.  It is implicit in his Honour's assessment of the applicant's offending that he mischaracterised the applicant's conduct.
73Secondly, the applicant contended that his Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, the matter already mentioned under grounds 1 and 2 - that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced, to some degree, by the manipulation of the co-offender.  This submission should be accepted as it follows from grounds 1 and 2 having been made out.  His Honour also seems to have not considered that the applicant did not initiate the offence, and that her role was relatively minor insofar as she assisted the co-offender to sexually gratify himself.  
74These two matters are sufficient to establish that his Honour's finding of objective seriousness was erroneous.  Ground 3 is made out.
75The errors established by grounds 1, 2, and 3 are sufficient for the grant of leave to appeal.  This makes it unnecessary to separately address ground 4 in the context of whether leave to appeal should be granted.  The parity principle is a matter to be taken into account when considering whether some other sentence is warranted.  In particular, it is necessary to keep in mind that the principle of equal justice requires, as far as the law permits, that like be treated alike and that differential treatment be metered out to reflect differences between those that are relevantly different: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (Green and Quinn) [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28]. 
Is some other sentence warranted in law?
76It is necessary to consider whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  Aside from reliance upon the matters advanced in support of grounds 1 - 4, counsel for the applicant relied upon affidavit evidence from the applicant, her mother, and her solicitor in relation to her present circumstances and those of her children, who now have both parents in custody.
77Counsel for the applicant submitted that the affidavit evidence established that the applicant:
(1)was remorseful;
(2)had completed various courses including the Young Adults Satellite Program, and had recently started a Certificate II course in Skills in Job Search and Training;
(3)had recently decided to end her relationship with her co-offender and had informed him by letter that the relationship was now over; and
(4)was anxious and concerned that her absence in custody was affecting her three young children, aged 7, 5, and 3, who are currently in the care of her parents, particularly her eldest daughter who was having difficulties coping with her mother's absence.  
78The Crown submitted that the Court should decline to intervene as no lesser sentence is warranted at law.  
79Neither party suggested that sentencing statistics provided useful guidance to the determination of an appropriate sentence in the present case.
Consideration and conclusion
80I have had regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances.  Except for this incident she is a person of good behaviour.  As a consequence of her offending she has been separated from her three young children since being imprisoned in August 2013.  Those circumstances have rendered her sentence more onerous.  She has already served over 13 months of her sentence.  
81The applicant's affidavit demonstrates that she has been a responsible in-mate with no disciplinary findings made against her.  She has also taken steps in terms of rehabilitation by seeking to enrol in appropriate treatment programs.  
82The sentencing judge did not make any finding as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  This no doubt reflected the state of the psychological evidence before him.  The second report of Ms Hopkins noted that there was insufficient evidence available to assign the applicant to a risk rating scale of re-offending.  The report identified a number of issues which were considered protective against her risk of further offending.  These relevantly included that the applicant did not present with any current substance abuse problems and did not have a serious history of mental illness or suicidal behaviour; and that the offence was not representative of chronic behaviour problems and had occurred on one occasion without any obvious escalation, severity, or diversity of offending behaviour.  
83On the other hand Ms Hopkins' report also noted some factors which could elevate the applicant's future risk of re-offending including her extremely low intellectual functioning and malleability to the influence of others.  As to this last matter, as already mentioned, the applicant has recently taken the positive step of ending her relationship with her co-offender.  This will obviously assist with her rehabilitation, as will the support she enjoys from her parents.
84Overall the applicant has a far stronger subjective case to that of her co-offender.
85It is necessary to balance all these matters against the offending.  
86Notwithstanding her limited intellectual functioning, the applicant appreciated what she was doing was wrong.  The offending was obviously serious.  The applicant abused a position of trust with a young girl who was a family friend.  The traumatic impact of this crime on the victim cannot be understated.  The sentencing judge was correct to observe that the applicant showed little compassion for the victim immediately after the offending.  
87Subsequently, the applicant expressed her remorse in a statutory declaration which was provided to the sentencing judge, in which she said she wanted to tell the author of the pre-sentence report ""how sorry I was"".
88More recently, in her affidavit of 20 August 2014, the applicant has acknowledged that she had done the wrong thing and was terribly sorry for what she had done.  The Crown did not submit that the applicant was not sincere in her contrition for her offending.
89It may be accepted that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced, to some degree, by her limited intellectual functioning and her vulnerability to manipulation by her co-offender.  The Crown did not dispute that the co-offender is properly to be viewed as the prime mover in this joint criminal enterprise.  The applicant's participation, although a necessary element of the offending, was secondary in comparison to her co-offender.  In my view, the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending is, for that reason, below the mid range.  
90When regard is also had, as it must, to the sentence imposed on the co-offender (Green and Quinn at [32]), I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted for the applicant to properly reflect their different roles, moral culpability, and subjective circumstances: R v Postiglione [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301-302.
91The appropriate starting point for the head sentence, in my view, is 3 years.  Allowing for the 25% discount found by the sentencing judge, the head sentence should be 27 months.  Having regard to his Honour's finding of special circumstances, and maintaining the ratio applied by his Honour (of a non-parole period equal to 50% of the head sentence), I would fix a non-parole period of 13 and a half months, with a balance of term of 13 and a half months.  
92The applicant should be resentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 months and 15 days, commencing on 11 August 2013 and expiring on 25 September 2014, and a balance of term of 13 months and 15 days, expiring on 10 November 2015.
Order
93I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal is granted.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)The sentence imposed in the District Court on 12 August 2013 is quashed.
(4)The applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 13 months and 15 days commencing on 11 August 2013 and expiring on 25 September 2014 with a balance of term of 13 months and 15 days commencing on 26 September 2014 and expiring on 10 November 2015.  The applicant is to be released to parole on 26 September 2014.

2764866,New South Wales Crime Commission v Gibbs [2014] NSWSC 1383,"Judgment

1By summons filed on 23 September 2014, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in property of the defendant, Stephen Allan Gibbs. Ancillary orders under s 12(1) of the Act were also sought, as well as orders under s 27 and other orders. 

2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 25 September 2014 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission's Director (Financial Investigations) and authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.

3For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.

4The property in question is identified in a schedule to the summons. It includes one property located at Rooty Hill, a motor cycle and funds held in an account with Newcastle Permanent Building Society.

5Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Gibbs had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, ""supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis sativa plant), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a prohibited drug (cannabis sativa plant), contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

6Mr Spark provided a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts sheet prepared by Senior Constable Salvador of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Gibbs' arrest on 16 June 2014; answers provided to questions he asked of Senior Constable Salvador about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers the COPS, RMS and LPI databases and documents produced to the Commission by Newcastle Permanent. 

7This material disclosed that Mr Gibbs has been charged with offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 after an investigation into the cultivation of cannabis sativa plants. Police surveillance resulted in Mr Gibbs' arrest in June 2014 at the Rooty Hill property which had been converted for the purpose of growing cannabis sativa plants by enhanced means, using hydroponic cultivation. Three hundred and forty seven plants at various growing stages, with a value estimated to be of $1,735,000, were found in the property.

8Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate and to dispose of motor vehicles and funds held in bank accounts quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Gibbs is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 

9Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 

10I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the other orders sought. 

11On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 

Orders

12I accordingly make orders in the terms sought.

		10 October 2014",2014-09-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764887,Aitken v R [2014] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2ADAMS J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  Matthew Wayne Aitken (the applicant) was sentenced by his Honour Judge Lerve in the District Court at Dubbo for an offence of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor occasioning death to imprisonment for 4 years 1 month with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.
4The offence is contrary to s 52A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.
Facts
5The applicant was 18 years of age and held a learner's permit to drive.  At about 9.45pm on Friday 25 November 2011 he was driving a utility with two passengers in Mudgee.  He failed to negotiate a left hand bend in the road, lost control and the vehicle impacted heavily with a tree before coming to rest.  One of the passengers, Mr Blake Shearan who was a close friend of the applicant's, was killed.  The other passenger was not seriously injured. 
6Empty bottles of beer were on the ground near the car and partially consumed bottles of bourbon and rum were inside.  A blood sample taken from the applicant revealed that his blood alcohol level was 0.109.
7The applicant later told police that it was pouring with rain at the time and visibility was reduced to about 20 to 50 metres ahead.  It was a 50km/h speed limited area but it was an agreed fact that he had been travelling at between 76 and 93 km/h, more likely towards the upper end of that range.  He told police that he was aware that as a learner driver he was subject to a zero blood alcohol limit, a speed limit of 80 km/h and was to be under the supervision of a fully licensed sober driver.
8The agreed facts included that the applicant had been drinking with friends from the middle of the afternoon through into the evening, including in the car. He had driven with his two passengers from Wellington to Gulgong where they remained for a few hours before continuing on to Mudgee.  It was common ground that his driving at times had been erratic, including dangerously crossing unbroken lines in an overtaking manoeuvre and otherwise being on the incorrect side of the road for no apparent reason.  The driver of a fuel tanker who had been overtaken was so struck by the manner of the applicant's driving that he attempted to contact police.
9The applicant said in his evidence at the sentence hearing that he was driving as quickly as he was because they were not aware of the lock out time of the hotel in Mudgee where they were planning to get more alcohol.
10No mechanical defect or failure was found upon investigation, although it was noted that the speedometer of the utility was not working.  Causative factors in the collision were agreed to be the speed of the vehicle, the applicant's limited driving experience and his blood alcohol content.
Personal circumstances of the applicant
11The learned sentencing judge noted that the applicant was almost 19 years of age at the time of the offence and had since turned 20.  He had a criminal and traffic record but the judge regarded it as limited and entitled him to some favourable consideration.
12The judge regarded the subjective case as ""strong"".  The applicant was diagnosed with ADHD as a child.  A social worker's report included a history of binge drinking.  Since the incident he had resorted to the use of cannabis and amphetamines.  His Honour considered that the latter warranted intensive supervision in the future.
13The judge accepted that the incident ""has had a very profound effect on him"" and he accepted that he was genuinely remorseful.  The judge noted that in the evidence given by the applicant he said that he felt worthless and deserved to go to gaol. He had experienced suicidal thoughts but said he had not been able to give effect to them.  This was considered by his Honour to be another reason why the applicant needed professional assistance in the future.
14Findings were made that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend.  The judge also took into account an element of extra curial punishment on account of the applicant having sustained a fractured vertebrae and other consequences such as being unable to continue with his work as a shearer's rouseabout.
15Special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period were found on the basis of the applicant's age, first time in custody, and the need for intensive supervision upon release.
Grounds of appeal
16Two grounds of appeal were relied upon:
1. The sentencing judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor the journey between Wellington and Gulgong.
2. The sentence was manifestly excessive.
Ground 1 - length of journey as an aggravating factor
17The judge had regard to the guideline judgment in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252. Of the seven features of the ""typical case"" there described, he found that four were present in this case.  The guideline judgment also identified (at [216]) frequently recurring aggravating factors that were relevant to an offender's moral culpability; one being the ""length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk"".  
18This ground is related to the italicised portion in the following extract from the remarks on sentence:
""However there are a number of aggravating factors.  The offender was driving in a dangerous manner from Gulgong to Mudgee and was drinking alcohol from Wellington to Mudgee. There were two other vehicles and there was other traffic on the road, although that traffic was described as light.  The driving conditions were poor as was visibility.  The offender was driving at a point immediately before he lost control of the vehicle at a speed substantially in excess of the relevant speed limit.  He was a learner driver and subject to a zero blood alcohol limit.
I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the course of driving between Gulgong and Mudgee described in the facts can accurately be described as erratic.  The length of the journey was not insignificant.  There [are] approximately ninety kilometres between Wellington and Mudgee and approximately twenty or so kilometres from Gulgong to Mudgee.  The offender was driving in a manner dangerous to the public as well as being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  In these circumstances I agree with the Crown's ... written submissions  ...:
'The dangerous driving in the present matter involved, inter alia:
(1)  driving whilst judgment was impaired by alcohol,
(2)  a lengthy journey exposing other drivers to risk,
(3)  excessive speed in circumstances of poor road conditions and poor visibility.
The circumstances clearly demonstrate an abandonment of responsibility by the offender well above any typical case.'""  (Emphasis added)
19The judge then referred to some other matters in the list of frequently recurring aggravating factors identified in R v Whyte which were not present.  He continued:
""However in all of the circumstances I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the offending in this matter is above the mid point on the scale of seriousness.  Indeed I am satisfied it is above the mid point of the scale of seriousness by some distance, although this is by no means a worst case example.""
20Counsel for the applicant conceded that it was open to the judge to have regard to the applicant's driving between Gulgong and Mudgee as an aggravating factor, being the length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. But it was contended that it was wrong to take into account the journey between Wellington and Gulgong as an aggravating factor.  The overall journey had been broken at Gulgong where the applicant and his companions had remained for about three hours; the trip from Wellington to Gulgong was really a journey separate from that from Gulgong to Mudgee. 
21It was also submitted that it was wrong to regard as an aggravating factor the consumption of alcohol during the journey from Wellington to Gulgong; that was only relevant to the applicant's level of intoxication at the time of the collision.
22The Crown submitted that there was no error.  The applicant had been drinking prior to departing Wellington and he was a driver who should have had a zero blood alcohol level.  He admitted to police that he had a beer at a hotel in Wellington and then four or five more at a friend's house.  This was between about 2.30pm and 6.00pm.  He also admitted that he and his passengers continued drinking beer during the journey to Gulgong.  They also had a bottle of cola to which the applicant had added some rum.  He told police that he rated his affectation at this stage (namely by the time of arrival in Gulgong) as three to four out of ten.
23In my view it was open to the judge to regard the trip from Wellington to Mudgee as part of the one journey.  Mudgee was their intended destination when they left Wellington.  They only pulled in to Gulgong because they were low on fuel.  The applicant was drinking throughout the entire period: at Wellington, from Wellington to Gulgong, at Gulgong, and then from Gulgong to Mudgee.  The fact that they were stationery for some hours along the way seems to be immaterial.  The applicant's admission that by Gulgong he was affected to the level he admitted to the police indicates that the risk to others was of a severity that increased throughout this period.
24But even if it was wrong for the judge to take into account the journey from Wellington to Gulgong, I agree with the Crown submission that this could hardly have had any bearing upon the judge's assessment of the gravity of the offence.  That was the ultimate issue to which the finding was relevant.  The journey from Gulgong to Mudgee was not insignificant, and the applicant would have been more intoxicated during that part of the overall journey than in the earlier part.  The journey from Wellington to Gulgong was only one of a number of factors the judge took into account in the assessment of the seriousness of the offence.  Removing that part of the journey would still have left the ultimate finding (which was not challenged) as one that was open to the judge to make.
25I would reject this ground.
Ground 2 - manifest excess
26Counsel for the applicant identified the following matters as supporting the proposition that the sentence was manifestly excessive:
Early plea of guilty.
Youth and limited record.
Remorse.
A subjective case described by the judge as ""strong"".
Significant injuries that the appellant suffered and the affect they had on his ability to work.
The fact that the deceased was a close friend; the applicant had been living with him and his family at the time of the collision.
27These were all matters of substance and deserving of weight.  There is no complaint that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to any of them.
28It was appropriate for the judge to have regard to the guideline in R v Whyte.  There it was said (at [229]), that in the typical case described where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (where a death is involved) would not generally be appropriate.
29In WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165, Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) observed (at [75]) that the guideline made no reference to the upper limits of a sentence but endeavoured to indicate a lower limit for a typical case below which a sentence would not generally be appropriate. 
30In the present case, the judge correctly identified that not all of the features of the ""typical case"" and not all of the ""frequently recurring elements [aggravating features] which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence"" were present.  He did not make a finding in terms of ""moral culpability"" or ""abandonment of responsibility"".  But he did find that the objective seriousness of the offence was above the middle of the range.
31There is no complaint about the judge's treatment of the guideline.  It is not suggested that he regarded it as in any way prescriptive. As Spigelman CJ emphasised in R v Whyte (at [234]), the guideline is ""a check"" and was consistent with an ultimate decision that involves the exercise of a broad discretion.  
32This was a case involving obvious tragedy for the family and loved ones of the deceased.  It also involved tragedy for the applicant himself.  But it is important not to let that impinge unduly upon the proper assessment of a sentence which, in accordance with principle, must involve a significant element of general deterrence notwithstanding the age of the offender. The judge had the unenviable task of sentencing the applicant to what had to be a significant term of imprisonment.   In R v Musumeci (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 30 October 1997, unrep), Hunt CJ at CL observed that:
""It is never easy to send a youthful person of good character to gaol but, where it is appropriate, it is something which must be done as a deterrent to others. The need for public deterrence will usually outweigh the fact that the particular offender has already learned his or her lesson. Also, retribution remains an important purpose which the sentence must serve.""
33To make good a claim that a sentence is manifestly excessive it must be established that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust:  Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25].  On my assessment, the learned sentencing judge adopted a principled approach to his duty to impose a sentence that reflected all of the relevant objective and subjective facts and circumstances.  I accept that the result represents a severe outcome for the applicant.  But it is one that was within the bounds of a proper exercise of sentencing discretion.
Orders
34I propose the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
2. Appeal dismissed.

		29 September 2014",2014-09-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764893,Regina v Bennett [2014] NSWCCA 197,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgment of Hall J.
2I agree with his Honour that grounds 1 and 3 of the appeal should be upheld, substantially for the reasons given.  I agree also that there is a degree of overlap involved in these grounds.
3I respectfully differ from Hall J with respect to grounds 2 and 4.  
Ground 2
4By ground 2 the Crown asserts that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account, as an aggravating factor, that the offence was committed in the home of the victim.  Hall J would reject that ground on the basis that that it was so committed is an element of the offence charged.  I disagree, and would uphold the ground, for the following reasons.
5Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") sets out, in sub-s (2), aggravating factors that, when known, must be taken into account in sentencing.  Paragraph (eb) prescribes as an aggravating factor that ""the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person"".  However, the suffix to s 21A(2) provides that a court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if that aggravating factor is an element of the offence.  
6The offence with which the respondent was charged was an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Section 112(1) and (2) provide:
""112  Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence(1)  A person who: (a)  breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or(b)  ...   is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years.(2)  Aggravated offenceA person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation.  A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.(3)  ...""
7For the purposes of this offence, a ""circumstance of aggravation"" is one of six set out in s 105A of the Crimes Act.  The circumstance of aggravation alleged against the respondent was that he knew that there were persons present within the dwelling house he broke and entered.
8The elements of an offence against s 112(2) are:
that the accused person broke and entered into a dwelling house or other building;
and
therein committed a serious indictable offence.
There is no element of this offence that the ""dwelling house or other building"" broken and entered is the home of the victim of the offence.  
9Section 112(2), by reference to s 112(1), is concerned with offences committed in ""any dwelling-house or other building"".  By s 4 of the Crimes Act, ""dwelling house"" includes:
""(a)  any building or other structure intended for occupation as a dwelling and capable of being so occupied, although it has never been so occupied,(b)  a boat or vehicle in or on which any person resides, and(c)  any building or other structure within the same curtilage as a dwelling-house, and occupied therewith or whose use is ancillary to the occupation of the dwelling-house.""
10That a ""dwelling house"" includes unoccupied premises, and that s 112(2) envisages break and entry into buildings other than a dwelling house, both indicate that the offence created by the sub-section is not limited to buildings that constitute the home of the victim or any other person.  That the building the subject of the break and entry was the home of the victim is therefore not an element of the offence charged.
11The charge on the indictment was:
""On the 18th day of November 2012, at ORANGE, in the State of New South Wales, [the respondent] did break and enter the dwelling house of [the victim] situate at [address] and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely, did intimidate [the victim], in circumstances of aggravation, namely, he knew that there were persons present within the said dwelling house.""
12That the indictment specified that the building that the respondent broke and entered was a dwelling house, and that it was the home of the victim, are not elements of the offence.  They are no more than particulars of the offence against s 112(2).
13It was, in my opinion, an error to find that the fact that the offence was committed in the home of the victim was an element of the offence and therefore not an aggravating factor within s 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
Ground 4
14I accept that it was open to the sentencing judge to find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and therefore to depart from the statutory proportions between the head sentence and the non-parole period.  However, I am of the view that the extent of departure was excessive.  
15That is not entirely for the reason submitted on behalf of the Crown.  The Crown submitted that there was an element of double counting in that the respondent's ""relatively young age"", his need for an extended period of supervision to address his drug and alcohol problems, and that the respondent would be serving his first custodial sentence were all taken into account in the fixing of the head sentence, and again in the fixing of the non-parole period.  I agree with Hall J that the Remarks on Sentence do not disclose the double counting alleged.  There is a reference in the Remarks on Sentence to the respondent's ""relatively young age"", but that appears in that part of the Remarks where the sentencing judge was considering the sentence to be imposed (as distinct from its division of the sentence into head sentence and non-parole period).  This was little more than a glancing reference when the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation were being considered.  The reference to the fact that this will be the respondent's first custodial sentence was also made in that part of the Remarks, but in the review of the respondent's history, apparently also in the context of considering rehabilitation.  The need for an extended period of supervision is plainly irrelevant to the selection of the head sentence and was not taken into account in that context.  It is relevant only to the division that must be made after the head sentence has been selected.  Accordingly, I agree with Hall J that the Remarks on Sentence do not disclose the double counting asserted on behalf of the Crown.
16However, error can also be identified in the result of the sentencing decision, where the result is ""unfair or plainly unjust"".  In my opinion, error in the selection of the non-parole period is in this case disclosed.  Not only is the non-parole period 40 per cent of the head sentence (as against the 75 per cent envisaged by s 44(2), absent special circumstances), it is also 40 per cent of the standard non-parole period, to which the court is obliged to have regard as a ""legislative guide post"": Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  I am satisfied that insufficient attention was given to the standard non-parole period in the implementation of the legitimate finding of special circumstances.  The variation resulted in a non-parole period that was manifestly inadequate.
17This was, in my opinion, an offence of very considerable objective gravity.  I agree with Hall J that the assessment of the offence as of lower than mid-range objective seriousness was not open.  I would, for myself, go further, and suggest that this was a case that exceeded the mid-range of objective gravity.  However, at first instance, it was conceded on behalf of the Crown that the offence fell into the mid-range of objective gravity, and I would therefore not depart from Hall J's assessment in that respect.
18Having regard to my view that a significant aggravating factor was not taken into account, and my view that the objective seriousness of the offence should be treated as mid-range, I have concluded that both the head sentence and the non-parole period were manifestly inadequate.
19In my opinion, the total term of imprisonment should be 5 years and 9 months.  To give effect to the finding of special circumstances, I would vary the statutory proportion applying to the head sentence and the non-parole period, and specify a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months.  That is a significant reduction on the statutory proportion.  The proposed non-parole period is 56.5 per cent of the head sentence.
20I propose the following orders:
(1)Crown appeal allowed;
(2)Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed;
(3)In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months commencing on 27 April 2013 and expiring on 26 July 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 26 January 2019.
21HALL J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed on the respondent, Rodney James Bennett, by his Honour Judge Hoy in the District Court on 11 October 2013.  The respondent was convicted after trial of one count of break and enter a dwelling house and commit a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the respondent knew there were persons present in the dwelling house, contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900. 
22The maximum penalty for the offence was 20 years imprisonment, and it carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  His Honour sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years.  The Crown asserts that that sentence is manifestly inadequate.
Factual Background
23The respondent and the principal victim, C, were associates and had known each other for a considerable time.  They shared an interest in illicit drugs, and the respondent purchased cannabis from C from time to time.
24C resided in premises in Orange.  He lived at those premises with his 14 year old son, O.  His eight year old daughter, V, visited regularly and was staying with him on the night of the offence.
25On 18 November 2012, the respondent consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol.  During the afternoon he made a number of attempts to contact C for the purpose of acquiring cannabis.  He made a series of telephone calls that went unanswered.  This would appear to have agitated the respondent.  As the afternoon went on, his frustration escalated.  By 8.28 pm, the respondent had made as many as 11 unanswered calls.  It would appear that one of the calls was answered by the victim's son.  However, the call quickly became disconnected.  By this time, the respondent had become incensed and was pursuing the victim with a degree of urgency.
26Together with another man, TM, the respondent walked to C's premises to confront him.  The respondent banged on the front door and demanded entry.  In fear, C and his children hid in the rear bedroom.  C's son O hid in the wardrobe, whilst his daughter hid beneath the covers on the bed.  C himself hid under the bed. He instructed his son to call triple-0, which he did.  Much of what followed was recorded by the triple-0 operator.
27The respondent opened a glass sliding door at the rear of premises and made his way to the bedroom.  He dragged C out from underneath the bed by his legs and began punching him.  C resisted.  The respondent was screaming and threatening C, including threats to use a shotgun.  I note, however, that there is no evidence that a firearm was actually present.  The children were understandably terrified by the attack and their screams are heard on the triple-0 recording.
28The sentencing judge observed:
""The Offender charged into the bedroom and dragged him out by the legs and started punching him.  At the time he was screaming and threatening C.  C understandably resisted.  Much of this interaction is recorded by the triple-0 operator who had been called by C.  The mobile phone was still on and connected.  It was in that bedroom.  Many of the words are indiscernible, some are very clear.  The screams of fear and panic were chillingly clear.  I am of the view that what could be heard gives considerable insight as to the ferocity of the attack and the terror that it instilled.  I also accept that the Offender eventually stopped assaulting and screaming at C once he examined C's telephone and realised an effort had been made to call him back.
The Offender stated he did not realise there were children present.  I find that difficult to accept.  The screaming was chilling and loud to the extent it was recorded by the triple-0 recipient who was on the end of the line connected to the phone which was under the bed.
Those present must have heard it.  The Offender says not so because of the shouting and screaming between he and C.  I do not accept that his realisation was as latent as he says.  He ignored the children.  The prompt for him to leave was the message, discovering the message on the phone, the attempted return calls; that which was the focus of his tirade.  He left shortly after that.  I also accept there was reference to the use of a shotgun and threat that it would be used upon C.  Indeed this was admitted by the Offender in cross-examination in the trial where he conceded that he did threaten C; in that at the time he said 'Tony pass me the gun'.  He said these words because he wanted to scare him.  He conceded the language but denied hitting or punching C.  Whilst he says there was no firearm, he said that he said those words ... to instil fear.  He certainly achieved that.""
29The respondent was arrested in the early hours of 19 November 2012.
The Sentencing Hearing and Remarks on Sentence
30The respondent was 31 years' of age at the time of the offence, and 32 at the time he came to be sentenced.  The respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. 
31His Honour made factual findings relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence.  These included that the intimidation was ongoing and that it involved the use of violence upon C.  Further, it was accepted that gun threats were made, and that the offence was committed in company.  In relation to the aggravating factors set out in s 21A(2) Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999, his Honour recorded a finding that the respondent must have known there to be children present at the time of the offence (s 21A(2)(ea)).  However, the learned sentencing judge declined to make a finding that the offence was committed in the victim's home for the purposes s 21A(2)(eb), on the basis that this was an element of the offence.  His Honour also declined to make a finding that the emotional harm or injury sustained by the victims was substantial for the purposes of s 21A(2)(g).  Ultimately, his Honour assessed the offence as ""falling within the lower range of objective seriousness"" (ROS 11).
32In relation to the respondent's subjective case, the sentencing judge noted that he did not have a significant record of previous convictions, and that he had relatively good prospects of rehabilitation by reason of his young age.  His Honour also accepted that the respondent had shown remorse for his behaviour.
33In assessing the harm occasioned by the offence, the learned sentencing judge referred to victim impact statements made by C, his son O and his daughter V respectively.  His Honour noted that the statements ""provide considerable insight as to the magnitude of the impact this offence has had upon each of those victims"" (ROS 15).  The sentencing judge also referred to findings made in the reports of two psychologists who had assessed V and O.  These findings included the fact that both children had suffered symptoms consistent with post traumatic stress disorder and other complications following the offence.
34His Honour referred to a pre-sentence report dated 10 October 2013.  It documented the respondent's substance abuse, notably his recent addiction to cannabis.  The report noted, however, that the respondent had remained abstinent whilst on bail and had indicated a willingness to undergo counselling.  The report also documented the respondent's depression, which remains stable when on his medication.  The report assessed the respondent as being a medium risk of re-offending.
35A finding of special circumstances was made pursuant to s 44(2) Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 on the basis of the respondent's young age, his need for ongoing assistance to overcome alcohol and substance abuse, and the fact that it was his first time in custody.  Moreover, his Honour backdated the commencement of the sentence to take account of time served after his arrest.
36His Honour sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 27 April 2013 and expiring on 26 April 2015, with a balance of term of three years commencing 27 April 2015 and expiring on 26 April 2018.  Thus, the overall sentence was five years.
Grounds of Appeal
37The Crown has advanced five grounds of appeal, namely:
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to find that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial leading to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.
Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in failing to find as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in the home of the victim, leading to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.
Ground 3: His Honour erred in his classification of the objective seriousness of the offence which led to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.
Ground 4: His Honour erred in his approach to a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which led to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.
Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly inadequate.
Ground 1: His Honour erred in failing to find that the emotional harm caused by the offence was substantial.
38The Crown submitted that the emotional harm sustained by V and O as a consequence of the offence was substantial and went beyond what an ordinary person would be expected to experience following an aggravated break and enter.  In support of this submission, the Crown referred to the respective victim impact statements of each child and the evidence of the two psychologists.  In particular, the Crown pointed to the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder made in relation to V for which she has received medication, and the suicidal thoughts she described in her victim impact statement.  The Crown also pointed to the depression and anxiety experienced by O.
39It was submitted by counsel for the respondent that the sentencing judge considered all the material tendered by the Crown and applied the relevant test.  It was submitted that the sentencing judge was well placed to make the finding he did, having heard the evidence at trial, listened to the triple-0 call and read the expert reports.  Counsel submitted that it was open to his Honour to find that the emotional harm was within the range of responses to be expected in the circumstances.
40In R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412, Hidden J (McColl JA and Levine J agreeing) said (at [26]):
"" ... before a judge could find 'substantial emotional harm' within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g), one would expect evidence specifically directed to that issue. Normally, this would be in the form of a victim impact statement. Whether that evidence established the aggravating factor would be a matter to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. However, it would need to disclose an emotional response significantly more deleterious than that which any ordinary person would have when subjected to an armed robbery.""
41Further, in Regina v Solomon [2005] NSWCCA 158; (2005) 153 A Crim R 32, Howie J (Grove and Latham JJ agreeing) said (at 37-38 [20]):
""Nothing in Youkhana should be taken to suggest that the normal or assumed effects of an armed robbery upon a victim are not substantial. The case is simply authority for the proposition that, in order to avoid double counting of aggravating factors, the court cannot take into account as an aggravating feature of a particular crime the effects upon a victim that would be expected to result from the commission of that type of offence. There may be cases at the margin where some judgment might have to be made about whether the severity of the effect of a particular offence on a particular victim is such that the offence should be considered to be aggravated.""
42In relation to s 21A(2)(g), the learned sentencing judge said the following in the present case (ROS 12):
""As to (g) I am not satisfied that there has been 'substantial injury' as required by the legislature. The psychological material and victim impact material provided is relevant and I take it into account. The injuries suffered in my view are not beyond those which could be expected to be suffered in the circumstances and as a result of an offence of this nature.""
43In my view, the harm sustained by the two children in this case is properly characterised as substantial for the purposes of s 21A(2)(g).  The young girl was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of the offence.  She continues to receive medication for this condition.  She also reported suicide ideation in her interview with the psychologist.  The psychologist concluded that the symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder ""impact on her ability to function adaptively in all areas of her life"". Similarly, the young boy also displayed symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress.  He also exhibited symptoms of depression.  These are not merely transient injuries.  The harm occasioned as result of the respondent's actions is pervasive in its impact on these children's lives and may have continuing consequences for them.  Therefore, I am satisfied that it is harm which is significantly more deleterious than the harm that may be expected to result from an offence of this kind.
44Accordingly, this ground of appeal is upheld.
Ground 2: His Honour erred in failing to find as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in the home of the victim.
45As referred to above (at [31]), the learned sentencing judge declined to make a finding for the purposes of s 21A(2)(eb) that the offence was aggravated by reason of it having been committed in the home of the victim.  His Honour's reasoning was that he was precluded from taking that into account as an aggravating feature because it was an element of the offence. 
46The Crown submitted that it was an error to find that it was not capable of constituting an aggravating factor. In support of this submission, the Crown referred to the decision of Barr AJ in R v Palijan [2012] NSWCCA 142 at [21] (McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing), which it asserted was authority for the proposition that a sentencing judge can regard the fact that the offence was committed in the home of the victim as an aggravating factor for an offence under s 112(2).
47In Palijan, the offender pleaded guilty to an offence of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence (intimidation) in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he used corporal violence on the victim.  In response to a submission that the sentencing judge in that case had erred in finding that the offence was aggravated on the basis that the offence was committed in the victim's home, Barr AJ stated (at [21]) that, ""[t]he element of breaking and entering in s 112(2) Crimes Act does not require that the premises be the home of the victim"".
48It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that his Honour was correct to distinguish Palijan.  In Palijan, the circumstance of aggravation that was charged in the indictment was the use of corporal violence.  Whereas in the present case, the circumstance of aggravation as charged in the indictment was that the respondent knew there to be persons in the house.  Counsel for the respondent submitted that there was a real risk of double counting if the sentencing judge were to take into account the offence having been committed in the home of the victim as an aggravating factor for the purpose of s 21A(2) in the present case.  Such a risk was not present in Palijan.
49The indictment in the present case was in the following terms:
""On the 18th day of November 2012, at ORANGE, in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of [C] situate at [address], Orange, and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely, did intimidate C, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, he knew that there were persons present within the said dwelling house."" [emphasis added]
50In his remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing judge said the following in respect of s 21A(2)(eb) (ROS 12):
""As to (eb) I do not so find. In my view that is an element of the offence and to take that into account would result in double counting. The submission that the children are entitled to feel safe and secure in their home is accepted but not to the extent of promoting a finding of aggravation under this sub paragraph"".
51Section 21A(5) provides that the fact that any aggravating (or mitigating) factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase (or decrease) the sentence for the offence.
52In circumstances in which the indictment pleaded the fact that the offence charged under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 involved the dwelling house of C that enabled the court to take into account, when determining the objective seriousness of the offence, the fact that the offence involved the dwelling house in which C and his two children were present at the time of the commission of the offence rather than considering it as a separate aggravating factor.  No error as contended for in ground 2 has in my opinion been made out.  This ground should be dismissed.
53Since formulating and expressing my conclusion in relation to ground 2 as set out above, I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Simpson J in which her Honour concludes that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the fact of the offence occurring in the home of the victim was an element of the offence and therefore not an aggravating factor within s 21A(eb) of the Sentencing Act. 
54In the circumstances in which I have reached a contrary conclusion, I set out below in greater detail the analysis which has led me to the conclusion which I have expressed in relation to ground 2.  I do so, in particular, by reason of the fact that offences under s 112(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act are, unfortunately, not uncommon.
Analysis
55In my analysis, the following matters are to be taken into account:
(i) Section 112 of the Crimes Act finds its place in Division 4 of that Act which is subtitled ""Sacrilege and housebreaking"".  Section 105A, also within Division 4, contains a non-exhaustive definition of the term ""building"" (""... includes any place of Divine worship""), as well as definitions of the expressions ""circumstances of aggravation"" and ""circumstances of special aggravation"".
(ii) For a conviction of an offence under s 112(1)(a) it has been accepted that the same act can be relied upon to prove both an element of the offence charged and a matter of aggravation:  R v O'Donoghue (2005) 151 A Crim R 597; [2005] NSWCCA 62.  That was a case in which the accused was charged with breaking and entering a dwelling and committing a serious indictable offence namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, being the use of corporal violence.
(iii) Section 112(1) and (2) is concerned with offences involving the breaking and entering of buildings, that is:  ""... any dwelling-house or other building ..."".  The section refers to ""dwelling-house"" as a particular species of building to which it is directed distinct from any other form of building.
(iv) As noted by McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hidden and Johnson JJ agreed) in Firbank v R [2011] NSWCCA 171 at [35]), and as Simpson J has stated in this case at [8], under s 112(1) the Crown has to prove two elements:  (1) the accused broke and entered into a dwelling-house; and (2) the accused committed a serious indictable offence therein.  The word ""therein"" refers, inter alia, to the commission of a serious indictable offence inside a dwelling-house or other building (in this case the offence of intimidation).  It is to be noted that the first element set out above has two components to it - one being the breaking and entering and the other being, relevantly, to this case, a dwelling-house into which the respondent broke and entered.  
(v) The ""circumstances of aggravation"" under s 112(2) pleaded in the present case was that ""the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed:  s 105A(f) Crimes Act.
(vi) The use of the word ""any"" in the phrase ""any dwelling-house"" in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of s 112(1) is not without significance.  The word ""any"" in a statutory context may, generally speaking, be said to be a word that connotes a capacious concept rather than a restricted one.  In this respect, see by way of example, Republic of Turkey v Mackie Pty Ltd [2012] VSC 309 at [33] per Vickery J.  
(vii) The Oxford English Dictionary meaning of ""dwelling-house"" includes ""a place of residence; a habitation; a house not for business purposes"".  The word ""home"" is defined as including ""a fixed place of residence"":  Shorter Oxford Dictionary.  Accordingly, the concept of a place of residence is common to both the expression ""dwelling-house"" and ""home"".
(viii) The Macquarie Dictionary definition of ""dwelling-house"" is:  
""noun.  a house occupied, or intended to be occupied, as a residence.""
The primary definition of ""home"" in the Macquarie Dictionary is:
""noun.  a house, or other shelter that is the fixed residence of a person, a family, or a household.""
(ix) There is, in my opinion, no delineation or refinement to be properly made between an offence that is committed in ""any dwelling-house"" as referred to in s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and an offence that is ""... committed in the home of the victim or of any other person"" as found in the provisions of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Act.  Both provisions in each Act equally embrace or include a place that is a place of residence.  The inclusion of the word ""any"" reinforces the amplitude of the ordinary meaning of ""dwelling-house"".
Discussion
56The Crown in its written submissions submitted as follows:
""His Honour erred in finding it was an element of the offence and not capable of constituting an aggravating factor.  It is submitted that this was an important aspect of aggravation of the offence pursuant to s 21A(2)(e) [sic] Sentencing Act, the significance of which is highlighted when regard is had to the effect of the offence on the children who lived in the house the respondent invaded; both of whom suffer from severe anxiety and feelings of physical insecurity as a result of the violation of their home.""
57The submission in this paragraph, however, fails to acknowledge the fact that the sentencing judge in the present proceedings in assessing the objective criminality of the offence expressly addressed the effect of the offence under s 112(2) on the children who were in the house which the respondent invaded - not as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(eb) - but, appropriately, as part of the objective facts concerning the aggravated offence itself.  The effect of the offence on the children who were present in the residence at the time of the offence, in other words, was not a matter which the sentencing judge left out of account or about which he made no assessment.  In this respect the only grounds for criticism in the sentencing judge's approach pertain to the matters which I have earlier addressed in respect of grounds 1 and 3, namely the finding by the sentencing judge as to the extent of the harm to the children (Ground 1) and his Honour's ultimate assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence (Ground 3).
58The provisions of s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act specify the aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence in subparagraphs (a) to (p) of that section.  However, importantly, as earlier stated, the section prohibits additional regard being given to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.
59There is a need for caution in determining what is integral to the elements of an offence under s 112.  This requires consideration as to whether there is a statutory basis for a conclusion that a dichotomy exists, or a differentiation is to be made, between a dwelling-house and a home of a victim.  If there is, then as Simpson J's judgment indicates, the aggravating factor specified in s 21A(2)(eb) applies in this case.  If there is not, then the s 21A(2)(eb) aggravating factor has no application and it would clearly be erroneous on the sentencing of the respondent for it to be taken into account at all.
60This accordingly involves an issue of statutory construction of some importance.  The presence of the suffix in s 21A(2):  ""The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence"" is a statutory injunction that reflects a fundamental principle in sentencing law, namely, that in sentencing an offender there is to be avoided any potential for the offender being punished twice; in this case, in respect of the second element of the s 112(2) offence.  As to the issue of double punishment see Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40] to [43] per McHugh, Hayne, Callinan JJ; Gummow J agreeing at [61], contra Kirby J at [132]; Portolesi v R [2012] NSWCCA 157 per Beech-Jones J at [40] to [52] (with whom Basten JA and Harrison J agreed).  (I note that these cases concerned the application of the principle in cases involving multiple offences.)
61In the determination of the issue concerning the aggravating factor relied upon by the Crown under s 21A(2)(eb), it is necessary to determine and to examine the basis for the conclusion that ""there is no element of [the s 112(2)) offence] that the ""dwelling house or other building"" broken and entered is the home of the victim of the offence"" (Simpson J at [8]).
62That in turn requires consideration, in particular, of the definition of ""dwelling-house"" in s 4 and the terms of s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
63I return to the question as to the elements of offences under s 112(1) and (2).  The definition of ""dwelling-house"" in s 4 of the Crimes Act is clearly not an exhaustive definition and that expression plainly carries, inter alia, its ordinary meaning, that is, a place of residence or habitation.  There are three reasons why this is so.  First, the definition in s 4 employs the word ""includes"".  Second, the structures or objects referred to in the definition in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of s 4 are structures that probably do not fall within the ordinary notion of a ""dwelling-house"".  Third, the definition of ""dwelling-house"" in s 4 of the Crimes Act cannot, in my opinion, operate as a control so as to diminish the substantive provisions in s 112(1) and (2).  
64In Kelly v R (2004) 218 CLR 216 at 253; 205 ALR 274 at 302 McHugh J said:
""... the function of a definition is not to enact substantive law.  It is to provide aid in construing the statute.  Nothing is more likely to defeat the intention of the legislature than to give a definition a narrow, literal meaning and then use that meaning to negate the evident policy or purpose of a substantive enactment.  There is, of course, always a question whether the definition is expressly or impliedly excluded.  But once it is clear that the definition applies, the better - I think the only proper - course is to read the words of the definition into the substantive enactment and then construe the substantive enactment - in its extended or confined sense - in its context and bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was designed to overcome.  To construe the definition before its text has been inserted into the fabric of the substantive enactment invites error as to the meaning of the substantive enactment.""
65In Gibb v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1966) 118 CLR 628 at 635 Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Taylor JJ said:
""The function of a definition clause in a statute is merely to indicate that when particular words or expressions the subject of definition, are found in the substantive part of the statute under consideration, they are to be understood in the defined sense -  or are to be taken to include certain things which, but for the definition, they would not include.  Such clauses are, therefore, no more than an aid to the construction of the statute and do not operate in any other way ... Consequently the effect of the Act and its operation in relation to dividends as defined by the Act must, we think, be found in the substantive provisions of the Act which deal with 'dividends'.""
66The principles of construction associated with inclusive definitions are well-known and have been discussed by DC Pearce & RS Geddes in Statutory Interpretation in Australia, (7th ed, 2011).  On the use of the expressions ""means"" and ""includes"", the learned authors there stated:
""It is usual to find one or other of these expressions where a word or phrase is being defined in legislation.  The orthodox and, it is submitted, the correct approach to the understanding of the effect of these expression is that 'means' is used if the definition is intended to be exhaustive while 'includes' is used if it is intended to enlarge the ordinary meaning of the word:  Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd v FCT [1977] VR 342 at 353; (1976) 10 ALR 441 at 455; Douglas v Tickner (1994) 49 FCR 509 at 519; 34 ALD 192 at 203; Gardner v R [2003] NSWCCA 199; (2003) 39 MVR 308.  So, for example, if it were provided in an Act that 'bicycle' means a bicycle propelled by a 'motor', pedal bicycles would be excluded from the scope of the expression 'bicycle' for the purposes of that Act.  On the other hand, the Concise Oxford Dictionary defines 'aeroplane' as a 'mechanically driven heavier-than-air flying machine'.  If it were wanted to bring gliders within the scope of controls to be exercised over aeroplanes it would be necessary to adopt the form of definition 'aeroplane' includes a 'glider'.  Here the reference to 'aeroplane' would encompass machines that normally fell within the word and would extend also to gliders which would not otherwise be covered.""  ([6.61])
67Turning to the provisions of s 112(1) and (2), the fact that they apply to buildings in addition to dwelling-houses does not, in my opinion, determine, shape, diminish or alter the fact that in this case the dwelling-house in which the victim resided was integral to the second element of the offence under s 112(1)(a) identified in paragraph [55](iv) above.
68Section 112(1), as earlier noted, expressly separates ""dwelling-house"" from any other form of ""building"" for obvious reasons.  A place of residence has conventionally been regarded as tied to notions of individual privacy and the sanctuary of a person's home.  The expression ""house breaking"" as earlier noted, forms part of the sub-title to Division 4 of Part 4 of the Crimes Act.  There being no separate definition of ""dwelling-house"" in Division 4, the discussion above in relation to the definition of that term in s 4 of the Crimes Act applies to s 112(1) and (2).
69The fact that that section also applies to buildings other than dwelling-houses is not, in my opinion, of relevance when it comes to determining what is an aspect of the element of the offence under s 112(1) in a case of an offence of breaking and entering a dwelling-house.
70The provisions of s 21A(2)(eb), forming part of a separate Act, (the Sentencing Act), and which employ the phrase ""in the home of the victim or any other person"" cannot, of course, bear upon the interpretation of the expression in s 112(1), (""any dwelling-house"").  Even if ""dwelling-house"" could be capable of carrying a broader meaning than the ""home of the victim or any other person"" in s 21A(2)(eb), the ordinary meaning of the former, in my opinion, clearly includes the latter.  The fact that s 21A(2)(eb) is expressed so broadly (ie, home of the victim ""or any other person"") in my opinion renders it synonymous with the expression ""any dwelling"" in s 112(1).
71Finally, I note in R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 consideration was given to a charge under s 112(2) of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence therein:  the serious indictable offence was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  The circumstance of aggravation was that at the time he entered the dwelling the applicant knew that a person was present therein.  The sentencing judge expressly included the use of violence in the offence as an aggravating factor, to be taken into account pursuant to s 21A(2).
72Although the facts of that case differed from the present, it is an illustration of the restriction arising under that provision.  There, the Crown had contended that a second circumstance of aggravation was the use of corporal violence.  Simpson J, with whom Johnson and Rothman JJ agreed, stated:
""31 ... The offence with which the applicant was charged was, as I have indicated, of breaking, entering and committing an indictable offence. The indictable offence - an integral element of the offence with which he was charged - was assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This necessarily involves the use of violence. The use of violence could not, therefore, further aggravate the offence. Nor could it be used, under s105A, as a circumstance of the aggravation. It was already an element of the offence charged. The reason that s21A(2) prohibits reliance upon an element of the offence as an aggravating factor is plain: The elements of any offence have already been taken into account in the calculation of the maximum penalty applicable to the offence, and therefore of the approach to sentencing in any such offence: see R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186 at [22]. 
32 In my opinion, his Honour did impermissibly take into account the use of actual violence as an aggravating factor. This was an error in the sentencing process.""
Conclusion
73Even if there be a fine-spun distinction between the two expressions referred to in the preceding paragraph, in my opinion such a distinction is not one that is capable of sweeping away on the facts of this case the fundamental statutory injunction in s 21A(2) to which I have earlier referred which prohibits on sentencing additional regard being given to any aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence.
74A reading of the remarks on sentence leaves no room for doubt that the sentencing judge repeatedly referred and had regard to the evidence which laid emphasis upon the fact that the break and enter was to the victim's home or dwelling-house, that his children were present as family members in the home, that the victim and the children took refuge in the rear bedroom of the victim's home and that the assault and intimidation took place in the victim's home.  The facts relating to all such matters formed part of the factual matrix which, properly, were considered and assessed in determining the objective criminality of the offence.
75In my opinion, for the reasons set out above, to treat such matters as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(eb) would be to have additional regard to matters that were integral to an element of the offence, contrary to the statutory injunction in s 21A(2) itself.
Ground 3: His Honour erred in his classification of the objective seriousness of the offence.
76This ground asserts that it was not open to his Honour on the evidence to characterise the offence as ""falling within the lower range of objective seriousness"".  The Crown submitted that such a finding failed to give effect to the various circumstances of aggravation that were present in this case. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the learned sentencing judge had regard for all the facts and circumstances bearing on this case, and that it was well open to his Honour to characterise the offence as he did.
77The principles to be applied to the resolution of a ground of appeal that seeks to impugn a sentencing judge's finding in relation to objective gravity were summarised recently by Simpson J in R v Fahda [2013] NSWCCA 86 at [4]:
""The starting point in considering this ground must be recognition of the principle stated in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] and [46]. Assessment of objective seriousness of an offence is the role of the sentencing judge. While such an assessment is not immune to appellate review, any interference with the findings of the sentencing judge must be founded upon one of the errors specified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499: acting on a wrong principle, allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision, mistake of facts, failure to take into account some material consideration, or production of a result that is unreasonable or plainly unjust, indicative in itself of a failure properly to exercise the power conferred.""
78After considering the range of facts and circumstances that bore on the objective gravity of this crime, the learned sentencing judge said (ROS 11):
""The Crown submits these and other factors puts the case into the mid range of objective seriousness. The Offender submits low end. There was corporal violence and children present. That resonates with seriousness. I also note however that the attack stopped as quickly as it started. It occurred over a relatively short space of time. Upon finally hearing C exclaim he had tried to call back, and upon showing the Offender the phone, the Offender appeared to accept that efforts had been made to return the calls. He then stopped. The offence was blatant, violent and terrifying, all apparently stimulated by something as innocuous as not returning phone calls. The Offender's conduct in carrying out these actions is extraordinarily if not perversely disproportionate to the situation. That said in all the circumstances this is a matter which I am prepared to categorise as falling within the lower range of objective seriousness.""
79In evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence the particular matters that determine its nature and extent in this case include:
(1) The initial fear which the respondent instilled into C and his two children by him banging on the door demanding entry soon after 8.30pm, on 18 November 2012 causing the children to hide in the bedroom, and C under the bed, the respondent at that time being ""uncontrollably agitated""  ROS at p 5.
(2) The actions of the respondent breaking into the house, knowing that young children were present, charging into the bedroom and pulling or dragging C out by the legs.
(3) The respondent's further assault upon C by punching him and at the same time screaming at him and threatening him, all plainly within the hearing of the children.  This led, understandably, to C resisting the respondent all of which no doubt contributed to the frightening commotion and disruption taking place.  The triple-0 recording picked up the screaming.  His Honour observed:  ""The screams of fear and panic were chillingly clear"".  ROS at p 6.
(4) The fact, as found by his Honour, that during the respondent's tirade there was reference to the use of a shotgun and a threat that it would be used on C.  The respondent conceded during cross-examination using the words ""Tony pass me the gun"".  He said he said these words because he wanted to scare him:  ROS at p 6.
80As to the harm inflicted on the children, I note that the report of Ms Brown, Psychologist in relation to V, and the Expert Certificate of Ms Bourne, Psychologist, indicate that both children have attended counselling sessions over a number of sessions.
81In relation to the child V, her account to Ms Brown confirms the level of terror she experienced.  She told Ms Brown that she thought ""her brother and father were going to die"" and that she was ""overwhelmed by fear and losing control of her bladder while experiencing a freeze response to the violence during the home invasion"":  at p 2.
82Assessment tests established ""generalised anxiety, hyperarousal and worry, as well as specific fears"":  at p 3.
83Following referral to Dr Shah, Psychiatrist, V was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Such a condition was still operative as at the last consultation on 2 October 2013, the date of Ms Brown's report.
84The child O's history to Ms Bourne exhibits similarities to V's account.  As at the date of the last consultation (19 September 2013), O was self-reporting symptoms that were ""in the severe range for depression, anxiety and stress"".
85Each of the factual matters referred to in [79](1)-(4) are objectively serious.  These, in combination with the psychological impacts upon the two children, in my assessment, put the objective gravity of the offence under s 112(2) at a higher level than lower range of objective seriousness as determined by the sentencing judge.
86I note that there is an overlap between grounds 1, 3 and 5 and that is a matter to be taken into account.
Ground 4: His Honour erred in his approach to special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
87The learned sentencing judge found special circumstances on the basis of the offender's relatively young age, the need for an extended period of supervision to address his drug and alcohol problems, and the fact that it was the respondent's first custodial sentence.  After taking these matters into account and adjusting the statutory ratio, the non-parole period arrived at by his Honour constituted 40% of the head sentence.
88The error asserted by the Crown under this ground is that his Honour double counted matters that he had already considered for the purposes of determining the head sentence, namely the offender's age, prior good character and lack of previous custodial sentences.  Counsel for the respondent submitted that several of the bases relied upon by the sentencing judge in support of an adjustment of the statutory ratio were, in fact, consistent with written submissions of the Crown at the sentencing hearing. 
89In relation to special circumstances, his Honour made the following findings (ROS 24):
""I accept this Offender is facing a goal sentence for the first time. The Crown submits I might also find relevant the Offender's ongoing need for supervision and his relatively young age. I am of the view that these factors and the overall need for a lengthy period of rehabilitation as to his drug and alcohol relapse need to be addressed with ongoing and focus [sic] vigilance and that he will thus benefit from a longer period on parole.""
90His Honour considered the rehabilitative steps that had been taken by the respondent in relation to his drug and alcohol problems in relation to the assessment of his subjective case (ROS 13, 17 and 19).  This did not preclude a finding of special circumstances to foster further rehabilitation upon his release.  Additionally, his Honour considered the respondent's lack of previous convictions as a mitigating factor under s 21A(2)(e).  Similarly, this did not preclude a finding of special circumstances on the basis that this was to be the respondent's first custodial sentence, thus making his sentence more onerous than might ordinarily be anticipated.  Finally, in relation to the respondent's age, the Crown submitted at first instance that this was a matter that the sentencing judge might find relevant for the purposes of s 44(2).  The Crown ought not be permitted to retreat from that submission in this Court.
91Therefore, I am not of the view that the learned sentencing judge erred in his assessment of special circumstances.  When read as a whole, I am not satisfied that the sentencing remarks reveal any double counting of any of the matters his Honour considered in finding special circumstances.
92Once a finding of special circumstances has been made, the extent of any adjustment of the statutory ratio is a matter for the sentencing judge.  In Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49, McClellan CJ at CL (James and Adams JJ agreeing) said (at [13]):
""This Court has explained on many occasions that the extent of any adjustment to the statutory requirement is essentially a matter within the sentencing judge's discretion. In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] Spigelman CJ said that an adjustment for special circumstances 'raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene.' Only if the non-parole period provided is manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive should this Court intervene: Cramp at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19].""
93The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge erred in reducing the non-parole period to 40% of the head sentence in this case, and that the non-parole period failed to reflect the criminality of the offence. In relation to the level of adjustment made by the sentencing judge, it is submitted on behalf of the respondent that his Honour had the benefit of hearing the respondent give evidence as to his remorse and his attempts to rehabilitate himself in relation to his drug and alcohol abuse, evidence which his Honour accepted.  Thus, it was submitted that it was open to his Honour to make the adjustment he did.
Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly inadequate
94The Crown submitted that, having regard to the circumstances of this offence - that it was an unprovoked, violent home invasion on residential premises in which children were present - a head sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two years was manifestly inadequate and failed to reflect the criminality involved.  Further, it was submitted that his Honour gave insufficient consideration to the five-year standard non-parole period.
95Counsel for the respondent submitted that the learned sentencing judge had regard for all relevant considerations and that the evaluative finding made by his Honour was open on the evidence.  His Honour had the benefit of seeing key witnesses give evidence (both at trial and at the sentencing hearing).  Further, counsel submitted that s 112(2) can encompass a broad range of offences with varying levels of criminality.  It was submitted that a head sentence of five years is not insubstantial, and was within the range of sentences for comparable cases. 
96This ground also overlaps with grounds 1 and 3.  I have taken it into consideration in relation to those two grounds.  As discussed below, I have concluded that the sentence imposed should be set aside and the respondent re-sentenced by this Court.
The residual discretion
97The principles applicable to Crown appeals are well established. In Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ stated (at 465-466 [1]):
""The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (Crown appeals) under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is 'to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons'. That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the 'residual discretion'.""
98Their Honours continued (at 477 [35]):
""In a Crown appeal against sentence in New South Wales, the Court of Criminal Appeal is invariably asked to exercise its powers under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to impose upon a convicted person a heavier sentence than that imposed by the primary judge. Assuming the Court of Criminal Appeal considers the sentence under appeal to be inadequate on account of error by the primary judge, two questions arise. Their answers involve the exercise of the different discretions conferred by s 5D. They are:
1. Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline, in the exercise of its ""residual discretion"" under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from.
2. To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied.""
99Mr Johnston of counsel for the respondent submitted that, if error is found on the part of the sentencing judge, compelling reasons exist for exercising the residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence.  An affidavit of the respondent was read at the hearing of the appeal.  It details the steps that have been taken by the respondent towards his rehabilitation since entering custody.  He has undertaken a number of courses and has also undertaken work.  Counsel submitted that rehabilitative considerations carry some weight in this case.  Disruption of an offender's rehabilitation is a relevant consideration in relation to the exercise of the residual discretion: Green v The Queen at 479 [43] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
100The Crown submitted that there are no factors that would warrant the exercise of the Court's residual discretion to dismiss the appeal.
101I have taken into account the matters raised on the question of the discretion but in all the circumstances, and having regard to the matters raised in relation to grounds 1, 3 and 5, I consider, as discussed below, that this Court should not exercise the residual discretion in favour of the respondent.
Conclusions
102I do not consider that the head sentence imposed by the sentencing judge of 5 years to have been manifestly inadequate but that the non-parole period of 2 years representing 40% of the head sentence is manifestly inadequate to reflect the substantial objective seriousness of the offence and the need for specific and general deterrence.  Accordingly, I would uphold ground 3.
103I consider that the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge was appropriate but that the variation in the statutory ratio under s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was not.
104I consider that the appropriate non-parole period should be a period of 2 years 9 months representing a ratio of the non-parole to the total term of the sentence of 50%.
105I propose the following orders:
(1) The sentence imposed by the District Court on 11 October 2013 be set aside.
(2) The respondent be re-sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months commencing on 27 April 2013 and expiring on 26 January 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 27 January 2016 and expiring on 26 April 2018.  The first date on which the respondent will be eligible for parole is 27 January 2016.
106HARRISON J:  I agree with Simpson J and with the orders that she proposes.

2764894,DC v R [2014] NSWCCA 192,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J.

2FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 29 June 2012 after he was found guilty after trial of four counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The complainant in each count was 15 years old. The applicant sexually assaulted her in a targeted attack on one night in 1993. In each count the circumstance of aggravation was the age of the complainant.

3That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. At the time of the offending s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) had not been enacted and, accordingly, the standard non-parole period of 10 years for an offence against s 61J of the Crimes Act did not apply.

4The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate head sentence of 7 years with an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months. 

5The applicant was self-represented on the appeal. He filed short handwritten submissions consisting of two paragraphs which the Crown addressed, conveniently, as the two ""grounds of appeal with supporting submissions"". They are summarised in the Crown's submissions as:

Ground 1: Delay

Ground 2: Assistance to the authorities pursuant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (""section 23 matters"") and sundry complaints.

Proceedings on sentence

6At the sentencing hearing the Crown tendered the applicant's criminal history. The applicant tendered a report from Mark Howard, psychologist, dated 26 June 2012, the significance of which has no bearing on the disposition of the application for leave to appeal.

The facts as found by the sentencing judge

7On 30 April 1993 the complainant, then aged 15, walked into the township of Port Macquarie from her home at around 6.30pm to see a film at a local cinema with friends. The applicant approached the complainant and her friends outside the cinema complex and asked whether they would like to have ""a joint"". They refused. 

8At about 9pm the complainant left her friends to walk home alone. While she was walking across a bridge she heard the sound of coins jangling and, when she turned around, she saw the applicant running towards her. She moved aside and he passed by her. 

9When the complainant reached the end of the bridge the applicant grabbed her, putting his hand around her mouth and neck. The complainant screamed and punched the applicant in the mouth. The applicant then pulled her to the bottom of an embankment where he put a knife against the back of her neck, telling her that he was not going to hurt her and that he just wanted to talk. 

10The complainant was hysterical and continued to scream. She was then pushed down to the ground by the applicant who forced his tongue into her mouth. The complainant continued to kick and push the applicant after which he punched her in the mouth, causing her lip to split. 

11The complainant repeatedly asked the applicant to let her go as he tried to remove her belt and jeans. The complainant continued to try to fend him off. After removing her jeans, the applicant penetrated her vagina with his finger or fingers. This was the offending the subject of the first count. 

12The applicant then inserted his penis into her vagina. This was the subject of the second count. The complainant repeatedly demanded that she be allowed to go.

13The applicant then took off his jumper and put it over her face and again inserted his tongue into her mouth after which he performed cunnilingus. This was the subject of the third count.

14The fourth count on the indictment was constituted by a further penile-vaginal assault. 

15The applicant then told the complainant to get dressed and to walk away without looking back in his direction.

16During the ordeal the complainant recognised the applicant's voice as being the same as the person who had offered her a joint earlier in the evening. She was unable to provide any further information which might have identified the assailant.

17Throughout the course of what can only be described as a series of violent and sustained sexual assaults the complainant suffered a split lip, bruising to her hand, an abrasion to her ear and recurrent vaginal bleeding. Three earrings had been pulled from her ear.

18The sentencing judge found additional features of statutory aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in respect of each of the four counts: (1) that actual bodily harm had been inflicted upon the complainant; (2) a weapon had been used; and (3) the offences were committed while the applicant was on parole.

19On 14 September 2011, as a result of the Cold Case Justice Project, police confirmed that the applicant's DNA profile matched the DNA samples collected by police from the complainant on the night of the attack. The applicant was subsequently arrested and charged. 

The applicant's prior criminal record

20As noted by the sentencing judge, the applicant has an extensive criminal record. His first conviction as an adult was in 1978 when he was sentenced to imprisonment for a break, enter, steal offence and for stealing a vehicle. Since that time he has served numerous terms of imprisonment. He was convicted of armed robberies between 1982 and 2001 for which he was sentenced to imprisonment.

21On 17 December 2004 the applicant was sentenced after trial to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years for threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, contrary to s 61K(b) of the Crimes Act for an offence committed on 13 April 2001. Since that sentence post-dated the offending for which he was to be sentenced, the sentencing judge took that offending into account only as bearing upon whether any leniency might be afforded to the applicant and to his prospects for rehabilitation. In light of the material that was before the Court, the sentencing judge found that the applicant had nothing more than ""guarded prospects of rehabilitation"".

22The sentencing judge noted that the applicant has been in custody serving terms of imprisonment for more than thirty of the last forty years. He is currently aged 53.

Ground 1: Delay

23On appeal the applicant was self-represented and appeared via video link. 

24His oral submissions were largely a repetition of his written submissions, supplemented by a plea for clemency which, under the first ground, read as follows:

""The police and prison system had this matter which should of been before the Court while I was in custody on another matter that started in 2001 and ended in 2009."" [sic]

25The sentencing judge was aware of the delay between the commission of the offence and when the applicant was charged. Her Honour found that steps might have been undertaken to review the complainant's allegations of assault prior to the case being reopened in 2011. 

26The sentencing judge cited the following passage from R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 where Street CJ said (at 519):

""...sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.""

27The sentencing judge went on to say:

""I indicate that in arriving at the sentence I will impose I have had regard to the relevant statutory framework that relates to the sentencing of offenders and to the principles established in the authorities which bear upon the issue and I have had regard to the purposes of sentencing which are set out in section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.""

28The Crown submitted that it was open for the sentencing judge to find that the sentencing principle that obtains when sentencing for a stale crime did not apply in this case (see R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130 at [32] - [33] and R v Spiers [2008] NSWCCA 107 at [37] - [38]) and that to the extent that her Honour afforded the applicant leniency on account of delay, it was unduly favourable. While these submissions have force, it is unnecessary to address them in detail since I am well satisfied that there is no substance in the first ground of appeal given the consideration the sentencing judge gave to the issue of the delay.

Ground 2: Assistance to the authorities pursuant to section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""section 23 matters"") and sundry complaints

29The applicant's written submissions under the second ground of appeal read as follows:

""I was taken from Kempsey to Long Bay Prison and put before a committy concerning pre-release due to outstanding matters E.T.C. (Finger prints - DNA) and trying to keep me in prison E.T.C. which I never fit the criteria? I also believe that this matter would of been delt with on my last incarceration possibly on a Form One. I also have matters that I've helped the Crown with under the Rockingham Cartwright Act C.C.A.? ""Murder"" - Rodney Cameron (AKA) (Mallard) 1992? / & Robert Ebner ""murder"" 1997? And many other matters over the years. E.T.C."" [sic]

30The applicant's oral submissions were again largely a repetition of what was advanced in his written submissions. These seemed to condense to two complaints: first to a complaint that he was sentenced to imprisonment at all for the multiple and serious sexual assaults the subject of the indictment, in that they should have been included on a Form 1 for the offending the subject of sentence proceedings in 2004; and, second, a wish to have his sentence reduced because he has assisted authorities in the past. 

31As the Crown submitted, the offences for which the applicant was sentenced by her Honour were of such gravity that even were he susceptible to being charged in 2004, they would not have been appropriately dealt with on a Form 1.

32Insofar as the applicant seeks to invoke s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the Crown points out it was not raised by counsel who appeared for the applicant at the sentencing hearing. In addition, as the Crown has amply demonstrated, his assistance has been taken into account in earlier and unrelated sentence proceedings as the following cases bear out:

R v Cook (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1991, unrep) per Badgery-Parker J at p 2.5-2.9, Hunt CJ at CL and Allen J agreeing;
R v Cook (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 26 June 1995, unrep) per Dunford J at pp 2-3 (a number of matters including one referred to in the applicant's written submission to this Court), Grove J agreeing;
R v Cook (District Court (NSW), Keleman DCJ, 17 December 2004, unrep), sentencing by Keleman DCJ at p 25, referring to Exhibit B, which appears to be a reference to the matter referred to by Adams J in the sentencing of R v Ebner [2001] NSWSC 421 at [22], [26]-[27].

33It is not appropriate that this Court revisit submissions that could have been raised at the sentencing hearing and were not. The decision as to whether a submission should be advanced is the responsibility of the applicant and his counsel. The fact that the applicant's assistance had already been taken into account in his favour may well have been known to his counsel. This is not the forum to enquire into or revisit that question.

34The second ground is not made out.

35The applicant has failed to advance any sufficient basis which might support a finding of error by the sentencing judge. Accordingly, the order I propose is that leave to appeal should be refused.

36ADAMSON J: I agree with Fullerton J.

5The sentencing judge discounted the sentence by 15% to take account of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.
Facts
6The facts set out below are derived from the Agreed Facts, which was the basis on which his Honour recited the facts in the remarks on sentence.
Count 1: aggravated enter with intent, in company and receiving (Form 1)
7From December 2000 the applicant was a Detective Sergeant at Burwood Local Area Command. In December 2003 he told Christopher Walker (a former police officer) and another person, X, about information that had been obtained by Licencing Police in the course of a firearms inspection. The information was that AL, the victim, had large amounts of cash, thought to be restaurant takings, in a safe in his home.
8On 4 December 2003, Mr Walker and X visited AL at home and pretended to be police officers. The applicant waited for them nearby in a van. Mr Walker and X persuaded AL to open his safe on the pretext that they were taking the money to ""check the serial numbers"". After leaving the house with the money, they went to the van where the applicant was waiting for them. He drove off in the van at speed.  The applicant instructed one of his co-offenders to destroy the van's registration plates. They shared the proceeds, about $23,500, between them.
Count 2: aggravated enter with intent, in company and dishonestly obtaining a benefit by deception (Form 1)
9In late July 2004 a legitimate police operation named ""Cobalt"" was established. Covert intelligence revealed that the applicant, Mr Walker, X and two other individuals planned to steal from a criminal, AH.
10The applicant and a co-offender confronted AH with a warrant that appeared to authorise a search of his home. They used the ruse that AH's television was stolen. They asked AH how much money he was prepared to part with to avoid being prosecuted and suggested that the figure ought to be ""at least ten [$10,000]. The applicant waited outside while co-offenders collected money from AH.  One of the co-offenders used a scanner to monitor live police frequency and kept in contact with the applicant by two-way radio.  Two security guards, one of them an undercover police officer, spoke with the applicant, who told them that he was there on police business and produced his police identification.
11A co-offender returned with $11,000 that he had obtained from AH. The co-offender took $1,000 out of the $11,000. Of the $1,000 that he had taken, he gave $800 to the applicant. The five co-offenders (including the applicant) left the area. They subsequently divided the remainder of the proceeds, $10,000, between them. 
Count 3: unauthorised computer use with intent to steal
12On 23 September 2004, the applicant and his associates devised a plan to take money from various people. One target was Ms LT, who was suspected of running a fraudulent immigration business. The applicant obtained information about her from the Computerised Operational Policing System (COPS), a computer system operated by the police. In the meantime, Mr Walker had introduced the applicant to B, who acted as a go-between between the applicant and Mr Walker.
13The applicant and B discussed various plans and ""targets"" (the applicant's term), some of which involved large sums of money. The applicant told B that he could supply names, addresses and other information for B and others to stand over those people for money, by pretending to be police officers. On 8 September 2004 the applicant and B discussed targets by reference to the codes ""the Old Man"" and ""the Australian couple"". However the applicant instructed B that they had to target Ms LT first.
14The applicant learned from viewing COPS on 23 September 2004 that Ms LT was to attend court on 29 September 2004. He then discussed her case with the officer in charge of her matter. The applicant met B and told him that they were to confront ""the Asian woman"" [Ms LT] at her home and that they were each to bring another person.
15An informer separately reported that the applicant and H were desperate for money in late September 2004 and had discussed possible sources of money. On 27 September 2004 the applicant telephoned B and arranged a meeting, at which they decided to approach Ms LT at her home the following day.
16The applicant had already arranged to meet B at 5 pm the following day, but he did not attend since he had been served with a summons to give evidence at the Police Integrity Commission on 8 October 2004.
Count 4: corruptly receive a benefit as an agent of the Crown
17While the applicant was engaged in the conduct the subject of the third count, he was also engaged with H in extorting money from another victim (the Suspect).  In mid-September 2004, the applicant was made responsible for co-ordinating the execution of search warrants in Burwood Local Area Command against persons suspected of possessing child pornography.  By reason of his position, the applicant had information to suggest that the Suspect was in possession of child pornography.
18On 24 September 2004 the applicant went with H to the Suspect's home. H went to the Suspect's front door, pretending to be a police officer. H persuaded the Suspect to come to a laneway where they met the applicant who identified himself as a police officer. They discussed the investigation into the Suspect and showed him some documents. The applicant and H then solicited money from the Suspect, who offered them $4,000. They arranged to collect the cash from the Suspect outside some flats at Concord.
19At the planned meeting, H searched the Suspect for listening devices. The Suspect handed over $3,900 and in return was advised how to get rid of the evidence on his computer and how to deal with any questioning.
20Conversations with another person, A, both before and after 24 September 2004, confirmed a plan to extort money from persons suspected of possessing child pornography. The conversations also recorded confirmation that the applicant and H had been paid by the Suspect. The Suspect got rid of all incriminating evidence on 25-26 September 2004. When a search warrant was executed by police on 27 September 2004, the Suspect was calm and appeared to be unsurprised by the visit. Nothing was found. The Suspect subsequently gave an induced statement to the Police Integrity Commission. The Suspect was not charged with possession of any child pornography.
Count 5: false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission (total of 3 charges, including 2 on the Form 1)
21On 8 October 2004, when giving evidence before the Police Integrity Commission, the applicant falsely denied dividing up the money with Mr Walker, dividing up the money with the second co-offender in Count 1 and having a corrupt relationship with H.
22Later that day, after speaking with his legal advisers, the applicant recanted and admitted his criminal involvement with those persons.
The sentence hearing
23The Crown tendered a statement of facts which it described as having been agreed in relation to all offences. Mr Greg James QC, who appeared for the applicant at the sentence hearing, consented to the tender on that basis. The statement of facts was marked Exhibit 1 (the Agreed Facts). Mr James then tendered a defence bundle, which included, among other documents, a statement of facts, which was obviously incomplete and which had formatting errors. It bore some relationship to the Agreed Facts but there were differences. The bundle was marked exhibit 2. Mr James did not indicate the basis on which his statement of facts was tendered. Nor did he explain, or even advert to, the discrepancies between the Agreed Facts and the statement contained in the defence bundle. The inference is available that the applicant's version formed part of the negotiation that culminated in the Agreed Facts.
24The Crown also handed up written submissions on sentence. The applicant handed up written submissions and tendered the following:
(1)The Indictment and Form 1;
(2)A version of the facts (which differed in part from the Agreed Facts);
(3)A report of Dr Roberts, psychiatrist, dated 23 October 2011;
(4)A report of Dion Bisa, psychologist, dated 20 August 2003 (obtained in connection with the applicant's workers compensation claim);
(5)Material germane to the applicant's good character, including certificates of recognition and appreciation;
(6)The Corrective Services Manual relating to Segregated and Protective Custody;
(7)An analysis by the Judicial Commission on Protective Custody and Hardship in Prison;  and
(8)The remarks on sentence of Finnane DCJ in respect of Mr Walker.
25The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.
26The applicant's counsel conceded that the assistance the applicant was willing to offer to authorities was of no utilitarian value. He also accepted that there was no ""true, precise parity equation"" between the applicant and  his co-offenders.
The remarks on sentence
Objective seriousness and aggravating factors
27After reciting the facts set out above, the sentencing judge said that the offences would be regarded as significant and serious even had the applicant not been a police officer. His Honour found that the applicant used his position of power and trust with the Police Force to commit serious offences. Most of his targets were suspected criminals who would be unlikely to complain. His actions frustrated the police investigation into the Suspect. The sentencing judge said:""The community rightly looks to the integrity of the Police Force to uphold and protect the law, not to break it.""
28His Honour said that the applicant's use of his position was a substantial aggravating factor. His Honour considered that there was significant planning in the commission of counts 1-4 and that the applicant's behaviour could not be described as ""impulsive"". The sentencing judge regarded the offending conduct as constituting part of a planned and organised criminal undertaking.
Subjective circumstances
29The sentencing judge made the following findings. The applicant was 42 at the time of sentence. He was of good character and had no criminal record. He had joined the Police Force in 1989 and, by December 2000, he was a Detective Sergeant at Burwood Local Area Command. He was married with children and had an unremarkable childhood. His father, who had also been a police officer, had risen to the rank of Assistant Commissioner. The sentencing judge referred to the applicant's assertion that he offended because of extreme financial difficulties which disqualified him from active duty, but did not accept this as an explanation, much less an excuse. His Honour referred to the lengths the applicant was prepared to go for financial reward.
Delay
30His Honour took into account delay and referred to R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 per Street CJ (to which he had been referred by Mr James). His Honour found that although the applicant would be precluded from certain employment after his release, there was no reason why he could not be a law-abiding citizen.
Other matters taken into account, including extra-curial punishment
31His Honour took into account the likelihood of onerous custodial conditions, the applicant's family situation, his lack of convictions and previous good character, his previous good service as a police officer, the extra-curial punishment involved in his loss of career and the public disgrace and humiliation he and his family faced as a result of his offending.
Assistance to authorities
32His Honour noted the Crown's submission that any assistance was negligible and Mr James' submission that it was at least indicative of a ""willingness to assist"". His Honour did not specifically adjudicate on these submissions and ought accordingly, in my view, to be taken to have accepted them both on the basis that the willingness to assist was a factor in the applicant's favour but that the lack of utility of such assistance was also relevant.
Special circumstances
33His Honour found special circumstances and adjusted the statutory ratio provided for in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 between the non-parole period and the total term from 75% to 60%.
Sentences imposed on co-offenders
34His Honour noted that Mr Walker and another co-offender pleaded guilty to substantially different offences in that:
(1)Mr Walker pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the receipt of a corrupt benefit contrary to s 299F of the Crimes Act 1900 and obtaining a benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA. He was sentenced by Finnane DCJ to 18 months home detention.
(2)The co-offender pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obtaining money with menaces with intent to steal in company contrary to s 99 of the Crimes Act 1900 and aid and abet an agent corruptly giving a benefit contrary to s 249F of the Crimes Act 1900 and was sentenced by Finnane DCJ to two years' imprisonment after a combined discount for a plea of guilty and past and future assistance. The sentence was suspended.
35The sentencing judge observed that the offences to which Mr Walker and the co-offender pleaded guilty were ""substantially different"" to those to which the applicant pleaded. His Honour also said:""There does not appear to be a meaningful degree of parity between the totality of their offending and the totality of [the applicant's] offending.""
36After referring to Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49, his Honour said:""objectively it is difficult to see that a realistic comparison can be made between [the applicant's] offending and the offending of Walker and [the co-offender].""
Grounds of appeal
37The applicant, who appeared on his own behalf in this Court, relied on the following grounds of appeal:
(1)His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extra-curial punishment suffered by applicant;
(2)His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extent of the delay;
(3)His Honour erred in his consideration of matters irrelevant to sentencing by having regard to factual errors and failing to have regard to omitted facts;
(4)His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extent of assistance given by the applicant to authorities and applying an overall reflective discount;
(5)His Honour erred in failing to apply proper and correct principles of parity in respect of co-offenders;  and
(6)The sentence is manifestly excessive.
Reasons
Grounds 1: alleged failure to take into account extra-curial punishment 
38The first ground can be dealt with shortly. The sentencing judge specifically adverted to this factor in his Honour's remarks on sentence. Accordingly, his Honour took it into account. What weight was to be accorded to this factor was a matter for the sentencing judge and forms part of the process of instinctive synthesis involved in the sentencing process: see, for example, Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [75] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ and Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [37]-[39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. If the resultant sentence is manifestly excessive, that is properly the subject of review and will be considered with respect to the sixth ground.
39In addition, the applicant submitted that insufficient weight was given to the loss of his superannuation. The applicant's superannuation was the subject of confiscation or forfeiture proceedings. Accordingly the sentencing judge was precluded by s 24B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 from taking it into account. It was a relevant consideration at common law: Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [54] per McHugh J, prior to the enactment of s 24B.
Ground 2: alleged failure to take into account delay
40The principles referred to in respect of the first ground also apply to the second ground. The sentencing judge expressly referred to delay in the following passage:""On the question of delay the Police Integrity Commission referred these matters to the DPP in October 2005.  Charges were laid in early 2007 and then became the subject of a contested committal hearing in October and November 2008 and April 2009.  He was committed for trial on 28 April 2009 but an indictment was not filed until 17 December 2010.  The matter was listed for trial on 2 May 2011, 30 May and 4 July, but those dates were vacated.  A further hearing of 11 July was adjourned and a plea of guilty was entered on 20 July 2011 following lengthy negotiations.""
41The applicant contended that there were errors in the findings relating to delay in that the offences came to light in proceedings in the Police Integrity Commission in 2004, rather than October 2005 and that charges were laid in December 2006 rather than early 2007. The first alleged error has not been made out: the applicant gave false evidence in October 2004; its falsehood came to light in those hearings. However, it was not until October 2005 that the Police Integrity Commission referred the papers to the DPP. The Crown submitted to the sentencing judge that the charges were laid in early 2007. The applicant's submissions did not provide any further detail as to their timing. In these circumstances the sentencing judge was entitled to rely on the Crown's submissions. The difference between December 2006 and early 2007 is, in any event, immaterial.
42His Honour took delay into account. The weight accorded to it was a matter for his Honour. This ground has not been made out.
Ground 3: alleged errors in fact-finding
43The facts by reference to which an offender is sentenced must generally be either proved to the requisite standard, admitted or agreed: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270; Weininger  v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629; Gas v The Queen; SJK v The Queen [2004] HCA 22; 217 CLR 198 at [30]. The Agreed Facts were tendered by consent on the basis that they were agreed. As such they constituted the basis on which the applicant was to be sentenced. The sentencing judge was both entitled, and obliged, to sentence on the basis of the Agreed Facts.
44The applicant was bound by the conduct of his counsel at the sentence hearing.  Mr James indicated that the applicant consented to the tender of the Agreed Facts. An agreement as to the facts is part of the acceptance of a plea of guilty. There is no discernible basis on which the Agreed Facts ought not to have been accepted by the sentencing judge, or on which their correctness ought to be revisited on this application. 
45The statement of facts tendered by the applicant at the sentence hearing did not have any such standing. Without agreement, the statement of facts contained within the applicant's tender bundle at the sentence hearing, had no probative value, except in so far as it happened to correspond with the Agreed Facts.
46Although there are occasions where matters not raised or conceded on behalf of an applicant at the sentence hearing will nonetheless give rise to errors which can be corrected by this Court, it is generally undesirable for leave to appeal to be sought on grounds which are contrary to concessions made before the primary judge, unless there are exceptional circumstances: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, at [81] per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL agreeing). No exceptional circumstances have been identified in the present case.
Ground 4: alleged error regarding assistance to authorities
47The sentencing judge referred to the fact that the applicant was willing to assist and noted Mr James's concession made on behalf of the applicant that the applicant's willingness to assist was of no utility. No error has been shown.
48In so far as the applicant relied on future assistance (since the time of sentencing), this is not a basis for this Court to revisit the sentence imposed. Although the sentencing judge was obliged to take into account assistance to authorities (whether past or to be given in the future), his Honour did so and no error has been shown in that respect. Any further assistance which has in fact been given by the applicant to authorities since his incarceration is appropriately a matter for the executive, rather than this Court: R v Perez-Vargas (1987) 8 NSWLR 559 at 563-565 per Street CJ, Hunt and Allen JJ agreeing.
49The applicant conceded in his written submissions that the further material he relied upon as to his assistance to authorities in the period since his sentence was imposed would only be relevant if this Court proposed to re-sentence. The Crown objected to this material on the basis that future assistance provided neither a reason nor an occasion to revisit the sentence, although its value might cause the executive to act to ameliorate the sentence or conditions of custody of the person who had provided it. As this Court does not propose to re-sentence, it is not necessary to rule on the admissibility of that part of the affidavit, to which objection was taken.
50The Court also received confidential material from the Crown, which arises for consideration only in the event that this Court proposed to re-sentence. As this Court does not propose to re-sentence it is not necessary for this additional material to be addressed.
Ground 5: alleged disparity between co-offenders
51The applicant's counsel accepted, correctly in my view, that there was no parity between the applicant on the one hand and Mr Walker and the other co-offender on the other because of the substantial difference between the offences with which they were charged. The practical effect of the principles of parity is diminished where different charges are laid (since this is a matter of prosecutorial discretion) or offenders are sentenced on the basis of a different factual substratum (whether agreed or otherwise): Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [30] which approved Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [203] per Campbell JA; see also Yousif v R [2014] NSWCCA 180 at [26]-[27] per Hoeben CJ at CL, Adamson and Bellew JJ agreeing. 
52The sentencing judge did, however, take into account both the sentences imposed on Mr Walker and also on the co-accused, although only the remarks on sentence in respect of the former were available at the applicant's sentence hearing. The fifth ground has not been made out.
Ground 6: alleged manifest excess
53The applicant sought to challenge the indicative sentences for counts 1, 3 and 5. Only a sentence that has actually been passed can be the subject of an application for leave to appeal: s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). An indicative sentence has not been ""passed"" since it is an indication of the sentence that would have been imposed if sentences for individual offences, rather than an aggregate sentence, had been imposed: s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
54A claim of manifest excess requires the applicant to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principles that there is no single ""correct"" sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]-[59].  Whether a sentence is manifestly excessive is a conclusion. It is not necessary to identify any particular error in the process; it is the examination of the result that leads to the conclusion. 
55Nonetheless it can be helpful to ascertain why and how the sentence was arrived at since this inquiry may explain the conclusion and expose the reason for any manifest excess. It is on this latter basis that regard may be had to indicative sentences since if one or more is excessive, it may explain why (if it be the case) an aggregate sentence is excessive.
56I do not discern any error in the indicative sentence for the first count. The applicant was, at the time of the offending, a serving police officer. He was the architect of the offence. He misused his position by acting on information that was available only to serving police officers and made an entry on COPS to reduce the chance of the money being lawfully seized by other officers before he and his co-offenders could obtain access to it. 
57The applicant called in aid statistics in respect of the third count. Statistics, which are of limited value generally in sentencing (Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [55]), are particularly inapposite in the present case where the moral culpability of the applicant depended on his position and the surrounding facts. The many and varied ways in which the system can be undermined by police officers abusing their positions makes the examination of statistics a largely futile task. 
58The applicant relied on the fact that, because his conduct was being monitored, the offending conduct was intercepted before it could run its intended course. It is difficult to see why conscientious policing ought to ameliorate the criminality of underlying conduct. The applicant's moral culpability derived from what he did, what he planned to do and what he intended to do. He misused the COPS system with intent to commit larceny. That he was thwarted by diligent policing does not operate in his favour on sentencing.
59The Agreed Facts indicated the extent to which the applicant was the mastermind of the criminal conduct as well as the extent to which he used the knowledge of the system he had gained in the course of his duties as a police officer. For example, the Agreed Facts pertaining to the first count record that as they were fleeing from the scene at speed in a van, the applicant told one of his co-offenders to destroy the registration plates of the van. The Agreed Facts relating to the second count recorded that one of the co-offenders used a scanner to monitor live police frequency and was keeping in contact with the applicant (who was approaching AH's home to seize cash) by two-way radio. When the applicant was inside AH's premises he used plastic disposable gloves, presumably to avoid leaving fingerprints by which he could be identified. 
60The Agreed Facts relating to Count 4, including the following example, demonstrated the extent to which the applicant abused his position as a police officer and the access it gave him to sensitive information.""4.  Briefings were held with representatives of each Local Area Command (LACC) that were to take responsibility for the execution of these warrants within their LAC.  Each LAC was also supplied with a CD package that outlined the allegation and evidence against each individual.  In mid to late September 2004 [the applicant] was given responsibility for the coordination of the Burwood LAC search warrants by his then Commander, Superintendent Stuart Smith.  He commenced his duties in relation to Auxin [the code name of the investigation into the downloading and possession of child pornographic images] on 20 September 2004.""
61The applicant's offending conduct, as a whole, involved an abuse of his position as a police officer. It tended to corrupt the system. It was designed to avoid his detection and thwart investigation of his crimes and those committed by others from whom he had extorted money. Such crimes are serious because they strike at the core of our system of justice which is dependent in large measure on honest and honourable policing. 
62The authorities are redolent with reference to the importance of custodial sentences of sufficient length being imposed for such offences, not merely to punish the offender but also to restore and maintain the morale of honest police officers and the community at large.  The following passages from previous decisions of this Court are apposite to the present case. 
63In R v Hilder (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 13 May 1993, unrep), Wood J said (Handley JA and Sully J agreeing):""Shortly stated, this is a case involving seriously corrupt conduct by a police officer in the performance of his duties. That kind of conduct must attract a significant custodial sentence, because it amounts to a breach of trust and authority and is such as to harm the reputation and morale of honest police officers.""

64In R v Irwin [1999] NSWCCA 361 (a Crown appeal against sentence), Newman J said of such offences, including giving false evidence to the relevant commission:""In the instant case, while there were matters raised in mitigation, the objective circumstances of the crime in the first count were such that, in my view, it places this matter squarely in the category of the worst type of case, see Ibbs v The Queen (1991) 163 CLR 47.  Not only was the intention of the respondent to obviate the risk of a drug dealer being brought to justice, but also his conduct involved the corruption of one other senior policeman and the attempted corruption of another.  Furthermore it was a crime committed by a person holding high rank within the police force, that of detective sergeant. ...In my view, these factors combine to put it within that category""
65His Honour continued at [50]:""As far as the crime of giving false evidence before the Royal Commission is concerned, again it is a matter which strikes squarely at the heart of our system of justice.  In my view his Honour should have, even having regard to principles of totality, imposed a cumulative sentence in respect of that other charge.  If in sentencing a serious crime, such as giving false evidence in such a situation, is to be treated in the normal course of events as being one which should be dealt with by concurrent sentencing, the effect is that the person is not punished at all for such an offence.  There must be a sanction, in my view, to bring home to people that when they are giving evidence, either before courts or before Royal Commissions, or before any other form of formal enquiry of this type, the truth must be paramount.
66I do not consider the sentence imposed on the applicant to be excessive. In my view it appropriately reflects the criminality of the offending conduct. Although there was some accumulation, there was also a substantial degree of implicit concurrence, having regard to the length of the indicative sentences compared with the aggregate sentence. The objective seriousness of the offences was, as referred to above, high. The discount for the plea was taken into account. The finding of special circumstances was favourable to the applicant. In these circumstances there is, in my view, no basis on which to interfere with the sentence imposed.
67The sixth ground has not been made out.
68I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal dismissed.**********

2764896,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2014] NSWSC 1346,"Judgment

1By summons filed on 22 August 2014, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, a proceeds of crime authority under s 338 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), sought restraining orders under s 19 of the Act in relation to some $AUD411,760 in cash seized by Australian Federal Police (AFP) in April 2013. Orders under s 38 that the money be taken into the custody of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy were also sought, as well as examination orders under s 180. 

2There are two interested parties to the application, Mr Liang Chen and Mr Geoffrey Wang (or Yue).

3The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 21 August 2014 by Glyn Roberts, a member of the Australian Federal Police (""AFP"") an authorised officer under the Act; an affidavit sworn by Trenton Schmidt, another AFP member on 19 September; and by an affidavit sworn on 19 September 2014 by Caitlin Telfer, a litigation assistant in the employ of the AFP.

4For the following reasons, I make the orders sought on 23 September 2014.

5Section 26 of the Act deals with the notice which must be given of applications such as this. The evidence established that necessary notice had been given.

6Ms Telfer deposed to service of the application on Mr Chen, who is detained in remand in Melbourne and attempted service on Mr Wang at an address in Sydney, at another in Shanghai and on his former solicitor, Ms Chen. 

7Mr Schmidt's affidavit explained enquiries made to locate Mr Wang, who had left Australia for China in 2013 and had not returned. Ms Telfer deposed to advice later received from Ms Chen that she had spoken to Mr Wang who was in China and who had advised her that he had received documents from the police in Australia. She did not think that he had a visa permitting him to return to Australia, but she had not received instructions to appear on his behalf.

8This Court is a court with ""proceeds jurisdiction"" to make the order sought under s 19 of the Act, the alleged offences having occurred in this State and the property the subject of the orders being located here (see s 335). Section 19 requires the making of restraining and other orders, upon satisfaction that an authorised officer who provides an affidavit supporting the application holds subsections of the kind specified on reasonable grounds. 

9In support of this application Mr Roberts deposed as to his suspicions that the cash the subject of the application was the proceeds of an indictable and/or serious offence, namely money with a value exceeding $AUD100,000, reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime, an offence under s 400.9(1) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code (Cth).

10Mr Roberts deposed that his suspicions rested on information provided by Federal Agent McIntyre, the criminal case officer in the matter. Mr Chen, who has resided in Australia since 2007 was suspected of being involved in an organised crime syndicate as a money remitter. The syndicate's methodology was for third parties to remit small amounts of money on his instructions, in order to evade the attention of authorities. He is known to associate with a suspected drug dealer, Mr Ng, and has been charged with money laundering and drug trafficking offences. Forfeiture orders in respect of some $1,603,806 were made against Mr Ng in June. Mr Chen's trial is scheduled to commence on 7 October 2014. 


11Mr Chen and Mr Ng became the subject of surveillance by a multi-agency task force into organised crime. Based on signed statements of a Mr Lee and a Mr Kim, Mr Roberts suspected that Mr Chen was observed in their company in September 2012 taking a bag into a money exchange and transfer business in Ashfield. Exchange records show that they each remitted money that day, totalling some $AUD200,000.

12In April 2013, Mr Chen was observed by Federal Agents, including Mr Roberts, entering a money remitter at Haymarket. He was found in possession of bags of money, some of which he said his friend Mr Wang had asked him to remit to China and that the rest belonged to him. When spoken to, Mr Wang confirmed one of the bags of money was his. Mr Chen was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and later bailed.

13Mr Chen is a shareholder in a mobile phone shop, but said that most of his income came from his parents. The cash the subject of this application was seized from him on 23 April 2013. Also found in his possession were six mobile phones, a driver's licence, credit card and Medicare card, in the name of Xia, as well as a driver's licence in his name and other items, including an address at Mountbatten, where a consignment addressed to Chen Ming of a precursor ephedrine had been intercepted by Customs officers the previous day. Further investigations outlined led Mr Roberts to hold the suspicion that the Xia licence, Medicare card and credit card are all counterfeit

14Mr Chen was in the company of four others in April 2013 when arrested. On further investigation they were shown each to have remitted large sums of money to China throughout 2013, including on the previous day. One had remitted some $AUD759,454 in 16 transactions and another $AUD176,575 in four transactions.

15Mr Wang was interviewed and made statements as to the source of the money, Mr Chen was found with, which he said belonged to him. Those sources included an unknown female at a hotel room at the Star Casino who had given him $180,000 in repayment of a debt owed to him someone in Melbourne named Simon.

16Mr Roberts deposed to a suspicion that Mr Wang had agreed to provide Mr Chen with an alibi, given their inconsistent accounts; the discrepancy between the amounts seized and Mr Wang's accounts and with their observed behaviour while under surveillance. Mr Chen was later arrested in Melbourne in June 2014, in possession of a further sum of cash of some $309,811.10, which he also claimed belonged to Mr Wang. He has also been charged in respect of that money.

17Mr Wang was later examined and made statements that he had operated an informal cash loaning business which generated income of some $10,000 per week on which he had never paid cash and that he had sent money to his parents in China through Mr Chen. 

18Mr Roberts considered the cash seized to be grossly disproportionate to the declared income of both Mr Chen and Mr Wang. There are no ATO records which explain a legitimate source of income for this cash.

19On the basis of Mr Robert's affidavit I was satisfied both that he holds the suspicions to which he deposed and that there were reasonable grounds for those suspicions to be held. In the result I was satisfied that the orders sought had to be made.

2764897,Stambolziovski v Nestorovic (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 292,"Judgment

1. INTRODUCTION


	
	Blaga Stambolziovski (""Mrs Stambolziovski"") slipped and fell in an external laundry connected to her place of residence, ""number 47"", rented by her son. She fractured her right femur. She attributes the fall to water leaking from an adjacent toilet. This is contested by the defendants, the owner, Lilly Nestorovic, and the real estate agent, Camanaro Prestige Properties Pty Limited, who allege that she fell while she was mopping the laundry floor.
	


2. THE FACTUAL CONTEST


	
	The slip, fall and injury to Mrs Stambolziovski are not in issue. The centre of the dispute is whether the injury occurred in circumstances suggesting negligence. Since Mrs Stambolziovski was alone in the laundry at the moment of the fall, she is the primary witness of how it occurred. Her credit including her subsequent conversations and to a lesser extent conversations of her family members are crucial in determining whether she has discharged the onus of proof resting upon her.
	


A. Mrs Stambolziovski's account


	
	Mrs Stambolziovski testified that she came to use the external toilet, which she had never before used, because she was embarrassed to use one of the two internal toilets in the house whilst a Telstra technician was present in the house installing a new phone line.
	
	
	She exited the house through the rear door, descended two steps and turned 90 degrees to the left to enter a laundry room with the intention of turning a further 90 degrees to the left to enter the adjacent toilet. As she took the first step into the laundry she simultaneously noticed water on the floor, and slipped and fell. Her left leg struck a small step at the entry to the adjacent toilet. Her head was in that room, she said, and she noticed and touched a little bit of water around the toilet. She felt that her right leg was broken. She called for help.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter, the Telstra technician came to her assistance, an ambulance was called and she was transported to hospital where she was treated and commenced recovery, first at St George Hospital and subsequently Calvary Hospital.
	


B. Challenges to this account


	
	Ms Nestorovic, the owner, challenged this account on a number of bases.
	


(i) Mrs Stambolziovski's address


	
	In evidence-in-chief Mrs Stambolziovski said that she was living at number 47 in ""August 2009"" but she agreed that she did ""attend"" the property on 27 August 2009 because her son, Sasha Stambolziovski, had asked her to be present when a Telstra technician arrived. She did not engage in paid employment at that time or in the previous years.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mrs Stambolziovski was again asked whether she was living at number 47 in August 2009 and answered, ""I'm not sure. We might have, we might have not.""
	
	
	When asked about where she was living at the date of the accident, 27 August 2009, she said, ""We were at home 78 Margate. That was the week when we moved, I'm not sure.""
	
	
	When pressed on this matter she said, ""I think we lived at 47"" and that before the accident she was living at number 47 ""Two or three weeks or more.""
	
	
	Her daughter, Vera Stambolziovski, subsequently testified that Vera, Mrs Stambolziovski's husband, Simon Stambolziovski, and Mrs Stambolziovski moved to number 47 ""roughly around a couple of weeks or so before the incident.""
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski was asked about when he and his wife moved to number 47 and he answered:
	


""A. INTERPRETER: After about two weeks. What do you mean?

Q. When did you move into 47--

A. INTERPRETER: Two weeks. Before or after? Two weeks before the accident.""


	
	The hospital records state that the address of Mrs Stambolziovski was number 47.
	
	
	Mrs Stambolziovski's initial account of attending the premises on the date of the accident is reflected in a report of an expert she retained, Neil Adams, who was advised that she ""attended"" at the house of ""her son - who resided in the house as a tenant"". Mr Adams' instructions were that Mrs Stambolziovski ""was not a resident at the house"" although ""she had visited the premises on a number of previous occasions"".
	
	
	This account of visiting her son's house is also reflected in the reports of the medico-legal experts retained by the plaintiff, Dr Raymond Wallace and Gerard Glancey, and in the report of Dr Roger Rowe, retained by the owner. Mrs Stambolziovski did not recall her answer to the experts although given the passage of time that might be expected.
	
	
	The statement of claim somewhat equivocally alleged that Mrs Stambolziovski was ""lawfully upon the premises having been granted permission by the tenant"".
	
	
	Whether Mrs Stambolziovski was living at number 47 at the time of the incident is a matter that is relevant to negligence. It may reflect upon her familiarity with the premises and with the outside laundry in particular. Her account during evidence-in-chief is not clear, but before then her account appears to have been that on 27 August 2009 she was a visitor to the premises. Her evidence in cross-examination and subsequent evidence in the trial from her family support her being an occupant of number 47 on 27 August 2009.
	
	
	I do not view these apparently conflicting accounts as crucial but they do not serve to strengthen her credit.
	


(ii) Reason for use of the external toilet


	
	Mrs Stambolziovski gave evidence that she went to the outside toilet, not one of the two toilets inside the house, because of the presence of the Telstra technician, Jimmy Stojanovski. The Telstra technician was said to have been in the lounge room close to the back door and behind her when she stepped outside.
	
	
	The Telstra technician gave evidence that he saw Mrs Stambolziovski, ""She was just standing around tidying up … Tidying up - probably dusting and that. Cleaning up."" After he completed working with the sockets he left for 15 to 30 minutes and journeyed down the street to locate the pillar ""to find the signal and hook up the phone line"".
	
	
	When he returned to the house he heard screaming in the back, ""opened the back door"", saw Mrs Stambolziovski lying there in the laundry and called an ambulance. The plaintiff did not cross-examine him about his evidence that the plaintiff was lying in the laundry rather than largely or partially in the toilet room. Neither party asked the Telstra technician about the condition of the floor at the time he found Mrs Stambolziovski.
	
	
	The owner submitted that the account of Mrs Stambolziovski should not be accepted, as the Telstra technician was absent and therefore could not have been the cause of any embarrassment. The evidence of the Telstra technician does not support Mrs Stambolziovski either in the precise location of her fall or in respect of his presence at the time she ventured outside.
	
	
	I do not regard the testimony of Mr Stojanovski as of great weight. Mrs Stambolziovski's motivations for using the outside toilet do not seem to me to be so memorable that they would remain clear in her mind years after the event, and the Telstra technician's observations of her location after the fall might also be inaccurate after the lapse of time. Those observations were not clarified by further questions of either party. The failure by either party to ask questions of the Telstra technician about the condition of the floor surrounding Mrs Stambolziovski leads to the conclusion that his evidence on that matter could not help either party.
	


(iii) The hospital records


	
	One serious challenge to the credit of Mrs Stambolziovski concerned her activities at the time of the incident as stated in the hospital records. Although she attributes the slip to water on the floor as she entered the laundry, the contemporaneous hospital records contain the following entries:
	


""27/8/09 ... States she slipped on the bathroom floor (which she was cleaning) onto [right] hip.""

""27.8.09 [3.25pm] ... Family assisting, ie translation.""

""28/8/09 ... Cleaning bathroom + slipped on wet tiles.""

""Slipped while cleaning bathroom ... 29/8/9.""


	
	The three references to slipping whilst cleaning the bathroom are each in different handwriting.
	
	
	To describe the cause of the injury the hospital records also used the code ""U731"" which applies to an ""injury ... occurring whilst engaged in other types of work"" and which embraces ""domestic duties such as ... cleaning"". It is distinguishable from code U732 that covers ""engaging in other vital activities [such as] personal hygiene"".
	
	
	Mrs Stambolziovski initially denied being interviewed by doctors at the hospital and subsequently denied any recollection of such an interview. She attributed this to the head injury she suffered and semiconsciousness due to a painkilling injection. When asked about the ""slipped whilst cleaning"" records, she said, ""I don't think I said that, and nobody had asked me that"", ""I did not say anything to anyone, I don't remember. I slipped from the water that had leaked from the toilet, I was not cleaning"" and ""Nobody asked me about the accident.""
	
	
	The hospital records (and the ambulance records) did not support the claim of diminished consciousness. Those records make several references to her being ""alert and orientated"". A Glasgow Coma Score was at the maximum score for consciousness. I was not persuaded that at any time her consciousness was so affected as to cause her incorrectly to describe what had occurred.
	
	
	The claim by Mrs Stambolziovski to a head injury was also problematic. The hospital records state that she ""Did not hit head/lose consciousness"". There is no reference to any head injury in the ambulance or hospital records. Mrs Stambolziovski did not recount any head injury when initially describing her fall in giving her evidence. Later she said her head came to rest ""next to the wall"" and later again in-chief the following leading question and exchange occurred:
	


""Q. Anywhere else? You, in the accident bumped your head, I think you said, on the wall; is that right?

A. INTERPRETER: I hit my head against the wall and I landed next to the wall, close to the wall, sorry, and I also landed on my left side - the left side of my body.

Q. Did you have any problems with the left side of your body after the accident?

A. INTERPRETER: I had a bit of bruising but it went away.

Q. But your head, did you have any ongoing problems with your head after the accident?

A. INTERPRETER: I hit my head because I went too close to the wall but because if regularly take my painkillers I don't feel the pain.""


	
	Mrs Stambolziovski marked where her head hit the wall when she fell. Given her direction of movement at the time she first stepped into the laundry and her small size compared to the distance from the laundry door to the far wall of the toilet, it seemed unlikely that a slip where she alleged could result in her head contacting that far wall.
	
	
	I was not persuaded that her head came into contact with the wall. As I said, there was no record of any head contact or head injury, her evidence on the subject came after a leading (and it seems misleading) question, and the distance from the point of the slip to the wall seems too great.
	
	
	However, so far as liability is concerned I do not think the evidence about Mrs Stambolziovski hitting her head is of great significance. There is no dispute that Mrs Stambolziovski was significantly injured in the fall. Hitting her head was part of an explanation she gave for the hospital records indicating that she fell whilst cleaning and is only significant to the extent that it contributed to any reduced consciousness. But Mrs Stambolziovski attributed being ""semi-conscious"" to a painkilling injection and ""a mask"", not to any head injury.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the physical injuries or medical treatment caused the references to ""cleaning"" in the hospital records.
	
	
	The Court should be cautious about inconsistencies between oral testimony and hospital records: see Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227 at [2]. This need for caution is particularly apposite in the case of a witness, who, like Mrs Stambolziovski, has a limited understanding of English, even if, as was the case with Mrs Stambolziovski, she had the assistance of her family to translate. Also, the later references to ""cleaning"", although written by a different hand, may have been influenced by the earlier records.
	
	
	On the other hand, this was not a case of a difference because of ""florid expression and exaggeration"" (see Mason at [4]) but rather the more prosaic matter of the activity engaged in by Mrs Stambolziovski at the time of the fall.
	
	
	In my view, the hospital records were evidence of a possible alternative sequence of events. They had the advantage of being contemporaneous but the disadvantage indicated in Mason. They were part of the evidence that needed to be weighed in the balance.
	


(iv) Other witnesses of the circumstances of the fall


	
	The Telstra technician was the first person on the scene of the incident. As I said, he gave no description of the floor or matters that may have been probative of the reason for the presence of Mrs Stambolziovski in the laundry. The Telstra technician said that Mrs Stambolziovski was cleaning up when he arrived but this says little if anything about whether Mrs Stambolziovski was cleaning the external laundry some time later. The ambulance records referred to ""slipped on wet tiles"" which is, in the circumstances of this dispute, equivocal.
	


(v) The plaintiff's evidence of mopping with a dry rag


	
	Mrs Stambolziovski gave evidence that she, her husband and her daughter mopped the floors but she used a dry rag rather than a mop. She denied that she mopped the external laundry with a dry rag or otherwise. In view of the language challenges of Mrs Stambolziovski, I do not think this evidence assists the defendants to any material extent.
	


(vi) The approach to the agent after the accident


	
	Mrs Stambolziovski gave evidence that she went to the agent, the second defendant, to obtain a letter confirming that the toilet leaked. She said, ""the solicitor was asking for"" the letter. She said her visit occurred in the beginning of 2010 after she had recovered. Carmelo (""Charlie"") Dimarti, the relevant representative of the agent, refused to provide that letter. Mrs Stambolziovski stated, ""he [apparently Mr Dimarti] said to me - but I remember clearly because Sasha [her son] had told me on two or three occasions that there was a leakage from the toilet.""
	
	
	The meaning of this answer was unclear as to whether Mrs Stambolziovski was recounting the words of Mr Dimarti or was providing her recollection of what her son, Sasha, said to her.
	
	
	The preferred construction of her testimony is, in my view, that Mr Dimarti was conceding to her that Sasha had told him two or three times that there was ""leakage from the toilet"" at the time that he, Mr Dimarti, (without explanation) refused to provide a letter. This apparently occurred at a time when the toilet had not been repaired. Mrs Stambolziovski gave clear evidence to this effect later in her evidence, suggesting that the construction I have given of the earlier answer was her intended meaning.
	
	
	Mrs Stambolziovski also gave evidence that her visit was preceded by a visit by her son, Mr Sasha Stambolziovski, to the agent also requesting the letter.
	
	
	The conversation between Mrs Stambolziovski and Mr Dimarti was corroborated by the daughter-in-law of Mrs Stambolziovski, Gordana Stambolziovski, who said she was present when the conversation occurred. She understood ""Sasha's lawyer was requesting a letter about the leakage of the toilet."" She stated:
	


""We obviously spoke to Charlie [Dimarti] in regards to the letter, and Charlie obviously said to me that he was aware of Sasha's complaints about the - obviously the leakage of the toilet on many occasions and Charlie said to me that he had forgotten to lodge or record that particular issue for the leakage of the toilet.""


	
	Thus, both Mrs Gordana Stambolziovski and the plaintiff gave evidence that they attended the agent's office, both said it was because of ""the solicitor"" or ""Sasha's lawyer"" requesting a letter about this leakage of the toilet, and the plaintiff said it occurred at the beginning of 2010. Mrs Gordana Stambolziovski did not give a date for this event.
	
	
	Mr Sasha Stambolziovski's evidence indicated that the visits to the agent occurred in late 2009 or early 2010 ""about three or four months"" after the fall. Mr Sasha Stambolziovski said that his mother, the plaintiff, asked him to visit the agent. He also referred to a letter from the solicitors ""asking me to go to the real estate agent and get the letter.""
	
	
	The owner sought production of the solicitor's letter. Initially Mrs Stambolziovski and her solicitor said there was nothing to produce. Subsequently a letter dated 11 April 2011 was produced. The solicitors were not retained until mid-2010. The letter produced did not contain a request to visit the agent or obtain a letter from it. In those circumstances, I cannot conclude that the visit to the agent was a consequence of the solicitor's advice, either by letter or otherwise.
	
	
	Mrs Stambolziovski's evidence in this regard was in error. Even if both Mrs Stambolziovski and Mr Sasha Stambolziovski (leaving aside the evidence of a similar date by the defendants' witnesses) were hopelessly wrong as to the date of the visit to the agent, still there is no letter that advises the plaintiff to visit the agent to obtain a letter or evidence confirming the leaking toilet.
	
	
	Mrs Stambolziovski by her counsel ultimately submitted that the visits to the agent were later in time, in these terms:
	


""Further if the purpose of the visit to the real estate agent was to seek a letter from the agent to evidence the fact that complaints had been made that the toilet be repaired then this would make a December 2009 request nonsensical. If the agent refused to provide the letter (as the defendants say they did), given that the toilet was not repaired on the plaintiff's case probably until about January 2010 or later, there were 2 simple solutions for the plaintiff at that point. Firstly she could have invited the agent around to inspect the still leaking toilet. Secondly given that the agent refused to provide the relevant letter at that point the plaintiff could have to obtain the relevant evidence (that apparently being on her mind at the time of the request) have taken photographs of the leak or video evidence of the leak and had it formally documented at that point.

That fact that none of these steps were taken strongly suggests that the suggested date that the requests were made for the letter in about December 2009 cannot be right.""


	
	Mrs Stambolziovski went on to submit that the visit to the agent was ""most probably sometime after April 2011"". Of course this submission has validity only so long as Mrs Stambolziovski's account is accepted. It has no validity if there was no leaking toilet since Mrs Stambolziovski in those circumstances could not have invited the agent around to inspect the ""still leaking toilet"" or ""taken photographs of the leak"".
	
	
	If that were the position - that there was no leaking toilet - then Mrs Stambolziovski was seeking a letter because there was no alternative method of proof of the leaking toilet. In view of the consistent evidence of Mrs Stambolziovski, Mr Sasha Stambolziovski, Mr Dimarti and Mrs Margherita Dimarti that the visits to the agent occurred in around late 2009 or early 2010, I am not persuaded that I should find that the request for a letter from the agent was prompted by advice or a request from solicitors.
	
	
	This circumstance weakens the plaintiff's account of her visit to the agent and indicates I should be more cautious about accepting her evidence of what the agent said and his alleged admissions.
	
	
	I found Mrs Gordana Stambolziovski's evidence to be of little value. She was unable to recount when the conversation occurred or what was said with any particularity, and she repeatedly used the term ""obviously"" which suggests that her evidence was based on reconstruction or conclusion from other material rather than her recollection of what occurred.
	
	
	Natalie Dimarti, the daughter of Mr Dimarti, gave evidence that while she worked at the family's real estate business Mr Sasha Stambolziovski came to the office to ask for a letter but she did not hear that conversation. She said that a few days later Mrs Stambolziovski came to the agent's office with her husband, Mr Simon Stambolziovski. They had brought a box of beer and asked Mr Dimarti about the letter. Ms Natalie Dimarti heard Mr Dimarti say, ""It's illegal and I'll go to gaol.""
	
	
	On two further occasions within a couple of weeks of Mr Sasha Stambolziovski's visit, according to Ms Natalie Dimarti, Mrs Stambolziovski came to the office and asked Ms Natalie Dimarti, ""Is the letter ready?"" to which Ms Natalie Dimarti responded, ""There isn't a letter"" or similar words. Mr Dimarti did not put these later conversations to the plaintiff in cross-examination, although, as Mr Dimarti acted for the second defendant and has no legal qualifications, the significance of that matter may be limited.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Natalie Dimarti accepted that the occasion when the case of beer was provided was in December 2009 or December 2008. She kept no notes of these occasions when the letter was requested.
	
	
	Mr Dimarti gave evidence that he and Mr Sasha Stambolziovski had known each other for a long time. Mr Sasha Stambolziovski came into the office three or four months after the accident. Mr Dimarti's evidence on this matter was as follows:
	


""And all Sasha asked me, he said to me, 'Brother, I wanted to ask you for some help', and I said, 'Yes, what kind of help?' He said, 'My mum had an accident at the house, as you know, we need you to make a letter to say that - that there was a leakage in the toilet, that the accident happened. Will - you know, it cost you nothing to do that for us.' And I said, 'No, I'm sorry. I can't do that.'""


	
	Further, Mr Dimarti recounted:
	


""Sasha asked me you got nothing to lose and I said, 'No, look, I cannot do it.

…

I cannot do it because [it] was not legal [to do] it and I'm also Justice of the Peace' and I said 'I don't lie. I can't do things. I can't do fake letters. I cannot provide you with some evidence which I'm not entitled to. I mean, at the end of the day, this is something that doesn't exist.'""


	
	Mr Dimarti further said:
	


""Well, I didn't feel it was legal because I knew there have never been any leakage in the toilet. I knew has never been any water leakage…has never been any leakage, has never been any report of a leakage, has never been any water, so why should I go and lie to a letter to say, yeah, take a letter but Sasha said to me, 'It cost you nothing, brother. There' s nothing - nothing to do with you. It doesn't cost you anything. All you got to do is got to do the letter to us.'""


	
	According to Mr Dimarti, about a week later Mrs Stambolziovski came to the office and said:
	


""'Sasha told me you got a letter ready for me.' I said, 'What letter are you talking about?' She said, 'I don't know. Sasha told me to ask you for a letter.' I said, 'I don't have any letter for you, I'm sorry.'""


	
	Mr Dimarti then recounted subsequently how Mr Simon Stambolziovski and the plaintiff came to the office with a box of beer. He testified:
	


""They come along. They sit down. They brought me the beer. I said, 'Thank you very much.' Then we start to talk. Then Simon said to me, 'Mr Charlie' because they called me Mr Charlie. I said, 'Don't need to call me Mr Charlie.' 'Mr Charlie, do you like our family?' and I said, 'Of course.' 'Why don't you do the letter [that] my wife ask you. Sasha ask you. Why don't you do this letter for us?' But I said, 'But I can't, Simon. That's something illegal. You asking me to do something illegal. Why should I do it for you? I'm not - I'm not in a position to do any letter for anybody,' I said, 'Because that is not exactly what happened. If you ask me to do a letter to tell you what happened, I can do you a letter, but you asking me to say something that didn't happen.' …That's exactly my words. So anyhow, he got cranky with me, the both of them they walk out.""


	
	Mr Dimarti denied that Mrs Gordana Stambolziovski ever came to the office and asked for a letter. He denied that the box of beer was provided because Mr Dimarti had helped Mr Simon Stambolziovski to obtain a job. It was put that Mr Sasha Stambolziovski asked Mr Dimarti ""for a letter for his solicitor."" And that ""you were aware that there was a leak in the toilet at the rental property"". Mr Dimarti responded, ""Do you have a letter with you, he says that?""
	
	
	Mrs Dimarti gave the following evidence:
	


""A. I was on the reception desk. Charlie walked towards the front desk, because he normally sits at the rear of the office. Sasha met him at the desk and said small talk, how are you, everything like that. Then he said, 'Can you help me with a letter, stating that we reported that the toilet was leaking but the owner didn't fix it? That way my mother can do a compo'.

Q. What did you hear Charlie say in response?

A. He said, 'Oh, no, I can't do that because you never reported a leaking, sorry, toilet.'

Q. What did Sasha do after that?

A. He continued to talk to Charlie for a couple more minutes. Then after a while he got angry and left.

Q. After that incident, did Mrs Blaga Stambolziovski come into the office?

A. Yes, about a week later.

Q. What happened when she came into the office?

A. She said, 'Sasha sent me to pick up the letter.' I was at the reception desk. She said to me, 'Sasha sent me to pick up the letter,' and I said, 'What letter?' She goes, 'Oh, the letter about the leaking toilet,' and I said, 'No, we're not doing any letter because you never reported a leaking toilet.'""


	
	Mrs Dimarti also gave evidence of a subsequent occasion when Mrs Stambolziovski came to the office and spoke to her and Mr Dimarti:
	


""She sort of addressed both of us, yes, and she said, 'Well, why didn't you give us the letter?' And Charlie got up and walked towards the front counter and he said, 'You know, you've got to be careful why - what do you want this letter for?' And she said, 'Oh, it's not my idea. It's Sasha's', something like that.""


	
	Mrs Dimarti also denies that Mrs Gordana Stambolziovski was ever present in these conversations.
	
	
	There were difficulties with both sets of witnesses in respect of these conversations. Mrs Stambolziovski submitted that there was no reason for her to return as the request for the letter had been strongly refused by Mr Dimarti. That may point to a milder rebuff by Mr Dimarti than he gave in evidence, but I do not think it is of any real assistance in resolving the competing evidence.
	
	
	Mr Dimarti's evidence was unsatisfactory in some respects. He gave evidence about not having a camera although he admitted that there was one on his iPhone. His explanation was that he did not know how to use it.
	
	
	He gave evidence of producing the initial condition report to the Court. It was accepted that he did not. He was suspended for a period from being a director of the real estate company, the second defendant, because of the late banking of a trust account cheque, and it was submitted that he was less than frank in disclosing this. But when he was directly asked about it he did disclose it. Whether, as the plaintiff asserts, this was the reason he was not a director was not satisfactorily established, as there was no evidence to the effect that he was a director at the time of the suspension.
	
	
	Mr Dimarti was not a careful witness. He often failed to focus on the meaning of the question and was inclined on occasion to voice his reaction to a question rather than to answer it, such as when he was asked about whether he had talked to his wife and daughter about the case. His response was:
	


""A. This case is boring, Mr Daley, what's there to talk? This is a boring case. Extremely boring and fake. Two words to describe, boring and fake.

Q. You've talked to your wife and daughter about it?

A. I've talked about boring and I talk about fake. Two answers. No more than that. There's nothing to talk about it. It's boring.

Q. But your daughter and wife know what you allege occurred with Sasha and with the plaintiff and her husband, don't they?

A. Because they were present.

Q. I'm suggesting to you because you've talked about it?

A. No, no, because they were present.

Q. So you say you haven't talked to them about it at all?

A. No need to, boring.""


	
	Mrs Dimarti was also challenged in respect of her evidence that she did an initial inspection. As the expected record of this inspection is not available, her account is weakened. However, Mr Sasha Stambolziovski did sign an acknowledgement of receiving a condition report at the time of receiving the lease, and it was not disputed that a practice of carrying out an initial inspection existed. Thus, the absence of the document could have been because no inspection occurred, or no record of the inspection was made, or that the record has been lost. I was not inclined to find that no inspection had occurred but, similarly, was not inclined to find that the inspection had verified that no leaking occurred when the toilet was flushed, as Mrs Dimarti had testified. However, this matter, in my view, said little about the honesty of Mrs Dimarti's answers whilst giving her evidence.
	
	
	It was not disputed that Mr Simon Stambolziovski came into the office bearing a box of beer in December 2009. It seems to me to be unlikely that this was a present for Mr Dimarti for finding him some work in 2008, as Mr Simon Stambolziovski asserted, especially when the accident had occurred in August 2009 and Mr Dimarti was the person who was said to have failed to act on complaints and effect repairs to the leaking toilet so as to cause a serious injury to Mrs Stambolziovski. The connection between the box of beer being provided and the request for a letter concerning the leaking toilet, which also occurred in about December 2009, (and on the defendants' evidence at the same meeting), seems more likely.
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski's denials of requesting a letter at the time of the gift of the box of beer were also weakened because of one aspect of his demeanour. I raised with counsel the observation that Mr Simon Stambolziovski did not look at Mr Dimarti when Mr Dimarti in person put to him questions about Mr Simon Stambolziovski requesting a dishonest letter. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that this was a result of a hearing problem Mr Simon Stambolziovski has and the involvement of the interpreter. That explanation has some force in respect of Mr Simon Stambolziovski's behaviour during the questions of Mr Dimarti but less force when he was giving his denials. However, I am not inclined to put much weight on Mr Simon Stambolziovski's demeanour because looking a person in the eye to rebut a false allegation may be in part a factor of one's personality, and the difficulty of assessing demeanour is magnified by the involvement of an interpreter.
	
	
	One other matter in favour of the second defendant's account as to the request for the letter is that the detail of the conversation provided by Mr Dimarti was greater than that provided by the plaintiff or Mr Sasha Stambolziovski. I also think that the admissions attributed to Mr Dimarti and denied by him are unlikely to be made in circumstances where he is refusing to provide a letter.
	


(vii) Evidence of complaints about the leak


	
	Mr Sasha Stambolziovski gave evidence that ""When I went sometimes to pay the rent I told Mr Charlie [Dimarti] that there's a leak in the loo."" Curiously, subsequently, Mr Sasha Stambolziovski was asked about when he came in to see Mr Dimarti relative to when the accident occurred and he said, ""No, I can't ask you to fix the toilet before the accident."" In any event, according to Mr Sasha Stambolziovski, Mr Dimarti responded to his comment about there being a leak in the loo by saying, ""[T]he owner's son lives at the backyard, don't tell me, tell him,"" to which Mr Sasha Stambolziovski said, ""I've got nothing to do with the owner's son, you're the - I pay the rent here, and you're the one that I have to tell.""
	
	
	When asked how long after he had noticed the leak had this conversation occurred, Mr Sasha Stambolziovski said, ""I don't know. I don't know, four, five weeks."" Mr Sasha Stambolziovski said that on two or three further occasions, ""every single time I used to go there to pay the rent"" he would say to Mr Dimarti, ""What's happening with the leak?"" Mr Dimarti would say, ""Don't worry about it. It'll get fixed.""
	
	
	Mr Sasha Stambolziovski did not mention speaking to either Mr Mladen (""Mick"") or Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic about the leak.
	
	
	After the accident Mr Sasha Stambolziovski had no further dealings with Mr Dimarti other than the request for the letter about three or four months after the fall, which was a day or a few days before the visit by Mrs Stambolziovski to Mr Dimarti described earlier. At no stage did Mr Sasha Stambolziovski close the door to the external laundry and toilet or do anything to prevent access.
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski gave evidence that when he visited the house whilst Mr Sasha Stambolziovski was living there but before he and the plaintiff had moved in, he would commonly see Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic and sometimes Mr Mick Nestorovic. He said that the first time he met Mr Mick Nestorovic he told him, ""There was some leakage."" This occurred ""approximately about a week before the case"" which I understood to mean a week before the accident. Mr Mick Nestorovic is alleged to have responded that he should talk to the agent.
	
	
	The only other conversation about the leaking toilet involving Mr Simon Stambolziovski, according to his account, was after the accident when he said to Mr Mick Nestorovic, ""I told him, you see what happened, it's because the toilet was not fixed"". Mr Simon Stambolziovski did not complain to the agent according to his account.
	
	
	Although Mr Simon Stambolziovski gave no evidence of complaints to Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic during evidence-in-chief, in cross-examination the following exchange occurred:
	


""Q. Mr Stambolziovski, you never told Alex Nestorovic that there was a leak in the toilet?

A. INTERPRETER: My son and Alex were sitting and drinking something, I came out of the toilet and I said to him 'There's a leakage in the toilet'. I was not referring to just one person, I was talking to both of them, and I said, 'There's a leakage'.""

Mr Simon Stambolziovski said this conversation occurred prior to him moving into the house.


	
	Each of Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic, Mr Mick Nestorovic and Mr Dimarti denied being the recipient of a complaint about the leaking toilet. Mrs Dimarti and Ms Natalie Dimarti were not asked about whether they received a complaint.
	
	
	The agent's account of these conversations seeking the letter finds some support in the account of Mr Mick Nestorovic of a similar request from Mr Simon Stambolziovski.
	
	
	Mr Mick Nestorovic prepared a statement for the owner's insurer, dated 28 December 2012. Paragraph 11 of that statement reads that about four or five months after the accident:
	


""[Simon] Stambolziovski asked me to do him a favour. He asked me if I could say that the injury to his wife was our fault and make a statement to that effect so that they could claim insurance for his wife's fall. I asked him wasn't that too late but he told me that they had three years. I refused to sign something that wasn't [true]. I told him that he should talk to the Real Estate Agent.""

(viii) The leaking toilet


	
	A matter relevant to the plaintiff's evidence and about the circumstances of the accident itself is the condition of and any repair to the toilet.
	
	
	Evidence of a leaking toilet also turned largely on oral evidence. The plaintiff's husband, Mr Simon Stambolziovski, and her son, Mr Sasha Stambolziovski, gave evidence that the toilet leaked.
	
	
	Mr Sasha Stambolziovski gave evidence that he noticed a leak from the external toilet about two or three weeks after he moved in. This equates to about May 2009. He also said that the leak occurred every time the toilet was flushed.
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski gave evidence that ""on occasions when I would visit my son, I would need to go to the toilet and I actually noticed that there was a - some water leaking.""
	
	
	The evidence of complaint to the agent is also relied on as evidence that the toilet leaked.
	
	
	The owner's father, Mr Mick Nestorovic, and her brother, Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic, gave evidence that the toilet did not leak and that no repairs were effected to it.
	
	
	Mr Mick Nestorovic lived on the premises with Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic until shortly before the lease to Mr Sasha Stambolziovski. Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic then moved into the granny flat. Mr Mick Nestorovic moved out but visited his son at the property once or twice a week, did maintenance work at the property on weekends and whenever he ""had the time"", and kept some tools in the external laundry.
	
	
	Both Messrs Aleksandar and Mick Nestorovic regularly used the external toilet. Thus, although the house on the premises was rented to Mr Sasha Stambolziovski, the granny flat was not. It remained occupied by Mr Aleksandar Nestorovic. The external laundry and toilet and perhaps the rear yard generally were utilised by both the Stambolziovskis and the Nestorovics. Indeed, they occasionally had drinks together on the back patio.
	
	
	There was no independent evidence of a leaking toilet. No photographs of the leak, no evidence from a repairer and no record of an inspection. Nor was there direct evidence that the water on the floor, on which Mrs Stambolziovski is said to have slipped, was occasioned by a toilet leak.
	
	
	Mr Sasha Stambolziovski and Mr Simon Stambolziovski said the toilet leaked after it was flushed. But there was no evidence that it was used or flushed on the morning of 27 August 2010, or even of the last time it was flushed, or of the length of time that water remained on the laundry floor after it was flushed. Although there was evidence that ""the men"" used the external toilet, there was no evidence that they did not use either of the internal toilets; and, thus, no evidence that the external toilet was used in the period shortly before the fall or evidence on which such an inference should be drawn. Mr Simon Stambolziovski said, ""I know that we were using the one outside and the one inside.""
	
	
	I am asked to infer that the water described by Mrs Stambolziovski was from the leaking toilet because the water was said to be present in both the toilet and the laundry.
	
	
	The plaintiff tendered a flush cone, a rubber seal joining the pipe from the cistern to the rear of the toilet pan. Mr Simon Stambolziovski said he collected this flush cone from the external laundry toilet area shortly after Mr Mick Nestorovic was said to have replaced it in about May or June of 2010, about nine months after the fall, according to Mr Sasha Stambolziovski, or, ""a while ... more than three or four months after the accident"" and, ""it could have been five or six months, I don't know exactly"" according to Mr Simon Stambolziovski.
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski said only he and the plaintiff were at home at the time the flush cone was replaced, whereas Mr Sasha Stambolziovski said that he had been in bed for three months at the time of the alleged repair. Mr Sasha Stambolziovski did not identify the dates when he was in bed for three months after an operation, other than that he had had his leg put in plaster for six months, and then in 2010 they put a plate in his leg. He gave evidence about the repair in these terms:
	


""I had an operation, I was lying down in bed for three months, I don't know what they were doing outside. Then after when they changed it, my dad came inside and said, 'here - here it is, it's changed, it's fixed.'""


	
	Thus, there is an inconsistency between Messrs Sasha and Simon Stambolziovski as to whether Sasha was present in the house at the time of the repair allegedly performed by Mr Mick Nestorovic.
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski testified that he observed Mr Mick Nestorovic change the flush cone and put it ""on the side"". Mr Simon Stambolziovski subsequently took the used flush cone, retained it in a drawer in his bedroom and told his wife, the plaintiff, of it. Yet the flush cone was not provided to the plaintiff's expert who visited the premises to inspect the toilet and laundry to prepare a report on how the accident occurred.
	
	
	As I said, the flush cone was tendered in evidence. There was no indication that the flush cone was defective or otherwise allowed the leak other than the oral evidence of Mr Simon Stambolziovski. No expert was called to give opinion evidence as to the integrity of the flush cone nor was the Court asked to inspect it or draw conclusions from its condition. If it was replaced by Mr Mick Nestorovic, that would be some evidence that it was defective. Again evidence of the replacement was the word of Mr Simon Stambolziovski against the word of Mr Mick Nestorovic, who denied he ever repaired the toilet or replaced the flush cone at number 47.
	
	
	Mr Mick Nestorovic gave evidence that he was a handyman who had done a lot of plumbing - residential plumbing - for about 30 years. He gave evidence that he often replaced flush cones, that they were readily and cheaply (about $6) available from Bunnings and other stores and that he could observe no defect in the flush cone.
	
	
	The evidence of Messrs Simon and Sasha Stambolziovski was to the effect that the flush cone was replaced after the conversations requesting a letter from the agent about the leaking toilet. The omission to gather evidence of the leaking toilet after the accident, whether by way of photographs or a plumber's report seems odd when evidence from the agent is being sought.
	
	
	Also, if Mr Mick Nestorovic knew of the existence of a request for evidence of a leaking toilet, it might lessen the likelihood that Mr Mick Nestorovic would repair the toilet, at least in the presence of Mr Simon Stambolziovski, and leave behind the used flush cone.
	
	
	Mr Simon Stambolziovski testified that he told Mr Mick Nestorovic apparently soon after the fall, ""You see what happened, it's because the toilet was not fixed."" If this occurred, the failure to have the toilet repaired for many months and the apparent lessening of (or absence of) complaints about the leaking toilet after the accident seem unlikely.
	
	
	As stated earlier, Mr Mick Nestorovic prepared a statement for the owner's insurer dated 28 December 2012. In that statement at paragraph 10 he records that shortly after the accident he was at the granny flat with his son and he saw Mr Simon Stambolziovski:
	


""I asked him how he was going and he said not very well. He then said, 'My Missus last week was mopping the floor in the external laundry when she slipped.'""


	
	The reference in the statement by Mr Mick Nestorovic to Mrs Stambolziovski slipping whilst mopping is of some significance. It is consistent with the contemporaneous hospital and ambulance records that, read together, suggest Mrs Stambolziovski slipped on wet tiles whilst cleaning. To me, that the hospital records and Mr Mick Nestorovic's recalled conversation could each independently record that event in error seems unlikely. It seems more likely that the independent record being consistent with Mr Mick Nestorovic's statement results from the statement and the hospital record being a correct account.
	
	
	Although a recollection of a conversation some years later would often be, at least to some degree, inaccurate, it was a conversation memorable in view of the conversation not long after where Mr Simon Stambolziovski sought from Mr Mick Nestorovic a letter stating facts contrary to the earlier conversation. This might be thought to have aided Mr Mick Nestorovic's memory of it. The plaintiff submitted that Mr Mick Nestorovic could have made up this conversation after reviewing the hospital records. That is theoretically possible, as Mr Mick Nestorovic appears to have received the medical records, some hundreds of pages, earlier in December 2012. But it does not seem likely. The hospital records do not mention ""mopping"" and the reference to ""slipped whilst cleaning"" in the records was not easily to be located especially by the untrained, such as a handyman like Mr Mick Nestorovic.
	
	
	Mr Mick Nestorovic was challenged as being an advocate for a particular position because of his desire to give evidence of the two conversations with Mr Simon Stambolziovski. I do not see this as a proper basis to criticise Mr Mick Nestorovic or his evidence. If the first conversation was accepted, it was strong evidence against the plaintiff. It would not seem unnatural for a witness, particularly one having a close familial connection with the owner of the premises who was being sued in the proceedings, to have a desire to give that evidence.
	
	
	Having heard his evidence, I accept Mr Mick Nestorovic as a witness of credit. He made concessions against his interests such as the danger of water on the floor. His account of these conversations in oral evidence was detailed and consistent with but not identical to the statements he had given to the insurer some two years earlier.
	
	
	Mr Mick Nestorovic's credit was also challenged on the basis that he had avoided service. I am not persuaded that this occurred. As he was not a party, none of the documents were required to have been served on him. The content of the affidavit of service did not establish that he had been served with documents. Even if he was served in late September 2012, he appeared in court in December 2012. The circumstances of that service and his evidence about it do not assist me in assessing his credit.
	
	
	I also note that the plaintiff has an obvious financial interest in the proceedings whereas the defendants both claim to have no interest in the outcome. Any financial interest of the owner is not obvious as she was covered by insurance. The real estate agent had no insurance but the business was conducted in the name of a company. Mr Dimarti dismissed the suggestion that a judgment against it would be costly as the company was a two-dollar company.
	
	
	Bearing all these matters in mind, I do not accept the submission as to the falsity of the defendants' evidence about the requests by the Stambolziovskis for letters about a leaking toilet. Were it necessary, I would be inclined to favour the defendants' account of those conversations. However, it is likely that the recollection of all the parties with respect to the detail of the conversations has been adversely affected by the lapse of time.
	
	
	If the toilet was leaking and the complaints were made, then the Stambolziovskis' account of the conversations in respect of the request for the letters is more persuasive. On the other hand, if the toilet was not leaking, not the subject of repair, and if no complaints were made, then the defendants' account must be accepted.
	
	
	Ultimately, I am not inclined to decide this claim principally on the basis of the disputed conversations occurring sometime after the event when there is little objective evidence in favour of either account.
	


3. CONCLUSION


	
	I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff slipped on water leaking from the toilet, as she alleges. The more likely cause of her fall was water on the floor as a result of her mopping the external laundry. The principal reasons for this conclusion are as follows.
	
	
	First, the hospital records are inconsistent with her account and provide a contemporaneous record by as many as three different persons that she told the hospital people that she slipped whilst cleaning. The reference in the hospital records to the ""bathroom"" rather than the ""laundry"" is of no significance given the presence of the toilet room (for which ""bathroom"" is an alternative term). Nor does the absence of the word ""mopping"" assist the plaintiff in circumstances where the hospital records, record the presence of wet tiles in connection with cleaning.
	
	
	Secondly, the plaintiff's account of her fall was weakened by her having initially reported to have been a visitor rather than a resident at the time of the fall. This evidence of a changing account could have been remedied by a statement of the plaintiff earlier than the dates of the expert reports, but no earlier account of the plaintiff was in evidence.
	
	
	Thirdly, there was an absence of independent evidence that the toilet leaked. On the plaintiff's account, for many months after the accident the toilet continued to leak. But there was no evidence other than the oral testimony of her family to support this. The absence of independent evidence that the toilet was repaired is to the same effect. There were no photographs of the leak or of the repairs, no evidence that the flush cone was defective or evidence from a plumber to that effect. To the contrary, the evidence of Mr Mick Nestorovic was that it was not.
	
	
	Fourthly, there was an absence of evidence of any real complaint about the leaking toilet after the accident, even when it remained unrepaired. Here the seriousness of the injury, if it was due to the leaking toilet, would be expected to have produced more serious, frequent, or recorded complaints.
	
	
	Fifthly, the statement of Mr Mick Nestorovic in December 2012 that he was told by Mr Simon Stambolziovski that the fall occurred while Mrs Stambolziovski was mopping. This is consistent with the hospital records, and, in my view, is likely to be independent of them since it refers to ""mopping"" and ""laundry,"" rather than ""cleaning"" and a ""bathroom"" and also because I was not persuaded that Mr Mick Nestorovic could realistically, or did, derive information from the hospital records to falsely invent this conversation.
	
	
	My assessment of Mr Mick Nestorovic's credit was based on the detail of his evidence about conversations, upon the manner of his testimony, and upon his apparent lack of a financial interest in the result of the proceedings. These matters strengthen my view that his evidence should be accepted.
	
	
	Sixthly, my view of Mr Mick Nestorovic fortifies my inclination to accept the evidence of the Dimartis rather than the Stambolziovskis as to the nature of the conversations requesting the letter about the leaking toilet. This is because Mr Mick Nestorovic received a similar request from Mr Simon Stambolziovski, and also because of the timing of the agreed provision of the box of beer.
	
	
	However, I am disinclined to put substantial weight on these oral conversations subsequent to the accident for the reasons earlier given.
	
	
	As a result of this conclusion, the plaintiff's claim for a breach of duty by the defendants failing to remedy the leaking toilet, and that this failure caused the plaintiff's injury, cannot be sustained, and the provisions of s 5B and s 5D of the Civil Liability Act 2002 cannot be satisfied.
	
	
	In view of this finding, there is no utility in me considering the defendants' alternative submission that there was no breach of duty, even on the plaintiff's evidence, or in me making an assessment of the plaintiff's damages.
	
	
	The second defendant, although a company, was either unrepresented or represented intermittently by Mr Dimarti. I decided in Everett v Neale [2012] NSWDC 73 at [147]-[150] on the authority of Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14; (1994) 179 CLR 403 that an unrepresented party is not entitled to costs associated with time spent preparing and defending their claim. Although the second defendant is a company, I think this rule should also apply to the second defendant to the extent that a qualified legal practitioner did not legally represent it.
	
	
	The orders of the Court, therefore, are:
	



	
	Judgment in favour of the defendants against the plaintiff.
	
	
	Plaintiff to pay the first defendant's costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	Plaintiff to pay the second defendant's costs of the proceedings, those costs not to include any compensation for time spent by Carmelo or Margherita Dimarti in preparing and defending this case.
	
	
	All cross-claims dismissed with no order as to costs.
	
	
	I defer entry of any order in respect of costs for 14 days and thereafter until further order in the event that any party seeks to argue that a different costs order should be made.

Midrange prescribed concentration of alcohol - convicted pursuant to s10A with no other penalty and disqualified from driving for 12 months.
Fail to stop and assist after impact causing injury - convicted pursuant to s10A with no other penalty and disqualified from driving for 18 months.
Drive while suspended - convicted pursuant to s10A with no other penalty and disqualified from driving for 2 years.
Wilfully alter concentration of alcohol - convicted pursuant to s10A with no other penalty and disqualified from driving for 18 months.
6The Crown has appealed pursuant to s5DB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the application of s10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 whereby the respondent was convicted of the four related summary offences without imposing any other penalty.  The Crown also relied upon s5DB(5)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which gives power to the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal in related summary offences.
7The appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in failing to determine the level of moral culpability of the respondent and/or the level of objective seriousness of the offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s52A(3)(c) Crimes Act 1900 thus leading to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in ordering that the sentence for the s52A(3)(c) offence be served by way of intensive correction order.
Ground 3:  the sentence imposed for the s52A(3)(c) offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm is manifestly inadequate.
Ground 4:  His Honour erred in giving the respondent's subjective case greater weight than was warranted such that it impermissibly ameliorated the sentence imposed.
Ground 5:  His Honour erred in failing to take into account the fact that the respondent was on bail at the time of the offences.Ground 6:  His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the mental illness and intellectual capacity of the respondent.
Ground 7:  His Honour erred in giving greater weight than was warranted to rehabilitation, thus diminishing the importance of punishment and denunciation.
Ground 8:  His Honour erred in disposing of the four related summary offences on the s166 certificate by convicting the respondent without imposing any other penalty pursuant to s10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
Ground 9:  His Honour erred in imposing sentences that are manifestly inadequate.
Factual Background
8On 26 March 2011 the respondent was helping his sister move house.  During the afternoon he was at a friend's house in Cedar Crescent in Leeton with other friends, Brent Hayes (the victim), Jasper Bush and Nicholas Tiffin.  The respondent was drinking alcohol.
9At about 6.30pm Brent Hayes drove a white Ford utility to the intersection of Cassia and Boronia Roads.  In the vehicle at the time were the respondent and David Gordon.  In the tray area of the utility were Jasper Bush and Nicholas Tiffin.  The group spent about 5 - 10 minutes in this area doing burnouts.  
10At approximately 6.50pm the respondent got into the driver's seat of the utility.  In the front seat of the vehicle were Nicholas Tiffin and David Gordon.  On the rear tray were Brent Hayes and Jasper Bush.  Gordon, Hayes and Bush were unsecured.
11The respondent drove the utility in a southerly direction towards Leeton.  The designated speed limit on Cassia Road was 60 kilometres per hour.  The designated speed into Leeton was 50 kph.  Cassia Road was a semi-rural, bitumen roadway situated on the northern outskirts of Leeton.  No centre line or fog lines were marked on the road.  The width of the road was 5 metres, widening to 7 metres at the relevant bend.
12While driving in the 60 kph area, the respondent reached speeds of 100 kph.  He was warned by Mr Gordon that he was travelling too fast and that there were tight bends in the road ahead.  Mr Gordon was holding onto the hand bar to steady himself as the respondent negotiated three bends in Cassia Road.  As he approached the vicinity of a left hand bend near Farm 244, he slowed to 90 kph.  It was at that time that Mr Tiffin also warned him to slow down. 
13The respondent told police that he was familiar with the road and that the intersection was a ""real sharp corner"".  The respondent told the police that during the process of negotiating the bend, his speed was 60 - 70 kph.  At this sharp bend in the road near Farm 244, the respondent's vehicle travelling in a southerly direction came into collision with and sideswiped a white van, driven by Mr Bell who was travelling in a northerly direction.
14Mr Bell travelled on this roadway on an almost daily basis during the course of his employment and regarded the bend as ""pretty dangerous"" and as ""a blind spot because you cannot see vehicles coming the other way"".  The collision occurred just on dusk.  Mr Bell had his lights on.  He saw the utility just as he was about to enter the bend.  Mr Bell told police that he was travelling at 40 kph.  Mr Bell straightened his van to take the corner from a wider point, as it was his perception that the utility was travelling at a speed which would result in the vehicles colliding.
15After the collision, the utility continued to travel in a southerly direction and did not stop at the scene.  As a result of the collision it started to fishtail with the respondent failing to maintain control.  The utility went onto the wrong side of the road, ran off the road and travelled in a table drain for approximately 100 metres.  It then ran over a culvert causing the rear tray passengers to be thrown from the vehicle onto the nature strip on the road.
16The utility came to a stop some metres further on.  The respondent told police that he saw that Brent Hayes was lying motionless on the ground and that he ""panicked"" knowing that he was not supposed to be driving due to current bail conditions restricting him from driving.  The respondent left the scene of the accident and continued driving in a southerly direction to a friend's house at 73 Teatree Avenue.  
17Subsequently the respondent parked the damaged utility in front of his house and walked back to the scene of the collision.  He told police that during this walk back to the scene, he consumed about one quarter of a 700 millilitre bottle of Galliano Sambuca, which he had in the utility.
18As a result of being thrown out of the utility Brent Hayes sustained serious spinal injuries.  These included a fracture dislocation at the T10/11 level, resulting in the loss of the use of his legs, fractures at the C6 and 7 levels, fractures of the ribs in seven places, an undisplaced fracture of the sternum, bilateral pneumothoraces and a laceration of the right lobe of the liver.  He has been left a paraplegic.  When the respondent arrived back at the scene, he was met by several members of the public who were assisting the victim.  The respondent was picked up by his sister and after going to her residence, was taken to the Leeton Police Station where he handed himself into to police at about 8.25 pm.
19The respondent was subjected to a breath test at 8.42pm which provided a positive result.  Expert analysis of the evidentiary material in relation to the respondent's consumption of alcohol established that at the time of the impact, his blood alcohol reading was no less than 0.149 grams of alcohol per 100 litres of blood.  
20The respondent took part in an electronically recorded interview, during which he made admissions to police that he was the driver of the vehicle involved in the collision on Cassia Road which ultimately caused the injuries to the victim. 
Subjective features
21The following subjective features were not in dispute.  The respondent was aged 21 at the time of the offence and 24 at the time of sentence.  He had prior convictions for relatively minor offences, dealt with in the Local Court, but had been convicted of drive while suspended and drive with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol on 6 May 2011.  These offences were committed on 5 March 2011, only a few weeks prior to the offences presently under consideration.  He was disqualified from driving for 2 years from 5 March 2011.  His licence was suspended on 16 February 2011, following a speeding offence.
22The respondent relied upon a report of a psychologist, Dr Susette Sowden, dated 26 October 2012.  Ms Sowden administered a number of tests.  As of that date, she expressed the following opinion:
""In the case of Mr Greaves, it appears from his account of his difficulties during adolescence that he manifested tendencies towards a Conduct Disorder with him commencing drinking alcohol when he was in his mid teens and using illicit substances when he was 18 years of age.  A protective factor for Mr Greaves appears to have been the support and structure offered to him by his mother, stepfather and his maternal grandfather, along with his employer.  It appears that while he enjoyed the structure offered to him by his family while resident in Glen Innes, he was able to have more focus in his life.  He was able to complete an apprenticeship in welding in Glen Innes prior to returning to Leeton to be with his sister.
In the light of Mr Greaves' impaired planning and non-verbal problem solving abilities,  (as evidenced by his responses to the SB5 AIQ test battery), it is considered that without a strong support network that Mr Greaves would be more prone to behavioural dysregulation and difficulties in organising himself and creating structure in his life.  In addition Mr Greaves appears to have anti-social personality tendencies with these tendencies being consistent with his engagement in polysubstance abuse within the context of him working and partying upon return to Leeton.  Mr Greaves appears to have experienced more behavioural dysregulation away from the immediate support offered to him by his mother while he was resident in Glen Innes.  His grief arising from his grandfather's death in 2010 and loss of support offered to him by his grandfather also appear to have been factors giving rise to his behavioural dysregulation upon his return to Leeton.  His anti-social and nacissistic personality tendencies within the context of him having less family support help explain his willingness to breach his bail arising from being charged on 5 March 2011 and engage in reckless and impulsive alcohol fuelled behaviour giving rise to the accident on 26 March 2011. ...
While Mr Greaves appears to have responded constructively to counselling and the drug rehabilitation program, of concern is his ongoing reported use of cannabis which facilitates his general avoidant approach to life.  It is considered important for Mr Greaves to have the structure and support offered by counselling for him to minimise the probability of a relapse in relation to his former polysubstance abuse.  Mr Greaves appears to have experienced significant remorse for his role in the motor vehicle accident on 26 March 2011, both in terms of the impact of his behaviours on his former brother-in-law and in terms of the impact on him.  Mr Greaves appears to have experienced guilt about his role in the accident.  His guilt and avoidance have made it difficult for him to continue a relationship with his former brother-in-law.""
23A pre-sentence report, dated 27 August 2012, referred to the respondent's remorse and his participation in substance abuse counselling.  The author noted that the respondent continued to use illicit substances on occasions.  An updated report of 25 November 2013 made reference to his participation in GROW (a rehabilitation program) but noted that he was ""asked to leave the program a few days before his required departure date as he had consumed alcohol"".  The report said that his progress had been positive overall.
24In the ICO assessment report of 27 February 2014, it was noted:
The respondent had casual employment with a local construction business since January 2014.
He had a history of alcohol abuse and ceased consumption following the offence but then commenced using cannabis developing very heavy daily use by early 2013; he was using other illicit drugs at this time.
He attended the Peppers Residential Drug Rehabilitation Program in January 2012 but left after six weeks.
He completed almost 6 months of the GROW program but was asked to leave a few days early due to alcohol consumption.
Since leaving the GROW program, he reported he had not returned to substance abuse.
The proceedings on sentence
25The proceedings in the District Court occupied 21 months.  The applicant was committed for trial on 1 February 2012.  The plea of guilty was entered on 12 June 2012.  Thereafter, the matter was adjourned on 3 September 2012 for further evidence regarding the injuries to the victims.  It was not reached on 14 October 2012 and adjourned to the next sittings on 29 October 2012.  The sentence proceedings commenced before Jeffreys DCJ on 3 December 2012 and continued to 12 December 2012 when they were adjourned for an ICO assessment.  The proceedings were adjourned on 13 March 2013, 14 April 2013, 29 April 2013 and 3 May 2013.  On each occasion the basis for the adjournment was to enable the respondent to enter a rehabilitation program.  On 24 May 2013 and 19 August 2013 the sentence proceedings were again adjourned to enable the respondent to complete a rehabilitation program.  On 26 November 2013 the proceedings were adjourned for a further ICO assessment.  The sentence proceedings concluded on 28 February 2014 and his Honour sentenced the respondent on 14 March 2014.
26The respondent was originally found unsuitable for an ICO because of his ongoing substance abuse problems.  The outcome of his attendances at various rehabilitation programs has already been referred to.  The second ICO assessment identified the respondent as suitable for such an order.  The relevant findings in that assessment have already been set out.
27In the course of his remarks, the sentencing judge referred to the guideline decisions in R v Jurisic [1998] NSWSC 423; 45 NSW LR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252.  By reference to those cases, his Honour identified the ""typical case"" as follows:
""Young offender of good character or no or limited prior convictions, death or permanent injury to a single person, the victim is a stranger, no or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates, genuine remorse, a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.""
28By reference to other cases in which those guideline judgments had been considered, his Honour noted that the seriousness of the injury was relevant to the objective gravity of the offence (Tzanis v R [2005] NSWCCA 274 at [13]).  The number of persons put at risk was relevant to culpability (R v TG [2010] NSWCCA 28 at [28]).  His Honour noted that the factors listed in the guideline judgments as impacting upon culpability and objective seriousness were not exhaustive (Gonzales v R [2006] NSWCCA 4 at [13]).
29His Honour had regard to the respondent's previous criminal record, noting that in 2009 and 2012 he received fines and a bond to be of good behaviour in relation to behaving in an offensive manner.  The most recent offence occurred on 5 March 2011 involving driving whilst suspended and driving with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in relation to which the respondent was fined and disqualified from driving for a period of 2 years.  His Honour concluded that the only effect of this criminal record was that it disentitled him to the degree of leniency which he would have had, had he been a first time offender.  His Honour declined to take the previous driving record into account as an aggravating factor.
30In relation to the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour concluded as follows:
""When I consider the aggravating factors in this matter in accordance with the Whyte guideline, so far as [i] is concerned the extent and nature of injuries inflicted, they are, in my view, catastrophic.  In relation to (ii), the number of people put at risk, there were four people in the vehicle at the time, two were on the back tray including the victim and they were unrestrained and there was another passenger in the cab who was also unrestrained.
So far as any degree of speed is concerned, I am not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the actual speed at the time of negotiating the corner.  All I am able to say is that the speed was significantly more than driving round that particular bend warranted but I am not able to say to what degree.
So far as the degree of intoxication or of a substance is concerned I note that at the time of driving the expert material establishes that he was driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.149.""  (ROS 15.4)
31His Honour declined to find that the applicant was showing off at the time.  He said:
""It is true that the offender received warnings but I am not convinced that he ignored those warnings.  It seems that he was told to slow down when he was travelling in excess of 100 or around 100 but he did in fact slow down and he was told to slow down as he approached the corner and it appears that he slowed down from 90 to what he told the police between 60 and 70.""  (ROS 16.1)
32Although the respondent did not give evidence, his Honour found that he had shown deep contrition.  His Honour reached this conclusion by reference to what was said in the pre-sentence report and in that of the psychologist, Ms Sowden.  His Honour said:
""In this matter it is my view that the offender and his relationship with his ex-brother-in-law indicate deep remorse and contrition on behalf of the offender and I propose to take that into account.""  (ROS 18.1)
33His Honour had regard to the psychologist's test results which showed:
""Overall Mr Greaves' ABIQ is in the borderline impaired to low average range and greater than 8% of people in his age range.  The non-verbal fluid reasoning sub-test provides a measure of non-verbal problem solving ability.""  (ROS 18.5)
34His Honour set out the findings of the psychologist in considerable detail.  The particular matters noted by his Honour were that the applicant required a strong support network, otherwise his behaviour would deteriorate.  The death of his grandfather in 2010 was a significant event which had a detrimental effect on his psychological welfare and behaviour.  His Honour gave particular weight to the psychologist's finding that when the applicant moved to Leeton in circumstances where he did not have the same support network, his behaviour deteriorated significantly.  According to the psychologist this was due to him experiencing depressive episodes and ""an anti-social and narcissistic personality disorder and a schizo-typal personality disorder"".
35His Honour set out in detail the conclusions of the psychologist:
""It's considered important in understanding what happened to have insight into Mr Greaves' planning impairment and his very low nonverbal problem solving abilities.  While he had strong scaffolding around him as he appeared to have at Glen Innes he appeared to more able to engage in more regulated and focussed behaviour.  In the light of his developmental difficulties and disturbed emerging personality development in his early 20s and in the context of him having minimal scaffolding in Leeton it's not surprising Mr Greaves became engaged in a reckless lifestyle consisting to alcohol abuse and polysubstance abuse.  With this in turn attracting criminal charges followed by a breach of bail and then eventually a serious incident involving a motor accident in which one of the passengers suffered serious injury.""  (ROS 20.5)
36By reference to what was said in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 and what was said by the High Court in R v Muldrock [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, his Honour concluded that because of his psychological difficulties, the significance of general deterrence and specific deterrence were substantially reduced.  His Honour found that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation in that he had successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program.  In formulating the length of the ICO, his Honour had regard to the fact that the applicant had experienced 4 months and 13 days of quasi custody, given the onerous bail conditions to which he had been subject.
THE APPEAL
37The Notices of Appeal were served upon the respondent on 5 April 2014.  
38Except for Ground 8, all of the grounds relied upon by the Crown are related.  The essential complaint by the Crown is set out in Ground 9 and in that regard, Grounds 1 - 7 can be treated in effect as particulars of that ground.
39The complaint in Ground 1 that his Honour failed to determine the level of objective seriousness of the offending is made out.  As was made clear in Muldrock at [27] the objective seriousness of an offence is to be distinguished from an assessment of an offender's ""moral culpability"" as referred to in [54].  It is in relation to that latter consideration that an offender's mental state, including any impaired intellectual functioning, is relevant.  In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge made no attempt to differentiate the two concepts.
40Had his Honour properly approached his sentencing task, it was important that he make an assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offending.  It was not sufficient that he simply refer to considerations raised in Whyte but otherwise reach no conclusion.  A proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending would inevitably have led to a conclusion that this was objectively a very serious offence and absent other considerations, required a significant custodial penalty.  This was implicitly and appropriately conceded by counsel for the respondent in the appeal.
41A brief reference to the factors identified in Whyte make such a conclusion as to the objective seriousness of the offending clear.  The nature and extent of the injuries suffered by the young victim were catastrophic.  All four people in the vehicle were placed at great risk by the mode of driving, particularly the three who were unsecured.  The degree of speed was clearly excessive in the circumstances and the only evidence that it was in the order of 60-70 kph at the time of the collision came from what the respondent said to the police at the time.  His speed was such that at least two of his companions called on him to reduce it. 
42The respondent's degree of intoxication was high, i.e. 0.149.  His driving could only be described as erratic and aggressive.  While there is some evidence (again from the respondent) that he did reduce his speed somewhat in response to the complaints by his passengers, that is hardly a matter which can be taken into account as reducing the objective seriousness of the offending.
43Finally, the respondent failed to stop, both after the collision with another vehicle and after the victim was ejected from the vehicle.  There was, of course, the additional aggravating factor not considered in Whyte that at the time of this offending the applicant was on bail for a serious driving offence and should not have been driving.
44It should be understood that the factors set out in Whyte as indicative of a typical case do not operate as a checklist the presence or absence of which have some mathematical relationship with the sentence to be imposed.  They merely describe the typical case.  His Honour, however, appears to have used them in that way hence his focus upon a sentence of 2 years which was the recommendation for a ""typical case"" in Whyte where serious injury but not death was caused and which also had significance if the respondent were going to be subject to an ICO rather than an actual custodial sentence.
45Because his Honour did not properly consider the objective seriousness of the offending, he failed to appreciate that the respondent fell outside the typical case envisaged by Whyte in that the offending was more serious.  The respondent was not of good character with no, or limited, prior convictions.  On the contrary, he had committed a number of serious driving offences, was regularly abusing illicit substances and was in breach of his bail conditions.  The finding of remorse was based on second hand reports and did not come directly from the respondent.  In that regard, it should be noted that the court in Whyte was careful not to be unduly prescriptive in setting out a range of sentences for a ""typical case"".  The court made no reference to the upper limits of such a sentence but endeavoured to indicate a lower limit for a typical case below which a sentence would not generally be appropriate.  Furthermore, the court in Whyte had in mind a fulltime custodial sentence, not an ICO. 
46In Stanyard v R [2013] NSWCCA 134 Fullerton J (Bathurst CJ and Campbell J agreeing) noted at [40]:
""40 The guideline judgment in Jurisic, and the further consideration given to it in Whyte, is not designed to operate in the way contended for by counsel. In so far as the guideline judgment refers to a numerical guideline it is directly referable to a typical case (which this case was not). Guideline judgments are not absolute directions for sentencing judges and not to be applied as if they operate as a minimum sentencing or standard sentencing regime. In accordance with the procedure provided for in s 37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, guideline judgments are attempts to achieve consistency in sentence with the ultimate goal of achieving equality and justice and to provide an opportunity for this Court to analyse sentencing principles for those offences where some unevenness or uncertainty of sentencing practice has emerged. Whilst guideline judgments are to be regarded as persuasive, they are not prescriptive (see R v Read [2010] NSWCCA 78 at [49]).""
47As indicated, the evidence as to the serious nature of the offending was virtually all one way and made it clear that the offending here was more serious than that envisaged for the ""typical case"" in Whyte.  Here there was a clear abandonment of responsibility of a significant kind by the respondent. 
48Not only did his Honour not make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, he gave no proper consideration to the ""moral culpability"" of the respondent.  Rather, his Honour identified aspects of the respondent's subjective case without indicating how and to what extent they impacted upon his moral culpability.  His Honour concluded that these were of such importance as to substantially offset the serious nature of the offending. 
49The matters to which his Honour adverted were the respondent's remorse; his prospects of rehabilitation and the findings of the psychologist as to the respondent's level of mental functioning and personality disorders.  While questions of remorse and rehabilitation were important, they are not relevant to moral culpability.  The question of the respondent's mental health was relevant but apart from setting out extracts from the psychologist's report, his Honour made no attempt to indicate the extent of that relevance.  Had he done so, it would have been clear to him that insofar as moral culpability was concerned, the psychological findings did not have the force which he gave them. 
50While it is true that the respondent had a relatively low IQ, had personality defects and substance abuse problems, there was no evidence that the respondent acted without an appreciation of the seriousness and wrongness of his actions.  On the contrary, the psychologist made it clear that the respondent well understood the seriousness of what he had done and its consequences.  Although his Honour referred to De La Rosa and Muldrock, the factual circumstances of the respondent's mental health were far different and did not significantly reduce the respondent's moral culpability.
51On this issue, the observations of Beech-Jones J (with whom Rothman J and I agreed) in Ngati v R [2014] NSWCCA 125 are relevant.
52There Beech-Jones J said:
""41 At the heart of the applicant's challenge to his Honour's sentence was his reliance on the following passage from the High Court's judgment in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [54] (""Muldrock""):
""[54] The principle is well recognised. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community."" (emphasis added)
...
42 It was submitted that his Honour failed to recognise that, with persons who have an impaired intellectual capacity, an inquiry into their ""moral culpability"" must conform with the approach stated in the emphasised passage from Muldrock just noted.

43 Earlier in Muldrock, at [27], the High Court had noted that:
""...objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""
44 Paragraphs [27] and [54] of Muldrock have been considered on a number of occasions by this Court. It suffices to state that the reference to the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence as referred to in [27] of Muldrock is to be distinguished from an assessment of the relevant offender's ""moral culpability"" as referred to in [54]. An offender's mental state, including their impaired intellectual functioning, is clearly relevant to any assessment of the latter (McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29] per McCallum J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing (""McLaren""); Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 at [34] per Beazley P). It is unnecessary to consider this further as it is clear that in the passage from the sentencing judgment set out above (at [40]) his Honour (correctly) used the phrase ""offender's criminal culpability"" in the sense of ""moral culpability"" as referred to in Muldrock at [54] and discussed by McCallum J in McLaren.
45 In this case it is not contended that the applicant was suffering from a ""mental illness"". However, it can be accepted that the intelligence testing revealed a deficit in the applicant's intellectual functioning that could answer the description ""intellectual handicap"". In Muldrock at [54] the High Court stated that questions as to a causal relation are less likely to arise in sentencing such offenders because they ""lack ... capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of [their] conduct"" and this will, ""in most cases"", substantially lessen their moral culpability for the offence. This is illustrated by the facts in Muldrock. In Muldrock there was ""unchallenged evidence of a causal relationship between the appellant's retardation"" and his commission of sexual offences towards children (Muldrock at [55]). In particular, a psychiatrist had assessed the appellant in that case as being aware of the wrongfulness of his own conduct but had observed that it was ""only a superficial awareness"" (Muldrock at [52]), and a psychologist had concluded that he had little control over his ""acting out behaviour"" (Muldrock at [41]). 46 Nevertheless the approach stated in Muldrock is only expressed to be apposite to ""most cases"" of an offender with impaired intellectual functioning. It does not necessarily apply to all. The task still remains to consider the evidence of the intellectual retardation and the facts of the particular offence. In this case, his Honour noted the degree of planning that was involved by the applicant in the commission of the offences.  His Honour concluded that the applicant was ""fully aware"" that his conduct was ""seriously wrong"".  Considered in this context, the finding that he was ""fully aware"" was clearly a reference to the applicant having a sufficiently deep understanding of its wrongful nature and consequences.
47 Thus, in terms of Muldrock, his Honour's findings reveal that, notwithstanding his low IQ, at least in relation to these offences the applicant did not ""lack the capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct"". This is not surprising for three reasons. First, because counsel for the applicant had, during the course of submissions, expressly disclaimed any suggestion to that effect. Second, because the degree of planning and the circumstances surrounding the commission of these particular offences suggested to the contrary. The applicant was clearly not acting out an impulse or tendency. His actions were not only cruel, they were also deliberate and methodical. Third, properly considered, the evidence given by Mr Howard and Dr Adams did not suggest to the contrary.""
53Observations to similar effect were made by Simpson J (with whom Adams and McCallum JJ agreed) in Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114 when commenting on the well-known principles relating to the sentencing of offenders suffering from an intellectual handicap or other mental problems which were summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa:
""34 It will be observed that none of these principles is stated as absolute. What is recognised is the potential effect, in any given case, of a mental disability. It does not follow that, because an offender suffers from some mental impairment or disability, his or her moral culpability is reduced (principle 1); nor that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (principle 2); nor that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him or her (principle 3); nor that the significance of specific deterrence is reduced or eliminated (principle 4). Nor, on the other hand, does it follow that a person with mental impairment is a danger to the community, indicating a need for community protection (principle 5). Too often, the mere fact of mental illness is advanced to this Court as necessarily calling for a more lenient sentence. What the principles spelled out by McClellan CJ at CL do is direct attention to considerations that experience has shown commonly arise in such cases. There is, however, no presumption. It remains necessary for the sentencing court to examine the relevant facts in order to determine whether, in the specific case, the mental condition has the consequence contended for.
35 A central question (but not the only question) is whether the mental illness or other condition had a causative role to play in the commission of the offence or offences for which the offender is to be sentenced. Counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that this was the principal issue in this case. If it is concluded that there was a causal connection, then the offender's moral culpability may be reduced (see principle 1). That connection may also warrant lesser attention being paid to the need for the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence (principle 2).""

54Taking the evidence of the psychologist at its highest, the real problems identified by her in relation to the respondent at the time of offending were his personality defects in the context that he was away from his support mechanisms, i.e. his family, and the fact of his polysubstance abuse.  What the psychologist did not assert in her report was that his relatively low IQ rendered him unable to understand the wrongness or potential consequences of his actions.
55It follows that his Honour's failure to properly assess the respondent's level of moral culpability, together with his failure to assess the objective seriousness of the offending, led to him imposing a sentence which was manifestly inadequate.
56In view of that conclusion and because of the way in which the appeal proceeded, it is not necessary to consider in further detail the individual grounds of appeal which I have treated as particulars of the essential complaint of manifest inadequacy which is raised by Ground 9.
57In relation to Ground 8, it is clear that the four summary offences were properly placed on the s166 certificate as they all arose from substantially the same set of circumstances as those of the offence on the indictment.  However, the elements in each of the summary offences were not the same as the offence on the indictment.  In particular, the criminality in each of the offences was not encompassed in the count on the indictment and was of a high order.  Accordingly, it was not appropriate for his Honour to say he took those summary offences into account in the sentence imposed for the offence on the indictment and that it was not appropriate to impose a further penalty.
58Without repeating the facts, it is clear that each of the offences was an objectively serious example of the offending to which each related and warranted more than just a recording of the conviction without penalty.  The respondent's traffic record was not a matter that justified leniency and in particular, the reduction of the automatic periods of disqualification to just 18 months.  This was the second PCA offence committed by the respondent within a matter of months.  This was his second offence of driving whilst suspended.  It is significant that Mr Tiffen rendered assistance to the victim after he had been ejected from the vehicle but the respondent did not.  Finally, the respondent only presented himself to the police after he had impeded their investigation by both removing the vehicle from the scene and disguising his alcohol consumption by consuming the Galliano Zambucca.
59Even though error has been identified in that the sentence imposed on the respondent was manifestly inadequate, there are difficulties in the Court re-sentencing the respondent so as to impose a custodial penalty.  The offence occurred over 3 years ago.  The plea of guilty was entered over 2 years ago.  From the time of the entry of the plea of guilty, none of the delay has been due to any fault on the part of the respondent.
60From the time of the plea of guilty, the delay has been due to the way in which the sentence proceedings were conducted.  In that regard, the sentencing Court invited and encouraged the respondent to attend rehabilitation courses and twice referred him for assessment for the suitability of an ICO.  Although some vicissitudes have been experienced by the respondent in relation to the GROW program, he was generally successful in completing it.  It would be fair to say that the sentencing court has given rise to a reasonable expectation on the part of the respondent that if he used his best efforts to rehabilitate himself by attending these courses and was otherwise suitable, he could expect to be sentenced to an ICO rather than fulltime imprisonment.  The respondent has by now completed one-third of his ICO requirement in accordance with its conditions.
61This Court also needs to be mindful of the purpose of Crown appeals and the application where appropriate of the residual discretion as to whether or not it should proceed to re-sentence an offender in the case of a successful Crown appeal.  Recent statements by the High Court have emphasised the importance of these considerations. 
62In Green v Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA49; 244 CLR 462 the plurality (French CJ, Heydon Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said:
""1 The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (""Crown appeals"") under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"") is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.""  That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the ""residual discretion"". 
2 In Crown appeals, circumstances may combine to produce the result that if the appeal is allowed the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision will occasion injustice. Relevant circumstances include consequential disparity relative to an unchallenged sentence imposed on a co-offender and delay in the appeal process which may be associated with disruption of the offender's progress towards rehabilitation.  In such cases it may be appropriate for a court of criminal appeal, in the exercise of its residual discretion, to dismiss a Crown appeal.""
63In this case some level of success in rehabilitation has been achieved and that progress may well be adversely affected if the respondent were given a fulltime custodial sentence.  Moreover, there is actual evidence in affidavits filed by the respondent and his mother of real anxiety and distress being experienced by the respondent when he became aware of the Crown appeal.  Taking those matters into consideration, and in particular the delay which has occurred in this matter, I am of the opinion that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of the Court's residual discretion not to re-sentence the respondent to a period of fulltime custody which otherwise would have been the appropriate sentence.  
64That having been said, the period of disqualification from driving imposed on the applicant should be altered to provide an appropriate punishment  and to provide some protection for the road users of New South Wales.  Re-sentencing in relation to that issue will not in the circumstances of this case impose undue hardship on the respondent.  Beech-Jones J has discussed this issue in more detail and I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasoning.
65Accordingly the orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) Allow so much of the appeal as concerns the imposition of a disqualification period on the respondent for the offence under s52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
(2) Set aside the disqualification period of 18 months imposed on the respondent under s188(2)(d)(ii) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) for the offence under s52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
(3) The appeal is otherwise dismissed.
66For the avoidance of doubt it should be noted that the effect of the above orders is that by operation of s188(2)(d)(i) Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) the respondent is disqualified from driving in accordance with the automatic disqualification period of 3 years from 4 March 2014 to 3 March 2017.
67BEECH-JONES J: I have had the advantage of reading a draft of the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. Subject to what follows I agree with His Honour's reasons and orders.
68At the time the respondent first presented for sentence the only proper sanction that could have been imposed for the offence under s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was a full time custodial sentence. The offence involved excessive speed, significant alcohol consumption, reckless driving including repeated failures to take heed of warnings and the occasioning of serious injury to the victim. At the time of the offence the respondent was suspended from driving. 
69Nevertheless I agree that this Court should exercise the residual discretion to dismiss so much of the appeal as does not concern His Honour's decision to reduce the automatic period of disqualification from driving. One significant factor warranting that course is the prolonged history of the sentence proceedings in the District Court. In the ordinary course the respondent should have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by no later than December 2012. Instead the proceedings were repeatedly, and in my view needlessly, adjourned while he was assessed and reassessed for his suitability for an intensive corrective order. The end result is that he was not sentenced under March 2014 and this appeal could not be determined until the third quarter of 2014. Had at the outset it been properly recognised that a custodial sentence was required then, given the respondent's age and personal circumstances, it can be expected that the minimum term of any custodial sentence he should have received would have expired or be close to expiring by this time. No doubt in many cases this type of analysis will have little bearing on whether the residual discretion should be exercised in an offender's favour. However in this case when it is combined with the other factors noted by Hoeben CJ at CL I consider that this Court should not intervene to imprison the respondent. To do so would impair the progress towards rehabilitation that he has displayed.
70However this basis for declining to interfere does not justify allowing the disqualification period that was imposed to stand. In respect of the culpable driving offence, s 188(2)(d) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) had the effect that, on his conviction, the respondent was subject to an automatic three year period of disqualification unless the sentencing court determined to order a shorter disqualification period of not less than 12 months (s 188(2)(d)(ii))). In this case His Honour imposed a disqualification period of 18 months on the basis that the effect of disqualification on a person living in a ""country setting"" was greater than those in the metropolitan areas who had access to public transport. This maybe so but it could never justify the imposition of a disqualification period below the automatic period for this offender. The sanction of disqualification exists for the protection of the public (R v Veatufunga [2007] NSWCCA 54 at [40] per Sully J). The prospect of the respondent driving a motor vehicle represents an unacceptable danger to both metropolitan and country drivers and pedestrians.
71Three of the offences on the s 166 certificate were also governed by the disqualification regime governed by s 188(2)(d) namely the offences of  driving with prescribed concentration of alcohol, failing to stop and assist after impact causing injury and wilfully alter concentration of alcohol. For these offences his Honour reduced the automatic disqualification period to twelve months, eighteen months and eighteen months respectively. For the remaining offence on the s 166 certificate, namely driving while suspended, the respondent was automatically disqualified by reason of his conviction for a period of two years it being his second such offence within 5 years (see former s 25A(7)(a), 25A(10)(c) and 25A(11) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW)). For that offence the sentencing judge was conferred with a power to impose a greater period of disqualification however its exercise was not sought before His Honour or by this Court (former s 25A(7)(b)). 
72Thus, the end result of the conviction and sentences was that the respondent was automatically disqualified from driving for a period of 2 years from the date of his conviction namely 4 March 2014 and received a series of court imposed concurrent disqualifications which collectively ran for a period of eighteen months. 
73As noted, the reduction in the automatic disqualification period was completely unjustified. If the matter was at large I would propose the imposition of a disqualification period of in excess of three years. However the Crown's submissions in this Court were exclusively directed to His Honour's actions in reducing the automatic disqualification period for the culpable driving offence. These submissions may have reflected an acceptance that there was no power in the sentencing court to alter the commencing dates from which the respondent was disqualified (see RTA v Tamara O'Sullivan & Ors [2011] NSWSC 1258 at [28] per James J; Hei Hei v R [2009] NSWCCA 87 at [39] to [46] per Rothman J) which would preclude the periods being accumulated. Alternatively it might merely reflect the fact that no further period of disqualification was sought by the Crown before his Honour. As no argument was directed to this in my view the Court should simply set aside the disqualification period imposed for the culpable driving offence and leave the automatic disqualification period of three years for that offence to operate from 4 March 2014. 
74Accordingly I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.  As stated by Hoeben CJ at CL, for the avoidance of doubt it should be noted that the making of order 2 has the result that the respondent is disqualified for driving for a period of three years from 4 March 2014 (s 188(2)(d)(i) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW)).
75HAMILL J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL including his Honour's concurrence with what Beech-Jones J has written in relation to the disqualification period.

2764903,R v Williams [2014] NSWCCA 200,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offence and sentence:
On 24 March 2014 (on the morning fixed for the commencement of the trial) the respondent pleaded guilty to one count of causing death by dangerous driving contrary to s52A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.

2On 14 May 2014 Judge Wilson SC in the District Court at Newcastle sentenced the respondent to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months, commencing 14 May 2014 and expiring 13 September 2015, and a balance of term of 11 months expiring 13 August 2016. Her Honour also imposed a 3 year disqualification from driving which commenced on 14 May 2014. 

3The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against that sentence pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Notice of Appeal was served upon the respondent while in custody on 12 June 2014. The ground of appeal relied upon by the Crown is:

""The sentence pronounced is manifestly inadequate.""

Factual Background

4The respondent was the driver of a motor vehicle which on 19 July 2012 was involved in a collision that caused the death of one Joanne Warburton. 

5After the plea of guilty was entered, the Crown tendered a statement of facts with which the respondent substantially agreed. There was, however, an area of dispute which her Honour had to decide. The dispute related to whether or not the respondent was engaged in ""competitive driving"" immediately before the crash. Three witnesses gave evidence on that issue and submissions were made. Thereafter, her Honour summarised her factual findings as follows.

6During the evening of Thursday, 19 July 2012, the respondent left his home at Swansea and drove alone to Newcastle in his white coloured 2000 model Holden Commodore sedan. That vehicle has a six cylinder 3.8 litre engine. He drove to Wharf Road where he met three young men who were his friends. They were travelling in a red 2006 Holden Commodore sedan. The respondent's then girlfriend joined the group driving her own silver Holden Integra. 

7At 9 pm the three cars left that location. The respondent was alone in his vehicle and his three friends were in the red Commodore. His girlfriend was driving alone in her vehicle. Her Honour was not able to find what the respondent's destination was but those in the red Commodore were travelling to Kooragang Island which is said to be a spot used for drag racing.

8At the intersection of Honeysuckle Drive with Hannell Street, which is controlled by traffic lights, the two Commodores stopped at a red light behind other traffic. There was another Commodore at that location, the driver of which is not known. When the lights turned green, a witness observed the three Commodores to speed away from the lights into Hannell Street, weaving through the traffic.

9Another witness saw the three Commodores come up quickly on his right side, travelling in the centre lane. The three Commodores closed up behind the vehicle which was blocking their path in that lane and then suddenly changed lanes in front of the witness and moved off at a fast speed.

10At 9.20pm the three Commodores were observed at another intersection at the corner of Industrial Drive and Ingall Street. The respondent's vehicle was at the front in the centre lane, the red Commodore was next to that vehicle in kerb side lane and the third Commodore was immediately behind the red vehicle. Other vehicles were stationary at the lights behind the Commodores. It was dark, the weather was fine although it had been raining and the road was damp. The area was well lit with street lighting and had a signposted speed limit of 80 kph. The road had two lanes of traffic in each direction divided by a raised concrete median strip. The road was in good condition.

11As one travels west from those lights (as the respondent did), vehicles travel on a flat road surface, first encountering a right hand bend, followed by a sweeping left hand bend, which leads to a straight, flat section of road. At that time Ms Warburton was also driving in a westerly direction along Industrial Drive. She was travelling in the kerb side lane at a speed of about 70-80 kph. She was driving a red Mitsubishi Lancer. It was soon after she entered Industrial Drive that her car was struck by the respondent's Commodore causing fatal injuries to her.

12The evidence of what happened immediately before the collision was that the engines of all three Commodores were revving while stationary at the traffic lights. When the lights changed, all three vehicles drove off at a speed of over 100 kph. It was when trying to negotiate the sweeping left hand bend that the respondent lost control of his car and collided with Ms Warburton's red Lancer.

13Apart from the three witnesses who gave evidence for the Crown, the respondent gave evidence. He said that his memory of the collision was vague. He ordinarily observed speed limits but accepted that he was speeding on this night. He could offer no reason for his departure from his usual practice, other than a possible lack of concentration. When asked about revving his engine, the respondent said that it might have happened, but he could not recall it. He did not recall the wheels of his Commodore losing traction. He denied that he was racing one of the other Commodores.

14Contrary to his assertion, her Honour found as a fact that he had engaged in a course of driving that ""may best be characterised as irresponsible and competitive in the short interval before he struck Ms Warburton's Lancer"" (ROS 11.5). Her Honour found that the respondent had been revving the engine of his car in readiness for a fast acceleration from the traffic lights. Her Honour found that he was travelling at a speed of between 105 and 110 kph at the time of the collision.

15Following the accident, the respondent told investigating police that he was the driver of the Commodore involved in the accident, but said ""It wasn't my fault, another car hit me first. It took off, it was a white Commodore. I don't know who it was"". He gave a similar but more detailed history to the police officer who interviewed him at the hospital where he was providing blood samples. Her Honour noted that the account of the accident given at the hospital was a very detailed one. Her Honour characterised that conduct as ""at best an impulsive fiction, born of panic and at worst, an attempt to cast blame elsewhere"". That version of events was inconsistent with CCTV footage which covered the collision.

16As a result of the collision, the victim suffered extensive head injuries being skull fractures, subarachnoid injuries, cerebral contusions and cerebral oedema. She also suffered chest trauma that included rib fractures, lung contusion and focal laceration of the right ventricle. She died at the scene. Her son, who was driving another vehicle behind her, witnessed the accident.

17In accordance with the guideline judgment in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 her Honour assessed the objective gravity of the offence and the degree of moral culpability of the offender. Her Honour said:

""In view of the factual findings the court has made concerning the irresponsible course of driving in which the offender engaged on this night, involving competitive driving, at speed, on a well populated road in wet conditions, I regard the offender's moral culpability to be towards the higher end of the continuum of criminality. Although not of the very highest level, it is not far below that level in my judgment."" (ROS 16.1)

18Her Honour found that the following seven features (which were said in Whyte to demonstrate a frequently recurring case in offences contrary to s52A of the Crimes Act 1900) were present here:

(i) A young offender.

(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.

(iii) Death or permanent injury occasioned to a single person.

(iv) The victim is a stranger to the offender.

(v) No injury or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates.

(vi) Genuine remorse.

(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.

In relation to additional aggravating features, her Honour noted that the respondent was driving at speed, albeit for a relatively short distance, and that his driving was competitive.

19Her Honour summarised the respondent's subjective case. He was 22 at the time of sentencing and 20 at the time of the collision. Although the respondent's parents had separated, his home life was relatively stable He grew up with his mother and sisters until he left school, after which he moved in with his father. In evidence his father described the respondent as a ""nervous, shy and cautious person"". The respondent had the support of both parents in the proceedings.

20The respondent completed his schooling and had been continuously employed since that time. He worked as a labourer before completing a pre-apprenticeship as an electrician. He was working as an electrical fitter at the time of the offence. This was an employment which he had held for over two years. He was involved in a steady relationship and had the support of his partner.

21The respondent had some health issues in that he suffered from scoliosis and Scheuermann's disease, which led to occasional back pain and fatigue. As a result of the accident, he was suffering from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. This produced frequent thoughts about the crash, concern for his future and erratic sleep. 

22There was a report from Dr Bench, a forensic psychiatrist, before the court. Dr Bench opined that the respondent had suffered from social phobias since childhood and that the 2012 accident was likely to have exacerbated that condition as well as his anxiety. Dr Bench accepted that the respondent understood the terrible impact his actions had upon Ms Warburton and her family and friends and that he felt great remorse for his actions. Her Honour accepted that assessment. 

23Despite the false account which he initially gave to the police, her Honour accepted that the respondent was genuinely remorseful and that he did understand the enormity of his conduct and accepted responsibility for it. In relation to the late plea of guilty, her Honour allowed a discount of 10 percent on sentence. Her Honour noted that he had little by way of a criminal history, with only one minor traffic offence. 

24Her Honour made the following observation in relation to the respondent's subjective case:

""Whilst I have had regard to the offender's youth and good character, those features of his subjective case carry less weight than would ordinarily be the case given the frequency with which young people of otherwise good character commit offences such as this. Those are, as already noted, also features referred to and taken into account in the guideline judgment."" (ROS 19.9)

25Her Honour found that specific deterrence had a limited role to play and that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend. Given his family support and regular employment, her Honour found that the prospects of rehabilitation were very good.

26In relation to general deterrence, her Honour said:

""There remains, however, a need for a sentence that will have a deterrent effect on others. That is an important feature of sentencing in cases such as this and cannot be overlooked or ignored. Irresponsibly used, cars become weapons on our roads and the tragedy and trauma that that causes to the community is profound. The Court has seen an example of that in Mr Warburton's deeply-felt victim impact statement which was read to the Court and which I have considered in the way that the law allows. The loss of Ms Warburton's life has had a terrible impact upon her family and her community and that loss constitutes the gravity of this offence. ... 

The courts must reinforce the message to all road-users that driving is a privilege that should be available only to those who observe the road rules. Here irresponsible behaviour in a car has led to the unlawful taking of a human life and the sentence that is imposed upon Mr Williams today must play a role in deterring others from engaging in the same sort of behaviour."" (ROS 20.5)

27Her Honour found special circumstances:

"" ... given the psychological disorders from which the offender suffers and his need for treatment for those conditions. ... It is thus in the offender's interests and in the interests of the community that he receive support and supervision for a longer than usual period of parole to assist him to achieve those aims."" (ROS 21.2

Crown submissions

28The Crown acknowledged the purpose of Crown appeals as most recently stated by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]. It also acknowledged the difficulties to be overcome for an appeal based on manifest inadequacy to succeed. The Crown had to clearly show that according to the relevant circumstances of the case, the sentence was so plainly unreasonable or unjust that this Court should infer that in some way, there had been a failure by the sentencing judge to properly exercise her discretion. That having been said, the Crown also noted the effect of s68A(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 which removed double jeopardy considerations and in particular, prevented a lesser sentence than that which would otherwise be appropriate being imposed.

29The Crown submitted that latent error was evident and that the sentencing discretion must have miscarried because the sentence ultimately imposed:

(1)Failed to adequately reflect the objective criminality of the offence.

(2)Failed to adequately reflect the principle of general deterrence for offences of this kind; and

(3)Reflected a failure on the part of the sentencing judge, having identified the correct sentencing principles, to apply them to the facts found by her.

30The Crown submitted that her Honour, having found that all of the features numbered (i) - (vii) outlined in Whyte and having found that the respondent's moral culpability to be towards the higher end of the continuum of criminality, did not give effect to those findings in the sentence. In that regard, the Crown relied upon the guideline enunciated in Whyte by Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Barr, Bell and McClellan JJ agreed):

""229 The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 

Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.""

31The Crown submitted that despite the qualification acknowledged by Spigelman CJ in Whyte at [232] which acknowledged the broad sentencing discretion of a first instance judge, her Honour's imposition of a 2 year head sentence was not consistent with her findings. These included a high level of moral culpability. The sentence was well outside the range for an offence of this type occasioning death. The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the objective features of the offending capable of lowering the respondent's moral culpability to a point where a 2 year head sentence was appropriate. Similarly, although the respondent's psychological disorders entitled him to a finding of special circumstances, his subjective features were otherwise unremarkable and did not justify such a degree of leniency.

32The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the timing of the plea or the conduct of the sentence proceedings which was capable of justifying such a lenient sentence. It submitted that on the contrary, the plea was late and of limited utilitarian value, given that a disputed facts hearing had taken place in which the respondent was unsuccessful.

33While acknowledging the respondent's youth and prior good character, the Crown submitted that such features were typical of this kind of offence and that the youth of the offender should not be allowed to dominate the sentencing exercise. On that issue, the Crown relied upon the observations of Hunt CJ at CL (with whom McInerney and RS Hulme JJ agreed) in Regina v Paul Musumeci (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 30 October 1997):

""This Court has held that a number of considerations which had to be taken into account when sentencing for culpable driving must also be taken into account when sentencing for this new offence of dangerous driving:

(i)The legislature has always placed a premium upon human life and the taking of human life by driving a motor vehicle dangerously is to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness.

(ii)The real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of human life.

(iii)Such is the need for public deterrence in this type of case the youth of any offender is given less weight as a subjective matter than any other types of cases.

(iv)The courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases.

(v)So far as youthful offenders of good character who are guilty of dangerous driving, therefor, the sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances."" (page 3)

Respondent's submissions

34The respondent's submissions focused primarily upon his subjective circumstances. The respondent had been continuously employed since leaving school and had a ""solid work history"". He suffered physical health problems including intermittent back pain and fatigue as a result of scoliosis and Scheuermann's disease. He had experienced social phobia and anxiety since childhood and had suffered symptoms of nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, sweating, tremors, poor concentration and blurred vision since school. Counsel for the respondent, whilst acknowledging that those considerations had no effect on the commission of the offence, submitted that they were relevant to the degree of hardship which the respondent was likely to experience in prison.

35In that regard, counsel for the respondent referred the Court to findings of the respondent's psychiatrist to the effect that following the accident he developed anxiety symptoms associated with a post traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms of insomnia, lethargy, poor appetite, suicidal ideation, constant rumination and intrusive thoughts, together with images of the accident were a sequence of this post traumatic stress disorder.

36Counsel for the respondent noted that there was no issue that the respondent experienced great remorse and now had insight into the magnitude of the loss he had caused the victim's family. The Court was taken to Justice Health records which showed that the notification of the Crown appeal to the respondent while in prison had led to a significant exacerbation of his anxiety which included physical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Counsel for the respondent stressed that these were important considerations when considering the exercise of the residual discretion.

37In relation to the guideline judgment, counsel for the respondent submitted that the Court should not lose sight of the fact that the judgment was a ""guideline"" and should not unduly restrict the sentencing discretion of a judge. In that regard, he relied upon the qualification of Spigelman CJ in Whyte at [232]:

""232 The guideline is, to reiterate, a ""guide"" or a ""check"". The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

233 This guideline focuses attention on the objective circumstances of the offence. The subjective circumstances of the offender also require consideration. ..."" 

38Counsel for the respondent submitted that the indicative sentence term
in the guideline was not prescriptive: R v Nguyen [2008] NSWCCA 13 at [48] James J (with whom Hoeben and Hall JJ agreed). That the term was below the indicative term did not demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. He submitted that her Honour expressly and correctly applied the guideline judgment consistently with its intended nature as a ""check"" or ""indicator"". Counsel for the respondent emphasised that sentencing for all offences subject to a guideline judgment was intended to involve the exercise of a broad discretion.

39Counsel for the respondent submitted that the only restraint on the exercise of the residual discretion by this Court was that related to the double jeopardy principle but that otherwise the residual discretion should be exercised. The respondent's difficult situation in prison and in particular the real and actual distress experienced by him when being notified of the Crown appeal should be taken into account on this issue (Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [175]).

Consideration

40The complaint by the Crown has been made out. Despite having made findings as to the high moral culpability of the respondent and as to the objective seriousness of the offending, her Honour did not give effect to those findings when imposing the sentence. The typical features for the application of the guideline judgment had been made out, together with the aggravating features of speed and competitive driving. That being so, her Honour did not explain why it was not appropriate to apply the guideline judgment.

41While the respondent had a reasonable subjective case, it was not such as to offset those considerations, particularly when one had regard to the important guidepost constituted by the maximum penalty for this offence. Accordingly, I have concluded that the Crown has been successful in establishing that the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly inadequate.

42That does not end the matter. The Court has to consider whether despite error having been identified, it should intervene to re-sentence the respondent or decline to interfere, even though the sentence imposed was erroneously lenient. 

43This issue was considered most recently in R v Reeves [2014] NSWCCA 154 where the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hall and R A Hulme JJ) said:

""13 In exercising the residual discretion, it is for the appellate court to answer two questions:


(1) Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline, in the exercise of its ""residual discretion"" under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from. 


(2) To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied: Green v R; Quinn v R at [35].

14 In Green v R; Quinn v R it was noted by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ), quoting Griffiths v The Queen [1997] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at 310 [53] (Barwick CJ), that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": at [1]. This was similarly expressed in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [70]:


""... the purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence imposed upon a particular individual. It has a wider purpose, being to achieve consistency in sentencing and the establishment of sentencing principles. That purpose can be achieved to a very significant extent by a statement of this Court that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were wrong and why they were wrong.""

15 This purpose is a ""limiting purpose"" that does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. Rather, it provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion: Green v R; Quinn v R at [36].


16 Accordingly, it has been held that it may be appropriate for the appellate court, in the exercise of its discretion, to dismiss a Crown appeal where ""circumstances may combine to produce the result that if the appeal is allowed the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision will occasion injustice"": Green v R; Quinn v R at [2]. ""

44The Court in Reeves went on to identify factors that might favour the exercise of the residual discretion. Included in those factors was one which is relevant to the matter before the Court, i.e. the deteriorating health of the respondent since sentence. The Court noted:

""19 In determining whether or not to exercise the residual discretion, it is open for the appellate court to look at material available at the time of the hearing of the appeal: R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; 176 A Crim R 1 at [28]; R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [32]. Accordingly, the appellate court is not required to put itself back in the position of the sentencing judge at the moment of conviction:


""If a Crown appeal against sentence is successful, and the appellant court resentences the respondent, it does so in light of all the facts and circumstances as at the time of resentencing. Events which have occurred after the original sentencing may be relevant."" (R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562).""

45In this case there was evidence of a deterioration in the respondent's mental health following notification of the fact of the appeal and generally. This related to his anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder. That material came from the Justice Health clinical notes of his attendances while in custody and from the respondent's affidavit and that of his mother.

46While that is an important consideration there are others of at least equal, if not greater importance. In R v O'Connor [2014] NSWCCA 53 Adamson J (with whom R A Hulme and Davies JJ agreed) said:

""88 Although the principal purpose of the determination of a Crown appeal is to give guidance to sentencing judges, the sentence actually imposed on the respondent is still of considerable importance. The need for specific deterrence in the present case would not be served by an exercise of the residual discretion. 


89 Nor indeed would the need for general deterrence be fulfilled were the residual discretion to be exercised. The general deterrence of a sentence is not to be measured solely by reference to its effect on putative offenders. One of the purposes of incorporating an element of general deterrence in a sentence is to ensure that sentences accord with legitimate community expectations and that public confidence in the administration of justice is maintained: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [82] per McHugh J. ...""

47In Reeves having reviewed the relevant principles and the particular facts of that case, the Court said:

""71 We have concluded that there is an insufficient basis for the Court to decline to re-sentence the respondent in the exercise of the residual discretion but the material now available is of such moment that the extent of intervention should be moderated. The combined effect of the added delay in the final disposition of the matter, the evidence of what has transpired in relation to the respondent's ill-health (both physical and mental) and the conditions under which he has been held in a form of quasi-custody since being released on parole, call for an amelioration of the Court's response.""

48I propose to follow the same approach. While the factors militating against intervention in this case are substantially less than those before the Court in Reeves, the question of the deterioration in the respondent's mental health is such as would justify some moderation in the extent of the intervention by this Court and consequent re-sentencing of the respondent.

49Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)The sentence imposed by Judge Wilson SC on 14 May 2014 in quashed.

(3)In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, commencing 14 May 2014 and expiring 13 February 2016, with a balance of term of 11 months expiring 13 January 2017.

50FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

51ADAMSON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2764904,Morrison v R [2014] NSWCCA 199,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceOn 8 August 2012 the applicant pleaded not guilty to all counts on an indictment containing 20 counts.  On counts 1 and 2 she was jointly charged with her partner, Mervyn Ferry.  Those charges were:
Count 1 - That they detained JA for advantage between 1 May 2007 and 30 August 2009 in circumstances of special aggravation, contrary to s83(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment; and
Count 2 - That they detained NB for advantage between 1 February 2010 and 10 August 2010 in circumstances of special aggravation, contrary to s83(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment.
2The circumstances of special aggravation within s83(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 were that the offenders acted together to commit the offences and secondly that they caused actual bodily harm to each victim.  Counts 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon JA, contrary to s59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 charged in the alternative to Count 1 against the applicant and Counts 12, 14, 16, 19 and 20 were various assaults upon NB charged contrary to either s61 or s59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 in the alternative to Count 2 against the applicant.  At the end of the Crown case, Counts 11 and 13 were the subject of verdicts by direction.
3On 17 October 2012 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on Counts 1 and 2 against both the applicant and her co-offender in full satisfaction of the indictment.
4On 17 May 2013 the applicant was sentenced to an effective sentence of 13 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 27 August 2010 and expiring 26 August 2019.  The balance of term expired on 26 August 2023.  This effective sentence comprised the following two sentences:
Count 1 - A non-parole period of 7 years commencing 27 August 2010 and expiring 26 August 2017 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 26 August 2021.
Count 2 - A non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment commencing 27 August 2012 and expiring 26 August 2019 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 26 August 2023.
5The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal the total sentence imposed on her by Judge Zahra SC in the Sydney District Court on 17 May 2013 on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.
Ground 2 - The partial accumulation of 2 years of Count 2 and Count 1 was manifestly excessive infringing the totality principle.
Factual Background
6The trial in this matter proceeded from 8 August 2012 until 17 October 2012.  In the proceedings on sentence, the Crown tendered without objection a 30 page document comprising a summary of the evidence at trial.  The sentencing judge set out the findings of fact upon which the applicant was to be sentenced in some detail in his remarks on sentence at 3-21.
7In summary, the Crown case was that the applicant and her partner acted together during two separate time periods to detain two young men for the advantage of exercising psychological control over them.  During the periods of their respective detentions, they caused actual bodily harm to each of the victims.
8The background to the offences is that the two victims JA (born in 1988) and NB (born in 1984) were friends with the older daughters of the applicant.  JA resided with the applicant and her partner from April 2007 until 28 August 2009 and NB resided with the applicant and her partner between 1 February and 10 August 2010.  Both victims gave evidence that while residing with the applicant and her partner, they were subjected to ongoing physical and mental abuse of various kinds.  They were subjected to regular violence, threats, starvation and other mistreatment to compel them to support the daily running of the house and to remain living there.  The applicant and her partner were able to overwhelm the victims and exercise full psychological control over them, such that the victims were virtually enslaved.
9No useful purpose would be served by setting out in detail what each of the victims was subjected to.  Suffice it to say that the details concerning JA are set out in the sentence judgment at [3] - [10] and those concerning the victim NB, at [11] - [20].  I incorporate those details into this judgment.  
10JA came under the influence of the applicant and her partner in April 2007 when he was aged 18.  At this time he weighed about 70 kilograms.  Over a period of time his savings account Access Card and PIN number were removed from him and he lost financial independence.  The physical conditions under which he was living gradually deteriorated.  From approximately September 2007 he commenced to be subjected to physical assaults from both the applicant and her partner.
11On many occasions he was assaulted up to ten times per day.  JA said that over time the portions of food he was given reduced and the applicant told him he was not allowed to eat unless he had finished all the chores in the house allocated to him.  He said that he did not ask for more food because he was scared.  Similarly when asked why he did not use a telephone to contact his family he said that he did not do so because he was scared of both offenders.  JA said that over time he continued to miss Centrelink interviews because of his injuries and when he did attend the Centrelink office, he was accompanied by the applicant or her partner.
12Towards the end of his time at the applicant's residence JA was compelled to make false admissions of wrongdoing, both orally and in writing.  The circumstances of JA leaving those premises in August of 2009 were that he had received a severe beating from the applicant's partner and another male after which he was then taken by the applicant's partner to a refuge.  His belongings were placed in a shopping trolley with him.
13At the refuge, JA told his story and the police were contacted.  JA was then taken to Bathurst Hospital where he was interviewed by police and a number of photographs were taken.  The photographs were in evidence at trial and in the appeal.  They show open wounds, malnutrition and the indicia of JA having received a severe beating. He weighed 45kgs at the time.
14JA suffered injuries to both his ears so that surgery was required. One of his ears will remain permanently disfigured.  There were injuries and cuts to a hand as a result of being struck with a breadknife and a metal bar.  There were injuries to his lip, nose and face as a result of being frequently struck in those places.  There were injuries to his legs and knees, resulting in swelling and pain that restricted his movement.  These injuries were due to being hit with implements and kicked.  Generally, his body was severely bruised and abrased and the damage to two of his teeth was such that they had to be removed.
15NB was aged 26 when he commenced living with the applicant and her partner in February 2010. He weighed 56kgs at the time.  He was subjected to similar treatment to that experienced by JA, except that the beatings which he endured were more severe and there were elements of what could only be characterised as sadism in the way in which he was treated.  He was so overborne by the mistreatment which he received that he was prepared to admit, both orally and in writing, to wrongdoing which he had not committed.  On 9 August 2010 the applicant's partner accused him of ""perving"" on one of the applicant's daughters and severely beat him.  Somewhat bizarrely, NB was then taken by the applicant's partner to the nearest police station where he was falsely accused of being a paedophile in relation to his conduct towards the young children who were residing in the house.
16At that time police observed that he had a number of severe injuries, appeared unkempt and smelt of faeces and urine from sleeping in the children's cubbyhouse without access to toilet facilities.  He was carrying the handwritten false confessions that the applicant had compelled him to sign.  The police officers were so concerned about NB's condition that they called an ambulance and he was taken to Bathurst Hospital where he remained for over four weeks.  At the time he was admitted to the hospital, he weighed 43kgs.  Photographs taken of him at the time show serious physical injuries and severe malnutrition.  
17The injuries diagnosed included injuries to both his ears, with the left ear being deformed.  There were multiple fractures to the facial bones, including his nose, eye socket and lower jaw. There were multiple rib fractures (14 fractures to 10 ribs) and multiple fractures of his lumbar spine.  Some of the fractures to his ribs were old (more than 3 months old) and some were in the process of healing (3-6 weeks old).  Others were recent (2-4 weeks old).  There were soft tissue injuries across his back and shoulders and internal injuries to his lungs.  There was bruising to both eyes, cuts to his eyebrow and cuts to his nasal bridge.  There were injuries to both legs and knees resulting in swelling, pain and restriction of movement.  Both eyes were infected.  
18As well as physical coercion, the applicant and her partner exerted psychological control over the two victims in the following ways:
Isolating the victims from their normal support of families and friends.Compelling the victims to perform daily household chores under threat of violence.Making false complaints of their wrongdoing.Subjecting them to repeated acts of violence which caused significant injury.Subjecting them to ongoing threats.Giving them little nourishment.Controlling their finances.Compelling them to falsely admit to wrongdoing and misconduct.
Proceedings on sentence
19Having set out the facts of the offending in considerable detail, his Honour considered the applicant's subjective case.  She was born in 1964 and left school in year 10.  She had an unhappy childhood and illicit drug use was part of her lifestyle from the age of 17.  This included daily heroin use until the age of 40.  She had been on the methadone program for over 20 years.  She was on social security benefits for most of her adult life and had six children to three different fathers.  At the time of sentence, the oldest was aged 31 and was caring for the two youngest children, aged 7 and 11.
20A psychological report described the applicant as suffering long standing depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, dating back to childhood.  She did not present clinically with symptoms of a major psychiatric disturbance.
21His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending as high.  In reaching this conclusion, his Honour had regard to the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and to what he regarded as the high level of moral culpability of the applicant.  His Honour had regard to the length of the period of detention, the circumstances of the detention, the extent to which fear was occasioned to the victims, the vulnerability of the persons being detained and the purpose of the detention.   His Honour determined that the purpose was psychological control of the victims, and found that a consideration of all of those factors demonstrated the high level of objective seriousness of the offences.
22It was against that background that his Honour imposed the sentences previously referred to.
THE APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.
23The applicant did not challenge the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 and accepted that it was an appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion.  It was the sentence imposed for count 2 which the applicant challenged.
24The applicant noted that the penalty imposed for both counts was the same, i.e. a head sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.  She submitted that this was inappropriate in the circumstances of the case.  She accepted that both victims suffered assaults which left them injured and both were left in a poor state of health when they were released from their detention.  She submitted that there was a real difference in the length of each detention.  In the case of JA it was over 2 years and in the case of NB it was just over 6 months.  By reference to what was said by McClellan CJ at CL (Johnson and Hammerschlag JJ agreeing) in R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130 at [54] - [64] the gravamen of this offence was the ""detention"".  It followed, so the applicant submitted, that the difference in the periods of detention in this case made it inappropriate for the same sentence to be imposed for Count 2 as imposed for Count 1.
25This submission is misconceived.  There was justification for the approach which his Honour took.  Although the period of detention in relation to count 2 was less than that in count 1, the violence and psychological control directed towards NB was significantly greater than that experienced by JA.  His physical injuries when taken to hospital were far greater than those of JA and are vividly shown in the photographs taken at the time.
26It is also significant that this was the second offence in point of time.  The applicant clearly learned nothing from the state of JA when he was released from detention.  On the contrary, there was a substantial escalation in the mistreatment of NB while he was detained in the home.  There was no evidence of any remorse or contrition for her treatment of NB.
27This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The partial accumulation of 2 years of count 2 on count 1 was manifestly excessive infringing the totality principle.
28The applicant submitted that the effective sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years was excessive and offended the principle of totality.  The applicant accepted that some level of accumulation was necessary but submitted that 1 year rather than 2 would have been appropriate.  
29The applicant submitted that what was said in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 198 CLR 296 by Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 5, was appropriate to this case:
""... the totality principle serves to ensure that an offender is not subjected to ""'a crushing sentence' not in keeping with his record and prospects"" ...""
The applicant submitted that the effective sentence in this case had resulted in a ""crushing sentence"" of that kind.
30In considering this submission the statement of principle by Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70;166 CLR 59 at 63 needs to be kept in mind:
""""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: 'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong', 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences'.""
31As that statement of principle makes clear, the decision whether to accumulate sentences is an exercise within the discretion of the sentencing judge.  There is no general rule of law that determines whether a sentence must be concurrent or consecutive:  Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J (with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed) at [47].  As Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) observed in R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [56] concurrency should not be imposed:
""56 ... simply because of the similarity of the conduct or because it may be seen as part of the one course of criminal conduct  ... The question to be asked is, can the sentence for one offence encompass the criminality of all the offences?""
32Simpson J made observations to similar effect in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540 at [7]:
""There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong.""
33These two offences were not closely connected.  Each offence occurred over a different period of time and related to a different victim.  Implicit in the applicant's concession that some period of accumulation was appropriate is an acknowledgement that the sentence on Count 1 could not encompass the criminality of both offences.  His Honour in the exercise of his sentencing discretion considered 2 years to be an appropriate method of accumulation.  No error is disclosed in that exercise of his Honour's discretion.
34The applicant pleaded not guilty and showed no remorse.  Although her subjective features indicated a troubled and dysfunctional childhood, there was no material before his Honour that would materially reduce the applicant's moral culpability for these offences.  Her prospects of rehabilitation were not hopeful and she had a lengthy criminal record.  His Honour had regard to all of the relevant factors in arriving at the appropriate sentence and an appropriate level of accumulation.
35This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Conclusion
36There is no complaint as to the sentence on Count 1 and it is conceded that some period of accumulation was applicable.  The applicant in effect only received an extra 2 years non-parole period for the very serious criminality caught by Count 2.  The orders which I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal dismissed.
37FULLERTON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
38ADAMSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2764905,Lander v R [2014] NSWCCA 198,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 15 November 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Freeman ADCJ on three counts of supply 3, 4 - methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA); two counts of supply cannabis and one count of possess cannabis.
2On the first count of supply MDMA (an amount of 100 tablets with a weight of 25 grams) his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months and a balance of term of 18 months.  The sentence was to commence on 15 November 2013 with the non-parole period expiring on 14 August 2014 and the balance of term expiring on 14 February 2016.
3On the second count of supply MDMA (10 tablets with a weight of 2.5 grams) his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months and a balance of term of 12 months which was wholly concurrent with the sentence in respect of count 1.
4On the third charge of supplying 2 tablets of MDMA, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months which was fully concurrent with the sentence imposed in respect of count 1.
5On the two charges of supply cannabis his Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of 12 months with a non-parole period of 6 months.  That sentence was to commence on 15 February 2014 with the non-parole period expiring on 14 August 2014 and the balance of term expiring on 14 February 2015.
6On the charge of possession of cannabis, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months to date from 15 November 2013 and expire on 14 February 2014.
7The total sentence imposed upon the applicant was a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months to expire on 14 August 2014 and a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 14 February 2016.
8The two counts of indictable supply (i.e. the first two counts referred to above) contrary to s25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMT Act) involved a quantity less than the commercial quantity and accordingly, the maximum penalty available was imprisonment for 15 years.
9The applicant was also charged with one offence of supply MDMA contrary to s25(1) DMT Act (being a summary supply), two charges of supply cannabis (also summary matters) and one count of possess cannabis leaf, contrary to s10(1) DMT Act, also a summary matter.  Those summary matters were dealt with pursuant to s166(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  The maximum penalty available for the summary offences was imprisonment for 2 years.
10The applicant seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him on the following grounds:
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in failing to discount the applicant's sentence as a consequence of the applicant's plea of guilty.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in finding that the applicant was a conduit between Roche ""who was to all intents and purposes, the main supplier and a wider section of the community"".
Ground 4:  The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
11There was originally a Ground 3 which the Court was advised would not be pursued.
12The applicant obtained bail pending this appeal on 14 May 2014.  There remain 3 months of the non-parole period and 18 months of the parole period to be served.
Factual background
13Both sides accepted his Honour's summary of the facts as accurate. 
14In 2012 a strike force called ""Waterlily"" was established to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs in the Southern Highlands.  One prime supplier, Brendan Roche, was identified.  His telephone conversations were from time to time lawfully intercepted and recorded.  Among those telephone conversations were some involving the applicant.  
15On 20 December during one of these conversations, Mr Roche agreed to supply the applicant with 100 MDMA pills at a cost of $13 per pill.  The applicant left the money in a pre-arranged location in a freezer in his residence and Roche went and collected the money.
16On Friday, 21 December the police intercepted a further telephone conversation initiated by the applicant.  In it there was an agreement for the applicant to go and collect Mr Roche from the Imperial Hotel and drive him home where the drug transaction could be completed.  That journey was filmed by the investigating officers.  Police estimated that the 100 tablets of MDMA would have weighed approximately 25 grams.
17Shortly before 6.30pm on 21 December the applicant, having received those 100 pills, had a further telephone conversation with Mr Roche.  It turned into a three way conversation between Mr Roche, the applicant and one Jake Baterinski, who was known to the applicant.  Roche, who had supplied the original 100 tablets, found himself without any and wanted 2 of those 100 back on the basis that he replace the 2 which he was borrowing.  That is the first matter of supply to be dealt with on the s166 certificate.  
18In addition, Baterinski wanted tablets.  The applicant told him where to find 10 tablets, secreted in rolled up socks, in the top drawer of his dressing table in his bedroom.  Baterinski was to take those 10 tablets, paying $25 per tablet.  From the 10, he was to provide 2 to Roche on the basis that Roche would ultimately replace them for the applicant.  
19The agreement to supply the 100 tablets is the first count and the actual supply to Baterinski of 10 tablets is the second count.  The applicant was not arrested until 7 May 2013 when police went to his home to arrest him.  When the police did so, they noted in full view a quantity of cannabis leaf and a bong.  The cannabis was seized by the police, together with an Apple iPhone.  The applicant was taken to Bowral Police Station where he participated in a recorded interview in which he made some reluctant admissions claiming a failure of memory.
20There were text messages on the telephone which was seized.  These revealed that on 18 March, Scotty Jones texted the applicant asking if he could buy $75 of weed, which was a reference to cannabis.  In the course of that conversation, Mr Jones said:
""I know you just got it for yourself but my workmate wants some and you're the only fellow I know.""
21The applicant texted back indicating that he would advise when he was able to fulfil the request.  He ultimately did so by saying that he could provide $50 worth.  This is the first count of supply cannabis.
22The second count related to events of 20 March when Mr Jones again texted requiring another $100 worth, but there was no rush.  The applicant texted back that there were no worries but he would not have the substance until Friday.  
23The last matter for which the applicant was sentenced was the possession of the cannabis, which was seized at his home on 7 May.  That weighed some 8 grams.  
Sentence proceedings
24The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings.  In that evidence he denied supplying the 100 tablets after Mr Baterinski's 10 had been subtracted, but instead consumed all of them by himself.  His Honour did not believe that evidence and said:
""What he told me stretched my powers of belief beyond breaking point.  In order to dispose of the number of tablets which he had received from Roche at a time one might say when he was up at Byron Bay with 15 of his mates, he said not that he gave his mates any, which would be understandably a natural thing to do if they were up there in Byron Bay but rather he ate the lot himself.  Meaning that he had to consume at least 8 tablets a day, even if he took them every day for the time between the receipt of the tablets and when he claimed to have ceased drug use altogether.  This is an improbable number of drugs for him to ingest, particularly in circumstances where his mother testified that she saw no untoward effects in him at all.  I think it is highly probable that he did distribute the drugs to his mates in Byron Bay where they were all partying and why he was foolish enough to tell me a series of lies to conceal that I have no idea.  But I am convinced that he did.""  (ROS 4.5 - 5.1)
25In relation to those lies, his Honour said:
""Now that redounds against him.  Despite warnings in the course of him giving evidence that that is the likely affect of trying to lie to the Court.  That does not mean that he gets punished as a form of revenge, it simply means that he has done himself no good in terms of establishing his credit which reflects of course upon his prospects of rehabilitation.  It makes one wonder about how seriously one can take his protestations that he is doing all he can to abandon his drug use.""  (ROS 5.2)
26His Honour took into account the applicant's subjective case.  The applicant was a talented sportsman who suffered serious spinal injuries at the age of 19.  As a result of those injuries, he was off work for 18 months.  Following that injury the applicant took drugs to deal with the pain.  That injury, apart from impacting heavily upon his capacity to work, also destroyed his sporting ambitions.  The applicant turned 27 some days before he was sentenced.
27The applicant's long period off work brought about financial difficulties.  His Honour noted that because of these financial difficulties, the applicant moved from using drugs himself to supplying with a financial motive.  His Honour said:
""I believe he was a conduit between Roche who was to all intents and purposes the main supplier and a wider section of the community.""
28His Honour concluded in relation to the supply of both MDMA and cannabis that the applicant was trafficking in drugs to a not insignificant extent.  His Honour did not accept that part of the applicant's evidence in which he sought to minimise his criminality.  His Honour said:
""... that causes me to doubt his very recent attempts of rehabilitation as being any more than attempts once again to avoid the punishment his activities ought to attract.""
29His Honour characterised the applicant's attempts at drug and alcohol rehabilitation as spasmodic and unsatisfactory.  He found his belated attempts to address these problems as unconvincing.  As a result, his Honour assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as only ""fair"".
30In relation to the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour said:
""The involvement of any person in the supply of prohibited drugs is a serious offence even those at the lowest level in the distribution chain.  Indeed including those who only act as couriers are, on authoritative statements by the Court of Criminal Appeal, to expect severe punishment because even those at the lowest level, if they can be dissuaded from engaging in this sort of behaviour, will curtail the widespread use of drugs which is bedevilling our society at the moment.""  (ROS 4.1)
31In relation to sentence, his Honour said:
""The finding that he was involved in trafficking although based only on the one supply of 100 pills and his involvement in re-supplying those and then supplying cannabis, leads me to the conclusion that no sentence other than fulltime custody is appropriate.  I have indicated that I understand, perhaps, the basis upon which he became sucked up in the drug culture and took those downward steps from user to user/seller.  I accept that the cannabis was used by him as his GP says and from time to time unwisely but again comprehensively as pain relief.""  (ROS 6.9 - 7.2)
32His Honour concluded his remarks by making a finding of special circumstances.  He did this because of the applicant's youth, it was his first time in custody and that sending him into custody would have enormous ramifications for him in his personal life.  His Honour observed that these extra curial punishments were sufficiently serious as to require a finding of special circumstances.
33The extra curial matters to which his Honour referred were described by the applicant in his evidence.  The applicant had commenced his own business as a carpenter and this would suffer.  It would also be difficult to maintain payments on his house, which was subject to a substantial mortgage.
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in failing to discount the applicant's sentence as a consequence of the applicant's plea of guilty.
34The applicant submitted that apart from commencing his Remarks on Sentence by saying ""The offender Rory Lander entered pleas of guilty in Moss Vale Local Court on 3 September..."" his Honour made no mention of the plea of guilty.  The applicant submitted that in those circumstances there was no indication that the plea had been taken into account in his favour in the assessment of sentence, nor was there any mention of the extent of the utilitarian discount for that plea.  The applicant accepted that both parties to the sentence proceedings had made submissions and had referred to the early plea of guilty.
35The applicant relied upon the statement of Spigelman CJ in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 49 NSWLR 383 at [160] where his Honour said:
""160 ...
(i)  A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight.
(ii)  Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. ...""  
36The applicant submitted that his Honour had failed to comply with that requirement.  He submitted that when the facts and circumstances of the case were taken into account, and when the extent of the individual sentences and the overall sentence were considered, it was apparent that the sentencing judge did not take into account the plea of guilty, nor did he allow a 25 percent reduction for its utilitarian value. 
Consideration
37It is true that other than the recitation of the fact that the applicant entered a plea of guilty at the beginning of the Remarks on Sentence, there was nothing said which supports the contention that his Honour gave weight to the plea of guilty.  As set out in R v Thomson; R v Houlton his Honour should have done so.  That having been said, the issue is whether it can be shown that his Honour in fact took the plea of guilty into account.
38A failure to expressly refer to a plea of guilty and the significance of the guilty plea, does not necessarily indicate that the plea was not taken into account.  Every case is to be evaluated according to its own facts and circumstances - Regina v Schumacher [2005] NSWCCA 355 at [15] - (Hall J with whom Grove J and Smart AJ agreed).
39Observations to similar effect were made by Spigelman CJ (with whom Grove and Bell JJ agreed) in Regina v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [12] - [15] where his Honour said:
""15 This Court is, of course, aware of the pressures under which District Court Judges have to deliver their sentences and that it is easy not to state a fact that everybody knows is required to be taken into account.  Nevertheless, the reasons given in Thomson for issuing a guideline included the need to ensure that participants in the New South Wales criminal justice system had no reason to be sceptical about whether or not the benefits of a guilty plea were in fact made available to accused.  It would have been preferable, for that reason, if his Honour had mentioned that he had done so.  However, in view of his Honour's long experience and the structure and length of the sentence he imposed, I am not prepared to act on the basis that his Honour failed to take into account the plea, or that he failed to give it appropriate weight.  I think the likely situation is that contended for by the Crown:  that his Honour commenced with a sentence of 36 months and applied a full discount.  Accordingly, I would not uphold this ground of appeal.""
40The same considerations apply here.  In submissions to his Honour, both the Crown and counsel for the applicant referred to the early plea.  In the case of counsel for the applicant, it formed an important part of his primary submission that a custodial sentence should not be imposed.  Since his Honour passed sentence two days after submissions were made to him, it can be inferred that his Honour was well aware of the fact of the early plea of guilty when doing so.  In that regard, the exchanges between counsel and his Honour in the sentence proceedings can be taken into account if they inform or elucidate abbreviated statements in the Remarks on Sentence (Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [67] per Leeming JA (with who Button and R A Hulme JJ agreed).
41In addition, the structure of the effective sentence imposed on the applicant is strongly suggestive that his Honour took the early plea into account and allowed in favour of the applicant a 25 percent discount.  The head sentence of 27 months in relation to count 1, suggests a starting point before a 25 percent discount of 36 months exactly.  Following that line of reasoning, the starting point for count 2 was 2 years exactly, 8 months for count 3, 16 months for each of counts 4 and 5 and 4 months for count 6.  Accordingly, I have concluded that the calculations for all 6 sentences show that his Honour clearly discounted the sentences by 25 percent because of the early pleas.
42While Freeman ADCJ is undoubtedly a most experienced judge, I prefer not to base my conclusion on that factor.  To do so might invite submissions from counsel in other cases as to the lack of experience of a particular judge.  This Court should not be seen to encourage such an approach.
43This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in finding that the applicant was a conduit between Roche ""who was to all intents and purposes, the main supplier and a wider section of the community"".
44The impugned part of his Honour's Remarks on Sentence in context was:
""In those circumstances, it was perhaps only a short step from using himself to using and supplying with a financial motive.  As I said, I believe he was a conduit between Roche, who was to all intents and purposes, the main supplier and a wider section of the community.  He was perfectly prepared to supply cannabis and he did so.""  (ROS 5.8)
45The applicant submitted that in accordance with R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 it was a fundamental principle of sentencing law that a sentencing court must not make a finding adverse to an offender unless that finding was established beyond reasonable doubt.  The applicant submitted that there was no evidence to establish that he was a conduit for drugs between Roche and the wider community.  The applicant submitted that the word ""conduit"" as used by his Honour meant ""supply on a regular basis"".
46This ground of appeal has not been made out.
47It is by no means clear that the word ""conduit"" contains within it the concept of regular or continuous supply.  A single supply would be sufficient to establish that a person acting as a middle man in the supply of drugs was in fact a ""conduit"" on that occasion.
48In any event, there was evidence from the Facts Sheet, tendered as part of the Crown case, that in December 2012 Roche agreed to supply 100 tablets of MDMA to the applicant at $13 each.  They arranged for payment to be made in a clandestine way, with the applicant hiding $1300 in his freezer.  
49The Facts Sheet went on to state that the next day the applicant spoke to Roche on the telephone telling him ""I can sort something out tomorrow"" as the banks had closed.  Another person was introduced by Roche over the telephone to the applicant (Baterinski).  The ensuing conversation between the applicant and Baterinski is consistent with the supply of drugs by the applicant to persons other than Roche.
50His Honour's adverse finding as to the applicant's credit is also relevant to this issue.  His Honour found it inherently improbable that the applicant consumed 90 MDMA tablets himself over an 8 day period at Byron Bay.  Inferentially, if the applicant were not consuming those tablets himself, he was supplying them to others.  Confirmation of that fact can be found at the conclusion of the applicant's evidence (T.13.11.2013, p16) where he said:""A.  I am admitting to parting with some of the pills, yes.""
51It follows that there was ample evidence to enable his Honour to make the finding beyond reasonable doubt, which he did.
Ground 4:  The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
52The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.  He submitted that the objective seriousness of the offending was not high.  In relation to Count 1, he submitted that the quantity of MDMA was less than 25 percent of the maximum amount before the drug would have been deemed to be a commercial quantity.  He submitted that by reference to sentencing statistics, only 31 of 299 persons without previous convictions dealt with by the District Court for an offence of supplying an ""indictable"" quantity of MDMA had received a fulltime custodial sentence.
53The applicant also referred to his strong subjective case.  He was a young man with a very minor criminal history and a good work record.  He had a business which he had started after overcoming a very serious physical injury.  
54For this ground of appeal to be made out, the sentence has to be shown to be unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).
55As was also said in Markarian by the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ):
""27 ... The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.""
56His Honour took into account all of the matters to which the applicant has referred in support of this ground.  His Honour was conscious of the quantity of MDMA concerned which was 25g and which substantially exceeded the indictable quantity of the drug which formed the basis for the offence (1.25g).  Moreover, the applicant was supplying two types of drugs to different people, the transactions were some months apart and yet he received the benefit of wholly concurrent effective terms, such that there was no punishment for the cannabis supplies.
57In relation to the statistics relied upon by the applicant, the Court has referred on a number of occasions to the limitations on the use of statistics and this case provides a good example.  What is required is that due regard be had to the maximum penalty specified by the legislature and what is required is consistency in the application of sentencing principles, not consistency in outcomes as shown in statistics.  These matters were recently discussed in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 by the Court (Hoeben CJ at CL; Johnson and Bellew JJ) at [66] - [68].  In any event, the sentences imposed were well within the historical sentencing outcomes depicted in the statistics relied upon by the applicant.  
58In this matter his Honour carefully analysed the objective seriousness of the offending and described the circumstances in some detail.  His Honour also carefully reviewed the applicant's subjective case, in particular, his past drug use and prospects of rehabilitation.  No error has been shown in that review process nor in the sentences imposed.  Most particularly, the sentences have not been shown to be unreasonable or plainly unjust.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
59The orders which I propose are:
(1) Grant leave to appeal.
(2) The appeal is dismissed.
(3) The grant of bail is hereby revoked and the applicant is to be returned to custody forthwith to complete the sentence imposed by Freeman ADCJ.  The applicant is to be released to parole on 31 December 2014 and as a condition of his parole, he is to be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.
60BEECH-JONES J : I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of  Hoeben CJ at CL. In relation to ground 4, in my view it would have been open to His Honour to impose a non custodial sentence on the applicant given that he was relatively young at the time he offended and the other aspects of his subjective case. However just because his Honour did not did so does not mean that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. For the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL neither that contention nor any of the other grounds of appeal were made out. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.
61HAMILL J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.  I also agree with the observations of Beech-Jones J.

2764907,Carr v R [2014] NSWCCA 202,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 20 November 2013 after entering a plea of guilty in the Local Court to knowingly making an improvised explosive device, particularised in the charge as a ""parcel bomb"", with intent to injure contrary to s 55(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  There is no applicable standard non-parole period.
3After applying a discount of 25 per cent for the early plea of guilty, the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
4The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:
Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the applicant's motive increased the objective seriousness of the offending. 
Ground 2: The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
Proceedings and remarks on sentence 
5A statement of facts was tendered by consent.  They were succinctly summarised in the sentencing reasons.
6On 18 September 2012 the victim, Michael Langley, and his partner, Lee Brindle, resided with Ms Brindle's young daughter in Ashcroft.  At around 10.30am, Rosa Langley, the victim's aunt, arrived with a parcel addressed to Mr Langley which had been delivered to her home in Lurnea where the victim had lived from time to time for many years.
7Mr Langley's aunt told him that she thought that whatever was inside the parcel must be broken because it was rattling.  After his aunt left, Mr Langley attempted to open the package in the presence of Ms Brindle and her daughter. 
8He had difficulty in doing so as the parcel was sealed with a lot of tape.  The parcel exploded in his hands when he was attempting to open it.  Ms Brindle noticed a spark from inside the box and, as the parcel detonated, a loud bang was heard producing sufficient smoke to activate the smoke detector.  They called triple-0 and left the house. 
9Mr Langley sustained a small burn mark on his right inner thigh and a ringing in his ears which resolved after a couple of days.  
10The New South Wales Police Bomb Squad attended and conducted an examination of the remnants of the parcel.  They established that the parcel was a homemade explosive device constructed with a small six volt battery, a spring switch, electric wiring and a fire cracker.  A number of ball bearings had been glued to the bottom of the parcel.
11The parcel also contained a handwritten, stencilled note.  This note was reconstructed by crime scene officers.  It read something to the effect, ""You owe a lot, I'm goin to collect, you will never know when or where I'll strike DOG"".  The remnants of the device were collected for DNA testing and fingerprint analysis.  Testing of the electrical wiring from the device produced a DNA profile that matched the applicant's.
12Police spoke with Rosa Langley who informed them that a male in a red van had delivered the parcel to her address.  She said this did not arouse her suspicions as Mr Langley had previously lived with her at that address.  She was unable to provide any description of the van.  She described the man who delivered the item as having olive skin colour, possibly of Asian background, and aged in his 30s (this is inconsistent with the physical appearance of the applicant).  A canvass of neighbours produced no further information.  Australia Post had no record of any parcel being delivered to Ms Langley's address. 13Ms Brindle was previously in a relationship with the applicant from 2003 to around 2007.  When Mr Langley, her current partner, was in prison in 2009, Ms Brindle reconnected with the applicant, but only on a platonic level, including her babysitting his children on occasion.  Contact between them ceased after Mr Langley was released from prison. 
14Ms Brindle told police that the applicant constructed electric devices on numerous occasions and she had witnessed him researching how to make bombs on the internet.  
15On 18 December 2012, police executed a search warrant at the applicant's premises.  In his bedroom police located a firecracker, a number of wires and tools which appeared to be consistent with being utilised for the purposes of construction of the explosive device. 
16The applicant was arrested and conveyed to Campbelltown Police Station.  He participated in an electronic record of interview.  During the interview he denied any knowledge of the parcel bomb.  He stated he had no formal training in electronics but tried to fix televisions and similar electrical equipment as a pastime.  He said the wiring found when the search warrant was executed at his premises was from electrical equipment he had been fixing.  He said a friend of his daughter had given him five firecrackers and that he had used the other four and kept one.  He said the tools found by police were used for work with electrical equipment.
17The applicant told police that he had not spoken to Ms Brindle for about two years.  He stated he knew her partner only as ""Mick"" and that he did not know where either of them lived.  He said he was not happy with Ms Brindle commencing a new relationship with the victim.  He denied knowledge of the note.  When the applicant was informed of the DNA evidence located on the wires, he requested the interview be terminated. 
18On 7 August 2013 he entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. 
19The applicant gave evidence on sentence in which he conceded that there was a possibility that the parcel would injure its intended recipient but claimed that ""he knew what he was doing"", having had experience in making devices of a similar kind and that his only intention was to scare Mr Langley which he considered would be achieved by constructing a device that, on detonation, would make a lot of noise and smoke but not cause any physical injury.  
20In addition to the agreed facts, his Honour expressly took into account the applicant's evidence for the purpose of assessing the extent to which the explosive device had the capacity to injure someone who opened the parcel (or someone in the near vicinity), and the nature of the injury the applicant was intending to inflict when he addressed the parcel and arranged for it to be delivered to a Mr Langley.  Both of these features had a critical bearing upon his Honour's assessment of the objective criminality of the applicant's offending relative to the offending comprehended by the section.  His Honour took into account what he described as ""the events subsequent to the making of the parcel bomb"", including the fact that the applicant deliberately made it so as to give the outward appearance that it was safe to handle.  In that context, he found that being disguised as a postage article, it had the capacity to pass through a number of hands with at least a possibility of it being opened in the presence of people for whom no injury was intended.   
21He also found that the parcel bomb was capable of detonating, making a loud noise and creating a great deal of smoke which, in combination, had the capacity to cause Mr Langley to have great fears for his safety.  He was also satisfied that the applicant should have been aware that in creating a capacity for the device to detonate, it had the capacity to inflict minor burns and to damage a person's hearing.  However, in the absence of any scientific evidence as to the extent to which the parcel bomb had the capacity to cause significant physical injuries, his Honour was not prepared to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant's intention extended beyond scaring Mr Langley and intentionally causing him psychological injury.  Were he satisfied to the requisite standard that the applicant's intention was to cause serious physical injury he would have considered the criminality as being in a worst case category. 
22He also noted that the applicant gave evidence that his motivation for wanting to scare Mr Langley was because he had threatened his daughter with harm some months before.  He denied that he was motivated by revenge because Ms Brindle had rejected him and was in a de facto relationship with Mr Langley.  The applicant's evidence was supplemented by evidence from his daughter who said that Mr Langley had in fact approached her at a railway station some months before the parcel was sent (albeit unknown to her) and that he threatened her in vague terms.  His Honour noted that the threatening notes contained within the parcel made no mention of Mr Langley's alleged misconduct toward his daughter, and that no complaint had been made to police at any time.  The applicant gave evidence that he did not go to the police because he did not think that they would ""do much"".  He said he did not go down and confront Mr Langley because he had a lot of assault charges on his record and he (the applicant) was ""trying to settle down a bit"".
23In the result, his Honour was not persuaded that the applicant's evidence reflected his actual motives in sending the parcel bomb.  Rather, he was satisfied, and to the criminal standard, that the applicant was motivated by a desire to seek revenge for the fact that Ms Brindle was living with Mr Langley, a factor which he considered increased the objective seriousness of his offending behaviour.  This finding was the subject of the first ground of appeal.
24His Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offending, which he was satisfied involved planning and preparation, was diminished only by the applicant's intention to cause psychological injury and not physical injury. 
25The Crown also tendered the applicant's criminal history which included offences of violence that had been dealt with in the Local Court with non-custodial penalties imposed in 2006 and 2008.  He was sentenced to periodic detention in 2000 for an offence of stalk and intimidate with the intention of causing fear of personal injury and to a period of imprisonment in 2005 for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty.  
26At the time of his arrest in December 2012, he was subject to a s 12 bond for a further offence of assaulting police and a s 9 bond for resisting arrest.  In subsequent proceedings for breach no action was taken in respect of the s 9 bond for resisting arrest.  He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the assault police charge to date from his arrest on the subject charge.  
27It is not suggested that his Honour's reference to the applicant's criminal record and, in particular, the various entries for offences of violence, was otherwise than in accordance with a principled approach disentitling the applicant to any leniency and allowing greater emphasis to be placed upon other sentencing objectives.  His Honour concluded that this was a case where considerations of retribution, deterrence and the protection of society indicated a more severe penalty was warranted than might otherwise have been the case where a person was able to rely upon previous good character.  He did not take into account the fact that the offences were committed whilst subject to conditional liberty as aggravating the offending (as he would have been entitled to do under s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) but rather that this was a further basis for disqualifying the applicant from leniency, further confirming the need for the sentence to reflect the need for specific deterrence. 
The applicant' subjective circumstances
28The applicant was 37 years old at the time of sentence.  His two daughters were in his care and the sentencing judge accepted they regarded their father with deep affection.  His Honour noted an undated reference from a former employer in which the applicant was well regarded.  He also noted a suitability report in respect of the applicant's eligibility to be accepted into the MERIT program.  His Honour observed that, by its nature, the report was ""pithy"" with its purpose being to assess the offender's suitability to be admitted to the program.  The applicant could not avail himself of that offer because he was bail refused on the subject charges.  His Honour noted that the report stated that the applicant ""has a problem with cannabis use"" but that there was no other evidence concerning a history of drug abuse or previous attempts at rehabilitation.
29His Honour declined to make a finding that the applicant was remorseful.  In view of the applicant's evidence in the proceedings, and in the context of his criminal history, his Honour did not consider the applicant as having good prospects of rehabilitation.  He made a positive finding that he was likely to reoffend. 
30In sentencing the applicant his Honour made express reference to the governing sections of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, emphasising that in determining upon an appropriate sentence in this case retribution, punishment, and specific and general deterrence should take predominance over the other objects of sentencing.
Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the applicant's motive increased the objective seriousness of the offending 
31The sentencing judge was referred by the Crown to the decision of this Court in R v Bonnet [2013] NSWCCA 234 as authority for the proposition that were he to accept the applicant's evidence that he was motivated to send the parcel bomb to punish Mr Langley for what he believed were inappropriate advances to his daughter, the objective seriousness of the offence would be ""significantly elevated"".  That submission is a misreading of Bonnet and misstates the law.
32The applicant in Bonnet had pleaded guilty to robbery in company with deprivation of liberty contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act.  It was her role in a targeted attack on the victim to administer a drug to enable the robbery to occur.  The applicant and her co-offenders sought to justify the robbery on the basis they believed that the victim, a man aged 41, had been using one of their friends , aged 16, for sexual favours, which they considered to be morally wrong.  There was no evidence to suggest that such sexual activity as involved the victim and their friend was non-consensual.  The issue on the appeal was whether the sentencing judge was in error when referring to the need for the sentence to deter others who might be motivated to exact revenge or to administer punishment by inflicting or threatening violence on a person or people adjudged to be deserving of it.  As Adamson J observed at [34] (Gleeson JA and Hulme J agreeing), the approach of the sentencing judge was entirely consonant with what Latham J concluded in Quealey v R [2010] NSWCCA 116 at [23]-[28] after her review of the authorities where offending was motivated by vigilantism.  Adamson J also rejected the applicant's related submission that the applicant's motive ameliorated her moral culpability so as to operate in mitigation of sentence.  
33In R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 (one of the authorities to which Latham J referred), at [32] Howie J observed that the relevance of motive in any given case will depend upon the particular facts of that case.  As his Honour expressed it, motive may frequently explain why the offence was committed without condoning or excusing it.  He also observed that the existence of a motive may not be relevant in mitigation but to other factors that may impact upon the exercise of the sentencing discretion, which, in some cases, may point in opposing directions.  He went on to say: 
[32] It is importance therefore to understand that the existence of a motive for the commission of a crime and the nature of that motive may be important factors in the exercise of the sentencing discretion but may in some cases point in different directions. It may to some degree mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence yet indicate the need for a more severe sentence in order to address issues of deterrence. In some cases, as where the use of illegal drugs explains the commission of the offence, it offers no mitigation of the objectives seriousness of the offence, yet may allow significance to be given to rehabilitation of the offender: see generally Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.
34In neither Bonnet nor Quealey, nor in the cases to which Latham J referred, was consideration given to whether motives of revenge or retaliation at some actual or perceived wrong have the capacity to aggravate the objective seriousness of an offence.  This is likely because, irrespective of whether an offender is motivated by vengeance or some grievance or simply hatred to commit an offence which involves the deliberate infliction of violence, the threats of harm or perhaps deliberate damage to property, it is the nature of the particular offending and its consequences, and the offender's appreciation of the consequences of the offending, that informs an assessment of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120; 212 A Crim R 254 at [27] - cf under s 21A(2)(o) where financial motives are a statutory aggravating factor.  See also the cases which have considered the impact of competing motives of drug addiction and financial gain for sentencing purposes: Dang v R [2013] NSWCCA 246 per Basten JA at [20]-[30], Adams J at [44] and Latham J at [111]-[112]).  Whilst an assessment of an offender's moral culpability is part of an assessment of objective seriousness, care must be taken to ensure that an offender's motives (which might, in a given case, render his or her moral culpability of a high order) do not overwhelm the assessment of objective seriousness referable to the offending conduct itself.  
35In this case, irrespective of whether the applicant's motive in constructing the explosive device and parcelling it for delivery to Mr Langley was to punish him for the advances he believed had made to his (the applicant's) daughter, or, as his Honour found, to exact revenge because of Mr Langley's relationship with Ms Brindle, his motives did not elevate his moral culpability in any relevant sense nor did they serve to elevate the objective seriousness of the offending.  Were that the case, an untargeted delivery of a parcel bomb with a generalised intent to cause harm to whomever opened it might be regarded as less morally culpable.  Clearly that analysis cannot be correct.  As I see it, the only significance of the applicant's motive for sentencing purposes in this case was to meet the need for the sentence to address both general and specific deterrence.   
36The applicant submitted that since motive was an erroneous or extraneous factor that has entered the sentencing process, on a proper assessment of objective seriousness a lesser sentence was warranted at law.  The features of the applicant's offending relied upon in assessing objective seriousness in the application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) are the same as those relied upon by counsel as exposing a manifestly excessive sentence.  If that ground of appeal is made good the applicant must be re-sentenced.  That being so, it seems to me appropriate to deal with the challenge to the sentence on the basis of it being erroneously excessive before returning to the question whether his Honour's approach to the issue of motive will result in re-sentence. 
Ground 2
37To assert that a sentence is manifestly excessive is a conclusion that is arrived at after an examination of the sentence imposed and the process of reasoning which delivered that result.  While it may be helpful to enquire into the reasoning process by which a sentence was arrived at, sentencing judges at first instance must be afforded as much flexibility in the exercise of their individual sentencing discretion as is consonant with the application of principle and a consistency of approach (see Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520; 204 A Crim R 434 at [58]-59]).  
38A claim of manifest excess also requires the applicant to establish that the sentencing judge has failed to properly exercise her or his sentencing discretion and that an unjust and plainly unreasonable sentence has resulted (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321; 115 A Crim R 558). 
39In seeking to discharge that onus in this case, the applicant placed significant reliance upon the sentencing judge being satisfied that the applicant intended only to cause Mr Langley psychological injury.  Whilst an intention to cause him physical injury might have justified the imposition of a much heavier sentence, the inverse does not apply.  In my view, the fact that his Honour accepted that psychological harm was the intended result in delivery of the explosive device does not derogate from the seriousness of the applicant's offending.  Psychological injury may, depending upon the person subjected to it, be no less disabling and permanent than physical injury.  In providing for an offence under s 55(a) of the Crimes Act, the Parliament did not discriminate between an intention to cause physical or psychological harm, equally as it is not to the point for sentencing purposes that the intended victim may have been psychologically robust (about which there is no evidence in this case in any event).   
40The applicant also submitted that although the sentencing judge found there was a level of sophistication in the construction of the device, the corollary of that finding, as a matter of necessary inference, is that the applicant carefully constructed the device to ensure it would only frighten Mr Langley and that there was no danger that he (or those that handled the device or those who were in his presence when it was opened) would be physically harmed.  That submission proceeds on the assumption that the applicant had such a refined level of expertise that he could ensure the device would not operate contrary to its intended capacity.  There was no evidence of that fact, and no scientific evidence which addressed the extent of the risk of the device malfunctioning and exploding before it was opened.  The fact that the applicant incorporated ball bearings as an additional design feature, with at least a risk of them being emitted under the force of the explosion, and without it being apparent that they added to the sound of the explosion, suggests to me that something more than psychological harm was intended.  I accept, however, that without scientific evidence as to the capacity of the device to cause physical injury that was not a finding his Honour considered he could make beyond reasonable doubt 
41Counsel's submission that because the applicant intentionally disguised the parcel to resemble a postage article addressed only to Mr Langley, thereby narrowing the range of potential victims, also assumes that the parcel would only be opened by Mr Langley.  While the applicant may have intended that only Mr Langley would open the parcel, it was in fact hand-delivered to Mr Langley's aunt at his direction which, at least theoretically, extended the range of potential victims to include the person who delivered it and Ms Langley. 
42The applicant also submitted that it was relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness that there was no risk to the public by sending the item through the public postal service because the applicant's unchallenged evidence was that he did not pay for the delivery of the parcel and that the person who delivered it knew what he was carrying.  It would appear that the evidence before the sentencing judge supported the applicant's evidence, since enquiries of Australia Post revealed no record of delivery by them.  To the extent that his Honour considered that those who used the services of Australia Post were put at risk by the applicant's conduct, or that the trust that was placed in that public service was jeopardised, this may have been misplaced. 
43There was little to which the applicant could refer by way of mitigation and nothing in his subjective circumstances that called for any leniency.
44I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was well within the range of a sound exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion and that appropriate regard was given to relevant sentencing principles.  The predominant sentencing considerations in this case were punishment, personal deterrence and general deterrence which, in combination, warranted a stern sentence.  In my view, there is nothing in the sentence imposed or the reasoning that preceded it that demonstrates the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
45I would reject second ground appeal.
Is a lesser sentence warranted?
46Although the applicant has demonstrated specific error in his Honour's approach to the issue of motive, the subject of the first ground of appeal, and although I accept that it is not necessary for the purposes of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act to establish that the sentence is manifestly excessive, it remains necessary for this Court to come to the positive view that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.  
47The applicant relied upon an affidavit of 5 September 2014 as bearing on that question.  He deposes to having successfully detoxified from poly-drug use over the course of the eleven months of his remand pending sentence, that he remains drug-free and intends to maintain his sobriety on his release.  On 7 June 2014 he successfully completed the Getting SMART program which he attended twice a week for 12 weeks.  He is currently participating in group therapy on a weekly basis with a view to maintaining his resolve.  He has also obtained TAFE qualifications in thermal cutting, OHS and Manual Handling of Shift Materials.  He has worked in the pallet making shop since entering custody.  He expresses an understandable parental concern at being separated from his three teenage children, although there is no evidence to suggest that they are in any way at risk in his absence, with his eldest daughter having taken over his Department of Housing lease.  He also said that, on reflection, he should not have sent the device and that he well appreciates that it was wrong to do so.  He said:
I didn't realise I scared them as much as I did until after I read their statements.  When I think about the victims I feel terrible having made someone else go through that. I didn't know at the time that they have a baby in the house. Knowing that now and having kids myself, I know that it was really bad and it made me feel really guilty. 
48Although it appears the applicant has gained additional insight whilst serving his sentence which, I am prepared to accept, improves his prospects of rehabilitation from the adverse finding made by the sentencing judge, I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law, having regard to what I am satisfied was very serious offending against the section, even accepting that the undiscounted sentence is half of the maximum penalty provided by the legislature.
49The orders I propose are:
1.  Leave to appeal is granted.2.  The appeal is dismissed.
50ADAMSON J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

2764918,R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 1368,"ex tempore Judgment

Admissibility of document (ref T2023)


	
	This is the 32nd day of the trial. Three days ago the Crown notified the legal representatives of the accused that it proposed to tender a further seven bundles of documents. They were seized during various searches that were undertaken during the investigation that led to the laying of charges.
	
	
	The next day, copies of that material, together with a short note outlining its asserted relevance, were served on the legal representatives of the accused.
	
	
	Both senior counsel for the accused advised the Court at an appropriate time that they took objection to its tender. The practical reason for their objection was the extremely late stage in the conduct of the Crown case that they were notified the material was to be relied upon. The legal basis for the objection was s 146(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (“the CPA”), and s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). (It was not contended that s 146 of the CPA was not “picked up” by s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)).
	
	
	I heard argument in respect of the admissibility of one of the seven bundles, and determined to pronounce a judgment in respect of it in anticipation that my reasons would assist the parties in considering the fate of the remaining six.
	
	
	The background to this matter was set out in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No. 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068. I will not repeat it. It is, however, necessary to explain some further aspects of the procedural background. Both accused were arrested in the first half of 2012. They were committed for trial on 28 May 2013. They were arraigned in this Court on 1 November 2013. At that time, a trial date of 4 August 2014 was set.
	
	
	On 4 April 2013, orders were made in accordance with Division 3, Part 3 of Chapter 3 the CPA for the service of material. They required the Crown to serve material in accordance with s 142 of the CPA. On or about 26 May 2014, the Crown did so.
	
	
	Section 142(1)(f) of the CPA requires the Crown, as part of that process, to include in its notice a copy of any exhibit that the prosecutor proposed to adduce at the trial. In relation to that requirement, the Crown's notice stated:
	


“In addition to the documents contained in the Crown tender bundle, the Crown intends to adduce:

1.    original diaries, notebooks and work books seized.

2.    original company stamps ie chops seized and produced.

3.    if necessary, any original other document contained in the Crown tender bundle"".


	
	In accordance with the order of the Court, responses to the Crown's notice were in due course filed.
	
	
	The trial did not commence on 4 August 2014. Instead, both accused were arraigned before the jury on 21 August 2014. In the interim, the Court determined a number of pre-trial applications. Further, a significant degree of case management was undertaken during that period.
	
	
	Amongst other matters, the Court required the Crown to provide full particulars of the charges. Further, the legal representatives of the parties engaged in long discussions, which led to the tender of a 18-volume Crown bundle at the time of the Crown's opening. Each juror was provided with a copy.
	
	
	As I have stated, the trial is now at day 32. Around 20 witnesses have already been called in the Crown case. A large number of documents, additional to the jury bundle that I have referred to, have been tendered. Two witnesses remain to be called in the Crown case.
	
	
	As stated, I heard argument concerning the first bundle of Crown material (“Folder 1”). That material consists of a folder and accompanying documents which were located at the home of the accused, Anthony Dickson, during the execution of a search warrant.
	
	
	The documents found within Folder 1 include some faxes, some bank statements and the like and some handwritten documents concerning, or which appear to concern, the distribution of funds received by NeuMedix Health Australasia Pty Limited pursuant to its structured finance deal with the ANZ Banking Group. In broad terms the material appears to be directed towards the charge which is the subject of Count 6.
	
	
	The material in Folder 1 can be conveniently divided into two categories. The first consists of originals of documents that have already been tendered. The tender of such documents was specifically adverted to by the Crown in the extract from the Crown notice that I have already referred to.
	
	
	Upon being pressed, senior counsel for both accused did not object to the tender of those original documents, nor did they indicate any objection to the jury being advised where those documents were found and their proximity to other documents that were in evidence.
	
	
	The second category of documents within Folder 1 consists of documents not previously tendered, that is, documents, that were not notified as exhibits proposed to be tendered in accordance with s 142(1)(f).
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that they had undertaken extensive pre-trial disclosure which involved the provision, or at least the making available, of some 100 folders of documents to both accused which included this material.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I understand the Crown to accept, and I certainly find, that its proposal to tender these documents would involve it seeking to adduce evidence in circumstances where it had failed to disclose the evidence to the other party ""in accordance with the requirements of pre-trial disclosure imposed by or under [Division 3]"", such that it engages the power under s 146(1) to exclude it being adduced.
	
	
	This, in my view, is no technical quibble. This case is extremely complex and heavily document intensive. There is a world of difference in terms of fairness between a party being told that there is a document somewhere to be found within 100 folders of documents and a party being specifically advised that a document is sought to be tendered in evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, it follows that, in my view, the discretion imposed by s 146(1) of the CPA to exclude the second category of documents in Folder 1, as well as the folder itself, has arisen.
	
	
	In the time available, I have not been able to undertake any detailed research concerning the factors governing the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 146(1). Nevertheless, I am proceeding on the basis that those factors include: any reasons, or absence of reasons, for the relevant non-compliance; the probative value of the material sought to be adduced; any unfair prejudice occasioned by the tender of the material or, more importantly, by its late notification to the accused that it was proposed to be tendered and, overall, whether to allow its tender would be consistent with the conduct of a fair trial.
	
	
	In relation to the reasons for the failure of the Crown to advise the accused that this category of documents was proposed to be tendered, it was not suggested that there was any deliberate or reckless non-compliance with the order made under s 142.
	
	
	Instead, as is often the case in complex cases, it appears that a recent review, or at least a re-review, of the original documents was undertaken which led to the formation of the conclusion in the Crown camp that it should seek to tender the entirety of the folder.
	
	
	Nevertheless, as senior counsel for Mr Issakidis put it, this truly involves the revisiting of an earlier decision as it is clear that some of the documents in Folder 1 had already been selected for inclusion in the Crown bundle.
	
	
	I have already adverted to the need, in a case such as this, for the Crown to identify the material that it relies on to prove its case at an early stage and before the trial commences.
	
	
	Trials are not well rehearsed plays. Mistakes can occur in their preparation and their conduct. Nevertheless, the history that I have outlined indicates that the Crown was given more than ample time to identify the material it sought to rely on. Proceedings such as this are simply too complex and cumbersome to be patched up as they go.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that in a letter from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the accused of 26 May 2014, which enclosed the notice of the Crown case, the following was stated:
	


“The Crown reserves its right to lead additional evidence at trial from the larger brief of evidence if it is required to do so and notwithstanding it is not included in the Crown tender bundle. It is envisaged that such material would be limited and likely in response to developments at trial. including the Defence case.”


	
	It is not contended that anything that has occurred during the course of the trial has warranted a reconsideration of the Crown's position to justify the tender of Folder 1.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I attribute very little weight to this reservation in this letter. The Crown cannot reserve a power to exempt itself from the operation of s 142(1)(f).
	
	
	The entire point of the pre-trial disclosure regime is to avoid complex trials going off the rails by additional material being adduced which catches the accused by surprise.
	
	
	In the end result, the background to this matter which I have set out above tends reasonably strongly in favour of a decision to exclude the second category of documents in Folder 1.
	
	
	As part of the process of considering the application under s 146(1) as well as the application under s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995, I required the Crown Prosecutor to identify the forensic significance of each of the documents in Folder 1 so that I could consider their probative value and any questions of prejudice.
	
	
	The bulk of the ""new"" documents, that is, those documents that have not already been tendered, consist of handwritten material produced mostly by the accused, Mr Dickson, or apparently produced by him, being various calculations concerning amounts received from the ANZ transaction that he apparently proposed to move through certain offshore accounts.
	
	
	However, it needs to be noted that Mr Dickson has already provided an admission to the Court that he was responsible for managing and causing all of the relevant banking transactions to occur. In light of that admission, I consider that the probative value of the material I have just described, to be low.
	
	
	However, I also note that buried within one of the documents apparently authored by Mr Dickson are two pages that appear to outline a proposed division of the funds received from the ANZ transaction during the financial year 2007 between Mr Dickson, Mr Issakidis and another person.
	
	
	I accept that this material appears to have some level of probative value concerning Count 6 and possibly Count 1 in that, on one view, it appears to contemplate the receipt and distribution of all of those funds free of any tax liabilities, and otherwise their distribution to himself and Mr Issakidis which, when coupled with later evidence, could be characterised as having been disguised as transactions such as loans.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that view, I nevertheless consider that this material should still be excluded under s 146(1).
	
	
	At the risk of repetition, it is in my view self-evidently clear that a considered decision must have been made at an earlier stage not to adduce it and it is now only been tendered late. The explanation, such as it is, is far from persuasive.
	
	
	Although I have accepted that this material has some probative value, I do not accept that it is particularly high, given the very rudimentary nature of the calculations that are set out on the documents in question.
	
	
	There is, however, within Folder 1 another document which consists of three stapled pages. The third page of that document is already in evidence. It is a typed note addressed to ""Zac"". There is evidence that has been adduced in the trial that ""Zac"" is Mr Issakidis' nickname. The note requests that ""Zac reconcile numbers re cash and send to me in mail to home address”.
	
	
	The note appears to be, at least arguably, a reference to reconciling the distribution of cash received from the structured finance transactions within ANZ during the financial year 2008. The typed note appears to contemplate a division of the proceeds and arguably, on one view, a disguising of their distribution, possibly by a loan to ""Zac"".
	
	
	Within the folder stapled to the front of this note are two handwritten pieces of paper, the first of which bears the date “9 July 2008”. (The typed note was headed ""Friday 4 July"").
	
	
	The first two handwritten pages are arguably a response to the typed note. They address the division of an amount that corresponds with the cash received from the structured finance deals with ANZ during the financial year 2008.
	
	
	44 The note proposes a division or distribution of some of those funds between someone with the initials “MI” and another person. There are also some pencilled comments on the note. It is at least arguable that the two pages constitute the response of ""Zac"" that is, possibly Mr Issakidis, to the request made in the handwritten note of 4 July.  
	
	
	The combination of the three pages is capable of suggesting that various loans issued to ""MI"" or ""Zac"" were, in truth, distributions.
	
	
	In my view, this document has a reasonable level of probative value at least insofar it concerns Count 6 in relation to both accused.
	
	
	What is to be done in relation to these extra two pages? In that regard I return to the relevant breach of s 142 that I have identified, namely, the failure of the prosecution to include in its notice advice to the accused that the document would be tendered.
	
	
	With this document, the relevant failure is not to advise the accused that the balance of two pages of a three-page document would be tendered. In substance, what the Crown is seeking to do is to complete the tender of an incomplete document that is already in evidence. When the matter is categorised in that way and when I have regard to its potential probative value, I consider it is in a different category to the other new documents found within Folder 1. I cannot exclude the potential for there to be some procedural unfairness to Mr Issakidis, in particular, but to Mr Dickson as well from its tender at this point, but I find it difficult to see that there is any such prejudice that could not be cured by the Crown being required to recall any witness that they may require.
	
	
	Accordingly, with some reluctance, I will allow the tender by the Crown of the original of that three-page document of which the third page is already page 2502 of Exhibit A.
	
	
	However, this still leaves the possible application of s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 in respect of that document. One matter of prejudice that was pointed to in the submissions was that there may be some impression created in the jury by the tender of a new folder that there had been a “late breaking discovery” of great forensic significance by the Crown. It follows from the rulings I have already made in respect of s 146, that the Crown will not be permitted to tender any folder. Instead, the limit of the tender of truly new material consists of the additional two pages of a document, which has already been tendered in evidence. Subject to the possible need to recall a witness, I am not persuaded that there is any danger of unfair prejudice from that course being taken. The jury could simply be told that there is an additional two pages of the Crown bundle (Exhibit A) that were omitted and they can be included in their folders or tendered separately.
	
	
	It follows that I would allow the tender of the original three-page document. I will allow the tender of the original documents already in evidence and the jury to be apprised of the location of those documents and their proximity to any other documents in evidence.
	
	
	I reject the balance of the tender of Folder 1.
	
	
	It will be for the parties to consider the course they will take in respect of the remaining six bundles. It should be noted, however, to this point the only documents that I have allowed to be tendered beyond those which are already in evidence consists of two pages, which simply complete a document that has already been tendered. I so find.

		14 June 2016",2014-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764920,WorkCover Authority of NSW v Buslines Group [2014] NSWDC 377,"SENTENCE


	
	The defendant pleads guilty to a charge that on 9 June 2011 at Lismore it failed to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of its employee, Rikkie-Leigh Birbeck, contrary to the provisions of s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.
	
	
	The defendant is a bus company operating in the northern areas of New South Wales. It operates a fleet of 220 vehicles with approximately 350 staff. It employs 31 bus mechanics with six working at the Lismore Bus Maintenance Depot. Ms Birbeck was there employed as an apprentice. She was ats the time of her injuries, a second year apprentice aged 19.
	
	
	The risk arose in the following circumstances. Ms Birbeck had been asked if she wished to “have a go” at replacing a piece of equipment known as a steering damper on one of the buses. Ms Birbeck drove the bus to the place at which the work was to be done and lay upon a skidboard which she moved into a position underneath the front of the bus where the piece of equipment was to be replaced.
	
	
	The bus upon which she was working was equipped with a mechanically operated air suspension system, permitting the bus to be changed between a raised position and what is called a knelt position.
	
	
	The knelt position lowers the bus by some 125 millimetres to make it easier for passengers to board. After the passengers are aboard the normal running position is the raised position. When Ms Birbeck commenced the work the bus was in the raised position.
	
	
	Five minutes after commencing the work Ms Birbeck perceived that the bus suspension had been lowered and she was stuck. She called for assistance. A Mr Hyde, responding to her call, came to her aid. Accepting Ms Birbeck’s conclusions as to what had happened Mr Hyde thought to raise the suspension.
	
	
	To do this he leaned through the window of the bus and turned on the engine. He then turned the switch which permits the bus to kneel or raise to what he thought was the raised position, (believing that the bus was then in the kneeling position).
	
	
	Unfortunately, because of something inherent in the mechanism, the movement of the switch caused air to be released from the suspension system in consequence of which the bus lowered some distance, between 3 and 25 millimetres, pinning Ms Birbeck’s chest area between the underside frame of the bus and the ground.
	
	
	Mr Hyde, alerted by the hiss of air escaping, immediately ceased operation of the switch. He and other employees then placed jacks underneath the front of the bus, raised the bus and released Ms Birbeck.
	
	
	Ms Birbeck was taken to Lismore Hospital by ambulance where her diagnosis was bruised muscles on the chest. She was off work for approximately one week, resumed for a short time on light duties and then resumed her normal duties.
	
	
	It is necessary in the assessment of appropriate penalty to determine what was the risk that came home.
	
	
	A report was commissioned from an expert engineer as to how and why the bus may have been lowered in the first instance as reported by Ms Birbeck, and what would have caused the bus to lower again when the bus started up.
	
	
	The report concluded that even in the most extreme case, with full air loss, the front suspension would not have lowered from the raised position.s
	
	
	The air suspension system fitted to the bus, a Mercedes Benz 0405 bus, has been in service for more than 20 years and is known to be both reliable and stable. It is apparently common practice to work under these buses without jacking the body to stop any movement.
	
	
	I am persuaded on the evidence that Ms Birbeck’s perceptions were wrong. The mechanical inspection established that there was no means by which the bus would have lowered while she was under it.
	
	
	It is apparent however that the bus did lower when Mr Hyde attempted to change the suspension setting from kneel to raise. It was this action that caused the bus to lower a short distance, causing the injuries to Ms Birbeck.
	
	
	The particulars to which the defendant pleads in the amended summons consist of a failure to conduct a risk assessment for the work undertaken by Ms Birbeck, failing to properly instruct and train her, effectively to instruct her that the bus must have been raised onto a mechanical hoist before replacing the damper or alternatively have props fitted so that the bus would not lower in the circumstances in which she found herself.
	
	
	The defendant also pleads to the particular that it failed to supervise Ms Birbeck in her work.
	
	
	Most relevantly the defendant pleads to the particular that it failed to devise and train workers in an emergency rescue plan for an employee trapped beneath a bus. Such a plan required that the bus be lifted off the employee using mechanical hoists where available rather than starting the engine of the bus.
	
	
	I think that had a proper risk assessment for the particular task been undertaken before the event it is foreseeable, though improbable, that the person conducting the assessment may have concluded that a person may be trapped under the bus for any number of reasons, and that it was unwise to rely upon the compressor operating the airbags to raise the bus in circumstances where there may be some initial loss of air pressure.
	
	
	I do conclude however that that circumstance, although foreseeable, was not obviously so.
	
	
	The gravity of the risk being the primary factor to consider in sentencing it is necessary to assign some value to the obvious seriousness of this offence. Relative to that factor is the extent of foreseeability. In the present circumstance I think that the culpability of the defendant in failing to foresee the particular risk that came home was not high.
	
	
	Another measure of the seriousness of the risk is the extent of harm that may have resulted from the defendant’s failures. Even if the suspension had been permitted to fall to the knelt position by Mr Hyde there was a clearance in the order of 14 centimetres between the lower part of the bus and the trolley upon which Ms Birbeck was working. There is no evidence that that clearance was associated with the risk of death or more serious harm than that which was suffered by Ms Birbeck.
	
	
	I accept that the work underneath large vehicles such as this is work which does raise possibilities of serious injury and it is necessary that there be a measure of general deterrence factored into the penalty.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that there is a particular need for subjective deterrence. I will come to that matter in the subjective features.
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS


	
	The defendant is not a company which was unaware of its responsibilities in relation to health and safety. The business was established in 1926. It is a large business and has no prior convictions. This is a remarkable achievement given the number of employees and the extent of its operations.
	
	
	The defendant did compile and publish an Occupational Health and Safety Policy. Unfortunately that policy did not include a work method statement for working underneath a bus although it did have policies in relation to the use of hoists. It seems to me that generally work under these buses without the use of jacks was unremarkable and has been the practice in the trade for many years.
	
	
	The circumstances in which the risk came home, while not impossible, were improbable. The risk may be described as the risk that while a worker was safely underneath the bus another person may inappropriately operate the air compressor to lower the bus.
	
	
	The defendant responded satisfactorily to the circumstances of the accident. It prepared a Work Method Statement for working under buses; purchased appropriate stands, and gave appropriate instructions to its employees.
	
	
	The defendant is a good corporate citizen. It contributes $20,000 to the Children’s Medical Research annually and makes other offerings to charities.
	
	
	Following the incident the defendant engaged a consultant to carry out a full review and update of its work health and safety policies and procedures. It has instituted training programs at a cost of $24,000.
	
	
	The cost of Mr Day’s engagement is not a matter of evidence but it is quite apparent that the defendant takes its obligations seriously.
	
	
	I have considered but rejected the option of engaging s 10 of the Act. That which happened to Ms Birbeck was not just physical, it must have been frightening in the extreme, indeed terrifying. I do not think her injuries would be sufficiently marked nor the lack of care, albeit slight, which led to the matter would be denunciated if no penalty was imposed.
	
	
	Given the remote nature of the foreseeability, the circumstance that more serious injuries were not probable and the attention by the defendant to its responsibilities I believe an appropriate penalty is $50,000.
	
	
	The defendant has entered a plea at the first available opportunity and cooperated with the prosecution, which entitles it to a deduction of 25%.
	
	
	The defendant is fined the sum of $37,500 and I order that WorkCover have a moiety of the fine. The defendant is to pay the costs of WorkCover in the sum of $25,000. The defendant is convicted and that penalty is imposed.

		17 February 2016",2014-10-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764921,R v Chang [2014] NSWDC 297,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Chun-Chi Chang. He has pleaded guilty to two serious crimes. Both of them are supplying heroin, one of them in a commercial quantity. Supplying heroin is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and carries a maximum of 15 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	Supplying the same drug in a commercial quantity is an offence against subs (2) of the same section. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that offence. Not only that, Parliament regards that crime as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment to that crime.
	
	
	Mr Chang pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. In this State he gets a significant benefit for that. The ultimate sentence which I impose will be reduced by 25% because of his assistance to the administration of justice.
	
	
	First I should say something about what happened which brought about the charges. They are set out in a statement of facts contained in exhibit A. There was a police undercover operation. Two men were involved - a police informer and an undercover police officer. The three men met in the Auburn RSL car park on 3 December 2013. The undercover officer bought two and a half grams of heroin from Mr Chang for $1,500. That sale amounts to the first offence. The facts say that the purpose of that purchase was as a “sample”.
	
	
	It was then agreed that Mr Chang would sell to the police undercover officer a “block” of heroin. They agreed on a price of $95,000. The conversation amongst the three men was recorded on a listening device. Mr Chang assured the undercover officer that his friend had the block and that the sample was “just chipped off” the block.
	
	
	Mr Chang was very frank in saying to the undercover officer what he did not know. He acknowledged that he had not crunched the sample off the block. When asked about the quality of the heroin he replied, “Others said they were moving it well but I, we honestly did not use it much, so have no idea.” When asked whether the sample was “straight off the block” and whether he saw another person “chopping it off” Mr Chang answered, “No he handed it to me.”
	
	
	The second offence of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin is based on that discussion. It is a supply in the sense of an agreement to supply a prohibited drug. A commercial quantity of heroin is 250 grams or above, up to one kilogram.
	
	
	Mr Chang was charged because of the price and the reference to the expression “block”. The facts say that $95,000 is the current street value of 350 grams of heroin which is referred to as a block.
	
	
	Mr Chang was arrested a few days later on 11 December 2013.
	
	
	Mr Chang has no criminal record in Australia and, as his barrister Mr L Brasch pointed out, there is no evidence of any convictions in his home country of Taiwan. A clean record is favourable to an offender.
	
	
	On the other hand there is a very unfavourable factor in Mr Chang’s case. When he committed these offences on 3 December 2013 he was on bail. He had been granted bail for an offence that he was charged with committing on 15 May 2013. He was charged with intentionally importing certain prohibited goods. The goods were two and a half kilograms of ephedrine. That was an offence against the Commonwealth criminal law.
	
	
	Mr Chang is pleading guilty to that offence and will be sentenced on 7 November 2014. But importantly for my purposes, Mr Chang used the opportunity given to him by a court to use his liberty to commit further serious offences. The law in New South Wales describes that as an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining his sentence.
	
	
	There is one argument that I need to resolve or make a decision about. Mr Brasch pointed out his client’s instructions were that he, his client, had no intention of supplying the block of heroin. It was to be a “rip off”. Mr Brasch argued that there was no evidence of his client’s capacity to supply the drugs, so I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he would actually carry out the supply.
	
	
	Mr C Bridge who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions argued that based on the recorded conversations, I could conclude that there was an intention to actually supply.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Chang intended to actually supply the block of heroin. I infer that from the terms of the conversation which was recorded. As I have noted, Mr Chang said certain things against his own interests. I think it unlikely that he would have said those things if he was intending never to supply the heroin. Nor do I regard it as likely that he would have ripped off a person in the same suburb that he lived in. I do not regard the assertion of a rip off as being a reasonable possibility, unsupported as it is by any evidence.
	
	
	Mr Brasch pointed out the personal circumstances of his client. He is 29, born and educated in Taiwan and had various jobs before coming to Australia as a tourist. That was at the end of 2012 and in 2013 he obtained a working visa and held down several jobs around Sydney. He has no family in Australia and indeed his family in Taiwan do not know about his predicament.
	
	
	Mr Brasch also argued that the seriousness of the crime was towards the lower end for offences of this type. I accept that submission because the supply did not involve any drugs actually going into the community. Mr Brasch also referred me to R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at 117. The weight involved was towards the lower end of the range.
	
	
	Mr Brasch argued that his client’s first time in custody in a foreign country with few visitors and very limited English would amount to special circumstances for giving him a longer parole period after serving the minimum sentence.
	
	
	I have taken into account the statistics provided by Mr Brasch issued by the New South Wales Judicial Commission.
	
	
	This is a case where the offender must obviously go to gaol full-time; there is no alternative. I regard an important aspect of sentencing Mr Chang as being protecting the community, given that he committed this offence whilst on bail for another serious drug related offence.
	
	
	I come now to say what the sentence will be. For the supply of a commercial quantity of heroin I would regard a sentence of five years as being appropriate without the aggravating factor of committing the crime on bail. That is a very important aggravating factor and I would regard an appropriate sentence as being six years imprisonment.
	
	
	For the supply of the two and a half grams of heroin an appropriate sentence would be two years, but two and a half years because of the aggravating circumstance.
	
	
	Looking at the higher sentence of six years first, because Mr Chang pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity I will reduce that by 25% so that his sentence is four and a half years.
	
	
	It is appropriate that his sentence for the more serious and the less serious offences be served at the same time. This is because the crimes were committed at the same time and were part of the same transaction. In due course I will impose one sentence for both crimes. That one sentence will be four and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	I indicate that the sentence I would have imposed for the less serious offence would be two and a half years; but reduced by 25% would be one year and ten months.
	
	
	For a sentence of four and half years, which is the sentence I will impose on Mr Chang, Parliament has provided that normally three-quarters of that must be served in gaol. That would mean that his non-parole period would be about three years and four months. I am going to reduce that non-parole period by a small amount to three years imprisonment because of what Mr Brasch referred to as special circumstances. I do not regard a non-parole period of less than three years as appropriate for this crime.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I am going to sentence you now if you would stand up.


	
	Under s 53A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of both crimes instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each one. The aggregate sentence is a non-parole period of three years commencing on 11 December 2013 when Mr Chang was arrested and expiring on 10 December 2016. The additional term will be one year and six months commencing 11 December 2016 and expiring on 10 June 2018. The sentence I would have imposed for the less serious offence is one year and ten months.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Have a seat Mr Chang I will explain that in a moment. Mr Bridge any corrections, any other orders I have to make? I don’t think so. I don’t direct parole because it’s a matter for the Parole Authority.

BRIDGE: Just in regard to the forfeiture order that I asked for.


	
	Under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 I make an order for the destruction of the 2.44 grams of heroin actually supplied by Mr Chang.
	


HIS HONOUR   Now I’ve done that, I will explain to the offender in a moment. I think that’s all Mr Brasch?

BRASCH: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Your prison sentence is four and a half years do you understand?

INTERPRETER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: It commenced on the day you were arrested on 11 December last year. It will therefore expire on 10 June 2018. There is a minimum period you must spend in gaol of three years. That commenced on the same day 11 December 13 and will expire on 10 December 2016. On that day you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not will depend on the Parole Authority not me. But of course you will be also sentenced for the other offence which will affect that as well. Do you understand Mr Chang?

INTERPRETER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr Brasch?

BRASCH: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Bridge?

BRIDGE: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I thank you Ms Li, Mr Chang can be taken down.

		06 March 2015",2014-10-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764933,Aiken v R [2014] NSWCCA 213,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2ROTHMAN J:  I also agree with R A Hulme J.  I confirm that upon my own reading of the evidence at trial I am satisfied that the verdict was not unreasonable or unsupported.
3R A HULME J:  Frances Mary Aiken was found guilty after a judge-alone trial in the District Court of an offence of driving in a manner dangerous to other persons whereby her car was involved in an impact which occasioned the death of Mathew Aiken.  
4This is an offence contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.  His Honour Judge McLoughlin SC subsequently sentenced Ms Aiken to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, with effect from 13 December 2013.
5The appeal is only against conviction.
6The grounds of appeal assert that the judge failed to give sufficient reasons for his determination that the appellant was driving in a manner dangerous to other persons (ground 1) and that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence (ground 2).  There is no merit in either ground.
Overview of the case
7Just after 4.00pm on 7 October 2010 Ms Aiken was driving her car along Princes Highway just north of, and away from, Batemans Bay.  She moved into a right-turn only lane in order to make a turn into Berrima Parade.  She brought the car to a stop.  She then commenced to make the turn but an oncoming car collided with the passenger side of her car.  Tragically, her 16 year-old nephew, who was sitting in the front passenger's seat, was killed.  There was evidence that Ms Aiken had consumed cannabis to an extent that her driving ability was impaired.
8Ms Aiken later told police that her car had stalled.  There was an assertion by an expert called in the defence case that the driver of the oncoming car could have swerved to avoid the collision.
9The Crown case was that ""she was driving in a dangerous manner [because] she drove her car into the path of the oncoming car at a point where there was just no opportunity for that car to avoid the collision and at a time when she was affected by substances"". (AB 383.40)
10The Crown called to give evidence the driver of a car that was immediately behind Ms Aiken's car (Raymond Smith); the driver of the oncoming car that collided with her (Sandra McKenzie); the driver of a car waiting to make a left hand turn out of Berrima Parade to travel towards Batemans Bay (Paul Smart); a police officer who investigated the collision (Sergeant Mark Dudley); a pharmacologist who gave evidence of Ms Aiken's impairment from cannabis ingestion (Dr Judith Perl); and a consulting engineer who gave evidence of his interpretation of the collision (Mr Grant Johnston).  The defence case comprised evidence from a consulting forensic engineer concerning his interpretation of the collision (Mr John Jamieson).
The issue
11It was accepted by counsel for Ms Aiken that the only issue was whether the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that she was driving in a manner that was dangerous to other persons. This required the Crown to prove that the manner of driving was:
""intrinsically in all circumstances, or because of the particular circumstances surrounding the driving, ... in a real sense potentially dangerous to a human being or human beings who as a member or as members of the public may be upon or in the vicinity of the roadway on which the driving is taking place"":  per Barwick CJ in McBride v The Queen [1966] HCA 22; 115 CLR 44 at 49-50; cited with approval in Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 579 fn 23 and King v The Queen [2012] HCA 24; 245 CLR 588 at [32] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
12In contrasting driving in a manner dangerous to the public from negligent driving, Barwick CJ continued in McBride v The Queen to say (at 50):
""The concept with which the section [i.e. s 52A of the Crimes Act] deals requires some serious breach of the proper conduct of a vehicle upon the highway, so serious as to be in reality and not speculatively, potentially dangerous to others.""
Ground 1 - insufficiency of reasons
13The learned trial judge gave reasons for his verdict of guilty which included a recitation of the principles of law he was required to apply (see Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250), a review of the evidence, findings of fact, and a conclusion expressed as follows:
""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established that the accused's driving amounts to a serious breach of proper management and control of a vehicle at the time of impact, in that she drove her vehicle into the path of the oncoming vehicle [which was] travelling at a speed of approximately ninety kilometres per hour with a clear view [available to Ms Aiken], putting Ms McKenzie into an impossible situation with the inevitability of a heavy impact occurring.  In my view such driving was an extremely serious breach of the proper management and control of a vehicle and significantly more than momentary inattention or misjudgement.""
14(In early passages of his judgment his Honour set out his findings of fact in more detail and I extract some of the passages below when dealing with Ground 2.)
15It was contended by Ms Aiken's counsel that these reasons were deficient in that they amounted to ""a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge had applied and the findings of fact that he had made.  What was required was an exposition of the reasoning process linking them and justifying the verdict.""  It was contended that the judge's findings ""would have been as equally applicable to a finding of negligent driving"" and ""failed to identify why the driving of the appellant amounted to a serious breach of the proper management and control of the vehicle"".  
16In my view, the explanation provided by the judge in announcing the finding expressed in the above extract from his judgment more than adequately explained his conclusion that Ms Aiken's driving was dangerous to other persons in the sense explained in McBride v The Queen.  The judge did not go on to say that the ""serious breach of the proper management and control of [the] vehicle"" was ""so serious as to be in reality and not speculatively, potentially dangerous to others"". That was not the subject of the argument raised under this ground.   In any event, as Ms T Smith, counsel for the Crown put it succinctly in her submissions, there was no need for further elaboration by the judge ""because it was obviously so"".  
17This ground must be rejected.
Ground 2 - unreasonable or unsupportable verdict
18Principles relating to a ground asserting that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable or is not supported by the evidence are so well-known that there is no need to recite them once again in a judgment of this Court.  A summary of them can be found in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14]. 
19It was submitted that it was not open to the trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Ms Aiken's guilt.  The evidence did not establish the extent to which her driving ability was impaired by her cannabis consumption. The findings as to the speed at which, and manner in which, she was driving were just as consistent with a finding of negligent, rather than dangerous, driving.  
20The judge found that there was some unsatisfactory features of the evidence of the two engineers.  He preferred, and accepted, the evidence of Mr Smith (the driver the car behind Ms Aiken) and Ms McKenzie (the driver of the oncoming car).  He found that their evidence was consistent as to what had occurred.
21His Honour stated:
""In my view the evidence of both Ms McKenzie and Mr Smith is consistent.  They both gave evidence in laymen's terms of the accused's vehicle moving out into the path of Ms McKenzie's vehicle, hesitating after a distance of twenty to thirty centimetres, and then moving off again as if to complete the turn, and in circumstances where little time was given for Ms McKenzie to deal with the emergency situation that had thus been created."" (AB 19-20)
22After referring to aspects of the evidence of the engineers, he said:
""In my view this matter is principally determined by the reliability or otherwise of Mr Smith and Ms McKenzie.  [Defence counsel] attacks their reliability in a manner to which I have referred.  The difficulty for him in that submission is, in my view, they both independently of each other have given general evidence of their observations which are consistent. It may be, as lay people, they do not have exact recall of distances and/or times.  One would not expect that they would.
From the evidence it is clear that the accused's vehicle was stationary for some time before proceeding to commence its right hand turn.  During that time Ms McKenzie's vehicle was approaching the intersection of the Princes Highway and Berrima Parade.  However it would appear to have been, as the accused's vehicle commenced to move, that there was a stutter or something occurred at twenty to thirty centimetres whilst it was still on its correct side of the road.  I accept the evidence of Ms McKenzie and Mr Smith that that vehicle then commenced to make its right hand turn in a normal way straight into the path of Ms McKenzie's vehicle with little Ms McKenzie could do to avoid it.  
Much has been put that she could have swerved to the left or the right.  Bearing in mind the reaction time that would be required by Ms McKenzie, she was no doubt further than the five metres or so that she said she was when the vehicle commenced to come into her path.  The time required for the accused's vehicle to get from a standing start to the position of impact and Ms McKenzie's vehicle to impact, would not support a view that Ms McKenzie was only five metres away at that time.  However, I accept that she was at a distance which would not have allowed her to swerve or to brake to avoid impact and it was the accused's driving in this manner which projected her vehicle into the roadway which occasioned impact and brought about the unfortunate death of the deceased."" (AB 23-24)
23A little later, his Honour said:
""[I]n my view [Ms Aiken's] vehicle did not stall in [Ms McKenzie's] path.
... I do not accept Mr Johnston's view of the speed of the accused's vehicle at the time of impact nor do I accept, if that be Mr Jamieson's evidence, that the vehicle was stationary.  I accept the evidence of the lay witnesses, Ms McKenzie and Mr Smith, that it was moving and moving as a normal right hand turn at the time of impact."" (AB 25)
24The judge noted that Dr Perl was unable to say definitively how much Ms Aiken's cannabis ingestion would have impaired her driving ability because it was not known how tolerant she was to the drug.  But even if she did have a tolerance, Dr Perl said that there would still have been impairment to some extent. The judge described this as ""an explanation"" for the manner of Ms Aiken's driving.
25With there being no challenge in this Court to the findings of fact by the trial judge set out in the above extracts, there is no doubt that it was open to him to find beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Aiken was driving in a manner dangerous to other persons at the time of the collision.
26This ground must be rejected as well.
Order
27I propose the following orders:
1.  Leave to appeal granted.
2.  Appeal dismissed.

		03 October 2014",2014-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764938,Atai v R [2014] NSWCCA 210,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The applicant Masood Atai (the accused at trial), sought leave to appeal against his conviction by a jury for the murder of Mr Ang Van Ly at Fairfield on 24 November 2009.  He also sought leave to appeal against his sentence, being imprisonment for a mandatory period of 18 years with a balance of term of six years.  The background to the offending and the conduct of the trial are detailed by R A Hulme J.  I agree that the appeal against conviction should be rejected and, subject to the following observations, with his reasons.  I would uphold the challenge to the sentence imposed.
Unreliability warning2Section 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies to ""evidence of a kind that may be unreliable"".  The categories of such evidence are not limited, but include evidence given by a witness ""who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding"": s 165(1)(d).  A warning ""is to"" be given if a party so requests, unless the judge is satisfied that there are ""good reasons for not doing so"": s 165(3).  There may be constraints in other provisions of the Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), but subject to such extraneous provisions, s 165 does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning: s 165(5).
3Counsel for the accused did seek a warning on the basis that Mr Yazin ""may have been criminally involved in the enterprise"": Tcpt, summing up, 20/09/11, p 34.  The trial judge noted that Mr Yazin had talked about ""involvement"" and asked counsel to identify the passage, which he promptly did.  The judge, correctly, rejected the application based on that passage, as it did not indicate involvement in the criminal enterprise with which the accused was charged.  It is not entirely clear from the transcript whether the whole of the discussion with counsel is recorded; there is a suggestion that it may not have been.  In any event, there was no submission in this Court that counsel sought to base the application on some firmer foundation.
4There was, however, an alternative basis for such an application, although the formulation of an appropriate direction would have required careful consideration by counsel for the accused.  As R A Hulme J explains, the case for the accused at trial sought to diminish the involvement of Mr Yazin in the events on the evening in question and distance him further from the house where the shooting occurred than his evidence suggested.  On that case, the likelihood of him being charged as criminally involved in the events of the evening became more remote, thus diminishing the basis for alleging unreliability.  Nevertheless, the jury might have dismissed the attempts by the accused to distance Mr Yazin from the events; there might then be an increased risk that Yazin had sought to gain immunity, exonerate himself, or at least diminish his culpability, by giving evidence favourable to the prosecution case.
5There would be two obstacles to the applicant now relying upon such a complaint.  The first is the lack of an evidential basis for such a warning.  The difficulty in requiring a warning in circumstances where the basis of the supposed unreliability has not been put to the witness in cross-examination is well understood: see Clark v R [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506 at [64] (Heydon JA, Dowd and Bell JJ agreeing).  That difficulty is exacerbated where the circumstances assume a finding inconsistent with the accused's case on this point.
6The second difficulty is related to the first: it is by no means clear that an appropriate warning could have been formulated in terms acceptable to the accused.  Thus the critical elements in Yazin's evidence included the description of the position from which he said he could observe events occurring in front of the house and evidence revealing knowledge of the fact that the applicant had a weapon, both immediately before the shooting and thereafter.  At least on one view, the effect of this evidence was not to  exculpate Mr Yazin, but rather tended to inculpate him in the criminal activity.  There might be grounds for identifying unreliability on that account, but they would be quite different from the warning given with respect to a co-offender who might be seeking to exculpate himself.  
7The common purpose underlying a request pursuant to s 165 and the need for the point to be taken at trial, for the purposes of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), is to ensure that such matters are explored in the context of the trial.  If that does not happen, not only is the position that the accused would have adopted unknown, but it also unknown whether the judge would have declined to give a direction sought for good reason, including the possibility that it might have been harmful to the accused's interests or simply confusing.
8In these circumstances, although it is possible that s 165(1)(d) could have been properly invoked, that did not happen and it cannot be said that any miscarriage of justice arose under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
Unreasonable or unsupportable verdict9This was not a case in which the applicant failed to particularise the specific aspects of the case said to give rise to an unreasonable or unsupportable verdict.  It was also not a case in which it could readily be said that the verdict of the jury was inevitable.  Accordingly, it is an appropriate case to grant leave to appeal on this ground: see Lee, Do Young v Regina; Lee, Seong Won v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [210].  
10On the other hand, it was not a case in which the evidence of the key prosecution witness (Mr Yazin) could be dismissed as not warranting acceptance on critical elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.  There were, as explained by R A Hulme J, elements of his evidence which could have been (and were) relied upon to demonstrate unreliability sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.  This was not, however, a case in which the credibility of a key prosecution witness had to be weighed against inconsistent evidence from, for example, the accused or a witness called by the accused.  This case required the jury to assess the credibility and reliability only of the prosecution witness.  For this Court to carry out an independent assessment of Mr Yazin's evidence involves a consideration of all the surrounding evidence, whether it is inconsistent with, supportive of or neutral with respect to his evidence.  In not dissimilar circumstances in Lee, this Court held:
""[191] The Criminal Appeal Act is said to follow the 'common form' found in many (but not all) Australian jurisdictions, which derived from the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (UK).  The ground on which such intervention is permitted (and required) is where the appeal court is 'of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence': s 6(1), first limb.  The use of internal commas indicates that both unreasonableness and absence of support are to be judged by reference to 'the evidence', including evidence accepted by the appeal court but not given at trial: s 12. 
[192] Appellants sometimes rely upon this ground, rather than the third limb (namely that there has been a miscarriage of justice 'on any other ground') to avoid identifying with precision any particular gap in the evidence or ground upon which a miscarriage may have occurred, while requiring the Court to apply the principles stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494:
'If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.'
[193] The Court in M then stated that the appellate court was not substituting its decision for that of the jury's verdict, 'for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'.  However, at 493, the joint reasons stated:
'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.'
[194] It is now clear that references to whether a particular conclusion was 'open to the jury' were not to be understood as requiring the appeal court to ask 'whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence': SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [20] (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ).  Further, it is erroneous to consider the central question 'whether on the evidence the Court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences - as rather an ancillary question to the question whether there was a sufficiency of evidence to sustain the conviction'.""
11Applying these principles, the ground should be rejected, for the reasons articulated by R A Hulme J.
Sentence12A sentence of 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years involves severe punishment.  Factors warranting a lower rather than higher sentence included the age of the offender (18 years), a finding as to his ""considerable immaturity"" and his severely disadvantaged background.  On the other hand, he was identified as the leader of the gang which went to the house; although the offence may be described as not premeditated, he was carrying a loaded revolver and fired it, albeit without an intention to kill, in circumstances where there was no threat or fear of violence directed at him and where the intended purpose of the activities, which may have been to obtain drugs, had apparently been frustrated.
13The trial judge described the offence as ""above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences"", but it not possible to place much weight on that characterisation because of the usual vagueness as to what is said to constitute a ""mid-range"". 
14The applicant put before the Court two groups of possibly comparable cases, each limited to offenders between the ages of 18 and 20 years.  One group pre-dated the commencement of the standard non-parole period (which is 20 years), the other post-dating the introduction of that standard, but pre-dating the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, which identified potential error in the practice of this Court in conceding too much weight to the standard non-parole period.  (The error may be described as ""potential"" only because, as recent cases demonstrate, it is not always easy to know whether the error has arisen in a particular case.)  Changes in sentencing requirements and practices have thus created significant difficulties in establishing an appropriate range of sentence for murder in this State.  In Imnetu v R [2014] NSWCCA 99, I said at [29]:
""These considerations would suggest that the correct approach might involve three steps, namely:
(a) identifying a range of sentencing for murder with respect to offences committed prior to 1 February 2003;(b) identifying a comparable range for offences committed thereafter, and(c) identifying the extent to which any increase in sentencing might be ascribed to the effect of the standard non-parole period, properly considered in accordance with the principles established in Muldrock.""
15After reviewing the changes in the statutory requirements, I concluded with the following observations at [34]:
""In May 2010 the Judicial Commission of New South Wales published Monograph 33, The Impact of the Standard Non-parole Period Sentencing Scheme on Sentencing Patterns in New South Wales.  It compared sentencing in two periods, namely that from 3 April 2000 to 31 January 2003 (before the standard non-parole period provisions) and from 1 February 2003 to 31 December 2007 (after the introduction of the standard non-parole period).  With respect to offences of murder which went to trial on a not guilty plea, there were 51 cases in the 'pre-period' and 33 in the 'post-period': p 26, Fig 1.  The median full term sentence increased by almost 28% (from 18 years to 23 years) and the median non-parole period increased by almost 18% (from 14 years to 16.5 years).  There do not appear to be reliable post-Muldrock figures which might indicate what proportion of the increase resulted from a correct use of the standard non-parole period and what proportion revealed an illegitimate use.""
16The judgment in Muldrock was delivered on 5 October 2011.  As the applicant's submissions noted, all the cases relied upon decided after the introduction of the standard non-parole period (and to which it may be assumed that the standard non-parole period applied) were sentences imposed before the judgment in Muldrock.  On one view, they might be treated as reflecting no less than the upper limits of an appropriate range.  On the other hand, the sentences imposed before the standard non-parole period took effect may fail to reflect the effect of the standard non-parole period which, properly applied, tended to increase the sentences for murder.
17There is no doubt that the pre-standard non-parole period sentences involved non-parole periods in a broad range from nine to 16 years.  The cases to which the standard non-parole period applied involved non-parole periods between 10 and 20 years, although, disregarding outliers, the median appears to have been approximately 16 years, allowing, as best one can, for disparate circumstances.
18The difficulties in setting an appropriate sentence for a murder in this legally shifting regime warrants a grant of leave to appeal against the sentence imposed, which is not self-evidently within any possible range.
19The primary reasons for not interfering with the sentence in this case are twofold.  The first is that the cases reveal considerable disparity in the sentences imposed, which makes it inherently difficult to identify a ""range"" beyond which a sentence is manifestly excessive.  Secondly, although a reduction from 18 years to 16 years is a significant period of time (two years), proportionately it is a reduction of only 11%.  Whether such limited interference would be warranted, for the purposes of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, might be open to doubt.
20Despite these considerations, in my view the severity of the sentence was not warranted.  I would resentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 16 years imprisonment with an additional term of five years and four months, giving a total sentence of 21 years and four months.
21R A HULME J:  Masood Atai (the applicant) was found guilty of the murder of Ang Van Ly at Fairfield on 24 November 2009 after a trial by jury before Grove AJ in September 2011.  He was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years to date from his arrest on 10 February 2010.
22The applicant seeks leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence.  Leave is required in relation to conviction as none of the grounds involve a question of law alone: s 5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
23The grounds of appeal against conviction are:
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in:
(a) refusing to give a warning pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act regarding the evidence of 'Yazin' or, alternatively, in
(b) failing to warn the jury of the need to scrutinize the evidence of 'Yazin' with great care.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred during his summing up when explaining the significance of the appellant's trial counsel not alleging that a person other than the accused had fired the shots at the house.  (SU 22-3)
Ground 3:  Abandoned.
Ground 4:  The verdict of the jury is unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
Overview of the Crown case
24Mr Ly died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head which he sustained as he stood in the doorway of a front bedroom in a home in Cathcart Street, Fairfield at about 11pm on 24 November 2009.  The fatal shot was one of a number that had been fired from a handgun from a location in front of the home.
25Prior to the killing a convoy of four cars occupied by approximately 14 people had been driven to a park a short distance from Cathcart Street.  At about 11pm that group walked to Cathcart Street where two of the men from the group approached the home where the victim was socialising with other men.  It was the Crown case that those two were the applicant and a man described as an ""Islander"".  The Islander male approached and knocked on the front door.  He enquired after ""Johnny"".  When an occupant of the home indicated that no one by that name was present, the Islander and the applicant returned to the grass verge in front of the property.  There, according to the Crown, the applicant stopped and produced a handgun which he discharged a number of times in the direction of the home.  
26The issues at trial were whether the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt that it had been the applicant who had discharged the gun.  In the event that the jury was satisfied of this, it was then an issue as to whether he had discharged the gun with an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or did so with reckless indifference to human life in that he discharged the weapon notwithstanding he foresaw the probability of a death occurring
27The Crown case in the first of those two respects depended upon the evidence of a man who was referred to as ""Yazin"".  He gave evidence that he knew the applicant; he had been one of the group near to the subject home at the time of the shooting; and he had seen the applicant shoot at the house.
28The defence case did not involve any denial or dispute that the applicant had been present in the vicinity of the home.  But it was disputed that he was the shooter.  The primary focus of the defence case was an assertion that Yazin was lying.  It was also argued in closing address to the jury by counsel then appearing for the applicant that even if the jury were satisfied that the applicant was the shooter, they would not be satisfied that the applicant had any of the relevant mental states to make out the charge of murder.  That is, it was contended that the jury would find him guilty of manslaughter instead.
29The Crown readily conceded that the proof of guilt of the applicant depended upon the jury's acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the essential aspects of the evidence of Yazin.
Evidence review
30Because of the ground asserting that the verdict is unreasonable or not supported by the evidence it is necessary to review the evidence in some detail, particularly that of Yazin.
31Yazin said that he met the applicant, whom he knew as ""Chocolate"", in 2009 at an address in Eddy Street, Merrylands.  As at 24 November 2009 he had only met him on about three occasions.  
32He said that between 8pm and 9pm one evening in late November 2009 he received a call from the applicant asking him to come to Merrylands.  He drove there and entered the Eddy Street home.  Present were the applicant, PJ, Saboon and Masieh Amiri.  The applicant told him that they were ""going fishing"" and Yazin told him that he was not happy about this because he had been busy helping his mother.  The applicant told him to sit down and relax.
33Some time later a number of cars arrived.  The applicant went outside to talk with the occupants.  Yazin said that he could see them through the window and described four of them as being of Islander appearance and three of Lebanese appearance.  The eighth person was SZ, also known as ""Deen"".  The applicant then came inside and said, ""Let's go"".  
34(SZ stood trial with the applicant on a charge of accessory after the fact to murder.  He was acquitted.  There is no issue in the present application concerning that fact.)
35Yazin and the others followed the applicant out to the cars.  The four Islander men got into a blue BTR hatch, the driver of which was a blond woman of Australian appearance (identified in other evidence as Leanne).  Yazin, Faisal and another male referred to as Faisal's relative got into a white Torana.  The applicant got into a red car.  SZ was part of the group but Yazin was not sure which car he was in.  There were a total of four cars driving in convoy.  
36The convoy first went to a housing complex where they met a group of males whom Yazin did not know.  Yazin, Faisal and Faisal's relative stayed in the car whilst the others got out and spoke with the group for about 15 minutes.  Then they all drove to a service station which was nearby where Leanne refuelled her car.  Whilst there, the applicant and SZ went into the shop.  (There were still photographs from CCTV footage at the service station which supported the presence and movements of people at this location).  There was evidence from other witnesses in the trial supportive of an inference that the applicant and or SZ stole a pair of rubber dishwashing gloves from the cleaning products aisle in the service station shop.
37Yazin said that all four cars left the service station and headed towards Fairfield where they stopped in front of a park.  Everyone except Leanne alighted and hung around the park for about 45 minutes.  At some point, Yazin saw the applicant, SZ, Masieh Amiri and one of the Islander males leave in Amiri's car.  They were gone for 30 to 40 minutes.
38According to Yazin, when those people returned to the park the applicant had a conversation with the group.  Yazin was sitting with Faisal some distance away and did not hear what was being said.  At the end of the conversation, Yazin heard the applicant say, ""Okay, let's go"".  All of the males then followed the applicant on foot.  
39The group went across the road through a grassed area into the next street.  When they stopped, Yazin heard SZ say to the applicant, ""Let me hold it"".  The applicant replied, ""No, no, no, I've got it"".  They crossed the road some distance from the house where the shooting took place.  It was Yazin's evidence that he and most of the other males were crouching down on the footpath.  He was crouching down about two houses away from the house that was shot at.  He identified this by marking a location on a photograph (Exhibit O).  
40Yazin said he saw the applicant and one of the Islander males approach the house.  They walked up the driveway towards the house but he then lost sight of them because of a fence that blocked his view.  He then heard knocking on the door but did not hear the door open.  He then saw the applicant and the Islander male return to his line of sight at the front of the driveway.  He then heard a window open and heard the Islander male ask if ""John"" was there.  He heard a male voice reply that no one by that name lived there.  The voice came from inside the house.  He then heard another voice ask, ""What do you want?""  He said the applicant replied that they wanted to buy some ""weed"".  The second voice replied that there was no such thing there and told them to ""get out of here"".
41Yazin said that he saw the applicant take two or three steps back.  His body was facing in Yazin's direction but his head was facing the house.  He reached for a firearm with his right hand at his waist and then shot at the house.  He described the weapon as an old revolver.  He said he heard four shots.  Yazin panicked and he and the other males ran to the cars and drove off.
42They returned to the Eddy Street, Merrylands address.  PJ, Saboon and an Afghan male were already there.  The applicant arrived a short time later.  PJ asked the applicant what had happened but there was no reply; the applicant pointed at the ceiling and the walls and put his finger across his mouth.  
43The applicant then went to the bathroom and returned without his shirt on and sat down.  He had a gun in his hand and gave it to PJ.  PJ opened it and emptied the bullets into a cup or a bag.  He indicated the number four with his hand and said, ""Fuck fuck, there is only two left"".  Yazin left soon after and did not know what happened to the gun or the bullets.
44Yazin also gave evidence that he had seen the gun, which he described as a ""cowboy type gun"", for the first time two days earlier at the Eddy Street house.  On that occasion the applicant had been wearing it at his waist.  He provided a description of the weapon which included that it was a revolver.
45The day after the shooting, Yazin went to the Eddy Street home after receiving a call from Masieh Amiri.  When he got there he saw the applicant, Amiri, Faisal, PJ, Saboon and two other males he did not know.  They all went outside the house and the applicant told them that what had happened the previous night was not to be mentioned again, especially not to the police.  He threatened them with death if they spoke to the police.  He said the applicant told them that there had been four Asian males at the house.  He said they all had guns and a couple of them had tattoos and they were all in the backyard.  He claimed that ""if he hasn't done what he did, we'd all end up being shot"". PJ told the applicant that he needed to get rid of his clothes and someone else told him to get rid of the gun.  
46There was no issue about Yazin's ability to identify both the applicant and SZ.  He later identified them from a police photo array but there was no issue raised about that aspect of the evidence.
47Matters raised in the cross-examination of Yazin will be referred to later in the context of some of the grounds of appeal.
Witnesses who were in the convoy
48Leanne gave evidence that she was driving a blue Hyundai i30.  She drove various males to various locations which she described without a great deal of specificity.  The passengers in her car were primarily of Islander background but at times there were others.  Her evidence supported the proposition that gloves were taken from the service station.  Her evidence was consistent with that of Yazin in that after they had arrived at the park she drove some of the males away to another location before returning.  Once back at the park she remained at her car while the males walked away.  She said that after about 15 minutes she heard four or five loud bangs and then saw the men running back to the cars.  One of the passengers who had been in her car earlier, Pena Tulemau, told her to ""go go go"".  She was directed to drive to other locations which did not include the Eddy Street, Merrylands address.  Her evidence was that she was first approached by police in December 2009 but did not tell them the truth about what had happened on the night because she was scared ""they"" would do something to her.  She was again spoken to by police in January 2010 when she told them the truth.
49Charles Varu gave evidence that he was one of the passengers in the blue car driven by a female he knew as ""L"" (obviously Leanne).  His evidence was that they drove around and met up with a number Iraqi males.  They drove to various locations including a service station where Leanne refuelled.  At that point there were now about four cars travelling together.  He said that at one point the males stopped at a park for some time before they walked towards a house and he followed.  He spoke of some of the group walking towards a house where, he was later told, Pena (Tulemau) knocked on the door.  He did not hear any conversation.  He then heard three gunshots and said everyone then turned and ran.  
50Mr Varu said that he did not see anyone with a gun that night and did not see anyone do the shooting.  They then drove home.  Mr Varu denied handling a gun that night and denied shooting anyone.
51Moeakiola Tunitau Usaia gave evidence that he knew a female he called ""L"".  His evidence was of little credibility; he claimed that he was too ""wasted"" to remember whether some people were with him.  He had been drinking and taking drugs all day.  He could not remember whether he had shot anyone in Fairfield on 24 November 2009. But he gave a straightforward ""no"" when asked whether he had a gun in his hand at any time that night. 
52Masieh Amiri said that he was friends with the applicant, whom he knew as Chocolate, and the co-accused Deen.  In 2009 he drove a black Holden Astra.  He said that in relation to the evening of 24 November 2009 he could not recall anything.  He agreed that a car shown in a photograph taken at the service station in question depicted his car.  He did not know the person in the photograph shown getting into his car.  He denied shooting at a house in Fairfield on the relevant evening.  
53Pasoon Jadran claimed that he had never heard anyone refer to him as ""PJ"".  His brother was Saboon Jadran.  He knew the applicant and SZ but denied ever being at the house in Eddy Street, Merrylands when either one of them was present.
54Mr Jadran said that he knew the applicant from the Afghan community but did not socialise with him and had not been at the house in Eddy Street with him.  He said that he did not handle or see a .38 calibre revolver on 24 November; the last time he saw a gun was in Afghanistan many years ago.  He denied shooting a gun at a house or at all on the relevant night.
55Saboon Jadran was Pasoon Jadran's brother.  He denied knowing the applicant and SZ.  He could not remember where he was on the relevant evening but denied handling a .38 calibre revolver and denied seeing a gun that day.  He specifically denied shooting at a house in Fairfield.  
56Faisal (who said he only had one name) denied knowing the applicant, SZ, or the people who lived at the home in Eddy Street, Merrylands.  He knew both Pasoon and Saboon Jadran and knew their family from Afghanistan and said they were friends.  He denied having fired any guns or seen any guns since he left Afghanistan four years earlier.
57Faisal Nasri knew the applicant and SZ but could not remember being with them at the Eddy Street home on 24 November 2009.  He did not know the people who lived at that address but did know Saboon and Pasoon Jadran.  He denied having been at a house in Merrylands with them.  He denied knowing Yazin and said he had never been at a house in Merrylands when a car with Islander males came; he did not associate with Islanders.  He could not recall going to a service station with Faisal and Yazin in his car.  The last time he heard gunshots was in Afghanistan in 1994.  He did not handle a gun on 24 November 2009 and denied shooting at a house in Fairfield.   Occupants of the house
58Sovannara Chhim (also known as ""Pov"") had lived in the house for about three months.  On the night of 24 November 2009 he had five friends over; they ate together and watched television.  All of them (aside from the deceased of course) gave evidence.  Its combined effect was that there was a knock at the door and, when it was answered, there was a brief conversation with an Islander male who was asking for ""John"".  He was told that no such person was there and walked away.  One of the occupants, Mr Palin Ung, spoke further with him through the open window of the bedroom on the front left side of the house (as viewed from the street).  He asked if everything was alright and the man replied, ""Yeah, everything's cool"".  In cross-examination he was asked if the man had said, ""Hey bro', I just want to buy some weed"" (as Yazin had claimed).  He was not sure; allowed for it to be possible; but agreed it did not appear in the statement he gave only hours after the event. 
59After the person he spoke to walked away, Mr Ung saw shots being fired by another man from near the front boundary.  None of the occupants were precise about the number of shots; estimates ranged from ""two to three"" (Mr Chhim) up to ""around four, five"" (Mr Ung).  The deceased went to the floor near the doorway of the bedroom.  The other occupants fled to the rear of the house.  After they emerged they realised the deceased had been shot and the police were called.
60Although Mr Ung saw the man who was firing the shots he was only able to give a limited description because it was dark:  male; not big; medium tall; something like 1.8 metres tall; thin to medium build.  He also gave the following evidence (after saying the man was ""a good 10 metre, 12"" metres from the bedroom window and confirming it was night-time):
""Q. So how were you able to see a person 10 or 12 metres from you?A. As I was saying, I didn't see, I can sort of just picture out what detail he had.  But not in face or structure wise.  Quite sure it was a male, and because it was dark, I was assuming because the Islander dark as well.
Q. Could you see the colour of his face?A.  No.  Not that the distance, no."" (AB 345)
61Mr Ung made the call to triple 0.  The recording was played to the jury and a transcript was provided.  After despatching the police to the scene the operator asked Mr Ung for information.  When asked if he saw the gunman, he said, ""Um, no, is two Islander"" and later:
""Mr Ung:  Is two Islander I think, yeah, I'm pretty quite sure is two islander.
Operator:  Two of them?
Mr Ung:  Yeah, two islander.  One, one ah, overweight one obese and the other one is um, an average weight.
Operator:  And they were both pacific islanders?
Mr Ung:  They were both islander.
He provided a description of the one with the big build before continuing:
Mr Ung:  The other guy's thin build and both were about a hundred and eight, a hundred and eight-five centimetres tall.
Operator:  ... The second guy is he's - -
Mr Ung:  The second guy is um, slim build, he's dark as well.  Ah, he's wearing I think a dark jacket.
Operator:  Which one had the gun?
Mr Ung:  Um, the thin guy.""  
62In cross-examination Mr Ung confirmed that he said in his police statement that the second man was skinnier than the first who was very big and overweight; he was about 185 cm tall; he could not see his face because it was dark; he could not make out his features but he ""wasn't white"" which ""would have showed up in the lights""; and he had black wavy hair that was messy and went ""somewhere near just around the neck area"".  He also said that this man was wearing a dark, maybe black, fluffy jacket. 
63The occupants confirmed that none of them had guns.  Four of them were asked in cross-examination by the applicant's counsel whether they had tattoos and the response was negative. (Yazin claimed the applicant had said the following day that the men in the house were  Asian and all had guns and a couple had tattoos.)
Paramedics and first police to the scene
64Police starting arriving at the scene from about 11.10pm.  Paramedics found the deceased to be in a grave condition with an apparent gunshot wound to the right temporal region.  He was transported to hospital but did not survive.  An autopsy confirmed that he died of a single gunshot wound. (And he had no tattoos.)
Ensuing investigation
65Police recovered security camera footage from a neighbouring home.  It revealed that at 22:52:42 the light was turned on in the front bedroom.  At 22:53:05 there was a momentary flash of light below the lit window.  The porch light was turned on at 22:57 and a person came outside and stood next to the front bedroom window. The first police arrived at 23:09:42.
66The shooter and those who accompanied him arrived in the general vicinity in four motor vehicles which were parked more than a block away from a house where the shooting occurred.  They approached on foot from an adjoining street and turned right into Cathcart Street.  The house where the shooting occurred was four doors down on the left-hand side.  
67The house itself was a modest three bedroom suburban home with fibro cladding.  There was a small front yard with no fence.  The front of the house was about eight to ten metres from the front boundary.  There was a grass verge between the front boundary and the kerb of the roadway.  At the time the men attended the home there were two cars parked in the driveway, a third vehicle parked partially on the front lawn, another vehicle on the grass verge, and a large truck parked on the roadway immediately outside.
68The front of the house was comprised of two bedrooms with the front door leading to a hallway in the middle.  The bedroom in question was on the left-hand side as the house was viewed from the street.  The driveway was on the extreme left-hand side of the block abutting a Colorbond fence.  The final panel of the fence before the front boundary angled downwards.
69There was evidence to the effect that the shooter would have been in a position about 11 metres from the window of the left hand bedroom.  That would have placed him on about the right-hand side of the driveway on the grass verge.
70The body of the deceased was found in the hallway in the vicinity of the doorway leading into the bedroom. 
71The combined effort of the evidence of a crime scene officer and a ballistics officer was that there was one bullet hole above the window of the bedroom immediately under the eave.  This was 3 metres from the ground and 1.4 metres from the left-hand corner of the house.  This bullet entered the bedroom high on the wall above the window, ricocheted off the ceiling and entered the wall on the opposite side of the room.  There was another bullet entry hole 2.2 metres from the ground just around the corner from the front of the house.  This bullet entered the bedroom about 1.8 metres above the floor and about 90mm from the front corner.  Its trajectory was outside to inside and upwards.   Another bullet entry hole was found in the flyscreen attached to the front window of the bedroom.  It was about 1.4 metres above the ground and 1.8 metres to the right of the left-hand corner of the house.  The ballistic officer's opinion was that there was no other damage to the bedroom that related to that bullet (so, by inference, this was the one that struck the deceased).
72The ballistics officer was asked whether the evidence enabled him to determine how many shots were fired.  He considered there were ""at least three shots fired"".  
73It can be seen from the above that there were only three points of entry of bullets fired into the house.  The ballistics officer agreed in cross-examination that if there was a fourth shot the bullet did not appear to have entered the house.  
74Some of the bullet fragments and a piece of damaged copper jacketing recovered from the bedroom as well as the damaged bullet recovered from the deceased retained insufficient detail to enable microscopic examination.  The possibility of a second firearm having been used could therefore not be excluded.  
75One of the ballistics officers said that an impact damaged bullet and the damaged copper jacket could only be determined to be of either .38, .357 or 9mm calibre.  He said, ""the 38 and 357 are generally used in revolvers, and the 9mm calibre cartridge are generally used in self-loading pistols"". 
76Finally, in relation to the spread of bullet entry holes, the ballistics officer agreed that it was over an area of almost two metres. 
77Professor John Fryer, head of the School of Engineering at Newcastle University who held a PhD in surveying photogrammetry, was the witness who gave the estimate of the gunman standing 11 metres from the bedroom window.  He also explained that possible explanations for the security camera footage only showing one flash were that the gunman was outside the field of vision of the camera when other shots were fired or that they were obscured by a telegraph pole.  He conceded that he was not a ballistics expert but said that the gunman would have to have been in a different position, more to the left when looking from the street, when the shot was fired that penetrated the side wall near the front corner of the house.
Telephone intercepts
78Police obtained a telecommunications interception warrant on 27 November 2009 and thereafter monitored the applicant's phone until 25 January 2010.  Recordings and transcripts of ten conversations were in evidence.  All but one of the conversations were between the applicant and his co-accused.  They used the English and Farsi languages interchangeably.  It was the Crown case that they spoke in code but it could be discerned that some of the conversations concerned the co-accused getting rid of the gun used by the applicant in the shooting.  That was very much a matter of inference; there was nothing explicit.
Ground 1(a) - refusal to give a warning pursuant to s 165 Evidence Act concerning the evidence of Yazin
79Before dealing with this ground it is worth recalling that the issues in the case were twofold:  (1) did the jury accept the evidence of Yazin that the applicant was the gunman or was he, as the defence contended, lying in that respect and (2) if he was the gunman, with what mental state did he fire the gun?
80It is also worth noting that the defence case did not deny the presence of the applicant at the scene.  It also did not involve any assertion that Yazin was more involved in what occurred than he said he was (namely, he was merely present).
81Yazin made his first police statement on 2 December 2009.  He did not mention a number of matters that he later disclosed in his second statement made on 11 March 2010.  In the first statement he said he was three or four houses away when the applicant and the Islander male entered the front yard of the house where the shooting occurred.  All he said was that the applicant and the Islander male walked into the property and then his view was obscured by the side fence; he did not hear any knocking on the front door or any conversation; and about a minute later he heard three or four gunshots.  He explained that at the time of making the first statement he was fearful for his and his family's safety.  But he was subsequently threatened and harassed to the extent that he realised there was no point in withholding information so he went back to the police on his own initiative and told them all that he knew in the second statement.
82The applicant's case that was put to Yazin (and denied) was that on the approach to the house he did not hear the applicant respond to SZ's request to hold the gun by saying ""No, I've got it"". He did not hear the applicant say anything about ""weed"".  He did not see the applicant produce and fire a gun, or have a gun at any time that night.  He did not see him go into the premises at Cathcart Street. 
83In relation to subsequent events, it was put to Yazin (and denied) that back at Eddy Street after the shooting he did not see the applicant give a gun to PJ who emptied bullets from it.  The applicant did not say anything about four Asians with tattoos and guns.  He did not make any threats about people talking, especially to the police.  No-one told the applicant to get rid of his clothes and the gun. 84Far from suggesting that Yazin was more involved than he was prepared to disclose, the following proposition was put to him (and denied):
""Q. And I'm putting to you that the truth is that you were at the back of the group of people crouching down and heard gunshots and that was it; you ran away after that and you don't know what happened; isn't that right?""  
85Trial counsel (who did not appear in this Court) attempted to make a strident attack upon the credibility of Yazin in his closing address.  Some of the more significant matters he referred to and points he endeavoured to make were:
(a)  Yazin was a liar.
(b)  His evidence that the applicant's name came up on his phone when he received a call summoning him to Eddy Street was untruthful.  Telephone records showed no such call made from the applicant's phone. (Counsel had asked in cross-examination whether it could have been someone else who rang up and asked him to come to Eddy Street. (AB402)  But it was never positively asserted that it was not the applicant and he was never confronted with the telephone records.)
(c)  Yazin was the only witness who incriminated the applicant. When a prosecution is dependent upon a single witness it is common sense to approach such evidence with considerable caution.
(d)  ""He's a person who might be criminally involved."" (This was never suggested to Yazin.)
(e)  The jury might think he did not disclose certain things in his first statement and claimed that he was further away from the scene because he was worried about his involvement. 
(f)  ""People like that"" might shift the blame from themselves onto others, or might want to justify or play down their own conduct.  They are known to blame innocent people.  Sometimes these things are done from motives of revenge or malice or dislike.  (No such suggestions had been made to Yazin.)
(g)  The description given by Mr Ung of the gunman was in conflict with Yazin's claim that he was the applicant.
(h)  Yazin said the front door was not opened in response to the knocking.  (But he said that this was something he assumed because he did not hear it being opened. (T128))
(i)  Yazin claimed the porch light was on, but the security camera footage from the neighbouring home showed that it was not (although the front bedroom window light was on).
(j)  The account of the applicant handing a gun to PJ back at Eddy Street was not provided by Yazin in his first police statement. 
(k)  He could not recall anything about the pants the applicant was wearing.
(l)  He did not see cars parked in the driveway and front yard and a truck parked on the street in front of the house in question.
(m)  Yazin said in his first police statement he heard three or four gunshots but in the second statement said it was four.
(n)  He said in his evidence that he heard an occupant of the house saying that no-one by the name of ""John"" lived there, but this did not appear in either of his police statements.  (But it was consistent with the evidence of the occupants.)
86The learned trial judge said the following about the evidence of Yazin at an early stage of his summing up:
""It is perhaps important that I say at this stage, because it has been said on a number of occasions, that although the Crown made reference to the evidence of the witness Yazin beyond reasonable doubt, it is not the case that you have to accept beyond reasonable doubt every single utterance that he made.  In due course I shall explain to you what are the essential elements of the crimes that are charged, and insofar as Mr Yazin is an important witness, it might be perceived that within his evidence what is needed to persuade you beyond reasonable doubt is his identification of the accused Atai as the person who fired the pistol at [xx] Cathcart Street and nobody else.
But it is not the case, as has been said to you once or twice, that you have to accept beyond reasonable doubt in the sense that you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that everything that he said when he was in the witness box.  For example, it was said to you not so long ago that there was evidence from Mr Yazin that he could not see any vehicles parked on the footpath and outside the premises.  You were taken to Exhibit C, which shows that there were cars all over the place outside the front, and you remember you got some photographs that show you cars about the front there.  It is not required that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Yazin is right about that.  It may be that it is of assistance to you in deciding whether he is right or wrong as to whether you accept him or otherwise, but as I have said to you now several times, what the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt are the essential elements of the crimes that are charged, and in due course I shall give you some precise directions in relation to that.""  
87 A little later his Honour gave unremarkable directions about the standard of proof and the Crown bearing the onus.  It is something that he reiterated at various other points of the summing up as well.  After dealing with other matters, including the essential elements of the offences charged against the applicant and his co-accused, he turned to a review of the cases advanced by the parties.  He commenced with the Crown case:
""However, in very short summary, the Crown case as I understand it against Mr Atai is one in a sense of exquisite simplicity.  The Crown simply says on 24 November 2009 Ang Ly was shot and he died as a result.  Nobody in this case seems to doubt that.  The essential issue the Crown says is well, who fired the shot?  The Crown says the evidence is that Atai fired the fatal shot.  No-one else did.  Any of the witnesses who were available who were there at the time, all said they didn't fire a shot.
You will have noticed, although it's a matter for you, that those who said that they didn't fire a shot were not challenged as to that statement.  It is of course open to you to make such assessment as you wish, but it's frequently the case that if a challenge is to be forthcoming, then you would hear about it.  All I am observing, although it's a matter for you, is that each of the persons who were available whom you know of as being at Cathcart Street said that they did not fire the fatal shot.  
The Crown says well you have the evidence of Mr Yazin who did come forward and said he saw it, and I have already observed to you that the critical part of his evidence upon which the Crown relies is that he says he saw Mr Atai do it.  You will of course, I am sure, look at the whole of the context of his evidence to decide whether that is acceptable to you.  But that it is entirely a matter for you."" 
88Before concluding his summing up his Honour invited counsel to make any applications for corrections or further directions.  There was the following exchange with the applicant's counsel:
""[COUNSEL]:  I was going to mention to your Honour if your Honour would consider an unreliable witness warnings under section 165 of the Evidence Act on the basis that Mr Yazin may have been criminally involved in the enterprise.
HIS HONOUR:  What do you want to say about that?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  The Crown would oppose such a direction.  Here there is no suggestion of any criminal activity.
HIS HONOUR:  He talked about involvement, but I don't know about criminal involvement.  Where is that page?
[COUNSEL]:  Transcript 137, line 40, was one of them, your Honour, (Read).
HIS HONOUR:  That is very different from having been involved.  If that is an application for a section 165 direction based on what appears at line 44 at page 137 of the transcript, I merely repeat, as I pointed out to counsel, that it is not a reference to having been involved criminally, but rather to being involved, presumably to the inconvenience and risks that are attended to all persons that are involved in criminal litigation, whether as witnesses or otherwise."" (AB 46-47) 
89The evidence referred to in that exchange arose in cross-examination by the applicant's counsel and was as follows:
""Q. And so, the words that you say Chocolate used about asking for weed, they are left out [of the 2 December 2009 statement] because they protect your family somehow, is that right?A. It protects what I might have heard and what the conversation might take place, yes, I thought it might in other words help me, like it might even stop me from becoming involved.""  (Emphasis added) (AB 441)
90The emphasised words in that extract, in the context of Yazin's frequent explanations about his motive for saying what he said and excluding a number of things in his first police statement, makes it clear that ""involved"" must be understood in the way the trial judge understood it: he was reticent about becoming involved as a prosecution witness because of his concerns for his safety and that of his family.  It did not convey anything to the effect of criminal complicity in the events in Cathcart Street.
91The request for a s 165 warning set out above occurred after the jury had been released for the day.  No further submissions were made by the applicant's counsel either that afternoon or before the summing up resumed and concluded the following morning.
92Section 165, relevantly, is in the following terms:
""(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: ...(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, ...(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury."" 
93In this Court it was submitted that a warning was required not only on the basis advanced by trial counsel (which may be put aside because it was based upon a misapprehension of the evidence) but also for a number of other reasons that essentially fall into two groups:
The group of persons who went to the address in Cathcart Street parked their cars in a nearby park and approached on foot late at night.  A number of them hung back and took measures to avoid being seen.  Yazin said that when approaching the house he overheard a conversation concerning a gun.  After the shots were fired the group departed rapidly.  He said that he had seen the applicant with a gun two days before the incident and saw him again with it upon the return to Eddy Street. Thus, it was submitted that ""the evidence allows the conclusion to be reached that [Yazin] was, to some level at least, criminally involved in the events of the night.  The principles of joint criminal enterprise may have rendered him liable for the primary offence."" 
Yazin made no attempt to contact police after witnessing the firing of at least three shots with the inevitable subsequent knowledge that someone had died.  He was at least liable for the offence of concealing a serious offence (s 316 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).  In addition, he conceded that he had withheld information from the police and in some instances deliberately lied to them regarding important aspects of his account of the events. 
94There were some attempts made in the written and oral submissions to rely upon matters that came to light during the sentence proceedings (for example, the Eddy Street house was the clubhouse for a gang named ""Notorious""). There was also a submission that the invitation to Yazin to go ""fishing"" involved a euphemism for some criminal activity. These were not matters relied upon by the applicant's counsel on the application to the trial judge and were not the subject of evidence or submission before the jury.  They may be put to one side.
95The two bases upon which it is now said that a warning was required ignore the reality of the trial.  During the course of the hearing, senior counsel for the applicant found it necessary to concede that the attack upon Yazin's evidence at no stage involved any assertion of his complicity in criminal activity.  It was accepted that the cross-examination sought to distance Yazin from involvement, for example by contending that he was further away from the incident and so less likely to have seen and heard the things he claimed.  It was also accepted that the application for the warning was ""half-hearted"".  
96In my view, this ground fails at the first hurdle.  There was no evidence that Yazin ""might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding"".  His evidence was that he was present but reluctantly so; and the contrary was not suggested. True it is that the jury might well have thought that this group of men who travelled in convoy; parked cars in an adjoining street; and then approached a particular house late at night and on foot were up to no good.  That much was implicit.  But without any suggestion of how Yazin, in particular, might have been criminally concerned, directing a jury in terms that he was would have invited speculation as to the foundation for the content of the warning.  Even if the view was taken that Yazin may have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings, the vagueness of his complicity would have rendered the task of explaining the basis of the warning exceedingly difficult, if it was possible at all.  In other words, there would have been good reason for the judge to decline to give the warning if an application had been made on the basis now advanced (s 165(3)).
97Moreover, if the trial judge had directed the jury that Yazin was criminally concerned simply on the basis of him being one of the group that went to Cathcart Street, it would implicitly have conveyed that everyone of that group was criminally concerned.  This would have included the applicant because there was no dispute that he was there as well.
98It was submitted that in explaining why the evidence of Yazin may be unreliable, the judge should have given as possible reasons that ""he may be attempting to exculpate himself or minimise his involvement by fabricating or exaggerating the role of the appellant or may have fabricated evidence out of motives of revenge or antipathy towards the appellant"" (AWS 275). The experience of the courts has shown that these are sometimes the motives of witnesses who may have been criminally concerned in the events: see, for example, R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; 52 NSWLR 301 at [127] (Howie J).  However, there was no evidentiary foundation for the jury to have attributed any of them to Yazin.  Trial counsel suggested these things in his closing address (see above at [85](f)) but, aside from reference to Yazin having agreed that the applicant was not a friend, there was no suggested explanation as to how any of these motives might be realistic possibilities.  And, more significantly, none were even suggested to Yazin.
99The fact that Yazin did not voluntarily come forward and tell police everything he knew was put as ""perhaps the most telling"" of the points relied upon by the applicant.  It was submitted that he was ""at the least ... liable for the offence of conceal serious offence"". 
100This Court has allowed for the possibility that a witness who has concealed knowledge of an offence, may be within the terms of s 165(1)(d): R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506 at [46]-[73] (Heydon JA, Dowd and Bell JJ agreeing).  Heydon JA (at [66]) described inclusion of concealment of a serious offence within s 165(1)(d) as to give it a ""controversial construction"".
101In R v Clark, the witness in question gave evidence that the accused had confessed to him after the event.  It was not the case that the witness was present or in any way involved in the events directly relating to the crime.  That is a point of distinction with the present case.  But two aspects of the reasoning of Heydon JA are pertinent.  First, he referred (at [51]) to authority for the proposition that an accessory after the fact does not have a motive to falsely inculpate a principal offender because the principal's guilt is the foundation for the accessory's guilt. The same can be said for a witness who has concealed his or her knowledge of an offence.  Heydon JA referred to the witness having nothing to gain from establishing the principal's guilt: ""he could bring nothing but trouble upon himself by doing so"" (at [66]). Secondly, there was the observation (at [57]) that if the witness was to be regarded as falling within the description in s 165(1)(d) it was incumbent upon the defence to elicit evidence to that effect. That was not done in that case, and nor was it done in the present.
102The respects in which the evidence of Yazin may have been unreliable was limited to those that trial counsel chose to explore with him in cross-examination.  They were matters that were readily understandable by a jury without the trial judge providing information based upon the experience of the courts and not commonly understood in the general community.  A warning that the evidence may be unreliable was not called for in such circumstances:  see, for example, Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 at [116] (Hunt AJA, Buddin and Hoeben JJ).
Ground 1(b) - failure to warn the jury to scrutinise the evidence of Yazin with great care
103The applicant's submissions acknowledged that the directions given by the trial judge did emphasise the central importance of Yazin's evidence but complained that ""they did not amount to a warning"".  At no stage did his Honour direct the jury that before accepting Yazin's account they were required to scrutinize his evidence with great care. 
104The direction it is contended the judge should have given is often known by the shorthand expression, a ""Murray direction"".  It is derived from R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 where, at 19, Lee J stated:
""The fact that a judge does not comment upon the absence of corroboration of the complainant's evidence cannot, in my view, in the case of those offences to which s 405C applies now be made the basis of a criticism of his summing-up, but again this does not mean that the judge cannot or should not, as is done in all cases of serious crime, stress upon the jury the necessity for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the witness who stands alone as proof of the Crown case. In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness' evidence is unreliable.""
105R v Murray was cited with approval by the High Court in Robinson v The Queen [1999] HCA 42; 197 CLR 162 at [21].  That case stands as authority for the proposition that such a direction should be given in a case in which there is a perceptible risk of a miscarriage of justice if the jury is not warned of the need to scrutinise the evidence in question with care before arriving at a conclusion of guilt.   106There was no request made to the trial judge for such a direction. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is therefore engaged and leave to rely upon this ground is required.  In R v Burt [2003] NSWCCA 248; 140 A Crim R 555 at [70]-[71] (Wood CJ at CL) it was observed that the absence of a request does not foreclose the issue; a judge is under a duty to give such directions as the case properly requires; and the question for this Court is whether or not the omission resulted in a risk of miscarriage of justice.  But, in the circumstances of that case, leave under r 4 was refused on the basis that:
""[74] While it may have been desirable, for his Honour to have given a Murray direction, there can be little doubt that the jury were made aware of the need for them to examine the complainant's evidence with great care.""
107It was submitted that the failure by trial counsel to seek a Murray direction could not be explained by any tactical forensic consideration. The applicant could not have been disadvantaged in any way if such a direction was given. (6.3.14 at T14.1)  The Crown countered by arguing that trial counsel may have refrained from seeking such a direction (which, I interpolate, is, unless accompanied by the arguments of the parties for and against acceptance of the witness' evidence, little more than a means of emphasising the standard of proof) out of concern that the judge might have reminded the jury of some of the reasons given by Yazin for shortcomings in his initial account to police (he had been threatened and was in fear for his family and himself).
108The written submissions for the applicant listed a number of ""problems"" with the evidence of Yazin which, together with the fact that the prosecution case was completely reliant upon it to secure a conviction, warranted a ""warning"".   The ""problems"" were essentially of the same nature as the various matters raised in the course of closing address of the applicant's counsel:  see above at [85].  
109In oral submissions, Mr Game SC took the Court to various aspects of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address to the jury.  It was acknowledged that the prosecutor accepted ""the case against Mr Atai depends very much upon Mr Yazin, without whom it wouldn't be a case, so you do have to believe Mr Yazin. You do have to accept his evidence beyond reasonable doubt, in the very important areas that he gives you evidence"". (AB 706.11)  But the Crown Prosecutor then invited the jury to ""have a look at what supports him"".  The matters she then identified were matters that supported his evidence in a general sense but not in respect of his identification of the applicant as the gunman.  I interpolate that if there was other evidence of that, there would be no occasion for the judge to be directing the jury about a case dependent upon a single witness.  It was also submitted, in effect, that the prosecutor failed to effectively deal with the ""problems"" with the evidence of Yazin, or made submissions to counter them that were not based in evidence. 
110In the course of trial counsel's closing address, throughout an array of criticisms he sought to make of the evidence, there was repeated emphasis upon the Crown's reliance upon the evidence of Yazin.  For example: 
""I would now like to draw to your attention [to] some of the issues that arose in cross-examination.  I do this because as the Crown's told you, you have to believe Yazin beyond reasonable doubt."" (AB 769.10)
111Shortly before concluding his address counsel repeated the point (for at least the sixth time):
""Members of the jury, you have to, the Crown says, believe Yazin beyond reasonable doubt to get to the first point, was my client the shooter ....""  
112The closing addresses of the prosecutor and counsel for the co-accused occupied Monday 19 November 2011.  Counsel for the applicant addressed from the beginning of Tuesday 20 November and the trial judge's summing up immediately followed.  A review of the entirety of the closing addresses leads me to the view that before the jury had heard a word from the trial judge in summing up, they would have been in no doubt whatsoever that (a) the Crown bore the onus of proof to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt; (b) the Crown case in respect of the applicant was dependent upon acceptance of the truthfulness and reliability of Yazin's evidence identifying the applicant as the shooter; (c) there were many aspects of that evidence which were said by the defence to be untruthful or at least unreliable; and (d) before they could return a verdict of guilty the jury would need to conclude that none of the criticisms raised a reasonable doubt about the essential aspects of Yazin's evidence.
113 I have earlier noted (at [86]-[87]) what the trial judge said in his summing up about the evidence of Yazin.  It is worth repeating one aspect: ""The Crown says well you have the evidence of Mr Yazin who did come forward and said he saw it, and I have already observed to you that the critical part of his evidence upon which the Crown relies is that he says he saw Mr Atai do it.  You will of course, I am sure, look at the whole of the context of his evidence to decide whether that is acceptable to you.  But that it is entirely a matter for you."" 
114Thus the jury were told that they should not only look at the evidence in terms of the critical matter, whether the applicant was the gunman, but that they should evaluate that in the context of all of the evidence.
115It might have been a useful precaution for the judge to have directed the jury in the terms of R v Murray, if only to forestall potential argument in this Court as to whether or not he should have.  But I am left in no doubt that the jury in the applicant's trial would have been well and truly aware of the need to scrutinise the evidence of Yazin with great care. The fact that they sought a transcript of it lends further support to this.
116I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage resulting from the omission to give a Murray direction.
Ground 2 - error in explaining significance of trial counsel not alleging that another person had fired the shots
117This ground relates to a passage of the summing up extracted earlier (at [87]).  In short, the judge observed that the Crown said it was the applicant who fired the fatal shot; all of the witnesses who were available who were there said they did not fire the shot; none of those witnesses were challenged about their denial; and if there was a challenge, the jury would have expected to hear it.
118It was submitted that the judge had ""undermined the onus of proof"" and so, despite no complaint having been raised by the applicant's counsel, r 4 had no application:  R v Soto-Sanchez [2002] NSWCCA 160; 129 A Crim R 279.  In that case the trial judge committed what was described as ""a fundamental error"" in directing the jury concerning the onus and standard of proof.  He undermined the onus of proof by directing, in effect, that the accused must be acquitted if the jury were satisfied on the balance of probabilities of his exculpatory version of events.  It was held by Stein JA (Sully J and Smart AJ agreeing) (at [23]) that the error ""went to the very root of the trial"" and that there was thereby a miscarriage of justice.
119It was submitted that there could have been no tactical advantage sought by trial counsel refraining from asking for a redirection or withdrawal of the observation and, in any event, it would have been difficult for the judge to have fashioned any redirection to effectively prevent the jury from engaging in an impermissible mode of reasoning.  
120Counsel for the applicant in this Court complained in written submissions that it was never his case that he was present when the shots were fired, or had seen who had fired them.  Accordingly it was not possible for there to have been any challenge to the denials of witnesses that they had fired the shots. (AWS 285) This was clarified at the hearing; there was no suggestion at trial that the applicant was not present but it cannot be assumed that through his mere presence he knew who fired the gun. 
121Counsel for the applicant characterised what the judge had said as inviting the jury to exclude the possibility of those witnesses who had been present at the scene having fired the shots because the defence had not disputed their denials.  Exclusion of that possibility made it easier for the jury to more readily accept the evidence of Yazin and to move to the conclusion that the applicant was the gunman.  
122The Crown contended that the impugned direction did not suggest, even implicitly, that there may have been any obligation on the applicant to nominate who the shooter was.  Given the repeated directions about the applicant bearing no onus of proof, and that it was the Crown who had asked the relevant witnesses whether they had fired the shots, it was submitted there was no possibility of the jury having acted upon a reversal of the onus of proof. 
123The Crown also submitted that the evidence of those who had accompanied the applicant and Yazin to Cathcart Street was obviously unsatisfactory.  In addition, there were some who were identified but who did not give evidence and others who had not been identified.  Accordingly, it would have been well open to the jury to consider the possibility of any of those people having been the gunman rather than the applicant.
124There is an element of imprecision in what the trial judge said on this subject.  The Crown characterised it as ""a matter of some opacity"".  The judge referred to the witnesses saying they did not fire a shot and that they were not challenged about that; and if there was a challenge the jury would expect to have heard it.  His Honour did not refer to either party as being the source of some expected challenge.  The jury might have thought it was significant that the Crown did not challenge the witnesses' assertion; thereby supporting its case that the applicant was the shooter.  If the jury considered the fact that the defence did not challenge them either, all that could be made of it is that the applicant did not contend that any of those seven witnesses was the shooter.  But that said nothing about whether the defence might either have been silent through lack of knowledge, or was silent because the applicant contended the shooter was one of those who had not been called and so there was no opportunity to mount any challenge.
125The jury can have been in no doubt that the applicant bore no onus of proving anything.  The judge told them that on Friday 16 September 2011 when the evidence came to an end upon the jury being informed that neither the applicant nor his co-accused would be giving evidence.  And there is no complaint about the directions given on that subject, and generally on the onus and standard of proof, during the course of the summing up the following Tuesday.
126Have regard to all of the circumstances I have referred to I am not persuaded that there was any undermining of the onus of proof.  (Trial counsel obviously did not perceive that there was.)  I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage of justice.  Leave to rely upon this ground pursuant to r 4 should be refused.
Ground 4 - unreasonable and unsupportable verdict.
127The principles relating to such a ground are well established and often repeated.  I do not propose to do so here save to say that a convenient summary appears in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14].
128The primary submission for the applicant concerned the evidence of Yazin which was described as ""unsatisfactory"", ""concocted"" or ""simply wrong""; it was incapable of establishing the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt.  (AWS 296)  Reliance was placed upon the same types of matters relied upon in support of the first ground. 
129The Crown acknowledged that Yazin had been deliberately incorrect or had omitted to mention certain matters in his first police statement.  But he had provided an explanation for that: he tried to distance himself from the shooting because he was afraid for his own safety and that of his family if he gave the police an accurate and complete account.  The Crown referred to the following matters he omitted:
He was only two and not three or four houses away from the residence when the shots were fired.
The conversations he overheard between the occupants of the house and the Islander male and the applicant.
Seeing the gun being fired by the applicant.
That he heard four shots, as opposed to three or four shots.
He later saw the gun at Eddy Street when it was given by the applicant to PJ who emptied the remaining bullets and made a comment.
130Importantly, in my view, Yazin not only gave an explanation for the errors and omissions in his first police statement, he also explained his decision to come forward and make his second statement:
""Q. At some stage, months later, on the 11th of March 2010, you went back to the Police Station didn't you, to make a statement, didn't you?
A. That is correct
Q. And had your memory improved when you went back to the Police Station?
A. Yes. As I said, I might have left a few things out of the first statement and I was, as I said, for me to believe in helping my family's safety and my safety at the same time, but once I started realising it is not helping at all, kept getting threats, kept getting harassed, that is when I realised, yep, there is no point trying to keep a few things hidden, step up forward and tell everything that I remember, and that is what I went and did.""
131There was no challenge to the veracity of this explanation as was conceded on the hearing of the application. (6.3.14 at T8.15)  It was an explanation which was, on its face, rational and credible.  It was capable of acceptance by the jury and it would seem likely that they did accept it.
132All other matters in the list of criticisms of Yazin's evidence in the applicant's written submissions were amenable to rational explanation in favour of the Crown and did not mandate a reasonable doubt about guilt.  Conflict with the evidence of Mr Ung about the description of the gunman does not detract from reliability of Yazin's evidence.  Mr Ung did not purport to be at all certain that the man was of Islander appearance.  He was looking out from the lit front bedroom into relative darkness; his attention was drawn to the man when the gun commenced to be fired; and his observation must have been fleeting.
133An important aspect of a consideration of Yazin's evidence is that there were some significant matters that were not the subject of any dispute.  There was no challenge to his evidence that he had seen the applicant wearing a revolver at his waist two days before the shooting.  His evidence of the applicant meeting a number of men outside the Eddy Street address and then coming back inside and saying, ""Let's go"" was not challenged either.  It was suggested in cross-examination that the applicant did not refer to going ""fishing"" but to ""cruising"".  When they were at the park near Cathcart Street there was a discussion among some of the men that Yazin was not involved in and did not hear, at the conclusion of which the applicant announced, ""Okay, let's go"".  The applicant then led the group on foot into Cathcart Street. The jury could well have considered that the applicant was the leader and most likely the one who would play a principal role in whatever was the intended purpose once in Cathcart Street. 
134In considering a ground asserting the unreasonableness of a verdict it is necessary that the Court ""must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses"": M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at [7].  The assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of Yazin was quintessentially one for a jury to determine and, in the circumstances of this case, difficult for this Court to gainsay.
135The applicant advanced an alternative submission: that the evidence was incapable of establishing that he had the mental state necessary to establish the charge of murder and that a verdict of guilty of manslaughter should be substituted. 
136The location of the bullet entry points into the house were said to indicate that the shots were fired at the house itself and not at particular targets inside.  And if a fourth shot was fired it must have missed the house completely.   They were fired from a significant distance and the evidence indicated they were fired by someone with limited or no competence with a firearm.  The presence of persons within the house was known by the gunman, but there were intervening physical structures (walls, windows, doorframes and furnishings).  Foresight of the probability that a bullet would strike an occupant, let alone fatally, was said to have been speculative. 137The applicant has failed to establish that Yazin's evidence was inherently unreliable or that any of his explanations for any shortcomings mandated a doubt about guilt.  Having reviewed the evidence at trial in detail, and giving respect to the advantage of the jury which this Court cannot have from a mere review of the transcript, I am not persuaded that the jury should have entertained a doubt that the applicant was the person who fired the gun that resulted in the death of the deceased.
138I am also not persuaded that the jury should have had a doubt that the applicant had the mental state necessary to establish the charge of murder as opposed to manslaughter.  It is well within the realms of a commonsense conclusion that the gunman must have foreseen the probability of death occurring where the gun was discharged multiple times in the direction of a house at night, knowing that there are a number of occupants up and about within that house, at least one of whom was in a front room with the light on, with the focus of the shots being generally in the direction of that room.
139It cannot be said that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the applicant's guilt of murder.  This ground should be rejected.
140I would grant leave to appeal against conviction in respect of grounds 1 and 4 but would dismiss the appeal.
Application for leave to appeal against sentence
141There is a single ground of appeal against sentence which contends that it is manifestly excessive.
142The written submissions for the applicant provided the following useful summary of the findings made by the learned judge:
""251. Grove AJ concluded that the appellant had discharged the firearm recklessly, having gone to the premises in Fairfield with about 13 other people in a convoy of four cars. He considered that the group went to the wrong house, as there was no evidence to suggest that the men inside the premises had any link to the appellant or others who had travelled there that night. 
252. Grove AJ concluded that prior to discharging the firearm the appellant could see people in the front areas of the house. He fired three or four shots, foreseeing that his actions would probably result in the killing of one of the occupants. He considered that the actions of the appellant were objectively very serious and found that the offence fell above the mid-range of seriousness for such an offence.
253. Grove AJ noted the statutory maximum and the standard non-parole period to be 'statutory guideposts'.
254. He then reviewed the subjective case for the appellant and found:
●  he was eighteen at the time of the offence,
●  he was born in Iran and is of Afghani ethnicity,
●  his father was killed in Afghanistan,
●  the family (his mother and seven siblings) came to Australia as refugees in 2005.
●  The appellant spoke no English when he arrived. By the time he left school in Year 10 he had been before the Children's Court for offences of supply (twice) and assaulting and resisting a female police officer.
●  He served three months imprisonment from 10 February 2010 for the offence of malicious damage.
●  He had only casual work after leaving school and from the age of sixteen began associating with the Notorious Motorcycle club.
255. Grove AJ noted that the group of persons present on the night of the offence both departed and returned to the motorcycle club's Merrylands meeting house. His Honour noted the psychological evidence that the appellant had struggled to cope in Australia and that the motorcycle club comprised people with similar cultural and language backgrounds.
256. His Honour was unable to reach either a positive or negative conclusion regarding the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation. He accepted the appellant's family were genuine in their desire to assist him. He noted that a denial of responsibility for the offence stood against the prospects of rehabilitation. He considered his custodial record to be not promising. 
257. Grove AJ noted there had been periods of segregation, some as a consequence of conduct, others for administrative reasons to separate various gang members. He considered this entitled the appellant to a modest mitigation of sentence. His Honour rejected a submission that there had been a delay in the proceedings of such length as to mitigate sentence.
258. Grove AJ considered the most cogent matter of mitigation to be the appellant's youth. He considered the offence reflected considerable immaturity. Given the inevitably long sentence to be imposed Grove AJ was not persuaded that a finding of special circumstances was warranted.
259. Grove AJ described the appellant as 'the sole perpetrator of a violent and brutal act which he knew would probably have fatal consequences.' He saw no need to accumulate the sentence on the three-month sentence initially served for the malicious damage offence.""
143The written submissions sought to make the following points: 
Murder resulting from reckless indifference to human life is not necessarily as culpable, and not necessarily less culpable, than murder arising from an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm: R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214 at [120] (Grove J).
The offence was not premeditated and was found to be one of ""considerable immaturity"". It was committed by an 18-year old offender from an extremely disadvantaged background.  This warranted a greater measure of leniency than was extended.
144The applicant identified two sets of cases for the purpose of comparison. The first were cases involving offenders between the age of 18 and 20, convicted of murder after the introduction of standard non-parole periods: R v Abdulkader and Hohaia [2006] NSWSC 866; R v Nguyen [2007] NSWSC 389; R v Houri [2007] NSWSC 615; R v Zaro [2007] NSWSC 756; R v Harvey [2007] NSWSC 871; R v Shamouil [2009] NSWSC 24; R v Barrett [2009] NSWSC 338; R v Carr [2009] NSWSC 995; R v Dennis [2009] NSWSC 1357; R v Wong [2010] NSWSC 171; R v Cambey and Carney [2010] NSWSC 369; and R v Tatchell and Wildsmith [2010] NSWSC 495. The second were cases where the standard non-parole period did not apply, involving offenders between the age of 18 and 20, where murder was committed with a firearm: R v Gosling [2001] NSWSC 850; R v Chan [2002] NSWSC 544; R v Hamzy [2004] NSWCCA 243; R v P Pham, V Pham and Nguyen [2003] NSWSC 1261; R v Vann [2004] NSWSC 988; and R v EM [2005] NSWSC 212.
145Senior counsel for the applicant was asked at the hearing about the sentencing judge's finding that the offence was ""above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences"".  It was acknowledge that there was no ground contending that this was wrong; nonetheless it was asserted that such a characterisation was ""not accepted"". 
146The Crown submissions were confined to an analysis of four of the so-called comparable cases that were relied upon by the applicant in his written submissions.  In short, the Crown contended that they did not support the proposition that the sentence is manifestly excessive, that is, unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325-326 [6].
147The reliance of the applicant upon other cases fails, largely because they are not really comparable apart from the age of the offender.  Singling out one subjective feature (age) in order to compare sentences is an unproductive exercise. The range of criminality in the chosen cases, and the bases upon which the offender was culpable for the crime of murder, were widely divergent. There was a significant variation in relevant subjective features as well, including in some of them discounts for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty. If anything, the cases support the proposition that, while the sentence in the present case was severe, it was not out of the ordinary.  
148As previously noted, the sentencing judge found that the offence was ""above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences"".  While this was ""not accepted"" by senior counsel for the applicant, it was not the subject of specific challenge by way of a ground of appeal contending error in the exercise of a discretionary judgment.  Minds might differ about this assessment but I do not think it is necessary to say more than that this was a serious case of murder.  The applicant was armed with a loaded revolver and after finding no satisfaction with whatever he sought at the house in Cathcart Street he chose to discharge it three or four times with a realisation that someone would probably be killed.  The judge found that the offender ""was the sole perpetrator of a violent and brutal act which he knew would probably have fatal consequences"".
149It was quite appropriate for the judge to take into account all of the applicant's personal circumstances in the way he described.  That said, it remained necessary for a sentence to be imposed that reflected important considerations of deterrence, particularly general deterrence, denunciation and recognition of the harm caused.  There was no evidence that the applicant was remorseful; he had a prior record; and the judge was unable to make any finding about his rehabilitation prospects.  Nonetheless, the judge found in his favour that ""the most cogent element of mitigation"" was his youth. 
150This sentence is not manifestly excessive.  It was harsh for someone as young as the applicant, but appropriately so.  I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
Orders
151I propose the following orders: 
1.  Leave to appeal against conviction granted, with respect to grounds 1 and 4.
2.  Appeal against conviction dismissed.
3.  Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
4.  Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
152SCHMIDT J:  As to the conviction appeal, I agree with Basten JA and R A Hulme J that the applicant must be given leave to appeal his conviction, but that the appeal be dismissed, an independent assessment of the evidence also not having led me to the view that the jury ought to have experienced a doubt as to the applicant's guilt of the offence of which he was convicted.153In relation to ground 1a, the trial judge's refusal to give a warning pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and ground 4, that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence, I agree with the reasons given by R A Hulme J, as well as the additional observations of Basten JA.
154I should add that it was the Crown's case that it was the applicant who discharged the firearm, either with at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or with reckless disregard for human life.  Contrary to the written submissions advanced on appeal, that it was ""never the appellant's case that he was present when the shots were fired, or that he had seen who had discharged the firearm"", it was accepted at the hearing of the appeal that Mr Yazin was cross-examined for the applicant as to what he was able to hear and see that night.  It was put to him that he had not seen the applicant go into the premises or take out a gun, but it was not put to him that the applicant was not present.
155As R A Hulme J has explained, Mr Yazin's evidence that it was the applicant who had fired multiple shots at the house where he knew there were occupants, one of whom he had spoken to, was accepted.   That evidence was clearly capable of establishing the necessary mental state for this offence.
156I also agree with the reasons given by R A Hulme J for rejecting ground 1b, that the trial judge had failed to warn the jury of the need to scrutinize the evidence of Mr Yazin with great care and with his Honour's reasons for refusing the applicant leave under Rule 4 to rely on ground 2, that the trial judge erred when explaining the significance of the applicant's counsel not alleging that a person other than the accused had fired the shots at the house.
157As to the sentence appeal, I also agree with R A Hulme J that while the applicant must be granted leave to appeal the sentence, the appeal must be dismissed, for the reasons which his Honour gave.  
158I note that the sentencing judge's findings were not challenged on appeal and that the applicant relied on the findings that the offence was reckless and of considerable immaturity, committed without premeditation.  His Honour nevertheless concluded that the offence fell above the mid-range for such offences.   That conclusion reflected the findings that before discharging the firearm recklessly, the applicant could see people in the front areas of the house and that he had foreseen that his actions would probably result in the killing of one of the occupants.  
159The applicant was 18 years at the time of the offence.  His Honour also took this into account, as well as other relevant subjective factors.  His Honour also had necessary regard to the standard 20 year non-parole period for a mid-range offence of murder, that being one of the statutory guideposts which his Honour was obliged to take into account on sentencing.  
160In written submissions on appeal the applicant placed particular reliance on comparisons sought to be drawn with the sentences imposed in four cases: R v Nguyen [2007] NSWSC 389 (a below mid-range stabbing murder committed during a robbery by a 20 year old, where the sentence imposed after a 25% discount for a plea was 18 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months); R v Houri [2007] NSWSC 615 (another stabbing murder committed by a 19 year old during a robbery, where the sentence imposed after a 10% discount for a plea was 18 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years, 6 months after a finding that a disability would mean that the offender would suffer hardship in custody); R v Zaro [2007] NSWSC 756 (another stabbing by an 18 year old where the sentence imposed was 22 years, with a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months) and R v Barrett [2009] NSWSC 338 (another stabbing murder by a 20 year old where the sentence was 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 years, after a 12.5% discount).  
161These matters were argued to have involved offending of a more serious kind than occurred in this case, but that sentences which were either less or roughly comparable to that imposed upon the applicant revealed error in his sentencing.  The submission was not made out.  It rested mainly on the ages of the respective offenders, rather than on any analysis of the nature of their offending.   
162Here the sentence imposed on the applicant was 24 years, with a non-parole period of 18 years and a balance of term of 6 years.  The applicant received no discount on this sentence, having not entered any plea.  Had there been an early plea, as there was in Nguyen for example, this sentence would have been reduced by 25% to 18 years.  On any view the sentence imposed on the applicant is a significant one, but that it was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this offender, was not established, as R A Hulme J has explained.
163In the result I agree with the orders which R A Hulme J proposes.

2764940,"Mitchell, Allan v R; Mitchell, Paul v R; Mitchell, Michael v R [2014] NSWCCA 212","Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and with his Honour's reasons.
2ADAMS J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  Three brothers, Michael, Paul and Allan Mitchell (""the applicants""), apply for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge King SC in the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 8 August 2013.
4The applicants pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), one at Adaminaby (""the Adaminaby offence"") and one at Cabramurra (""the Cabramurra offence""); and to one count of larceny contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act (""the larceny offence""). Paul Mitchell pleaded guilty to an additional offence of break, enter and steal (""the Tumut offence"").  For reasons which will appear, I will refer to those offences as ""the Southern Tablelands offence"".
5The applicants were also dealt with for the summary offence of entering inclosed lands contrary to s 4(1) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW), for which they received fines of $400.
Facts
6The additional break, enter and steal offence for which Paul Mitchell was sentenced occurred on 5 or 6 August 2012. He broke into Martin's Mini Storage at Tumut, forced open a safe and stole $12,500. Other property was also taken including a chainsaw and other tools. The total value of the cash and property stolen was $13,250.
7The offences in common for each applicant occurred on the afternoon of 9 September 2012 and lasted into the early hours of the following morning.
8The larceny offence involved various items being taken from a Toyota Land Cruiser. Between 3.30pm and 5.00pm the applicants entered a paddock in Adaminaby and gained entry to the Land Cruiser, which was unlocked. They removed the spare tyre from the back seat of the vehicle together with various Toyota badges, an indicator light and wiring from the vehicle.  They were seen by an off-duty police officer wheeling the tyre to a service station where it was inflated before they walked out of sight.
9The aggravated break, enter and steal offence at Adaminaby occurred later that day. They forced entry to a storage shed at the Adaminaby Golf Club and stole a large number of items including a barbeque, gardening equipment, a tent and alcohol. The value of the items was not stated.
10The aggravated break, enter and steal at Cabramurra involved the applicants forcing entry into a general store through the front door and stealing a large number of items including cigarettes, clothing and radios. In addition, a steel safe was taken which contained $4,460.23 in cash. A stock take put the value of the stolen property, including the cash in the safe, at $8,613.50. 
11The safe was removed with the assistance of a trolley jack the applicants obtained from the nearby Cabramurra Hobby Club (the enter inclosed lands offence).  The safe was attached to the rear of their car and dragged away from the premises but it became detached as they left Cabramurra and fell down a large embankment from where it could not be recovered. The applicants then covered the safe with snow and dirt in an attempt to hide it. It was subsequently located with the contents intact.
12The other stolen property was recovered by police on the morning of 10 September 2012 after a passer-by discovered it hidden under a tarpaulin in the National Park near Tumut. The offenders were arrested two days later in Narrabri. 
13The sentencing judge described the offences as ""a sequence of very serious criminal conduct"". In the circumstances, the judge concluded that it was impossible to find that the offences were not, ""at least to some extent, pre-planned"". They clearly intended to recover the property that was hidden under the tarpaulin and to return to the safe. 
Subsequent offences at Gilgandra and Narrabri
14The applicants left the Southern Tablelands area at some point soon after having committed these offences and travelled north.  On 11 September 2012 on the Newell Highway near Gilgandra they stole property valued at about $1250 from the rear of a work vehicle parked near a rural property.
15They proceeded on but their vehicle broke down.  They got a lift into Narrabri, took a Toyota Landcruiser without the owner's consent and returned to their own vehicle and towed it into town. That night they broke into an audio-electronics business with the intention of stealing property but an alarm was activated and they fled.  They were arrested on the morning of 12 September 2011.
Personal circumstances - Michael Mitchell
16A Pre Sentence Report and a psychological report were tendered in relation to Michael Mitchell. 
17He was aged 19 at the time of the offences. He was the fourth of five male children. He reported a stable upbringing and had enjoyed a good relationship with his parents. 
18Towards the end of primary school he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and was prescribed medication.  In high school he was continually getting into trouble and was placed in a ""special behavioural class"".   He left halfway through Year 10 and subsequently engaged in various manual jobs. His most recent employer indicated that he was prepared to offer him work upon release if available. 
19He used cannabis from around the age of 16 and harder drugs since the age of 18, including crystal methamphetamine, heroin, ecstasy and OxyContin. He had a significant and costly drug addiction. He was under the influence of a number of illicit substances at the time of the offences and was suffering from withdrawal when he went into custody.  The psychological report indicated that he had shown little insight into the reasons for his abuse of drugs.  He had not attended any detoxification or rehabilitation programs.
20The sentencing judge was ""prepared to accept that there is at least some evidence of remorse and contrition, although it is limited"" and added that ""it cannot be said that there is a good prospect of rehabilitation in the absence of the offender addressing his drug addiction, which, so far, he has made no effort to do other than his claim that while in custody he has abstained from the use of prohibited drugs"". 
21The judge referred to Michael Mitchell's criminal record which consisted of matters dealt with by way of bonds, probation or fines in the period between 2005 and 2010. He said that he did not regard it as an aggravating circumstance but ""simply indicates that it cannot be said that he has an unblemished record"".
Personal Circumstances - Paul Mitchell 
22A Pre Sentence report and a psychological report were tendered in relation to Paul Mitchell.
23He was almost 22 years of age at the time of the offences. As with Michael, he had a positive relationship with his parents. He had recently moved out of home, was not in a relationship and did not have any dependents. 
24There were behavioural problems at school.  He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at age of 12. He was placed into a class for emotionally disturbed children at the beginning of Year 8 which he said he hated. He left school at the age of 14 and subsequently engaged in sporadic employment. He was unemployed in the nine months prior to arrest. 
25The judge noted that there was a juvenile and adult criminal record comprising a variety of matters that had resulted in the imposition of fines, bonds and community service.  As with Michael, his Honour considered that this was not an aggravating matter but denied the offender the benefit of leniency that could have been extended if there was no prior history.
26The applicant began using cannabis at age 12 and it had become a daily habit by the time of his arrest. He began using heavier drugs at around 20, including crystal methylamphetamine, OxyContin, morphine and heroin. He had a costly habit and was experiencing withdrawal in custody.
27He said that prior to the offences, he and his brothers had been using cannabis, methamphetamine and drinking alcohol. Money was the motivating factor. 
28Apart from the plea, the sentencing judge found some evidence of remorse. However, a reference in the Pre Sentence Report to having difficulty in taking responsibility for his actions ""appears to limit the significance of any expression that might be consistent with remorse"". 
29The judge said that he could not find that there was a good prospect of rehabilitation, concluding that it was unlikely to occur ""until such time as the offender properly addresses his addiction to prohibited drugs and/or restricted medications"".
Personal Circumstances - Allan Mitchell
30A Pre Sentence Report and a psychological report were also tendered in relation to Allan Mitchell. 
31He was aged 39 at the time of the offences. He described his early childhood as ""pretty rough"", being exposed to his parents' heavy drinking and violence from a young age. They lived a transient lifestyle, his parents being employed as fruit pickers. 
32He was put into a residential placement and then lived with a foster family from age 10 and moved back to live with his parents at 15, but indicated that their conduct had not changed. He left school in early high school and thereafter had engaged in seasonal work and labouring. 
33He has two children who were aged 14 and 9 at the time of sentencing.  They had both been taken into care because of concern about the ability of their parents to care for them.  It was unclear whether the applicant had maintained any contact with them.
34He began using cannabis at the age of 12 or 13. He was also using OxyContin, morphine, crystal methamphetamine and amphetamines prior to his arrest. The psychologist indicated that he was significantly dependent on drugs, with little ability to control the effect that the desire for drugs has on his life. 
35Allan Mitchell's criminal history is significant, commencing when he was a juvenile and continuing with little abatement.  He had been imprisoned on multiple occasions.  The judge declined to recount the detail: ""suffice it to say that there are many [previous convictions], and that in respect alone of offences of break and enter, including aggravated forms, there are approximately some 12 previous counts recorded"".  The Probation and Parole Officer reported that ""prior case management has attempted to assist Mr Mitchell address substance abuse issues"" but his response had been ""poor"".  The judge concluded that ""[h]is poor criminal history is an aggravating circumstance"".
36The judge was unable to find that he was genuinely remorseful or contrite. Nor was he able to say that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.
Sentences for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences
37The applicants were charged with the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences upon their arrest and with the Southern Tablelands offences in the days following.  The proceedings should have been joined and they should have been sentenced for all matters together.  However, they were sentenced for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences by Robison DCJ on 27 March 2013 in the District Court at Moree and for the earlier offences by King DCJ in the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 8 August 2013.
38The sentences imposed by Robison DCJ were quashed by this Court: Mitchell v R; Mitchell v R [2013] NSWCCA 318 (in respect of Michael and Paul); Mitchell v R [2014] NSWCCA 63 (in respect of Allan).  That was on the basis that they were manifestly excessive, particularly having regard to the primary judge's finding that the offences were at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness and, in the case of Paul and Michael, their age and lack of prior custodial experience.
39The initial sentence imposed upon Paul and Michael Mitchell was imprisonment for 2 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months with effect from 12 September 2012. They were resentenced by this Court to imprisonment for 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months with effect from the same date.
40The sentence imposed upon Allan Mitchell was imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years with effect from 12 September 2012.  He was resentenced to imprisonment for 1 year 10 months with a non-parole period of 1 year.
Sentences Imposed 
41King DCJ sentenced the applicants in the context of the sentences they had received from Robison DCJ.  Because the offences were ""part of a continuing sequence of offending"" his Honour considered it appropriate to have regard to the principle of totality by taking into account the sentences earlier passed.  He allowed a discount of 25 per cent in recognition of the utilitarian value of the applicants' early pleas of guilty.
42Michael Mitchell received a total sentence of 4 years 11 months with a non-parole component of 3 years 5 months. The total including the Moree sentence was 5 years 3 months with a non-parole component of 3 years 9 months.
43Paul Mitchell received a total sentence of 5 years 5 months with a non-parole component of 3 years 9 months. The total including the Moree sentence was 5 years 9 months with a non-parole component of 4 years 1 month.
44Allan Mitchell received a total sentence of 5 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 4 years. The total including the Moree sentence was 6 years with a non-parole component of 4 years 6 months.
45As can be seen, in recognition of the totality principle the sentences imposed by King DCJ were partially accumulated upon those earlier imposed by Robison DCJ.  But the extent of the accumulation was quite modest:  4 months in the cases of Michael and Paul and 6 months in the case of Allan. 
46Since the applicants seek to establish manifest excess in respect of not only their overall sentences but also for individual sentences, it is necessary to set out the sentences imposed for each offence.
Individual Offences - Michael Mitchell
47For the larceny offence Michael Mitchell received a fixed term of 5 months to commence on 12 January 2013. 
48For the Adaminaby offence he received a sentence of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months to commence on 12 June 2013. 
49For the Cabramurra offence he received a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months to commence on 12 December 2013.  
Individual Offences - Paul Mitchell
50For the offence of break, enter and steal at Tumut Paul Mitchell received a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 12 January 2013.
51For the larceny offence he received a fixed term of 5 months to commence on 12 July 2013. 
52For the Adaminaby offence he received a sentence of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months to commence on 12 December 2013. 
53For the Cabramurra offence he received a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months to commence on 12 June 2014. 
Individual Offences - Allan Mitchell 54For the larceny offence Allan Mitchell received a fixed term of 6 months to commence on 12 March 2013. 
55For the Adaminaby offence he received a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 12 September 2013. 
56For the Cabramurra offence he received a sentence of 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 12 March 2014.
The Crown concession concerning the impact of the resentencing by this Court for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences
57The Crown conceded that with the resentencing by this Court in respect of the sentences imposed by Robison DCJ, ""this Court should intervene to resentence the applicants to reflect the impact of the successful appeals on the overall sentences imposed"" (CWS [4]).  In oral submissions, the Crown Advocate conceded that this could be by reduction of the extent of accumulation as well as by the imposition of lesser individual sentences, so as to arrive at a lesser overall sentence.  Whether these concessions are well-founded is a question to which I shall return.
Ground of appeal and submissions - Michael Mitchell
58Michael Mitchell raised a single ground of appeal:  
The sentences both individually, and in combination, are manifestly excessive. 
59There was no complaint about the fixed term of 5 months for the larceny offence but it was contended that the sentences imposed for the aggravated break and enter offences are manifestly excessive and so too is the total effective sentence having regard to:
a)The objective seriousness of the offences, particularly given that the ""serious indictable offence"" committed within the premises was stealing (as opposed to some other more serious offence) and the ""circumstance of aggravation"" was being in company (as opposed to other more serious circumstances).
b)The applicant was a youth aged 19 at the time of the offences.
c)Prior to the offences the applicant had never been sentenced to imprisonment.
d)The pleas of guilty and the limited finding of remorse.
60Whilst King DCJ did not make any definitive finding about the level of objective seriousness of the offences, it was submitted that they were ""well below the mid-range"". 
61The starting points which must have been adopted prior to the 25 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty were 4 years 8 months (Adaminaby) and 5 years 4 months (Cabramurra).  These were too high, it was submitted, when regard was had to the factors identified above.  It followed that the judge must have given too much weight to the objective seriousness of the offences and too little weight to the applicant's subjective case.
62In oral submissions, Mr Smith, counsel for the applicant, embraced the Crown's concession and submitted that in the application of the principle of totality the degree of accumulation of the sentences imposed by King DCJ should be reduced. 
63Counsel made further submissions concerning the objective seriousness of the aggravated break and enter offences.  The circumstance of aggravation averred was ""in company"".  It was accepted that this can be a significant matter of aggravation when it involves a victim being confronted by a number of offenders, but in this case the number of offenders only operated to enable the breaking into the premises and the theft of property to be more likely successful; for that reason it was of less significance as an aggravating circumstance.
Grounds of appeal and submissions - Paul Mitchell
64Paul Mitchell also raised a single ground of appeal:  
The sentences imposed when considered alone, and in combination, are manifestly excessive and a different sentence is warranted at law. 
65It was clarified in the oral submissions of Ms Kluss, the applicant's counsel, that the complaint was confined to the length of the individual sentences for the aggravated break and enter offences and the total effective sentence. 
66Generally, it was submitted that the sentences were manifestly excessive having regard to the same four matters identified in the submissions for Michael Mitchell (see above at [59]). 
67Reference was made to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics but there was no indication in the written or oral submissions as to how they bore upon an assessment of the ground of appeal.
68Reference was made to King DCJ having found special circumstances but the overall sentence for the Southern Tablelands offences involved a non-parole period that was 69 per cent of the head sentence.  When considered in combination with the sentence for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences the non-parole component is 71 per cent.  It was submitted that the finding of special circumstances had resulted in the judge erring by imposing a longer overall sentence rather than a lesser non-parole component.   There is nothing in the judge's sentencing remarks that supports this contention and I reject it.
69Parity was also raised in the written submissions, despite there being no ground asserting error in this respect.  It was pointed out that while the applicant was youthful and had not previously been imprisoned, he was sentenced to an overall term for the Southern Tablelands offences that was only a month less than Allan Mitchell who was considerably older and had a much more substantial prior record.  This submission overlooks the fact that the applicant was to be sentenced for the additional offence of break, enter and steal that he committed at Tumut a month before the offences he committed with his brothers.  It was a significant offence and it was conceded on the hearing of the application that it was open to the judge to have imposed a 2 year term of imprisonment.
Grounds of appeal and submissions - Allan Mitchell
70Two grounds of appeal were raised:
1. The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive. 2. His Honour erred in not finding special circumstances.
71It was contended in written submissions that the offences were below the middle range of objective seriousness, although not at the lower end of the range in the same way as the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences had been found to be.  That was said to be because there were no statutory aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and all (or virtually all) of the property had been recovered.
72There was no complaint about the application of the principle of totality by the judge with regard to the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences.  It was accepted that there could be no complaint about the 6 months partial accumulation upon the sentences for those offences. 
73It was accepted that there should have been a distinction made with the sentencing of the applicant's two younger brothers in relation to the offences that were in common, given his age and criminal history.  Aside from those aspects, there was nothing in the facts which indicated any greater or lesser role of the applicant when compared to the roles of his brothers.
74It was submitted that there was error in the judge failing to find any measure of remorse, having regard to the pleas of guilty and what appeared in the Pre Sentence Report and the psychological report.
75Mr Ramage QC, who did not prepare the written submissions, raised a potentially erroneous aspect of the sentencing remarks where King DCJ said in relation to this applicant, ""His poor criminal history is an aggravating circumstance"". How his Honour regarded it as ""aggravating"" was not explained.  A criminal history cannot operate in aggravation so as to produce a sentence that exceeds what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances but such a history may be ""pertinent to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie"": R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [15], [26] (Spigelman CJ).
76As to the seriousness of the offences, Mr Ramage described the larceny offence as ""very irritating and very annoying"" for the owner but it could hardly meet the description of the sentencing judge of being a part of ""a sequence of very serious criminal conduct"".  He also took issue with the judge taking into account in considering the seriousness of the aggravated break and enter offences that they were committed at night, ""thereby destroying the owners' trust in the security of their premises"".  He submitted, in effect, that such planning as there might have been for the offences was, at most, cursory and the execution rather amateurish:  for example, to steal a safe and tow it away, only to have become detached and fall down an embankment.  There was also the fact that most of the stolen property was recovered.  So, in short, the submission was that the judge was wrong to characterise the offending as ""very serious criminal conduct"".
77In relation to Ground 2, it was submitted that the applicant required a longer than usual period of parole supervision because of his history of drug and alcohol dependence.
Crown submissions
78The Crown submitted that the sentences were not manifestly excessive for a number of reasons.  Whilst King DCJ did not explicitly indicate what he considered to be the level of objective seriousness of the offences, he made a number of comments that were inconsistent with a finding that they were below the mid-range of seriousness.  He said that the offences were ""part of a sequence of very serious criminal conduct"" and ""it is impossible ... to find they were not, at least to some extent, pre-planned"".  When considered in conjunction with the offences at Gilgandra and Narrabri, there was ""a period of significant criminal offending over approximately a four day period"".  They broke into premises at night and took anything ""they could lay their hands on"".  He concluded that ""their conduct showed little concern for the community or for the individual business proprietors or club members who might have been affected by their conduct.  They also committed the offences at night, thereby destroying the owners' trust in the security of their premises.""
79In relation to the severity of the overall sentences, the Crown pointed to the fact that there was a substantial degree of concurrency between the individual sentences.  Although the offences were committed in a relatively short time-frame, they were discrete offences with different victims and this warranted a degree of accumulation of the sentences. 
80The Crown also submitted that the sentencing judge took all relevant aspects of the applicants' subjective cases into account.  No further leniency was warranted, particularly when none of them were found to have good prospects of rehabilitation in the light of their histories of drug use and offending, albeit the latter was less so in the cases of Michael and Paul Mitchell.  King DCJ was well aware of the young ages of those two and took it account generally and, along with other factors, in finding that there were special circumstances warranting lesser non-parole periods.
81In relation to the parity arguments raised in the submissions for Paul and Allan Mitchell, the Crown submitted that the differences in their sentences were explicable on the basis of their respective ages (21 and 39 respectively); their criminal histories (a number of matters resulting in fines, bonds and community service against a more substantial record with many prior occasions of imprisonment); and the findings of the sentencing judge in relation to remorse (of limited significance in respect of Paul and none in respect of Allan).  To those matters may be added the additional offence for which Paul Mitchell was sentenced. 
82In relation to Ground 2 of Allan Mitchell's appeal complaining of a failure to find special circumstances, the Crown pointed to the fact that King DCJ had adverted to the issue and declined to make the finding.  There are many cases in this Court in which reference has been made to special circumstances involving a discretionary finding of fact as to which the Court will be slow to intervene unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly excessive (or inadequate); for example: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]. 
Consideration
The Crown concession
83I cannot agree with the Crown concession that there should be intervention by this Court because of its earlier reduction of the sentences imposed upon the applicants by Robison DCJ.   
84The written submissions for the Crown focussed on the extent of concurrence of the sentences imposed by King DCJ with the sentences imposed by Robison DCJ.  For example, it was pointed out that for Allan Mitchell, the non-parole period imposed by Robison DCJ was 2 years and the sentences imposed by King DCJ were concurrent with that period to the extent of 18 months; but as a result of resentencing by this Court the period of concurrence was reduced to 6 months.  In relation to both Michael and Paul Mitchell, the period of concurrence was reduced from 11 months to 2 months.
85Focussing on the degree of concurrence is misplaced.  Attention should be directed to the degree of accumulation.  In determining the sentences for the Southern Tablelands offences, King DCJ was required first to determine the appropriate individual sentences before assessing the extent to which they should be concurrent or accumulated having regard to the principle of totality: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45]. Because the applicants were serving the sentences earlier imposed, he was also required to assess the extent to which the sentences he imposed should be concurrent or accumulated upon the earlier sentences: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 66; R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481 at [11]; Choi v R [2007] NSWCCA 150 at [157]. In applying the principle of totality in both respects, he was required to consider questions of concurrence or accumulation in the manner described by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41:
""[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""  (Emphasis added)
86King DCJ obviously considered that the sentences he was imposing could not ""comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence"", namely the Gilgandra and Narrabri matters.  He determined that the additional criminality in those offences was best reflected by accumulating his sentences by 6 months, in the case of Allan Mitchell, and 4 months, in the cases of Michael and Paul Mitchell.  On any view, these were very modest degrees of accumulation.  
87In my view, even with the reduction of the sentences by this Court for the Gilgandra and Narrabri matters, no lesser degree of accumulation can be countenanced. 
Manifest excess
88There can be no criticism of King DCJ saying that Allan Mitchell's criminal record was ""an aggravating circumstance"", except perhaps to say that for the sake of clarity, in order to foreclose argument on appeal there might have been an explanation for how it operated as such.  The remark cannot be interpreted as the judge thinking that the criminal record aggravated the objective seriousness of the offences.  Allan Mitchell's sentences for the break, enter and steal offences were only 6 months longer than those imposed upon his younger brothers.  That is an appropriate differential to reflect the differences in the individual cases and is not indicative of an erroneous assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences.
89The submission advanced on behalf of Paul Mitchell that his overall sentence is too close to that imposed upon Allan Mitchell cannot be accepted.  The additional break and enter offence at Tumut necessitated less difference in the overall outcome of the two cases.  The operative effect of that additional offence is that 6 months was added to the overall term he was required to serve.  Against a fixed term of 2 years, about which there is no complaint, that is a modest outcome in a practical sense.
90However, I am of the view that the sentences for the aggravated break and enter offences are manifestly excessive.  They were offences of a lower order of seriousness than it may be inferred that King DCJ considered them to be, although certainly not at the lowest end of the range.  They involved incursions into commercial premises rather than private residential homes and the property stolen was unlikely to have had sentimental value to the owners.  The serious indictable offence was stealing as opposed to something more serious; and the circumstance of aggravation was constituted by the offenders being in company.  Circumstances of aggravation that may be involved in offences of this type include offenders being armed; using corporal violence; inflicting bodily harm; depriving a person of their liberty; or knowing that someone is within the premises: s 105A Crimes Act. Generally speaking, those circumstances are usually of greater seriousness than when an offence is committed ""in company"", particularly where no victim is confronted by the offenders. 
91Further, it was accepted that there were none of the aggravating factors listed in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act such as the offences being committed in a home; the offences causing substantial loss; or the offences being part of planned or organised criminal activity.  As to the latter, it may fairly be said that the offences were executed in a rather clumsy and amateurish fashion. 
92All of this is not to say that the absence of aggravating factors operates as a mitigating feature; it is merely to put the offences within a context of the range of criminality that can be encountered in offences against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.  The starting points for these sentences before the 25 per cent reduction for the pleas of guilty should have been lower and the resulting sentences should have been correspondingly less.
93There can be no legitimate criticism of the degree to which King DCJ partially accumulated the sentences. For Michael Mitchell, the first sentence was accumulated by 4 months upon the Robison DCJ sentences.  The second and third sentences were accumulated by 5 months and 6 months respectively. The sentences imposed upon Paul Mitchell were accumulated by 4 month, 6 months, 5 months and 6 months.  The sentences imposed upon Allan Mitchell were each accumulated by 6 months.  The Crown submissions on this subject should be accepted. 
94The submission that King DCJ was in error in not finding that Allan Mitchell was remorseful should be rejected.  His Honour only had the contents of reports; the applicant did not give evidence.  Oral evidence is not a prerequisite for a finding of remorse (Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [17]) but in the circumstances it was open to the judge not to find that there was remorse.
95Similarly, the complaint under Ground 2 of Allan Mitchell's appeal should be rejected.  A finding of special circumstances might have been open, although the basis for it was tenuous.  This was not a case in which there were ""significant positive signs which show that if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and that this is not merely a possibility"":  R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [57] (Bellew J).  Moreover, the issue of special circumstances was not overlooked.  His Honour considered it but declined to make the finding.  There was no error. 
Evidence on re-sentencing
Michael Mitchell
96Affidavits were read in the event the Court came to consider re-sentencing.  He had one disciplinary infraction last November:  he pleaded guilty to an offence of failing a prescribed urine test.  This involved the use of buprenorphine and resulted in him being removed from an Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program. Since then he has been at the South Coast Correctional Centre where he has been studying full-time in the Intensive Learning Centre.  He has completed some vocational training courses, intends to return to live in Tumut where his parents live and he has an offer of employment. So, the picture in terms of rehabilitation prospects appears a little more positive than it was at the time of sentencing.
Paul Mitchell
97According to his solicitor's affidavit, Paul Mitchell is also being held at the South Coast Correctional Centre. He completed an Intensive Drug and Alcohol Program last October.  He has not failed any urine tests.  He is enrolled in a TAFE course and is working as part of a traineeship in metal fabrication.  He is also participating in the Intensive Learning Centre program and completed a 3-day Young Offenders program. He has plans for employment and study upon his release.  
98The Crown sought verification of these matters and a response by way of letter from the General Manager of the gaol was annexed to the affidavit of the Crown Advocate's instructing solicitor.  Paul Mitchell received relatively minor punishment for the disciplinary offence of ""fail to comply with correctional centre routine"" last December.  Rather than completing the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program, he in fact was removed from it due to use of buprenorphine.
Allan Mitchell
99An affidavit sworn by Allan Mitchell's solicitor includes that he is being held at Junee Correctional Centre and is attending an ongoing drug and alcohol course.  He has completed a ""managing emotions"" course.  Further, he is unable to perform more than light duties as a sweeper because of a back complaint; he has hepatitis C and claims he cannot obtain medication in custody; he receives no visits; and he has hopes for employment upon release as he holds a forklift licence. 
100In the short time available the Crown was only able to obtain a general response from Justice Health about the claim concerning medication for hepatitis C:  the wide range of services it provides for prison inmates includes a pharmacy service; it ""provides clinical care for patients with hepatitis C and HIV within NSW custodial facilities at all stages of their condition""; and it has a program to deal with such issues that ""was developed to ensure standardised best practice"". 
101No submission was made by Mr Ramage that the Court should accept his client's claim of not receiving medication for his hepatitis C condition. It was not submitted that the Court should find that imprisonment is more onerous because of this.
Re-sentencing
102Application of the principle of totality in the context of imposing lesser sentences for the Southern Tablelands offences requires a reconsideration of the degree of partial accumulation of the individual sentences.
Michael Mitchell
103The fixed term sentence of 5 months for the larceny offence should be maintained.
104In lieu of the sentence of 3 years 6 months (from a starting point of 4 years 8 months) for the aggravated break and enter at Adaminaby, there should be a sentence of 2 years 7 months (reduced from 3 years 6 months on account of the plea of guilty).
105In lieu of the sentence of 4 years (from a starting point of 5 years 4 months) for the aggravated break and enter at Cabramurra, there should be a sentence of 3 years (reduced from 4 years). 
106The total effective sentence should be one of 3 years 8 months (in lieu of 4 years 11 months).  The finding of special circumstances by King DCJ should be maintained but greater effect should be given to it on account of the applicant's better progress towards rehabilitation since he was sentenced.  The overall non-parole period should be 2 years 3 months (in lieu of 3 years 5 months).
107In conjunction with the sentences for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences, Michael Mitchell will become subject to an overall term of 4 years (in lieu of 5 years 3 months) with a minimum of 2 years 7 months (in lieu of 3 years 9 months) to serve.
Paul Mitchell
108The fixed term sentences of 2 years for the break and enter offence at Tumut and 5 months for the larceny offence should be maintained and there should be the same sentences for the aggravated break and enter offences as proposed for Michael Mitchell.
109The applicant had the benefit of the larceny sentence being entirely subsumed within the sentence for the Tumut break and enter.  No-one raised any issue about this so I do not propose to alter that arrangement in resentencing.
110The total effective sentence should be 4 years (in lieu of 5 years 5 months). The finding of special circumstances by King DCJ should be maintained but greater effect should be given to it on account of the applicant's improved progress towards rehabilitation since he was sentenced.  The overall non-parole period should be 2 years 6 months (in lieu of 3 years 9 months).
111In conjunction with the sentences for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences, Paul Mitchell will become subject to an overall term of 4 years 4 months (in lieu of 5 years 9 months) with a minimum of 2 years 10 months (in lieu of 4 years 1 month) to serve.
Allan Mitchell
112The fixed term sentence of 6 months for the larceny offence should be maintained
113In lieu of the sentence of 4 years (from a starting point of 5 years 4 months) for the aggravated break and enter at Adaminaby, there should be a sentence of 3 years (reduced from 4 years on account of the plea of guilty).
114In lieu of the sentence of 4 years 6 months (from a starting point of 6 years) for the aggravated break and enter at Cabramurra, there should be a sentence of 3 years 4 months (reduced from 4 years 6 months). 
115The total effective sentence should be 4 years 2 months (in lieu of 5 years 6 months).  There should be a finding of special circumstances because the applicant has now demonstrated some progress towards rehabilitation since he has been in custody and he should be encouraged to continue through a longer period of parole supervision.  I propose an overall non-parole period of 2 years 9 months (in lieu of 4 years).
116In conjunction with the sentences for the Gilgandra and Narrabri offences, Allan Mitchell will become subject to an overall term of 4 years 8 months (in lieu of 6 years) with a minimum of 3 years 3 months (in lieu of 4 years 6 months).

JUDGMENT
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:   I agree with Adamson J. 
2FULLERTON J:  I agree with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Syme DCJ on 9 May 2013, following his conviction after trial, as follows:
Count no.Section of Crimes Act 1900OffenceMaximum Penalty/ Standard Non-Parole periodSentence1S 61LIndecent assault on JJ on 31 March 20125 years Fixed term of 4 months to date from 9 May 2013 and to expire on 8 September 20132S 61ISexual intercourse without consent against JJ on 2 April 201214 years /7 yearsTotal term of 4 years to date from 9 May 2013 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months

4Her Honour found special circumstances and adjusted the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term from 75% to 62.5%.
5The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence for the second count was manifestly excessive.
Facts
Count 1: indecent assault on 31 March 2012
6The victim arrived in Australia on 24 March 2012 on a student visa. Within a few days of her arrival, she obtained employment with the applicant and his wife at their Thai restaurant at Crow's Nest. The applicant's wife was pregnant with their first child. On 30 March 2012, the victim's first day at work, the applicant was overly friendly towards her and made inappropriate sexual comments. The next day, towards the end of her shift, the victim was alone with the applicant in the restaurant. He approached her in the washing up room, grabbed her from the front, put his arms around her and tried to kiss her on the cheek. She resisted and said, ""No, I don't want this"". He persisted and undid her bra strap under her T-shirt. He put his hands on her chest and rubbed her breasts. She was afraid and begged him to stop. Ultimately she managed to free herself after raising her voice.
Count 2: Sexual intercourse without consent on 2 April 2012
7On 2 April 2012 the applicant continued to make inappropriate comments. He suggested that she be his mistress and become pregnant to him. At his request, she worked a full shift. At the end of the shift, after they had finished cleaning the restaurant, he switched off the light, followed her into the washing up room, grabbed her and forced her against a bench. Despite her resistance, he tried to kiss her, held her hands tightly behind her back with one hand, tried to undo her bra and then forced his hand under her T-shirt. He forced his hand down the front of her trousers and digitally penetrated her vagina, a short way and for a relatively brief time, which the victim estimated to be about a minute. She was afraid and begged him to stop. Eventually she managed to extricate herself. He said, ""You are wet already, that thing of yours smells nice, it's not like the other woman's"".
8The applicant gave the victim a lift home but continued speaking inappropriately to her. She complained both to her flat-mate and to her boyfriend and reported the matter to police the following day.
9At trial the applicant denied any wrong-doing and said that the victim flirted with him, that she kissed him and that he only touched her pubic hair. The jury must be taken to have rejected his evidence by its verdict of guilty on each count.
The sentence hearing
10The Crown tendered the indictment and the applicant's criminal history which showed that he had had no prior contact with the police. The Crown also tendered a pre-sentence report dated 3 May 2013 and a report of pre-sentence consultation. It also tendered a victim impact statement from JJ who said that she had been suffering from flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia. She also said:""The biggest impact on my life is how it affected my work.  I need to work to support my study but after trying to return to work I found that I can't trust my male bosses or co-workers.  I don't want to be nice to them at all in case they get the wrong impression.  I'm always thinking about not putting myself into the same situation or making myself vulnerable to being attacked again.  It is too stressful for me to work.""
11The applicant tendered a letter dated 3 May 2013 from Far East Migration Consultant Pty Limited, various character references and a report of Dr. Ashkar, psychologist, dated 6 May 2013. The applicant's wife gave evidence at the sentence hearing about her immigration status (holder of a student visa) and that of the applicant (whose visa is linked to hers).
The remarks on sentence
12The sentencing judge recited the facts that are set out above. Her Honour noted the victim impact statement and the distress the victim suffered as a result of the offending conduct. Her Honour said:""This sadly is a normal and usual consequence of this kind of offence on a victim. It will not form part of an aggravating circumstance but the victim impact statement simply reminds this Court and the offender of the consequences of his behaviour.""
13Her Honour referred to the victim's position as the applicant's employee and said:""To that end she was in a vulnerable position because she needed the work and she was during the course of these offences alone at work with him and he was in a position of power over her. For these offences therefore, it forms an aggravating circumstance because of the relationship between the two participants.""
14Her Honour found:""He completely disregarded her protestations. His actions only ceased when on the first occasion she raised her voice and on the second occasion, after his fingers had entered her vagina, she physically pulled away.""
15Her Honour was not satisfied that the applicant felt remorse, except for himself and for the consequences of his offending on his family, and took into account his good character and lack of criminal record. Her Honour did not, however, consider that his lack of insight and understanding amounted to an aggravating circumstance.  
16The sentencing judge found special circumstances based on the language difficulties arising from his English being poor to adequate and cultural difficulties which will make his incarceration more onerous.  
17Her Honour did not accept the submission that the sentence ought to be structured so as to avoid the applicant failing the good character test for immigration purposes. Her Honour did, however, take into account the circumstance that the imposition of a sentence would be likely to have the effect that the applicant would be deported at the end of his sentence. The sentencing judge considered that this amounted to extra-curial punishment. Her Honour found the applicant to have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, although she also found that he lacked insight into the consequences of his offending on the victim.  
18The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending as follows:""The conclusion from his good character and lack of record is that he should be allowed some leniency.  Taking into account all of the circumstances of the offence that I have referred to, that is, the length of time that the offence occurred, the circumstances of the offence, the fact the victim signified on several occasions both in words and struggling that she was not consenting, the relatively short duration and the fact that he was her employer and that digital penetration only was involved, this is an offence towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness but not at the lowest end.""
Reasons
19The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence for the second count was manifestly excessive.  
20A claim of manifest excess requires the applicant to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principles that there is no single ""correct"" sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]-[59].  Whether a sentence is manifestly excessive is a conclusion. It is not necessary to identify any particular error in the process; it is the examination of the result that leads to the conclusion. 
21Nonetheless it can be helpful to ascertain why and how the sentence was arrived at since this inquiry may explain the conclusion and expose the reason for any manifest excess. 
22Mr Crawford-Fish, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, challenged her Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending as being towards the lower end but not at the lowest end. He relied on two matters in support of his contention that the sentencing judge erred in the assessment with respect to the second count: 
(1) The sentencing judge found that the applicant, as the victim's employer, was in a position of power over her and that this amounted to an aggravating circumstance.
(2) The sentencing judge found that the applicant completely disregarded the victim's protestations.
23Mr Crawford-Fish relied on the victim's attendance at work on days subsequent to the first of the applicant's inappropriate remarks and the conduct that comprised the first count. He contended that her conduct showed that she had a choice whether to attend work and that she chose to do so. He subsequently retreated from the submission but considered that her subsequent attendance showed that the disparity in power between the applicant and the victim was not as substantial as her Honour had adjudged it to be. I do not accept this submission.  
24First, this Court is reluctant to disturb the sentencing judge's assessment of objective seriousness of the offending conduct: see the authorities referred to in Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [46]-[47] per Fullerton J, Ward JA agreeing. Secondly, I do not discern any error in her Honour's assessment in the present case, either in the context of (1) above, or at all. Section 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that an offender's abuse of authority over a victim is an aggravating circumstance that is to be taken into account on sentence. Although the victim may have had a choice whether to attend work after the applicant had first behaved inappropriately towards her, she was obviously in need of money and was subject to a financial imperative to support herself while she was studying. Furthermore, she may have believed that her firm rebuffs had had the desired effect and that the applicant would respect her rejection of his advances. Abuse of authority by the offender, as employer, is not neutralised by the victim reporting for work after the first instance of abuse.
25Mr Crawford-Fish submitted that it was not correct to say, as her Honour did, that the applicant completely disregarded her protestations when her Honour went on to say that he desisted on the first occasion when she raised her voice and on the second occasion when she physically pulled away. He also relied on the circumstance that the applicant drove the victim home after his commission of the second count.  
26I reject this submission. Her Honour was plainly aware that the applicant had ceased the offending conduct at the points referred to above. The applicant's complete disregard of her protestations was not permanent, but lasted as long as the offending conduct lasted. A reader acutely attuned to error could discern a potential inconsistency between the finding that the applicant completely disregarded her protestations and the finding that he stopped the offending conduct at two particular points (when she raised her voice and when she pulled away). However, such an analysis is inappropriate, particularly in respect of remarks on sentence that have been delivered orally and ex tempore immediately following the sentence hearing. Judges who impose sentences in such circumstances (as is the usual practice in the District Court) are entitled to have their remarks read and considered fairly and as a whole, with due consideration of the context in which they have been delivered.  
27I do not discern any error in her Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the second count. It was open to her Honour to find that the offending was towards the lower end, but not at the lowest end, of the scale of seriousness. The digital penetration was effected as a result of the applicant physical forcing himself on the victim when they were in the restaurant together, in the dark. He had already suggested that he should make her pregnant. He was her employer and she was a new arrival to this country. She was terrified of what he would do to her.  
28Her Honour took into account the prospect of deportation as amounting to extra-curial punishment. The fact of actual or potential deportation is irrelevant to the sentencing exercise. It was, accordingly, an error for the sentencing judge to use deportation to determine any aspect of the sentence: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [13]-[14] per Wood CJ at CL, Hislop and Johnson JJ agreeing. In the present case, this error was in the applicant's favour.  
29I do not consider the sentence imposed for the second count to be manifestly excessive. The sole ground of appeal has not been made out.

2764943,Woodward v R [2014] NSWCCA 205,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hamill J.
2FULLERTON J: I agree with Hamill J.
3HAMILL J: Tony William Woodward (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court at Newcastle by his Honour Judge Berman SC on Monday 25 November 2013. He was sentenced on his plea of guilty in relation to one count of dangerous driving occasioning death, an offence contrary to s 52A (1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Following very brief sentencing proceedings and even briefer remarks on sentence, his Honour imposed a sentence comprising a non-parole period of four and half years from 25 November 2013 expiring 24 May 2018 with a balance of term of one of a half years. The total sentence is one of six years.
4The applicant relies on three grounds of appeal: 
(1)The learned sentencing Judge failed to take account of the early plea of guilty.
(2)The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to find special circumstances.
(3)In the circumstances of this case, the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.
5In relation to ground one, the applicant points to the fact that the sentencing Judge said nothing in his judgment to indicate that the plea of guilty had been taken into account. Unusually, his Honour did not even refer to the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty.
6The offence occurred on 5 September 2012. The applicant was charged by court attendance notice on 17 February 2013. A plea of guilty was entered on 21 August 2013 in the Newcastle Local Court. There is no dispute that the plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and that it entitled the applicant to a significant discount from his sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. In R v Thompson [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104, a bench of five members of this Court emphatically determined that where an offender enters a plea of guilty the record should reflect clearly and transparently that the plea of guilty has been taken into account and the extent to which it has ameliorated the sentence imposed. Subsequent cases have made it clear that reference to the plea of guilty and a clear statement of the fact that it has resulted in a reduction in the sentence is usually an important part of a judgment, however brief, delivered in imposing a sentence upon an offender. It is possible to point to cases where a failure to do so has not resulted in interference by this Court, but such cases do not in any way diminish the force of the guideline judgment to which I have made reference. In most of those cases where this Court has not intervened, the sentencing Judge has at least made passing reference to the fact that the plea was entered.
7As I have said, the present case is unusual in that the experienced sentencing Judge failed to make any reference to the applicant's plea of guilty at all.
8It is worth repeating the guideline adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thompson at [160]:
""(i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight.(ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate.(iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.(iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount."" 
9The applicant was entitled to expect a reduction of his sentence of about 25%, that being the top of the range contemplated in the guideline judgment.
10Counsel for the respondent appropriately and properly conceded that ""this is a matter where the applicant's plea of guilty would have been likely to attract a discount of 25%"". She also observed that in Convery v R [2014] NSWCCA 93 the same sentencing Judge was found to have failed to apply a discount for a plea of guilty. However, she pointed to the fact that in Convery v R, the mathematics involved suggested that no such discount had been applied whereas in the present case a 25% discount might be inferred on the basis that his Honour had commenced with a starting point of 8 years and applied the 25% discount to arrive at the total sentence of 6 years.
11While there is considerable force in this submission, it brings into very sharp focus the applicant's more general complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive (ground three). It also provides no answer to the fundamental rationale behind the guideline judgement, which is that there is a policy benefit in acknowledging a plea of guilty in a clear and transparent way. Spigelman CJ in R v Thompson discussed (at [21]-[22], [38], [53] and [162]) the perception in the profession that pleas of guilty were not resulting in significant reductions in sentence, thus discouraging offenders from entering a plea of guilty at an early stage.
12In any event, ground one must be considered along with ground three and I now turn to that ground.
13Assuming that the respondent's submission in relation to ground one is correct, the sentencing Judge imposed a sentence encompassing a starting point of 8 years. That is a very high sentence given both the maximum penalty (10 years) and relevant guideline judgments on sentencing in relation to offences under s 52A: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252.
14In R v Jurisic, Spigelman CJ established the following guideline sentence in relation to this offence (at 231):
""In my opinion this Court should promulgate the following guidelines:
1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment.
2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.
I realise that the formulation I propose - does the relevant aggravating factor manifest, in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct - introduces an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. Nevertheless the formulation of the issue in such a way will serve the objective of consistency of sentencing with respect to conduct that the community has indicated plainly that it wishes to deter and condemn.
The period of three or two years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence. This is also the approach in the English guideline judgment on rape: R v Billam [1986] 1 WLR 349; [1986] 1 All ER 985.""

15Nine circumstances were identified and it was held that ""[t]he presence or absence of these factors -and their degree- will determine the appropriate penalty."" These factors were set out (at 231):
""(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.
(ii) Number of people put at risk.
(iii) Degree of speed.
(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.
(v) Erratic driving.
(vi) Competitive driving or showing off.
(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk.
(viii) Ignoring of warnings.
(ix) Escaping police pursuit.""
16In R v Thompson the Court clarified at [161] that the guideline judgement in R v Jurisic ""should be understood to involve a late plea of guilty"". 
17In R v Whyte this Court (again constituted by a bench of five) confirmed the guideline judgment but added certain comments in relation to it. Spigelman CJ (with whom the rest of the bench relevantly agreed) outlined the characteristics of a ""frequently recurring case of an offence under s 52A"":
""(i) Young offender.
(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.
(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
(iv) The victim is a stranger. 
(v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates. 
(vi) Genuine remorse. 
(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.""
18The present case involved a significant abandonment of responsibility by the applicant and there is no doubt that the moral culpability involved in his behaviour was very high. The facts were not contested and were set out in an agreed statement of facts tendered on sentence. They were in the following terms: 
""About 8.05pm on Wednesday the 5th September 2012, Tony William WOODWARD (the offender), was the driver of a red Holden Commodore sedan. Samual Wayne GUNN (deceased) was a passenger in the front seat.
The offender was the holder of a P1 Provisional license and was therefore subject to zero blood alcohol and a maximum speed requirement of 90 km/h.
The offender drove East on George Booth Drive, Cameron Park. It was dark and fine. The road was dry.
George Booth Drive had one eastbound and one westbound traffic lane. The lanes were divided by a double unbroken line.
The road was of bitumen construction and is an undulating road surrounded by bushland. The posted speed limit is 90 km/h. The road was in good condition.
A short distance east of the Withers Street intersection, on George Booth Drive, the offender crossed the double unbroken lines and entered the westbound lane, to overtake a Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda 3 sedan was travelling at approximately 90 km/h. After the offender passed the Mazda 3 sedan, he returned to the eastbound lane, just before a hill crest. Approximately 600 metres east of Withers Street intersection, at the hill crest on a slight left hand bend, the offender lost control of his vehicle. The vehicle began to rotate clockwise, crossing the double unbroken lines into the westbound lane. The vehicle slid sideways for approximately 50 metres, before the passenger side of the vehicle collided heavily with a tree. The tree was uprooted as the vehicle continued, rotating post-impact and coming to rest facing in an easterly direction, approximately 8 metres east of the tree.
The tree was located approximately 10 metres south of the western lane fog line of George Booth Drive.
The offender's vehicle sustained extensive damage to the left (passenger) side, partially tearing the vehicle cabin in half. During the collision, the offender was ejected from the vehicle. Samual Wayne GUNN remained within the vehicle and sustained critical injuries, resulting in his death.
Gregory ASQUITH was the driver of the Mazda which was overtaken by the offender. ASQUITH was returning home from the central coast. ASQUITH told police that he was overtaken by a vehicle travelling quickly which made him look at his speedo and he saw that he was travelling at about 90 km/h. He told police the vehicle was overtaking over double lines and near the crest of a hill. ASQUITH told police the offending vehicle returned to [its] correct side of the road before the crest and was momentarily lost from sight as it crested the hill. When ASQUITH achieved the crest he looked for the vehicle and saw that it had left the road to his right and collided with a tree. Thomas PULLIN was a passenger in ASQUITH's vehicle. He also checked ASQUITH's speed when they were overtaken over the double lines near the crest of a hill. He told police that ASQUITH was travelling at about 90 km/h. Upon seeing the collision ASQUITH turned his vehicle around and went to assist.
At about 8 p.m. Kristal ELLIS drove with her husband Aaron ELLIS and their son west on George Booth Drive. As they approached a crest they saw a car veer suddenly across their lane in front of them. Mr ELLIS told police it appeared to be rotating clockwise. It left the carriageway, hit a tree and rotated again. Mr and Mrs ELLIS stopped to offer assistance.
The offender was transported to the John Hunter Hospital with minor injuries. At about 9 p.m Blood (682382) and Urine (D26841) samples were supplied by the offender. The Blood sample returned a positive result for alcohol (0.127 gms/100mL). The analysis of the urine sample detected Delta-9-TCH acid.
Police Pharmacologist Dr Perl was asked to provide an opinion on the alcohol and other drugs in the offenders system. Dr Perl advised that without a drinking history she [could] not provide any opinion about the alcohol. In relation to the cannabis Dr Perl stated that Delta-9-TCH acid in urine did not necessarily indicate recent consumption or affectation by cannabis. Delta-9-TCH acid may be present in body fats days weeks or months after the consumption of cannabis. Accordingly, there is no evidence the offender was affected by cannabis at the time of his driving.
The Holden Commodore sedan was escorted to the Newcastle Holding Yard for a mechanical inspection. A later inspection concluded there was no mechanical defect in the Commodore that would have contributed to the crash.
The offender declined the opportunity to be electronically interviewed.
The Crown complains that the offender was driving too fast for the conditions, driving under the influence of liquor and overtaking when it was not safe to do so.""

19In evidence the applicant admitted that he was walking around the streets drinking cans of bourbon and coke. He said he had consumed five to six cans each of which contained around 1½ standard drinks. He knew that he ""shouldn't be behind the wheel"".
20As I have said, and as Judge Berman SC found, these facts show that the applicant had abandoned responsibility to a significant degree. A number of other road users were placed at risk by his erratic and aggressive driving. He was driving while under the influence of alcohol or at least with a blood alcohol level of 0.127 gms/100mL. His provisional driver's license required him to have a blood alcohol level of zero. 
21The case involved more than one of the aggravating features referred to in the guideline judgements. However that does not make this case unique and the sentence, if it involved a starting point of eight years, was substantially higher than one would have expected for a case involving one victim who was not (it appears) a stranger to the offender. Higher sentences have been imposed but usually they have involved either multiple victims, conviction after trial or the aggravated version of the offence. 
22The victim's family provided moving testimony as to the devastation that the applicant's conduct has caused. The Court received victim's impact statements from Mr Gunn's parents, his grandmother, his sister and his partner. They have suffered a terrible loss and the impact on each of them has been, and no doubt continues to be, severe. Their pain and grief should again be acknowledged. 
23The applicant, who was 26 years old at the time of the offence, had a criminal history including a prior offence (in 2006) of low range PCA in relation to which no conviction was recorded. The other matters on his criminal record were not particularly relevant and had resulted in the imposition of bonds and community service orders. He had never previously been sentenced to imprisonment. He had a traffic record but that record was not particularly lengthy or bad. 
24The sentencing Judge was placed in a difficult position because very little evidence was tendered on behalf of the applicant to establish a subjective case. The applicant gave brief evidence describing his family circumstances and apologising to the victim's relatives and to his own family. There was a pre-sentence report and a letter from the applicant's partner confirming that the applicant had three children aged 5 years or younger at the time of sentence. There was also a letter from a general practitioner noting that the applicant was taking anti-depressant medication. There was no evidence exploring or confirming that the applicant was suffering from a depressive illness although the pre-sentence report noted that the applicant himself was ""of the opinion that he is depressed at this time"". The pre-sentence report also noted that he had not followed up on a referral to a psychologist and ""was unsure whether he wished to proceed"" with drug detoxification or rehabilitation. 
25However, even in the absence of such material, the sentence imposed in the present case was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" and ""manifestly wrong"": Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [22] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ). It was, as ground three contends, manifestly excessive. 
26In coming to this conclusion I am conscious of the fact that the guideline judgements in R v White and R v Jurisic were not ""unduly prescriptive in setting out a range of sentences for a typical case"" and that the court ""made no reference to the upper limits of such a sentence but endeavoured to indicate a lower limit for a typical case"": see WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165 per Hoeben CJ at CL at [74]-[76]; see also Stanyard v R [2013] NSWCCA 134 per Fullerton J at [40]. 
27Nevertheless I am persuaded that the sentence imposed on the applicant exceeded by a significant degree the proper boundaries of an appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
28The substance of ground two, the failure to find special circumstances, concerned the question of whether counsel for the applicant at first instance had conceded that special circumstances did not exist. Judge Berman SC said that counsel had, as he understood it, conceded that there were no special circumstances in the case. It was certainly true that Counsel's submissions on the subject were brief, not to say diffident and unhelpful. All that was said was:
""Nothing I can put in terms of special circumstances, other than those that are set out in the presentence report but really when one looks at it he was an accident going somewhere to happen.""
29The learned Crown Prosecutor said that he was ""not sure I understood my friend's submission in relation to special circumstances"" and referred to some matters that may have been capable of amounting to special circumstances. He said ""I expected to hear that his youth, first time in custody and the matter in the report saying that he'd benefit form a period supervision ... might enliven special circumstances"". Counsel for the applicant made no submission in reply. 
30In the circumstances it is readily understandable how his Honour proceeded on the basis that special circumstances had not been established. Where there is to be a submission that there should be an adjustment to the non-parole period pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), counsel has an obligation to state with clarity just what those special circumstances are. In any event, it was open to the sentencing Judge to conclude that the evidence did not require an adjustment to the non-parole period under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I would not uphold ground 2. 
31In resentencing the applicant, I have taken into account the maximum penalty of 10 years along with the non-prescriptive guidelines to which I have referred. The present case has some of the features of the ""frequently recurring"" case described in R v Whyte but not all of them. The applicant was not a particularly young offender and he had some criminal history. He was injured in the collision and taken to the hospital although the nature of his injuries was not made clear in the evidence other than to say they were ""minor"". The victim was not a stranger. There was evidence of his remorse. He told the author of a pre-sentence report that ""he should have died in the crash rather than the victim, and that he deserves to be punished for his actions"". The applicant also gave evidence that he was sorry.
32I have taken into account the fact that the guideline judgments related to cases where there was a late plea (presumably encompassing a discount in the vicinity of 10%) whereas the applicant is entitled to a discount of 25%. 
33But for the applicant's early plea of guilty, I would have imposed a sentence of five years because the moral culpability involved in this case and the abandonment of responsibility was very high. As the respondent pointed out, not only was the applicant well over the legal limit in terms of his blood alcohol reading but he was also speeding and, as a P-plate driver, he was in breach of the conditions upon which he was entitled to drive at all. His manoeuvre of crossing double separation lines as he approached the crest of a hill was reckless to a substantial degree. 
34From the starting point of 5 years I would deduct 25% (1 year and 3 months) for the early plea of guilty. The total sentence will be three years and nine months. The circumstances set out in the presentence report and the brief evidence of the applicant on sentence do not establish special circumstances. An affidavit tendered by the respondent concerning the applicant's time in custody does not assist him. Accordingly, the non-parole period will be 75% of the total sentence: see s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This will be rounded down to keep the sentence in sensible round figures: cf Rios v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 8 at [42]-[43] (Adamson J), Akkawi v R; Akkawi v R [2012] NSWCCA 11 [101]-[102] (Simpson J) and Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98 at [2] (Hidden J) and [37] (Hamill J). The non-parole period will be two years and nine months. 
35I propose the following orders:
(1)Application for leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal upheld.
(3)The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 August 2016. There will be a balance of term of one year commencing on 25 August 2016 and expiring on 24 August 2017. 
(4)The applicant will be eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2764944,TT v R [2014] NSWCCA 206,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Hamill J.

2FULLERTON J: I agree with Hamill J. 

3HAMILL J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court by his Honour Judge Conlon on 4 October 2013. The applicant was convicted after trial in relation to one offence of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. That is an offence contrary to s 350 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.

4The Judge imposed a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of three years.

5The grounds of appeal are as follows:
(1)His Honour erred by overstating the objective seriousness of the offence.

(2)His Honour erred by understating the subjective case-namely the diagnosis of major depressive illness which was before the court.

(3)His Honour erred in declining to make a finding of special circumstances.

(4)The sentence was manifestly excessive.

6In oral argument counsel for the applicant, who did not draft and sign the written submissions, said that other grounds were ""related to ground one"" and ""turn on whether or not ground one is successful"". I do not understand the basis of this concession, and I will deal with the other grounds briefly by reference to the way they were argued in the written submissions. 

7The first ground of appeal involves a consideration of the relevant facts of the case. As I have said, the applicant was convicted after trial and this Court does not have all of the material relied upon at the trial. However, the sentencing Judge set out the facts in a little detail before making the finding as to objective gravity which is impugned by ground 1. The facts have not been subject to challenge in the written submissions or in the oral argument. Those facts were as follows: 
""In early 2005 the deceased Louise O'Brien came to live at 26 Wynn Street, Woonona with TT and her family. TT and Louise's mother Katherine McDonald had been friends for many years. Mrs McDonald was awaiting Department of Housing accommodation in the Wollongong area and the arrangement for Louise to take up residence with the T family was so she could commence her schooling at Woonona High rather than have to change later in the year. Thereafter Katherine McDonald saw her irregularly.

Patricia Goddard was TT's mother, she lived at 35 Chounding Crescent, Bellambi. Ms Goddard would visit her daughter's home almost on a daily basis. Whenever TT was away working at carnivals Patricia Goddard would stay to look after the children.

The evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the last time Louise O'Brien was seen alive was Sunday 12 October 2008. On the morning of that day [BT] (14 years of age at the time) saw Louise in the hallway of 26 Wynn Street. She saw a bump on the side of her head. She said, ""It was squishy, you could put your finger in it"". She told her mother TT who said, ""She'll be okay"". [BT] was to attend a Lebanese festival at Fairfield on that Sunday along with TT. Before they left [BT] said that TT told Ms Goddard to leave Louise alone and not to touch her. [BT] said when they left that morning DT was there along with some of the younger children including [WT] (ten years of age) and [TT] (nine years of age).

During the course of that day [BT] received a call on her mobile phone from Ms Goddard. [BT] said she sounded really worried and wanted to talk to TT. [BT] put the phone on loudspeaker and handed it to her mother. [BT] heard Ms Goddard say that Louise got smart and she threw the hammer but it missed. TT asked for DT to be put on the phone. He said, ""Nan threw the hammer and it did hit Louise"". TT asked if it hit hard and DT said, ""No"". TT then asked for Louise to be put on the phone. [BT] said that TT told her to stay awake and she will go and pick her up. [BT] said, ""Louise was murmuring like she was going to fall asleep."" She could not make out what she was saying"". [BT] stated that TT then told DT, ""To put her in the caravan and make sure the kids didn't see anything"".

During the course of that phone conversation [BT] also recalled there being mention of ""Louise going in and out"" and TT telling DT ""to put her in the shower"". [BT] then said, ""D yelled at nan and told her to get out and take the kids"". [BT] also recalled D saying ""she wasn't breathing"" and her mother freaking out saying, ""Fuck, fuck, fuck"". [BT] said that was when she heard Patricia Goddard tell the kids to get to their rooms.

Other witnesses also observed Louise O'Brien on that day injured and distressed. Chantelle Gibson and [AT] visited 26 Wynn Street that day. [AT] said Louise was ""very drawn and pale. Her hair had been cut and it looked like with a pair of scissors, it was all very, very short and she was shaking and she just wanted water and she looked very ill"". [AT] also observed a cut above her right eye. Chantelle Gibson said: ""Her head was very roughly shaven about 1 centimetre in length. Initially I noticed that she had something in her teeth and I realised that it was what looked like dried blood in between her teeth. She had a cut above her right eye...it wasn't long but it was wide and open and the blood around the area was quite dark. The right side of her face was extremely swollen and her nose looked a lot flatter than what I remember and she appeared to have, have like two black eyes, were quite dark underneath"".

Ms Gibson also observed that ""she was standing but having great difficulty standing. She was sort of swaying and would go down to put her hands on her knees and lean down..."". She recalled Louise asking for a drink of water and Patricia Goddard saying, ""Just stand up, stand up fucking straight"". Ms Gibson and Ms [AT] then left and later that evening reported their observations to Wollongong police requesting that Louise's welfare be checked.

Also on Sunday 8 October 2008 Ms Leanne Gordon attended 26 Wynn Street to collect some washing powder. She saw Louise O'Brien. She said, ""She had chunks taken out of her hair, like shaved, skinny and I thought she was drunk...because she was stumbling like she wasn't herself she was all over the place"". Ms Gordon said she asked Louise to go with her however Louise ""just shook her head and went back inside"". The next day Monday 13 October 2008 Ms Gordon reported her concerns to the Wollongong police regarding the welfare of Louise.

[WT] was just short of 11 years of age as at 12 October 2008. His interview with the police was conducted on 27 May 2011 (when he was 13 years of age). That interview (edited) became his evidence-in-chief. Whilst acknowledging that given the circumstances it would be difficult to be precise in respect of all details, I found his evidence of significant matters to be impressive. He recalled Louise ""making noises like how you can't breathe real good"". He said her eyes went shut. He saw DT and Adam pick her up and carry her to the bath. He said they put her in the bath with warm water. He said Patricia Goddard came ""and started tapping on her like to make sure she's awake and she got panicky. Her face turned all red she started crying"". He said she was telling Louise to get up and she asked DT and Adam to come back in from the caravan. She then told them to lift her into the back room.

[WT] gave precise details concerning the position she was in in that back room. A blanket had been placed over her and a heater in front of her and he said he then walked out to that room to check her pulse. He then said to Patricia Goddard, ""Nan, Louise is dead"". Ms Goddard said, ""No she ain't, no she ain't"", and asked where he checked her pulse. He later gave details of how he checked her pulse in her arms and neck. He said, ""Her face wasn't pale anymore, like it turned all blue"". He said Patricia Goddard then called D's mobile and asked him to come back in (from the caravan) and check Louise's pulse. He said DT came in and said to Ms Goddard, ""She's still breathing"". [WT] said he knew that he had checked it the right way and said, ""No she ain't"".

[WT]'s memory was that he and some of the other children went down to the park and when they returned Louise was gone from the back room. He believed the only place she could have been was in the caravan. [WT] also had a memory of the police visiting his home later that night when he was bed.

[TT] was a year younger than [WT]. In her interview with the police (25 May 2011 - edited) she recalled being in the home when Louise fell from a chair to the ground and that she was not moving. She said DT and Adam then carried her from the room, carried her by the legs and under her arms. She said she looked like she was asleep. She said she recalls being locked in her room. She was unsure where her mother was on that day however she recalls police and ambulance attending later that evening.

Unfortunately the memory of the police officer who attended the premises that evening, being 12 October 2008, as well as the memories of the officers who attended the next day (13 October 2008) were vague as to their precise movements at the home. However, one thing is certain. They did not see Louise and were assured that whilst she was not there, she was safe and well.

I have no doubt that certainly by 13 October 2008 (and possibly by late12 October) Louise had passed away. I similarly have no doubt that Louise's body was moved to 35 Chounding Crescent, Bellambi and that afterwards TT had organised for Beau Broadbent and DT to dig a hole at the site of those premises. Louise's body was then buried in a bin and placed into hole. TT and DT then pretended that Louise was alive and well and living elsewhere. That pretence was maintained until the remains were discovered by police on 28 February 2011. TT and DT assisted Patricia Goddard in this way so that she might escape responsibility and punishment for the death of Louise O'Brien.""

8After setting those facts out his Honour said:
""The Court has been referred to a number of decisions concerning sentences for accessory after the fact to murder and accessory after the manslaughter. In R v Walsh and R v Sharp [2004] NSWSC 111 at [4] Howie J stated: 

'In many cases, the criminality of an accessory after the fact to manslaughter will be the same as that of a person convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder'.

In R v Abdulrahman [2007] NSWSC 578 Studdert J commented at [9]: 

'...Mr Button of Senior Counsel was correct to draw attention to the difference in the maximum penalties provided in s 349 for accessory after the fact to murder and in s 350 in relation to accessory after the fact to manslaughter. Section 349 provides for a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment and s 350 provides only for a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. In my opinion the maximum penalty provided by the Crimes Act for this type of offence pays insufficient regard to the gravity of accessorial involvement in the taking of a human life. I consider the maximum penalty warrants review by the legislature. However, I must sentence the offender in accordance with the statute as it presently stands'.

Section 350 covers a very broad range of criminality as it extends to a multitude of criminal offences. I am in agreement with the Crown submission that manslaughter must be viewed as probably the most serious indictable offence after the crime of murder. Therefore being an accessory after the fact of manslaughter must be considered the most serious form of offence of accessory after the fact as it involves accessorial involvement in the loss of human life.""

9The observations of Howie J in R v Walsh, R v Sharp [2004] NSWSC 111; (2004) 142 A Crim R 140 to which the sentencing Judge referred must be considered in context. The full text of what Howie J said on the subject was:
""4. In many cases, the criminality of an accessory after the fact to manslaughter will be the same as that of a person convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder. In both cases the accessory knows that an unlawful killing has occurred. The determination of the offence for which the offender is guilty will depend upon the offence for which the principal offender is convicted. That is the case here. In all probability had Mr Walsh been convicted of murder, Ms Sharp would have been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder. If that had been the result she would have been liable to a maximum penalty of not 5 years imprisonment, but 25 years imprisonment.

5. However, I must sentence on the basis that Parliament has determined that an accessory after the fact to manslaughter is on any facts liable to a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. In this case, had I not been restricted by the maximum penalty, I would have sentenced the offender Sharp to a full-time custodial sentence. Ms Sharp's criminality does not justify such a sentence as against the maximum penalty prescribed, notwithstanding the seriousness of her conduct.""

10The point that the sentencing Judge appeared to be making was the same point made by Howie J, namely that the accessory's liability is tied to the offence (murder or manslaughter) with which the principal is charged or convicted. Neither the sentencing Judge, nor Howie J, should be taken to have been suggesting that the seriousness of a crime under s 350 is the same as a crime under s 349. This is simply because of the significant difference in the maximum penalties involved. I do not understand Howie J or the sentencing Judge to be saying anything beyond noting that the kind of assistance that an accessory may provide the principal can be similar, however the homicide is charged.

11Similarly, the comments of Studdert J in relation to the appropriateness of legislative review of the maximum penalty must be considered in the context that there has been no increase in the maximum penalty. So it is that the maximum penalty for accessory after the fact to manslaughter carries the same maximum penalty as accessory after the fact to any other indictable offence.

12The comments made by the sentencing Judge in the present case appear to me to be an implicit call for consideration to be given to the appropriateness of the maximum penalty, and little more than that. I do not accept the submission that those comments, particularly those at the end of the passage that I have extracted above, indicate that the sentencing Judge fell into error in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. His Honour was simply drawing attention to the fact that where an accessory is involved in the disposal of a corpse, that fact is likely to take the case into the more serious end of the spectrum of crimes contemplated by s 350. There is ample authority to support this: see R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205 at [11] (Simpson J); R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104 at [19] (Buddin J); R v Galea, R v Yeo [2000] NSWSC 301; R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944. 

13In R v Quach, Simpson J said at [11] ""I take the view that assistance in the disposal of a body after a murder takes a crime of this kind into the upper echelons of the offence against s 349."" While the cases to which I have referred are cases prosecuted under s 349 of the Crimes Act, they have equal application to offences of accessory after the fact to manslaughter under s 350.

14However, Fullerton J said in Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [45]:
""It does not follow that if the assistance an accessory renders is of a different or less direct kind (as well it might be in the case of a contract killing of the kind alleged here) that it necessarily constitutes offending of a lesser order of objective seriousness. Each case must be assessed on its own facts.""

15In R v Johnson [2014] NSWSC 1254 I suggested that an assessment of the objective gravity of offences of this kind (in that case accessory after the crime of murder) involves a consideration of a number of factors which include, but are not limited to:
(1)The circumstances of the homicide itself.

(2)The extent of the knowledge in the accessory of those circumstances.

(3)The precise act, or acts, which constitutes the offence of being an accessory after the fact.

(4)The length of time over which the offender assisted the principal offender in escaping justice.

(5)The extent to which the acts of the offender successfully delayed, or thwarted, the investigation and prosecution of the principal offender.

(6)The motivation of the offender in committing the crime.

(7)The offender's conduct in being motivated by a sense of misguided loyalty or emotional attachment to the principal offender. This is a circumstance of particular significance in cases where a family member assists the principal offender.

(8)The disposal or destruction of a corpse. These cases generally fall at the upper end of the range of criminality for the offence.

16In R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408, Hidden J said ""in many cases of this kind the offender's conduct is the product of emotional attachment or dependence or a misguided sense of loyalty. No doubt, that accounts for most, if not all, of the cases in the judicial commission statistics which were disposed of otherwise than by full-time custodial sentences."" In R v Quach Simpson J referred at [13] to the offender's state of ""fear, loyalty and confusion"" arising from his relationship with the principal. 

17Counsel for the applicant relied on the fact that the principal offender in the present case was the applicant's mother. While that is true, there was little or no evidence as to the nature of that relationship or the extent to which it motivated the applicant. There was no evidence as to whether a sense of loyalty or attachment lay behind the awful things that the applicant did. The applicant has at all times denied any involvement at all. The psychologist report included:
""According to [the applicant] she would have reported her mother's actions had she been aware of the fact that she had inflicted grievous bodily injuries to a young woman with her subsequently dying at her mother's home."" 

18It is noted that the basis of the principal's liability was her failure to obtain medical treatment rather than an allegation that she had inflicted grievous harm upon the victim. Nevertheless, the applicant's comments to the psychologist made it difficult to sustain an argument that she was motivated by her misguided loyalty, or emotional attachment, to her mother. 

19The applicant's criminality in the present case went well beyond her involvement in arranging for the disposal of the victim's dead body. She also involved herself over a lengthy period of time in remarkably deceptive and callous conduct in which she (and other members of her family at her direction) told lies to a series of people as to the whereabouts of the victim. At all times she maintained that the victim was alive and well. These lies included deceiving the victim's mother as to the plight of her daughter. By her actions in perpetrating that deception and in arranging for the young woman's body to be buried she successfully diverted the police investigation for a period of more than two years. The sentencing Judge had no doubt that the victim was dead by 13 October 2008 on which date the applicant arranged for a man to dig a hole telling him that she needed to ""bury a dog"". The pretext that the victim remained alive continued until 28 February 2011. On that day, the police discovered her decomposed remains.

20Counsel for the applicant relied on both the relationship with the principal offender as well as the fact that no indignities such as dismembering or destroying the corpse had been visited upon the victim. Whilst each of those things are true, I am not satisfied that the offence was not properly categorised as an offence at the very upper end of offences prosecuted under s 350. The following factors pointed in that direction: 

(1)The principal offence was a homicide involving the death of a very young woman.

(2)The applicant appeared to be intimately aware of the circumstances in which the victim died. Indeed the evidence showed that she was aware that the victim was unwell on the day before her death. While her involvement at that stage could not be taken into account in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, it highlights the extent of the applicant's knowledge of the circumstances of the crime: Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [36] (Fullerton J) and [125] (Hamill J). 

(3)The acts of the applicant involve both the disposal of the body and perpetrating a number of lies to distract both the victim's family and the police from discovering the death of the victim.

(4)The lies and deceptions were sustained and perpetrated over a period in excess of two years. 

(5)The conduct of the applicant successfully assisted the principal offender in escaping justice for a lengthy period of time.

21The sentencing Judge was wrong to say that manslaughter must be viewed as ""probably the most serious indictable offence after the crime of murder"". Given the maximum penalty of 25 years and the fact that there are many crimes for which the maximum penalty is life, that statement cannot be correct. However, the offence is amongst the most serious because it involves the loss of human life. Further, his Honour was correct in assessing the objective criminality of the present offence under s 350 as an offence towards the very top of the objective range of criminality that might be contemplated by that crime.

22I would reject ground one.

23In spite of the concession by counsel who appeared at the hearing, it is appropriate that I refer also to grounds 2 and 3. These were argued together in the written submissions. While there was evidence before the sentencing Judge that a psychologist (Gerry Wenzel) was of the opinion that the applicant suffered from a serious depressive illness and had done so for many years, there was nothing in the evidence that required some ""automatic consequence [to follow]"" from the presence of that condition: see the comments of Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 (at 68) which were applied by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [44]-[45]. 

24The applicant's psychological condition may have been relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion in a number of ways: see R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [21]-[27] (Spigelman CJ). However, this was not a case where there was a causal link between the condition and the offending such that the objective gravity of the crime, or the applicant's moral culpability, was diminished. Nor was there any evidence to support the proposition that general and specific deterrence were not significant matters in an assessment of the appropriate sentence. The psychologist's report did not support a conclusion that the psychological condition would make the applicant's time in custody more onerous. Accordingly, it was open to the sentencing judge to approach the evidence in the way that he did. Certainly the sentencing judge referred to the opinion of the psychologist and there is no suggestion that he disregarded it.

25I would reject ground two.

26In the written submissions, ground 3-which contends that the sentencing Judge ought to have found that there were ""special circumstances"" under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)-was linked with the evidence concerning the applicant's depressive illness. A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary exercise. His Honour took the view that a reduction of the sentence below three years would have resulted in a sentence that he considered to be manifestly inadequate in the particular circumstances of the case. This approach was open to the learned sentencing Judge in the exercise of the discretionary judgment.

27I would reject ground three.

28Ground four asserts that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The written submissions articulated this ground as follows:
""30. Should the Court not find specific error in the grounds set out above, it is alternatively argued that taking into account the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

31. The applicant has served two and a half years of her term. Over this period, her mother - the co-offender - passed away. It is respectfully submitted that the court should proceed to impose a lesser sentence in accordance with the law."" 

29Nothing was added to this submission at the hearing of the application. 

30The applicant was a person with a very minor criminal history. Her criminal history did not disentitle her to leniency. The depressive illness could be taken into account in assessing the appropriate sentence, as was the subjective history set out in that report. The applicant was 43 years at the time of the offences. She had a ""compromised"" education having left school during year eight to find work. According to the report, she and her siblings were frequently confronted with violence in the family home. Sometimes her mother punished her by beating her with a stick. She was not only subject to such treatment herself but she also witnessed it being visited upon her siblings. One particular incident involved one of her brothers being burnt with a hot electric iron after he had been accused of stealing. She had a background of ""socio-economic hardship"". She left home at 13 years of age and had worked in a showground. She had had three partners over her adult life and had a total of nine children with those men.

31On the other hand the applicant had demonstrated no remorse at all. Her approach to the police investigation into what she knew was the young woman's disappearance was calculated, callous and cold-hearted.

32It is clear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour considered imposing the maximum penalty. It was, no doubt, the combination of the applicant's lack of criminal antecedents and her sad subjective background that led his Honour to impose a sentence less than that. 

33Over a maximum penalty of five years, and given her subjective circumstances, the total sentence of four years was a stern one. However I am not persuaded that, given the gravity of this offending, it was ""manifestly unreasonable or plainly unjust"": see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [22] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ) and [59] (Kirby J).

34There is ""no single correct sentence"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [27] and [133], cf Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, at [46]. The sentencing Judge presided over the trial and was familiar with all of the evidence including the electronically recorded interviews with the applicant. His Honour was intimately aware of the facts and circumstances of the case whereas this Court has been provided with an appropriately limited amount of material. This is a classic example of a case where an appellate court should be cautious before interfering with the exercise of the wide discretion as to sentencing entrusted to the sentencing judge. 

35Even if an individual judge of this Court may have imposed a lesser sentence, the Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge: Markarian v The Queen (supra) at [28]. Nor does it mean that the sentence actually imposed was wrong in law, manifestly excessive or unjust.

36I would reject ground four.

37In view of the length of the sentence when considered against the available maximum penalty, I would grant leave to appeal. However I would dismiss that appeal.

38I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

2764946,WorkCover v Everwilling Cranes Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 379,"The defendant Everwilling Cranes Proprietary Limited (Everwilling) pleads guilty to a charge that on 29 October 2010 at Granville in New South Wales it failed by its acts or omissions to ensure that persons not in its employment, Mr Mike Matthew Borg and Michael Walker, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of the defendant’s undertaking in contravention of s 8(2) of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000.
	
	
	The offence occurred in the course of construction of a substation for Integral Energy. That construction required the placement of approximately 121 precast concrete panels of various dimensions and weights.
	
	
	The principal contractor on the site was One Build Pty Limited which engaged Hanson Precast Pty Limited (Hanson) to manufacture, supply and install the precast concrete panels. Hanson sub-contracted the installation work to Cross Lift Pty Limited (Cross Lift), a dedicated rigging company. Cross Lift, in turn, engaged the defendant Everwilling, a provider of mobile cranes.
	
	
	Mr Jamie Henderson, the general manager of Everwilling Cranes, attended upon the site and prepared a safe working statement in consultation with Hanson and Cross Lift. He was told the weight of the panels to be lifted but not informed of the circumstance that the panels required rotation upon one axis before installation.
	
	
	Everwilling had previous dealings with Hanson and Cross Lift and in those dealings one or both of those companies had advised Everwilling when a rotation was required. On this occasion neither company informed Mr Henderson of that requirement.
	
	
	If the panels were delivered on a truck in the necessary plane no rotation would be required. In the instant case because some of the panels were approximately nine metres in length it would not have been practicable to ensure delivery in the appropriate plane.
	
	
	Everwilling provided a Grove model GMK5130 for the purpose of the work. On the day of the incident this crane was operated by Mr Boyce, an employee of Everwilling. Mr Boyce was assisted by Mr Telford, a dogman.
	
	
	It became apparent to those two men that the concrete panels which had been delivered required rotation. This was a step which had not been addressed in the safe working statement prepared by Mr Henderson.
	
	
	Contrary to their training and instructions Mr Boyce and Mr Telford proceeded to lift and rotate the panels by use of an auxiliary lift attached to the crane. In so doing the auxiliary hoist was overloaded by approximately 51% of its safe working capacity.
	
	
	Because of this overloading, the sheath of the crane failed, severing the wire rope of the auxilliary hoist. Part of the wire rope lashed and struck Mr Borg causing bruising to his shoulder. Part of the sheave was explosively ejected narrowly missing a bystander Mr Michael Walker, a leading hand employed by One Build.
	
	
	It is beyond question that given the forces involved and the nature of the failure, serious injury to either Mr Borg or Mr Michael Walker were reasonable possibilities.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offence is to be determined by a synthesis of the extent of the risk of injury and death, the degree of foreseeability and the simplicity of obviation. The defendant Everwilling Cranes had available a 300 tonne crane which was perfectly suitable for the purpose of rotation without risk.
	
	
	The prosecution submits that the risk was eminently foreseeable by Mr Henderson. I do not believe that to be the case. When Mr Henderson attempted to prepare his safe working statement he was apprised of no fact which would have put him on notice that rotation was required.
	
	
	On previous occasions when rotation was required he was apprised of the circumstance by Cross Lift and Hanson and a safe working statement was prepared and approved by them which dealt with that contingency.
	
	
	The safe working statement prepared by Mr Henderson in this case was submitted by him to both Hanson and Cross Lift and it was apparent that rotation was not envisaged. Neither Hanson nor Cross Lift had demurred from the system designed by Mr Henderson.
	
	
	By its plea of guilty the defendant does accept that Mr Henderson prudently in every case should enquire whether rotation was part of the system and not assume that the clients would provide that information to him. This is a long way from courting of the risk. It is a long way from a failure to advert in any sense to the safe means of effecting the lift.
	
	
	Mr Henderson did direct his mind to it upon the basis of the facts disclosed to him by the client. Understandably, but in breach of the defendant’s duties under the Act he did not make further enquiries.
	
	
	I think the culpability of Mr Henderson is relatively low. The culpability of Mr Telford and Mr Boyce is patent. They had been trained in operations, trained by the manufacturers and inducted into the safe working system required for this lift.
	
	
	They had been specifically instructed to stop work if there was a departure from the safe working system and to seek advice from Mr Henderson. They ignored those instructions. The culpability of those two men is in relation to the defendant a culpability which is to be weighed against the hierarchy of responsibility within the defendant’s operations.
	
	
	It seems to me that Mr Henderson in requiring those men to report to him departures from the safe working system had done everything a reasonable employer could have done. There was a practice of the defendant supervising its employees and there is evidence that he had cause to believe that Mr Boyce and Mr Telford were responsible employees.
	
	
	While I accept that the personal culpability of Mr Telford and Mr Boyce was high the extent to which the defendant is responsible for that culpability is moderated by their lack of seniority within the defendant’s operations.
	
	
	I accept that the operation of cranes, and in conjunction with extremely heavy loads, is a dangerous operation and there is need for perpetual vigilance and in this case the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	Since the accident the defendant has instituted a system whereby the Occupational Health & Safety officer is to be notified of all lifts of slabs and she has responsibility fors determining whether rotation is required.
	
	
	I have before me a letter from Mr Mainfield, a state manager of Austral Precast, which over 10 years has utilised the defendant’s services in the installation of precast concrete sections. Mr Mainfield says that throughout the relationship he has always found the senior management team and their employees conscious of safety and engaged in planned approach to hazards, identification risks, assessments and control.
	
	
	The defendant was not unconscious of its responsibilities in relation to health and safety and had a system in place addressing those responsibilities before the event. I do not believe that there is any significant need for the sentence to reflect specific deterrence.
	
	
	Subjectively the defendant has expressed contrition and remorse, co‑operated with WorkCover and adopted measures necessary to overcome the deficiencies revealed by this event.
	
	
	The defendant employs 46 workers, 36 of whom are crane drivers and dogmen and it has operated since 1995. Although it has two convictions arising out of one event in 2008 this record in a high risk industry while not perfect is commendable.
	
	
	The maximum penalty is $825,000. Although the personal culpability of Mr Henderson, as I say, is not great, I cannot ignore the gross irresponsibility of the employees Mr Boyce and Mr Telford.
	
	
	The defendant operates in a dangerous industry and I cannot ignore the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	I think in all the circumstances an appropriate penalty is $120,000. It is agreed that the defendant will pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $25,000. I do not think this is entirely out of proportion such that it requires that it be deducted from the $103,000.
	
	
	I discount $120,000 by 25% in consideration of subjective factors remorse, contrition and co‑operation with the prosecution.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $90,000.
	
	
	I order that WorkCover have moiety of the fine and order the defendant pay the prosecution’s costs in the sum of $25,000.

		03 March 2016",2014-10-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764952,Afacan v R [2014] NSWCCA 203,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:OffenceOn 22 April 2013 the applicant, together with a co-accused Michael Francis Tavares, pleaded not guilty before his Honour Judge Letherbarrow SC and a jury to the following offence:
That they on 17 October 2011 at Canley Heights and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did detain John Tjahjono without his consent and with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely a sum of money and in circumstances of aggravation in that they were in company, contrary to s86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.
2On 6 May 2013 the jury found the applicant and the co-accused guilty of this offence.  The applicant seeks leave of the Court to appeal from that conviction on the basis that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
3The applicant was sentenced on 24 July 2013 to a 2 year intensive correction order.  There is no appeal against sentence.  The appeal is against the conviction alone.
Crown case and evidence at trial
4The Crown case was as follows:  The victim was a 60 year old Indonesian man who had lived in Melbourne since 1976.  He had previously had a serious car accident and suffered brain damage, lost his job and marriage and developed a gambling problem.  He had started to use ice to help him deal with his depression.
5About two years before the offence, the victim met Mr Gurgelgi and the applicant through mutual friends.  Through his connection with Mr Gurgelgi the victim travelled to Sydney and met a person known as ""Diddy"" who suggested that the victim supply ice for him in Melbourne.  Mr Gurgelgi was also interested in supplying ice for Diddy in Melbourne.  
6In October 2011 the victim's endeavours in supplying ice in Melbourne for Diddy ended badly.  He did not secure enough payment for one deal of ice, he used some of the drug for his own consumption and he used proceeds of the collective sales to gamble.
7Shortly before the date of the offence, the victim ended up owing Diddy and his supplier (known as ""Tiger"") the sum of $30,000 which he could not pay.  Both Diddy and Tiger were Sydney based suppliers of ice to the victim.
8On 15 October 2011 the applicant and Mr Gurgelgi asked the victim to travel to Sydney with them to settle the debt with his Sydney based supplier (Tiger).  About three hours later, in the early hours of 16 October, the applicant and Mr Gurgelgi arrived at the victim's home in a hired yellow Holden Commodore and they left to drive to Sydney.  The vehicle had been hired by the co-offender, Michael Tavares, who shared the driving with the applicant.
9The group arrived at a hotel in the Sydney CBD in the early afternoon.  This was captured on CCTV.  At about 4pm they travelled to Cabramatta to meet up with Diddy and Tiger in the car-park.  This meeting was also captured on CCTV.
10Tiger spoke to the victim about the outstanding debt, he threw away the victim's mobile telephone and threatened to cut off a finger for every $5000 which remained unpaid.  Tiger gave him three weeks to pay up.  After this meeting, the victim confessed to feeling relieved that he had secured some extra time to pay the debt.
11After the meeting at Cabramatta the applicant, Mr Gurgelgi and the victim returned to the hotel where they stayed the night.  The group checked out of the hotel the next morning.  They regrouped a few hours later when the applicant and the co-offender returned to pick up the victim at about 3pm.   The victim got into the rear seat with Mr Gurgelgi.  The co-offender was driving and the applicant was in the front passenger seat.  About five minutes into the trip, the applicant started to demand money from the victim.  The applicant was unhappy.  He punched his window and screamed at the victim demanding money.
12When the victim told him that he did not have any money, the applicant told him to get it from his family nominating his daughter.  The applicant told him that if he did not get the money, he would not be going back to Melbourne.  Mr Gurgelgi threatened him and said that he knew where his daughter lived.  
13The victim felt scared.  He heard the central locking system click and Mr Gurgelgi told him that he was not getting out of the car.  He wanted to get out of the car but the doors were locked.  The applicant and Mr Gurgelgi wanted $10,000.  Mr Gurgelgi said that if he did not give it to them, he would shoot him in the leg.  
14At about 4.10pm the vehicle was driven into a Caltex service station at Canley Heights.  The applicant, the co-offender and Mr Gurgelgi exited the vehicle at various times to refuel and go into the shop.
15After waiting a few minutes, the victim opened the car door and ran off towards the Canley Vale shops.  The applicant and the two others saw this and immediately pursued him.  Most of this was caught on CCTV.
16The victim sought aid from staff at a Chinese restaurant where he ran to hide from his pursuers in the toilet.  He asked them to call triple 0 but they refused.  He continued running and sought help from another café owner who did call triple 0 on his behalf.  He was chased by his pursuers.  The victim spoke to the triple 0 operator and said that he was scared as he was being chased.  
17Two bystanders witnessed the victim being chased and gave evidence as to seeing him being pursued by men in a car.  One of the bystanders said that the victim asked for help as ""those guys were after him"".
18An important part of the Crown case was CCTV footage which the Crown submitted supported parts of its case.  In summary, the CCTV footage showed the following:
(1)The hotel lobby showing the victim, Mr Gurgelgi, the applicant and the co-accused.
(2)Footage from the Cabramatta car-park depicting the victim, Tiger and other unknown persons in which:
(a)Tiger gave Mr Gurgelgi a hug.
(b)The applicant and the co-accused were shown.
(c)Tiger went out of view wherein the victim commented that he threw the mobile telephone onto a nearby roof.
(d)Tiger gesturing to the victim which was said to be him saying ""You better pay"".
(3)Footage from the Amora Hotel reception depicting the applicant carrying a white bag together with the victim and the co-accused.
(4)Footage from outside that Hotel showing:
(a)The same three people outside the Hotel approaching a yellow car.
(b)The victim standing to the rear of the driver side passenger door.
(c)Mr Gurgelgi walking towards the boot of the car from the lobby area.
(5)Footage from the Caltex service station showing:
(a)Mr Gurgelgi get out of the car.
(b)The co-accused get out of the driver's door.
(c)The applicant get out of the car.
(d)The co-accused re-enter the driver's door.
(e)The co-accused walk into the service station shop.
(f)A police officer follow the co-accused into the shop.
(g)The applicant enter the shop.
(h)Mr Gurgelgi enter the shop.
(i)The victim get out of the car.
(j)The victim running.
(k)Mr Gurgelgi running.
(l)The victim approaching someone (whom he said he asked to call triple 0 but that person kept walking not saying anything); and
(m)The victim coming into the restaurant.
19The CCTV footage from the Chinese restaurant showed the co-accused entering.  The victim did not see that because he was hiding in the toilet.  
Defence case
20Neither the applicant nor the co-offender gave evidence.  The applicant did participate in an ERISP.  In the ERISP he denied kidnapping the victim and insisted that he was just trying to assist him by going to Sydney to help him sort out his drug debt with Tiger.
21An analysis of the ERISP shows a rambling explanation of events, including an account of the police arriving at the scene and arresting the co-offender.  At that point the applicant and Mr Gurgelgi ran away and waited a few hours.  He said that he thought that when his co-offender explained everything to the police they would know that they were good guys and they would let him (the co-offender) go so that they could return to Melbourne.  When the co-offender did not return after several hours, he and Mr Gurgelgi jumped on a bus to go to Melbourne, effectively abandoning the hire car. 
22In general the defence case depended upon the cross-examination of the victim and the identification of inconsistencies and contradictions in his evidence.  The applicant's case was that the evidence of the victim was inherently dubious and internally inconsistent in a number of material respects.  The applicant submitted that the Crown's case depended upon the jury accepting the victim's evidence but that it was so implausible as to not be capable of being accepted.
Challenges to the evidence of the victim
23In relation to the presence of a police officer in the service station shop the victim said that he wanted to try to escape at the time but the car door was still locked and he could not get out.  He said that when he eventually realised that the door was not locked, the police officer had already left.
24The victim agreed that he entered into the arrangement with Diddy so that he could make some money.  He agreed that he had sold ice for Diddy, that he had spent some of the proceeds of the sale and had used some of the ice for his own purposes.  He was cross-examined as to contradictions in his evidence about his contact with Tiger.
25The victim was reluctant to agree that the applicant and his friends offered to go to Sydney with him in order to help him when talking to Tiger.  The victim eventually agreed that he thought he would be safer with the applicant and his companions when he met Tiger.  In the police interview, he said that when he returned to the car he told his friends he was happy with how the meeting turned out and he thanked them.  In his evidence at trial he said that when he got back into the car, no-one said anything about helping him.
26He was cross-examined about whether it was possible for him to get out of the back seat of the car.  That issue remained inconclusive.  He was cross-examined to the effect that the back doors to the car were not locked whereas he maintained that on occasions they were locked but when he was at the Caltex service station he discovered that the doors were not  locked.
27The victim agreed that at no time in the whole journey between the city and the service station did he ask for the car to stop so that he could get out.  He said that he tried to get out a number of times but the door was locked.  When he tried at the petrol station after sitting there for a couple of minutes, he discovered that the door was unlocked.
28The victim agreed that when he returned to his flat he told Mr Gurgelgi and the applicant that he had lost his money and now owed Diddy $30,000.  He was aware that Tiger and others had come to Melbourne looking for him.  They had been to his flat and spoken to his flatmate.  The victim was the one who wanted to then go to Sydney to confront Tiger.  He was scared that he might get hurt.  He agreed that the applicant had offered to go with him to make sure that he would not get hurt, to protect him.  He did not think that the applicant knew Diddy or Tiger.  He agreed that in the trip to Sydney all his expenses were paid (i.e., car, fuel, hotel).  He agreed that the applicant and co-accused remained in the car while he spoke with Tiger in the Cabramatta car-park, except for a very short period when they introduced themselves to Tiger and returned to the car.
29The victim agreed that he returned to the car and told the applicant and the co-accused that everything was all right because he had been given another three weeks.
30In summary, the applicant submitted that the narrative of events which the victim deposed to was implausible.  He submitted that it made no sense for him to have helped the victim confront Tiger and Diddy so as to gain an extension of time for payment if he then intended to demand money from him.  This was against a background of he and his friends having paid for the victim's trip to Sydney and being aware that he had no money.
31He submitted that the evidence as to the sequence and detail of events given by the victim was inconsistent with the CCTV footage.  He submitted that the evidence of the victim was internally inconsistent and changed as he continued to give evidence.  He submitted that the victim by reason of his disposition or otherwise was unable to provide a cogent version of events or provide responsive answers to propositions put to him throughout his evidence.
32Based on the implausibility of the victim's story as a whole, and the inconsistencies in his evidence, the applicant submitted that the jury's verdict could not be supported by the evidence and was unreasonable.
Crown response to Applicant's submissions
33The Crown submitted that the key parts of the victims narrative were fully supported by the objective evidence.  While there may have been some differences in peripheral detail, the Crown submitted that the victim was clear and emphatic when answering questions on important parts of the offence put to him in cross-examination.  The Crown submitted that at no stage did the victim deviate from his evidence that he was detained against his will for a period of time in the car that afternoon by the applicant and Mr Gurgelgi, during which detention they made repeated threats to him.  He was adamant that he escaped at the first opportunity which he perceived and ran some several hundred metres seeking help from bystanders.  Those bystanders witnessed others pursuing him.  Finally, he sought assistance of police with a triple 0 call.
34The Crown noted that the victim's credibility was attacked on the basis of his prior drug use, his gambling, his indebtedness to Diddy, his gambling binge at the Crown Casino, his drug dealing, his criminal history and a prior false statement to police in relation to a drug supply.  He was cross-examined on these matters at length.  The Crown submitted that the applicant freely admitted all of those matters.
35Although there was limited cross-examination of the applicant as to inconsistencies between his police statement and his sworn evidence at trial, the issues raised were very limited and peripheral to the key elements of the victim's evidence.
36The Crown submitted that exhibits G and H (being still photographs taken from the CCTV footage at the Caltex service station) provided strong support for the victim's evidence that when the police officer was in the shop, there was still one of either the applicant, Mr Gurgelgi or the co-offender near to the car.  The Crown submitted that exhibit H and the CCTV footage (with time stamps) indicated that there were only seconds between when Mr Gurgelgi finished putting petrol in the vehicle and when he joined his co-offender inside the shop.  It was at that point when all three of the offenders were inside the Caltex shop, that the victim escaped from the car.
37The Crown submitted that it was obvious from the CCTV footage that the applicant and his co-offenders all demonstrably reacted to the victim's flight from the vehicle by turning around, looking out towards the vehicle and simultaneously leaving the shop together.  Within seconds the co-offender got into the vehicle and drove out of the service station in pursuit of the victim.  The Crown submitted that this simultaneous and powerful reaction of the offenders to the flight of the victim provided compelling support to his evidence that he had been detained against his will in the vehicle.
38The Crown referred to CCTV footage, taken from a nearby hotel, which showed the victim on the footpath pursued by Mr Gurgelgi.  A Google map, which was tendered in the proceedings, indicated that the distance between the hotel and the Pho Hing Restaurant was about 200 metres.  It was over this relatively substantial distance that the victim was pursued by Mr Gurgelgi.
39The Crown relied upon the evidence of Mr Faale Vaotuua, who was standing outside the Pho Hing Restaurant on the afternoon of 17 October 2011 when he saw the victim running towards him.  The victim asked for his help as two men were chasing him.  Mr Vautuua saw the yellow vehicle and a male passenger call out to the victim words to the effect ""Uncle, uncle come inside the car we can take you back"".  The victim went into the restaurant followed by the passengers from the vehicle and shortly after, the driver of the vehicle followed the others.  Mr Vautuua heard the passenger tell the victim to come outside of the restaurant and repeatedly told him to get into the vehicle.  The victim stayed inside.  About five minutes later, the police arrived and arrested the co-offender, Tavares.  
40Mr Paipa Lokeni was outside the Pho Hing Restaurant when he saw the victim run towards him and ask for his help as there were men after him.  Mr Lokeni saw a vehicle approach and the driver and backseat passenger were calling out ""Uncle, uncle come here"".  Mr Lokeni said that the victim was scared and hid behind them.  Mr Lokeni described how the passengers' voices changed and became angrier when the victim would not go with them in the car.  The passenger and the driver followed the victim into the restaurant who by this time had run towards the back of the restaurant calling out for help.
41When the first detective on the scene spoke to the victim he noticed that he appeared scared and dishevelled.  The victim made immediate complaint to that police officer and made a formal police statement that day.
42The Crown relied upon the contents of the triple 0 call.  The Crown noted that the call clearly indicated that the victim had entered the Canley Heights Corner Café and asked the owner to call the police.  First the café owner spoke to the operator and then he passed the telephone over to the victim. The victim told the operator that he was scared and that he had been kidnapped.  He was scared that the men were still coming for him.  He said that he had been told to get money and the man's name was Yunis.  He abandoned the call when he saw the two men come into the café.  By that stage the police had arrived.
Consideration
43The law in this area is now well settled.  In SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said:
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1).  The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""
It is then necessary to apply those principles to the facts of this case.

44There were inconsistencies in the evidence given by the victim.  I agree with the Crown, however, that on the essential elements of the offence there were few such inconsistencies.  To the extent that there were inconsistencies they were, as the Crown submitted, in relation to relatively minor and peripheral matters.  No complaint is made concerning the directions provided by the trial judge.  The jury were directed appropriately as to the onus of proof and the standard of proof and were reminded that they had to assess the witnesses and decide whether they were telling the truth and whether their accounts were accurate.  His Honour gave extensive and appropriate directions on circumstantial evidence and the drawing of inferences.  
45His Honour gave a Murray type direction and clearly explained to the jury that in cases where the Crown relied essentially on the evidence of one person, such as in this case, it was important for the jury to exercise caution before they convicted an accused.  The jury was directed that:
""... unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tjahjono is an honest, reliable, and accurate witness in the account he has given you, you cannot find the accused guilty."" 
46His Honour fairly summarised the case for both the Crown and the defence.  He pointed out that it was the Crown case that despite his questionable background, the victim was an honest and accurate witness on the important issues relating to the offence and that this could be confirmed by the jury, taking into account the CCTV footage, the content of the triple 0 call and the eyewitness accounts.  In summarising the defence case, his Honour noted that the applicant submitted that the victim was an unreliable, inaccurate and untruthful witness whom they would not accept.  He reminded the jury that it was the defence case that the victim was a self-confessed drug user and dealer and had admitted lying to the police in the past.  His Honour repeated that it was submitted by the defence that the applicant's evidence was unbelievable.
47On 3 May 2013 the jury sent out a note (MFI 6) which requested clarification of the single key witness direction.  In response his Honour repeated the Murray direction and when counsel for the applicant queried the wording which his Honour had used, his Honour recalled the jury and redirected them again with a more detailed Murray direction.
48Accordingly, it could not be said that the jury were not fully aware of the necessity to carefully examine the reliability and honesty of the victim's evidence before they could convict the applicant.  Insofar as the victim's evidence is concerned, the jury was in a far better position than this Court to assess his demeanour when responding to questions put in cross-examination.  
49This Court is in a position to compare the evidence of the two eyewitnesses and the content of the triple 0 calls with the evidence of the victim.  There is a high level of consistency in that evidence.  I am satisfied on my reading of that evidence that it provides strong support for the proposition that the victim was genuinely afraid of the applicant and his companions and was seeking to escape from them.
50The most powerful evidence in the Crown case was the CCTV footage.  This shows the victim escaping from the car and the immediate and dramatic reaction of the applicant and his companions to that event. The CCTV material shows the applicant and his companions suddenly turn to look outside the shop.  It is clear from their expressions that they are surprised by something which they are looking at.  The three of them then rush from the shop.  It next shows the victim endeavouring to move away from the service station in order to escape the offenders.
51I am satisfied on the basis of that material, not only that the victim was genuinely afraid of the applicant and his companions, but that this fear was based on having been detained by them in the car and having been threatened by them unless he produced a sum of money.
52It follows that given the advantage which the jury had of seeing and hearing the victim give his evidence, coupled with my own assessment of the evidence of the bystanders, what was said in the triple 0 calls and what was shown in the CCTV footage, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.
53The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
54McCALLUM J:  I have read the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in draft and have undertaken my own independent assessment of the evidence in the trial. I agree with the Chief Judge that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence of Mr Tjahjono was open to criticism in a number of respects but ultimately provided an account of the kidnapping which was both coherent and plausible. His account drew compelling support from a number of independent sources, including the CCTV footage, which this Court has seen. As submitted on behalf of the Crown, the footage clearly shows a simultaneous, powerful reaction on the part of the three offenders to the victim's flight from the car at the petrol station. I have not been persuaded that the jury ought to have entertained a doubt as to the applicant's guilt.
55BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL. I also agree with the additional observations of McCallum J.

		07 October 2014",2014-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764956,Da-Pra v R; R v Da-Pra [2014] NSWCCA 211,"Judgment
1EMMETT JA:  On 21 May 2012, after an eight-day trial before R S Hulme J and a jury, Mr Renzo Da-Pra was found guilty of:
the manslaughter of his father, Mr Gervasio Da-Pra;causing grievous bodily harm to Mrs VW with intent to murder; andthe murder of Miss EW.
All three offences were committed on Friday, 18 December 2009.  There are two appeals.  Mr Da-Pra appeals against his conviction, while the Crown appeals against the sentence imposed.  I shall refer to Mr Da-Pra as the appellant.
2The essential issue at the trial was whether the defences of mental illness or substantial impairment were available in relation to any or all of the three offences.  The defence of mental illness, or insanity, is a complete defence, while the defence of substantial impairment is a partial defence that reduces murder to manslaughter.  The jury, in convicting the appellant of the three offences, found that the appellant was not entitled to the mental illness defence in relation to any of the three offences.  The appellant had been charged with the murder of his father.  The jury found him guilty of manslaughter as an alternative to murder on the basis of substantial impairment.  The jury rejected the substantial impairment defence in relation to the offence involving EW.
3By notice of appeal filed on 28 June 2013, the appellant appeals from the convictions on three grounds.  The first ground is that RS Hulme J erred in failing to direct the jury, in relation to the count involving Gervasio Da-Pra, that they must not reject unanimous medical evidence in the absence of other evidence displacing or throwing doubt upon it.  The appellant says that the medical evidence in relation to the offence involving his father was unanimous that the defence of mental illness was established.  
4The second ground is that all three verdicts were unreasonable or insupportable, having regard to the evidence.  The appellant contends that the jury should have returned special verdicts that he was not guilty by reason of mental illness.  That would have triggered s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Mental Health Act), empowering the Court to order that the appellant be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law, or such other order as the Court considers appropriate.
5Finally, the appellant contends that this Court should exercise the power conferred by s 7(4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the Appeal Act).  Under s 7(4), if on an appeal it appears to the Court that although the appellant committed the act charged, the appellant was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for the appellant's action at the time when the act was done, the Court may quash the conviction and sentence passed at the trial and order that the appellant be detained in strict custody in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order as the Court considers appropriate.  
6The language of s 7(4) of the Appeal Act and s 39(1) of the Mental Health Act are similar.  There is therefore some overlap between the appellant's contention that the verdicts were unreasonable and his contention that this Court should exercise the power conferred by s 7(4).  If the Court were disposed to exercise that power, the other grounds of appeal would fall away.  
7On 4 June 2012, R S Hulme J sentenced the appellant to a total effective term of imprisonment of 20 years from 20 December 2009, expiring on 19 December 2029, with an aggregate non-parole period of 15 years.  The appellant will be eligible for release on parole on 19 December 2024.  By notice of appeal filed on 15 June 2012, the Crown appeals under s 5D of the Appeal Act against the sentences imposed by R S Hulme J.  In essence, the Crown contends that the sentences imposed in relation to the offences involving EW and VW were manifestly inadequate.  The Crown's sentence appeal in relation to a conviction would fall away if the Court were disposed to exercise the power conferred by s 7(4) of the Appeal Act in relation to that conviction.  
The Conviction Appeal
8In the light of the contention that the Court should exercise the power conferred by s 7(4), it will be necessary to consider the psychiatric evidence in some detail.  Before considering the psychiatric evidence, it is desirable to state the relevant legal principles, about which there is no dispute, and say something about the facts that gave rise to the charges against the appellant.

Legal Principles 
9Every person is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary is proven.  To establish the defence of mental illness, formerly known as insanity, it must be proved on the balance of probabilities that when committing the acts alleged to constitute the offence, the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, as a result of a disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of his acts or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  A person does not know that what he is doing is wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons, or when he cannot reason with some modest degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing (R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; 55 CLR 182 at 189-190).
10The law requires that, at the relevant time, the state of mind of an accused must have been one of disease, disorder, or disturbance arising from some medical condition.  That condition must result in the function of the reason, memory or understanding of the accused being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder of the capacity to reason such as would prevent the accused from knowing what he was doing, in that he did not know the physical nature or quality of his acts, or from knowing that those acts were wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in the community (R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108 at [19]-[21]).
11It is possible for an accused to be suffering from a disease of the mind but still know that what he was doing in committing an offence was wrong, such that he will be legally responsible for it.  In these proceedings, it was common ground, both at trial and on appeal, that at the time of the offences the appellant suffered from schizophrenia.  It was also common ground, at trial and on appeal, that the appellant knew the nature and quality of his acts when he committed the three offences.  Thus, the central issue at trial and on appeal was whether at the time of the offences the appellant had a defect of reason in the legal sense, such that he should not be held responsible for committing the three offences because he did not know or was unable to realise that what he was doing in committing the offences was wrong.
12Although medical evidence is not essential to prove the defence of mental illness, it is very much the practice that expert medical opinion evidence is adduced on that issue in criminal courts in New South Wales (R v Rodriguez [2010] NSWSC 198 at [45]).  While juries are not bound to accept and to act upon such evidence, they are not entitled to disregard such evidence capriciously.  However, it is open to a jury to reject unanimous medical evidence where other evidence casts doubt upon it.  Where the expert opinion is not challenged and no other evidence casts doubt upon it, the trial judge should direct the jury that they should not reject it (Taylor v R (1978) 45 FLR 343; 22 ALR 599 at 608).  However, where the factual basis for the expert opinion evidence is incomplete or unreliable, or the opinions are challenged in cross-examination, such a direction is not required (R v Shirwood (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 24 July 1998, unrep)).
The Facts
13The appellant had been in a motorcycle or ""bikie"" club between the ages of 21 and 29.  At the age of 27, he was bashed by a rival gang, who threatened to harm him if they ever saw him again.  For some time, he had no fixed place of abode and travelled between New South Wales and Queensland, staying with friends and family.  At the time of the offences, the appellant was 45 years old.  His parents lived at Wetherill Park.  VW, then 77 years old, and her granddaughter, EW, then 12 years old, lived nearby.     
14On the afternoon of Thursday 17 December 2009, the appellant went to his parents' house and told them about his concerns that unknown people were out to harm them.  He had had delusions for some time involving a belief that he and his family were being pursued by members of the bikie group with which he had been associated, including ""Boris"", the president of the bikie group.
15The appellant stayed the night of 17 December 2009 at his brother's house.  At about 7.30am on the next morning, Friday 18 December 2009, he drove to his parents' house at Wetherill Park.  His father was at home alone.  His mother had gone out shopping.  At some point, he attacked his father in the garage.  The appellant knocked his father to the ground and inflicted forceful blows to his neck and head, either with a weapon or by unarmed physical force.  Gervasio Da-Pra died as a direct result of blunt force neck injuries.  Other significant injuries included bruising to his face, fractures to two bones at the base of his nose, a fracture to the front of the sixth rib and a loosening of the joint between the ribs and the sternum.  
16After killing his father, the appellant placed his father's body in the boot of his father's car and drove it to the nearby Stocklands Mall shopping centre (the shopping centre).  He parked the car in the car park, locked it, and returned to his parents' house.
17There was evidence that a computer hard drive was missing from a table in the garage of his parents' house.  There was also evidence of damage to a security screen door at that house.  The Crown case was that the appellant took the hard drive and damaged the door to create the appearance that his parents' house had been broken into and that property had been stolen.
18Sometime after 12.15pm on 18 December 2009, the appellant went to the Ws' house (the W residence), near his parents' house.  He was armed with a large hunting knife.  VW and EW were inside the house.  The appellant knocked on the front door and spoke to VW.  He told her that his car had broken down and that he wanted to phone his father.  VW felt uneasy and did not want to let him into the house as he looked nervous and agitated.  Instead, she offered him the use of her mobile phone.  However, the appellant pushed his way inside the house, forcing VW back from the front door into the kitchen.  He grabbed her by the arm as she struggled and struck her a number of times on her face with his hands and fists.  She lost consciousness and fell to the ground.  The appellant then cut her throat with the hunting knife, causing wounds to her throat and severing her trachea.  Her larynx and anterior jugular veins were completely transected and her left internal jugular vein and the vasavesorum of the left carotid artery were partially transected.
19While VW was being punched, EW was standing next to the dining table in the kitchen area.  The appellant then attacked EW, who suffered extensive bruising to her lips and chin that was unlikely to have been caused by a single blow.  She suffered a fracture to her skull and other bruising in that area.  That could have had a number of causes, including falling to the floor.  She also suffered patterned bruising to her upper chest.  The appellant then sliced EW's throat twice, causing lacerations that killed her almost instantly.  Her death was a direct result of the injuries to her neck.  One cut extended through the back of her mouth to her spine.  The wound included four shallow ""tails"" into the adjacent skin, suggesting a sawing motion of the implement that caused the injuries.  Blood spatter indicated that EW was supine at the time her throat was cut.
20After the attack on EW and VW, the appellant went upstairs and disarranged VW's bedroom and substantially ransacked the house.  He also damaged the outside window screens and the phone connection in the dining room.  He then left the house, leaving EW dead and VW unconscious and bleeding heavily from the throat.
21Telephone records indicated that the attack occurred before 1.30pm, since VW was eventually able to telephone the emergency number and ambulance officers arrived at the house shortly after 1.30pm.  They found EW dead on the floor in the family room near the kitchen and VW in a side doorway between the entrance hall and the lounge room.  VW was admitted to the intensive care unit of Westmead Hospital suffering a fractured eye socket, a fractured jaw, a severed trachea and slash wounds to her throat.
22After leaving the W residence, the appellant returned to his brother's house and spoke about people being after him.  The appellant's sister-in-law, Mrs Juanita Da-Pra, saw him at her house.  He gave her a paper flower on which he had written her family's names.  He told her that if someone knocked on the door, she should hand them the flower and ""see if it is enough"".  Juanita Da-Pra described the appellant as ""paranoid"".
23The appellant then left his brother's house and drove to the Central Coast, to the home of Ms Elizabeth Austin and Mr Ronald Feeney.  He borrowed Ms Austin's phone and made a telephone call at 3.33pm to Juanita Da-Pra and said ""don't lose the flower"".  The appellant stayed with Mr Feeney for two to three hours, during which time he told Mr Feeney that he was ""in some trouble"".  Mr Feeney described him as ""quiet and a bit fidgety"".  Eventually, the appellant changed his clothes and drove away.  He spent the evening of Saturday 19 December 2009 at a camping area.  He said that he disposed of the hunting knife while there.
24Early on the morning of Sunday 20 December 2009, the appellant doused himself with petrol and attended at the emergency department of Fairfield District Hospital.  He handed the nursing staff a notepad containing a handwritten note and asked them to pass it on to the police.  The pad smelt of petrol and the note contained admissions by the appellant that he had killed his father and EW.  It appears that at the time of writing the note, he believed he had also killed VW.  The note included the following:
I was once told (threatened) that my parents and myself were going to suffer terrible death.  I had a time limit where I could have made their passing easier, but at the end of the day the result was going to be the same.  My friend Danny knew the problem I was facing, but was in no way going to help me kill my parents nor me.  A friend of his which he thought was worth approaching ... was not only the slight bit interested, he wished me luck, but would not participate either.  I was left with having to do it myself.  After killing my father, I was looking for a way to create a diversion, so I went to the neighbours, I was intending to only threaten them, but between what I had just done and what I had to do, I lost all control and in the frenzy become [sic] a person that even I believe [sic] should not exist.  I did have a choice of saving my mother as, I was going to die, but now my only mission in life is to make it home and end my life to hopefully show how sorry I am for what took place.  In trying to avoid something bad, I have only succeeded to make things so much worse, and what's worse, 2 more innocent victims were added to my list of dead.  What I would have done not to have this task at all.  Words are unable to explain how I regret my wrongdoings but I can only hope that my actions tonight will at least bring some closure and or comfort to the people, familys [sic] and especially the innocent victims that I regrettfully [sic] involved.  I must now get home and try to complete the task that was once set, and pray that in doing so, will end this tragic event.  At least for some.
25Another note that the appellant wrote somewhat earlier, but that was found some time after his arrest, referred to the imagined threats to his family.  That note said:
A friend (Danny) tried to contact someone he knew, but the more I explained, neither he nor his friend were willing to help, as I would have preferred my parents to die more humanely.  That left me no choice but to do it myself.  I met someone in a pub in Milperra which decided would give me a hand however while I was cleaning up at my parents, Chuck decided to visit next door, and I was unable to prevent what happened.  Innocent people from their fate.  I was intending on hiding, but the guilt and remorse I feel for those people has brought me to one conclusion.  I'm hoping that my death will bring about some closure, and hopefully show how sorry I truly am.  [strike out in original]
26After leaving the first note with the nursing staff at Fairfield Hospital, the appellant returned to his car, which was parked outside the hospital, and then set fire to the petrol.  As police approached the car, it became engulfed in flames.  After extinguishing the flames, the police removed the appellant from the car.     
27When pulled from the car, the appellant spoke to one of the attending police officers.  He admitted killing his father and attacking his neighbours.  He was asked why he had done so and replied that he did not mean to.  He was asked why he had killed EW and responded:
It wasn't meant to happen like that.  After I did my Dad, I went over there to get an alibi and things got out of hand.  I panicked.  Then the knife was in my hand and I just starting slashing.
28The police took the appellant to hospital, where he received treatment for serious burns to his head, hands and arms.  He was transferred to Liverpool Hospital, where he was seen by Dr Emilie Tahtouh, who asked him why he had set himself on fire.  He replied, ""I may have killed my father and my neighbour"".  When asked by Dr Tahtouh why he did that he said, ""they told me that if I didn't hurt them they would hurt me"". 
29The appellant was transferred to Concord Hospital and on 29 December 2009 commenced anti-psychotic medication.  On 4 January 2010, he was interviewed by the psychiatric team at Concord Hospital and gave them a history of 15 years of psychotic illness.  He said that the offences occurred because people did not take his concerns seriously.  He gave no details of the offences.  
30On 19 February 2010, the appellant was transferred to Long Bay Prison Hospital, where he spoke to a nurse, Mr Brian Owen, who was the psychiatric registrar.  He told Mr Owen that he was aware that he had been charged and that he had ""knocked down two"" and ""seriously hurt another"".  He said that he did not get along with his father and that they fought all the time and he ended up having a big fight with his father when the incident occurred.  He told Mr Owen that he decided he needed money and went next door.  He said the little girl screamed and ran past him and he used the knife on her.  He told Mr Owen that he ""didn't want to kill her"".  
31On 20 February 2010, the appellant was interviewed by Dr Goh, a psychiatric registrar at Long Bay Prison Hospital.  He told Dr Goh that his father would not listen to his warning about an imminent raid on the house and that he stabbed his father.  He told Dr Goh that his father was a difficult man and that their ""tempers would flare up"".  He told Dr Goh that he thought he would go next door, ""pretend that a home invasion had occurred there, take money from the house and then leave the city"".  He said that the girl ran past him while he was holding the knife and he was really sorry it happened.
32More than 12 months elapsed before the appellant gave any further account of the offences.  The subsequent accounts were given to three psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen, Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Sharon Reutens.  I shall refer to those accounts when dealing with their evidence.  It is significant that in those accounts, the appellant referred to hallucinations about bikies and about a blue car while on his way to the W residence.  Both of those matters were delusions that he later said were in his mind and that, in causing him to fear for his life and the lives of his family members, were prime reasons while in his delusional state for committing the offences against EW and VW.  The bikies were, on the appellant's later accounts, a critical component, perhaps even the single most significant component, of his delusions.
33There was no mention of either of those matters in either of the handwritten notes, in the conversations at the time of his arrest or in the interviews by medical staff at Liverpool or Concord Hospitals or at Long Bay Prison Hospital.  The closest the appellant came to mentioning a threat from bikies when attempting to recount the events involving the offences, before speaking to the psychiatrists some 15 months later, was when he told Dr Tahtouh that ""[t]hey told me that if I didn't hurt them they would hurt me"" and when he told Dr Goh on 20 February 2010 that on the day of the offences he feared an imminent raid on his parents' house.  Both of those comments might have been referable to a threat from bikies.  There was no mention at all, however, of a blue car being after him while on his way to the W residence.




The Psychiatric Opinion Evidence
34The appellant gave accounts of the offences to the three psychiatrists.  Those accounts were foundational to the psychiatrists' opinions, since the psychiatrists accepted the veracity of the appellant's accounts in order to draw inferences as to the appellant's state of mind at the time.  On the basis of those inferences, the psychiatrists expressed opinions as to whether the full defence of mental illness or insanity was available in relation to the killing of Gervasio Da-Pra and EW and the attack on VW.  Also on the basis of inferences founded on an acceptance of the veracity of the appellant's accounts, the psychiatrists expressed opinions on whether the partial defence of substantial impairment was available in relation to the two offences to which it could possibly be available, namely, the two homicides.  Thus, all the psychiatric opinion evidence was based on a broad acceptance of the veracity of the accounts that the appellant gave them.
35At his trial, the appellant contended that he should be found not guilty, in relation to all three charges, by reason of mental illness.  Alternatively, in relation to the two murder counts, he contended that he was substantially impaired by abnormality of mind and that manslaughter was the appropriate verdict.  The issue at the trial in respect of all three counts was the appellant's mental state at the time of the alleged offences.  The appellant's mental state was the subject of psychiatric evidence at the trial by Dr Nielssen, Dr Allnutt and Dr Reutens.  
Dr Allnutt's Evidence
36Dr Allnutt was asked by the Crown to assess some of the evidence and to interview the appellant.  The Crown provided him with a large number of documents, including statements of witnesses and the appellant's handwritten notes.  Dr Allnutt conducted a clinical examination on 23 June 2011 and a subsequent examination in September 2011.  He provided three reports of his examinations of the appellant.  He gave oral evidence as to the contents of his reports. 
37Dr Allnutt said that the appellant presented as cooperative and fairly well-groomed.  His speech was clear, coherent, soft and monotonous.  He was clearly anxious and upset during the interview, though his affect was restricted.  He spoke in a clear and coherent manner and maintained good eye contact.  He did not manifest behaviour suggestive of either the effect of psychiatric medication or neurological illness.  He did not manifest significant intellectual impairment.  His capacity for insight and judgment was adequate.  He was not manifesting significant active symptoms of psychosis.  He did, however, provide a history of cannabis use for two to three years prior to the offences, as well as relatively significant substance abuse over a long period consistent with probable substance abuse disorder.  
38Dr Allnutt said that the symptoms that the appellant had described himself as having prior to the offences would be consistent with a systematised persecutory delusional system, probably due to paranoid schizophrenia.  He noted that the appellant was raised in a relatively loving and supportive family environment.  He appeared to have been relatively dependent on his parents for a number of years.  He had apparently been able to pursue gainful employment until he suffered a motor vehicle accident in about 1990.  After the accident, he was on a disability support pension, which likely increased his dependence on his parents.  
39Dr Allnutt considered that the appellant manifested some evidence of dysfunctional personality traits but that he would not, at that stage, conclude that he had a personality disorder.  Dr Allnutt considered that the appellant's most significant stressor related to the criminal charges against him and that his functioning appeared to be reasonable.
40Dr Allnutt considered that the symptoms were consistent with a persecutory delusional belief and that there would be reasonable grounds for concluding that the appellant was suffering from a psychosis and thus a disease of the mind when the offences occurred.  He became increasingly anxious that if he went to the police, more people would die and Boris would kill his family, so he did not go to the police and subsequently saw no options for himself, feeling trapped.  He formed the view that people were coming for his family and believed that time was running out for him and he needed to act to protect his mother.
41Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that, when the appellant killed his father, he was suffering a disease of the mind of a nature and severity that it severely impacted on his capacity to make rational decisions with regard to his father.  He was thus experiencing a defect of reason.  Dr Allnutt considered that it was unlikely that the defect of reason was such that it significantly compromised the appellant's capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions.  Dr Allnutt said in evidence-in-chief that while the appellant was suffering that defect of reason, he nonetheless appreciated the nature and quality of the physical act in relation to the death of his father.  He said that the appellant understood that if he hit, strangled or stabbed someone, he could potentially seriously harm, if not kill, the person.  On that version, he intended to kill his father.
42Dr Allnutt considered that, given that the appellant incorporated his father and other family members, particularly his mother, into a delusional system, he would have been compromised in his capacity to make rational decisions in relation to both of them.  It appears that he had irrationally determined, because of his delusions of persecution, that he had no option but to kill his father in order to save his mother and that, having regard to his delusional world, that was the better option and the right thing to do.  Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that in those circumstances, the appellant would have been unable to reason about the matter of wrongfulness in relation to his behaviour towards his father with a reasonable degree of composure.  Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that in regard to the behaviour leading to the death of his father, the defence of mental illness was available.
43Dr Allnutt said that not wanting to be arrested and put into gaol was consistent with the appellant's understanding that the authorities would think that what he had done was wrong.  Intending to create an alibi or divert attention from himself, as the perpetrator of his father's death, was also consistent with such an understanding that what he had done would be viewed as being wrong.  Dr Allnutt said that the appellant's inability to reason as to wrongness was such that he felt it was morally right to do what he did because it would save his mother.
44Dr Allnutt formed the opinion that, if it were accepted that, when the appellant entered the W residence, he believed he had been followed and that a person whom he believed had come from the car had pushed him into the house, then it would follow that the appellant had incorporated the neighbours into his delusion.  However, that would have to be accepted notwithstanding that the appellant's account to Dr Allnutt was at odds with other of the appellant's accounts of what happened on the day and specifically at odds with other of the appellant's accounts about what was in his mind at the time of entering the W residence, inconsistencies of which Dr Allnutt was aware.  One inconsistent aspect was that on other occasions, the appellant had suggested that he intended to enter the W residence to commit a robbery.
45Dr Allnutt said that, if the appellant had incorporated the neighbours into the delusion, by viewing them as associated in some way with those whom he believed were attacking him, that would affect his ability to know or rationalise that what he was doing in relation to the neighbours was wrong.  However, Dr Allnutt said that his opinion could vary if there was some other rational explanation for the way the appellant acted at the W residence, such as an intention to try to divert attention from what he had done to his father.  Dr Allnutt agreed that his opinion ""depends on what facts are accepted or assumed for this purpose"".
46Dr Allnutt saw the appellant again on 22 September 2011, when he was provided with some further detail.  The purpose of the interview was to clarify the appellant's thought processes at the time of his killing of EW and attacking her grandmother.  
47Dr Allnutt believed that it would be reasonable to conclude that, on balance, the appellant had ""a defence of mental illness"" in relation to the charge concerning VW because his disease of the mind caused him to be unable to reason about the matter, and the wrongfulness of attacking EW, with a reasonable degree of sense and composure as a person with a rational mind would.  Dr Allnutt said that, on balance, he considered that the appellant ""would have available to him a defence of mental illness"" in relation to the charges concerning all three victims.  
48Dr Allnutt's opinion was based on his accepting the truth of the account that the appellant gave him and on his drawing inferences from that account about the appellant's symptoms.  Even accepting the truth of the appellant's account given to him, Dr Allnutt said that it was marginal as to whether the appellant would have the defence of mental illness available to him, ""in the sense that he would have had probably capacity to think about it"", though he was also ""pre-occupied by his delusional experience that he never applied that thought"". 
49Dr Allnutt was subsequently asked to provide a third report and to consider scenarios different from the appellant's account.  That is to say, he was asked to assume different factual bases on which he was to base his opinion.  
50First, he was asked to assume a scenario in which the appellant attended the W residence to divert suspicion from himself in relation to his father's death and that he did that by trying to make it appear to be a home invasion.  Included in his thinking was the intention of obtaining money so that he could leave the area and not be arrested by authorities for his father's death.  He was asked to assume that the attack on the neighbours was consistent with that intention and that the appellant also took steps afterwards to disturb things in the W residence to make it appear that a home invasion had taken place.  He was also asked to assume that the appellant had inflicted significant injuries to both EW and VW other than cutting their throats, suggesting that the appellant's attacks on them were more than impulsive or ""momentary slashing type attacks"".  He was asked to assume that it may be possible to reject the appellant's assertion that he had believed he had been followed into the W residence by persons who had made threats and to reject the assertion that he mistook EW for an attacker or someone out to harm or kill him.
51Dr Allnutt said that even under the scenario created by those assumptions, if it were accepted that the appellant was experiencing psychotic symptoms in the form of a delusional belief that he or his family were under threat and thus experiencing a disease of the mind, then he would be regarded as having a defect of reason.  This was because psychosis is a mental condition that by its nature causes a defect of reasoning.  The issue would then be whether that defect of reasoning significantly affected his capacity to know that his actions in relation to EW and VW were wrong.  Dr Allnutt expressed the view that it was unlikely, under that scenario, that the appellant's defect of reason was of a nature and severity that it significantly impaired his capacity to know the nature and consequence of his actions.  
52Dr Allnutt said that when the appellant killed his father, he was of the delusional belief that he and his family were under threat and that his persecutors were following him.  There would be a propensity to continue to hold that belief up to the time of the offences involving EW and VW.  He was aware when he entered the W residence that what he had done to his father was wrong, in the sense that he understood it to have been wrong in the eyes of others.  But Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the evidence suggested that the appellant remained of the view that he had done the right thing in a moral sense.  That is the basis for his view that, on balance, the appellant had available a defence of mental illness in relation to his father.  He considered that the difficulty in reasoning about wrongfulness would have persisted at the time that he entered the W residence.  His reasoning capacity, at least as it pertained to the death of his father, remained impaired by his ongoing delusional beliefs.  Thus, he was still vulnerable to impaired reasoning at the time of the offences involving EW and VW.  
53Dr Allnutt was of the opinion, however, that the evidence of thoughts, actions and feelings of guilt and regret in relation to EW and VW suggested some degree of awareness of wrongfulness.  Dr Allnutt did not believe that a defence of mental illness would be available if the appellant had attended the W residence to divert suspicion from himself in relation to his father's death and to obtain money so he could leave the area and not be arrested by authorities for his father's death.  The defence would not be available if the appellant took steps to make it appear that there had been a home invasion and inflicted significant injuries on both victims besides the slashing of their throats such that the attack was more than momentary, and if one rejected the assertion that at the time, the appellant believed that he was being followed and that he mistook EW to be an attacker out to kill him.
54While the appellant was probably anxious, emotionally aroused and paranoid about his situation, Dr Allnutt considered that the motive was rational, namely, to avoid recognition, detection and arrest by police.  The behaviour was planned.  Since he would not be regarded as having incorporated the victims directly into his delusional belief system, he was likely to have known that his actions were legally wrong and also morally wrong, having regard to his strong sense of guilt afterwards.  
55Thus, Dr Allnutt considered that on this scenario, involving acceptance of facts different from those that the appellant had provided, the appellant likely retained the capacity to understand events as they pertained to EW and VW, to judge right from wrong in regard to them and to control his actions.  The defence of substantial impairment would then be unlikely to be available.  Thus, Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that on the alternative scenario, a defence of mental illness was not available to the appellant in relation to VW and neither a defence of mental illness nor a defence of substantial impairment was available to him in relation to EW.
56Dr Allnutt then dealt with further variations of the above scenario apparently suggested by Dr Allnutt himself.  The variations involved making the assumptions mentioned above, but altering what the appellant's motive was when he entered the W residence.  On the third variation, which was referred to as the ""third scenario"", Dr Allnutt made the additional assumption ""that killing the occupants was not part of his initial plan at the time he entered, that it was only after he entered the [W residence] that the idea of the attacking or killing [of] them occurred"".  Dr Allnutt said on that ""third scenario"", the issue was less clear because the defence of substantial impairment may also be applicable in relation to EW as ""his mental state could have impaired his capacity to control his actions because he could have acted impulsively in a panic due to his delusions"".
57Dr Allnutt was asked to assume that VW and EW were struck and fell to the ground and that their throats were cut while unconscious on the ground.  He accepted that once they were on the ground, the appellant would have known that they were his neighbours.  Dr Allnutt said that if they were knocked to the ground and incapacitated, and he then cut their throats, his opinion was that the appellant knew the nature and quality of the physical acts, including the cutting of their throats.  He said that if the appellant entered the house intending initially not to attack someone, but then did nevertheless strike them through some reaction, it was possible that he could have realised what he had done and therefore decided to kill them rather than leave witnesses as to what he had done.  That is to say, he did it to avoid detection and arrest in relation to the attacks on the Ws and to get away.


Dr Nielssen's evidence
58Dr Nielssen assessed the appellant on 17 March 2011 and prepared a report dated 5 April 2011.  Dr Nielssen had regard to a number of documents, including a transcript of the appellant's criminal history and statements by VW, Mr Mario Da-Pra and Mr Carlo Da-Pra.  He also had a copy of the appellant's note.  A statement by Juanita Da-Pra and photographs and reports relating to the crime scenes were also made available to him.  He also had access to the three reports by Dr Allnutt, as well as the various accounts that Mr Da-Pra gave to medical staff at Concord Hospital.  Dr Nielssen gave oral evidence as to the contents of his report.
59Dr Nielssen's conclusion, after his interview and examination, was that the appellant's mental state was one of chronic schizophrenia and substance abuse disorder, rather than a substance-induced psychotic illness.  That was because of the chronic nature of his delusional ideas, the persistence of symptoms for some time after he stopped using drugs, and what Dr Nielssen thought to be the impoverished nature of his emotional responses or thought content.  Dr Nielssen thought that they were more consistent with chronic mental illness than with a transient or temporary drug-induced state.  He said that the vivid auditory hallucinations are more typical of schizophrenia than drug-induced conditions.  Dr Nielssen described schizophrenia as a mental illness that typically manifests with auditory hallucinations, disorganised thinking, impairment in emotional regulation, especially early in the illness, and delusional beliefs or fixed false beliefs, often of a bizarre nature.  Over the long term, there is chronic impairment in intellectual function and often a loss of volition or emotional responses.
60Dr Nielssen said that he believed that the appellant had the defence of mental illness open to him in relation to his father's death.  Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that the appellant had a disease of the mind in the form of chronic schizophrenia that gave rise to a defect of reasoning and, specifically, to a frightening, delusional belief that he had to kill his father to save his mother.  He thought that the appellant probably recognised the nature and quality of his act in a physical sense.  He knew, in a sense, that he was killing another human being but did not recognise that his actions were morally wrong, as he believed he was killing his father for altruistic purposes and because his family was in danger.  Dr Nielssen said that the appellant's acutely disorganised thinking and emotional arousal affected his capacity to reason with any calmness or composure about the alternative courses of action available to him.
61Dr Nielssen said that he thought that the appellant had the defence of mental illness available to him in respect of the subsequent attacks upon EW and VW for the same reasons.  Dr Nielssen said that he was still acutely mentally ill in that he had a delusional belief that he was still in danger.  The immediate trigger was his belief that he was being attacked, possibly by people who had followed him to the W residence.  More importantly, his capacity to reason in a calm and logical way about what to do was grossly impaired by an acute schizophrenic illness.  In reaching that opinion, Dr Nielssen said that he was aware of the evidence that the appellant had moved various objects in VW's bedroom and of the appellant's account that he had attended at the W residence with the intention of creating an alibi.  He did not consider that that intention in any way undermined his opinion.
62Dr Nielssen was asked about Dr Allnutt's opinion concerning the defence of mental illness in relation to two of the factual scenarios described by Dr Allnutt, involving the variations as to what was in the appellant's mind as he was entering the W residence.  Dr Nielssen said that, on the face of it, it was a purposeless and unmotivated crime that did not have a rational or malicious intent.  He said that it was more a horrible and tragic accident, where a mentally ill person came into the house affected by frightening delusions.  He did not know of any information that suggested that there was a rational or malicious motive for the offences.  On the other hand, he was quite confident, based on the information available to him, that the appellant had been psychotic for some time before the offences.  He considered that he was psychotic at the time he killed his father and psychotic at the time he set fire to himself.  He was psychotic for some weeks or months after he was arrested.  
63Dr Nielssen considered that the appellant was affected by delusions throughout the period of the offences.  He observed that the specific content of the delusions changed or evolved according to the content of further hallucinations and the appellant's interpretation of events in his surroundings, such as the passing of a blue car, that confirmed or supported his delusional beliefs.  He considered that they were present throughout that period and that the appellant's state was such that it was impossible for him to reason with composure about the origin of his symptoms or the likely consequences of his actions.  
64In response to a question from the trial judge, Dr Nielssen agreed that if someone was suffering from a delusion in the morning, the person would not be able to get it out of his mind at all during the day.  If it is a fixed false belief held with the sort of intensity that creates fear, then it is likely to be present all the time.  Dr Nielssen said that someone who has such delusions in effect has them throughout waking hours, without pause or break, for days at a time.  He said that during acute episodes, the delusions tend to be present all the time.  When asked what he meant by ""acute episodes"", Dr Nielssen said that schizophrenia tends to be an episodic condition, in that it responds to treatment.  After treatment, most people will have some remission from symptoms.  
65Dr Nielssen said that, in his opinion, the appellant was mentally ill when he committed the offences on EW and VW, based on the appellant's history and corroborative information about the onset, nature and course of his psychotic illness.  The effect of a severe psychotic illness would be to deprive the appellant of the capacity to think in a calm and logical way as to what he was doing.  He maintained that opinion notwithstanding the appellant's account that he went to the W residence with a view to effect some kind of alibi or to get money.  He confirmed that the evidence that the appellant rummaged around in VW's bedroom and effected some kind of damage to the outside of the W residence, so as to create the impression that others may have been responsible for the attack on the Ws and the crime of his father's death, did not have any impact on his opinion in relation to the attack on EW and VW.
66In cross-examination, Dr Nielssen agreed that the appellant understood that the community saw the taking of a life as wrong, although in certain circumstances there may be a justification for taking a life, such as when he believed that he was saving the lives of his mother and other members of his family by doing so.  Dr Nielssen agreed that the appellant would have known that the taking of a life was legally wrong, reflecting community standards that it is wrong.
67Dr Nielssen agreed that the delusions concerning his father's death did not incorporate his neighbours.  Even at the door of the W residence, the Ws were not part of the delusion.  He chose to go to the W residence, understanding that they were neighbours.  Dr Nielssen agreed that the appellant would not go to a place where he thought there were bikies.  Dr Nielssen agreed that, in relation to all three offences, the appellant knew the physical nature of his acts.  The question was whether he was able to reason with a moderate degree of sensibility and rationality in respect of his actions.
68Dr Nielssen was asked, given the fact that he thought that the appellant's capacity for logical and rational thinking was quite impaired, whether deciding to create an alibi and move his father's body to give him more time get away demonstrated rational thought.  He responded that it was rational behaviour when described like that, but that the whole of the appellant's behaviour was affected by his belief that he was being pursued and was in danger.  Dr Nielssen's understanding was that the appellant believed that he was being watched the whole time and was experiencing auditory hallucinations throughout the day in question and on previous days.  
69Dr Nielssen accepted that when the appellant entered the W residence, he knew it was wrong to take a life.  However, he considered that the appellant believed he was in mortal danger and reacted to defend himself.  In that way, his delusional belief affected his behaviour.  Dr Nielssen said that an acute mental illness prevents people from reasoning in a calm and rational way because they are often acutely frightened and have grossly disorganised thinking.
70Dr Nielssen accepted that his opinion was based on the appellant's account given to him more than 15 months after the offences and that the appellant had previously given accounts to others.  Dr Nielssen was asked about the note that the appellant gave to the staff at Fairfield Hospital.  Dr Nielssen's attention was drawn to the fact that while the note mentioned the appellant's delusion that he had to act in relation to threats to protect his mother, it made no mention of being followed on his way to the W residence.  Rather, the appellant said that he was intending only to threaten the Ws but that, between what he had just done to his father and what he had to do, he lost all control in the frenzy and became a person that even he believed should not exist.  Dr Nielssen would not agree with the proposition that there was a difference between the appellant's explanation in relation to his father and his explanation in relation to the Ws.  Dr Nielssen said that he believed that the delusional beliefs were operating throughout that time.
71Dr Nielssen's attention was then directed to the appellant's earlier note in which he blamed someone else for what happened to the Ws.  Dr Nielssen agreed that the implication from both notes was that the appellant realised that he had taken the lives of two innocent people with no excuse and needed to point the finger at someone else.  Nevertheless, Dr Nielssen considered that the actions were consistent with being acutely unwell.
72Dr Nielssen's attention was drawn to the note in which the appellant said that after killing his father he was looking for a way to create a diversion so he went to the neighbours, and that he was intending only to threaten them but between what he had just done and what he had to do he lost all control in the frenzy and became a person that even he believed should not exist.  Dr Nielssen agreed that that reason was different from the one the appellant had given to him as to why he went to the W residence. 
73Dr Nielssen also confirmed that he had not been provided with Mr Owens's statement or the account that the appellant gave to Dr Goh.  Dr Nielssen did not see a rational purpose in someone who may have committed a crime trying to divert attention away from himself and from what had happened by killing two other people.  He considered that it was bizarre to commit two further homicides to make up for the first one that he was trying to conceal.  He did not consider that that was logical at all.  He did not consider that the appellant's other accounts made any difference to his final opinion.  He considered that the appellant was in an acutely psychotic state and that the further offences involving EW and VW were the result of his disturbed state of mind.
74Dr Allnutt's variations in relation to the appellant's mental state before entering the W residence did not make Dr Nielssen change his opinion.  The problem that he had with those variations was that they assumed that the appellant had lucid intervals, yet the appellant had had an episode of insanity that had lasted for months before the offences and that had lasted for months afterwards.  He did not consider that one could reduce the events in question to rational actions based on a rational mind.  On the other hand, he conceded that there were elements of rationality in the appellant's actions, such as placing his father's body in the boot of the car to reduce his mother's stress and trying to set up an alibi or distraction.  Dr Nielssen said that those matters did not alter his opinion, since people who are psychotic can still have a rational understanding of the real world even while they remain affected by their delusional beliefs.  
75Dr Nielssen accepted that if the appellant's delusions contributed to his attack on EW and VW, it must have been because of a thought process that occurred after he entered the house.  He accepted that once VW lost consciousness and fell to the ground after receiving blows to the head, the appellant would have recognised that she was no longer a threat.  Similarly, he accepted that once EW was struck and fell to the ground, the appellant would have recognised that she was not a threat.  However, he qualified his agreement by saying that that was so ""in a rational state of mind"".  
76Dr Nielssen agreed that there was evidence that suggested that the appellant understood before entering the W residence that it was wrong to take a life.  However, Dr Nielssen said that while a person in a rational state would recognise that the Ws were not a threat, to cut their throats while they were on the ground indicated that the appellant must have been in an acute and irrational state.  The acts themselves suggested that he was not in a rational state.
77In re-examination, Dr Nielssen reiterated that the appellant was deprived of the capacity for completely rational thinking because of the overall effect of his acute mental illness.  While individual actions might appear to have been rational, his overall motivation and capacity for logical thinking was affected by his mental illness.  Even after being made aware of the appellant's various accounts, Dr Nielssen remained of the view that the appellant had been mentally ill.  He considered that at the time of the offences, the appellant was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions and that his subsequent remorse was not inconsistent with that conclusion.  Rather, it was an appreciation of what had happened.  One can understand why the jury might have been skeptical about the maintenance of that opinion. 
Dr Reutens's Evidence
78Dr Reutens considered the opinions of Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen and interviewed the appellant on 8 May 2012.  Dr Reutens had available a statement of facts in relation to the three offences, the appellant's criminal history, copies of statements by Mario Da-Pra, Carlo Da-Pra, Elsa Da-Pra and Juanita Da-Pra, as well as a copy of a statement by VW.  She also had copies of medical notes of 19 and 20 February from Concord Hospital and a copy of the appellant's note, a crime scene report and post-mortem reports.  Dr Reutens gave oral evidence.
79Dr Reutens considered that the appellant's symptoms were consistent with chronic schizophrenia.  Thus, the beliefs about Boris and the bikies were delusions that, coupled with his auditory hallucinations, were consistent with a psychiatric disorder.
80Dr Reutens expressed the opinion that the beliefs recounted by the appellant constituted a delusion that, together with the auditory hallucination of Boris, was consistent with the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.  She said that the chronic nature of his psychotic disorder and its persistence in hospital, in the absence of ongoing substance use, was consistent with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia.  Dr Reutens expressed the opinion that when the appellant killed his father, he was suffering from a mental illness, namely chronic schizophrenia, which is a disease of the mind.  That disease caused a defect of reason: as a result of his delusion that his father had to be killed to prevent more people, particularly his mother, from being killed, he was unable to make a rational decision.  However, she considered that he was likely to have known the nature of his actions.  Dr Reutens said that because the delusions involved a belief in the inevitability of the death of family and friends, which could only be averted by the appellant killing his father and himself, it was her opinion that he was impaired in his ability to judge the rightness or wrongness of the act with any reasonable sense of composure and reason.
81Dr Reutens said the appellant's decision that he required an alibi so that he could get away, and his decision to stage a home invasion or to call his father and leave a message, indicated that after he had killed his father, he knew it was legally wrong.  However, in his mind, he was morally justified because he believed that it would avert more deaths.  Dr Reutens considered that that indicated that he was unable to judge rationally the rightness or wrongness of his act.  In her opinion, the appellant had a defence of mental illness available to him for the offence of killing his father.  
82Dr Reutens expressed the opinion that at the time of the offences involving EW and VW, the appellant was suffering from a psychotic illness, namely schizophrenia, which produced a defect of reasoning such that he was incapable of rational thought.  She considered that it was unlikely that it significantly compromised his capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions.  However, based on the history that the appellant provided her, she was of the opinion that he had incorporated his neighbours into his delusion.  That is to say, he believed that they were the people who he believed were following him so that he was acting in self-defence.  She said he was unable to reason with any degree of composure as to the rightness or wrongness of the act because he believed he was acting in self-defence, was unable to think rationally due to his psychotic illness and was in a state of arousal after he had just killed his father.  Therefore, she believed he had available to him the defence of mental illness. 
83Dr Reutens also considered that the appellant would have the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind available to him in relation to both killings because at the time of both sets of offences, he was suffering from an abnormality of mind, namely schizophrenia, which impaired his ability to appraise rationally the nature of the acts and which impaired his ability to reason in a logical manner.  However, Dr Reutens concluded that the appellant also had the defence of mental illness open to him for all of the three charges, because he was suffering from schizophrenia manifesting in persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations.  That disorder of mind affected his ability to appraise the events with any degree of rationality.  He was also grossly impaired in his ability to reason logically.  He was unable to determine the rightness or wrongfulness of his actions because he was acting on the basis of delusions.
84Dr Reutens confirmed that in coming to her conclusions, she had been provided with information concerning the damage to the flyscreens thought to have been done by the appellant.  She was also aware of the evidence of various objects being moved in VW's bedroom.
85In the course of cross-examination, Dr Reutens said that the appellant's disease of the mind did not render him incapable of any rational thought, in that he still maintained the ability to do learnt acts, that is procedural memory, but it affected processes that required thinking, namely logic.  It would also affect his ability to contain himself and not act impulsively.  People who are psychotic can behave fairly normally and function in a way that does not bring a great deal of attention to themselves, even if in other areas their thinking is quite impaired.
86Dr Reutens agreed that the appellant exhibited rational thought in placing his father's body in the car and cleaning up the blood in the garage, irrespective of whether he did that to prevent distress to his mother or to buy himself time to get away.  She also accepted that he was thinking rationally in knowing that the police, not the bikies, would now be after him for killing his father and in not wanting to go to gaol or to kill himself.  They were rational thoughts.  However, Dr Reutens said, the rational thought of not wanting to go to gaol was based on the delusion that he would be killed in gaol.  She considered that they were rational thoughts produced by an irrational mind.  The higher-order and more complex thoughts are harder to carry out.  She agreed that the appellant's attempt to establish an alibi by going next door indicated higher-order thinking.  She said that rationality was not a dichotomous variable: some people are grossly irrational in all aspects, while others have rationality to a degree.  However, as the degree of planning or the degree of complexity of an action increases, the irrationality starts to become more apparent.
87Dr Reutens agreed that when the appellant was in the W residence, he considered them neighbours right up to the time that he felt he was pushed in the back.  She said that at that stage, he had incorporated them into his delusion that the people in the car chasing him were now in the house and he had to defend himself.  She agreed that that was only for a very short period of time, since once the screaming stopped, he realised that they were his neighbours once again.  
88Dr Reutens was asked about the fact that VW was lying unconscious on the ground after being struck when the appellant cut her throat and about the fact that the evidence showed that EW's throat was also cut when she was lying supine on the ground.  Dr Reutens was asked to comment on why the appellant did not understand at that point when he went to cut their throats while they, a 12-year-old girl and an elderly woman, were lying defenceless on the ground, that they were the neighbours whom he had recognised as such when he had entered the house.  Dr Reutens thought that it was a very impulsive overreaction and that it was difficult to know how quickly in succession the events had happened.  If VW had fallen and he had immediately cut her throat, that would be an impulsive action: anything that moved would be perceived as the attacker and it was best just to kill them.  However, if VW was lying on the ground and he approached her, the likelihood that he was acting impulsively would be lower.  Dr Reutens said that it was a momentary action, but agreed that two people having their throats cut would have taken more time and was not just momentary.
89Dr Reutens was asked to consider the possibility that the appellant had attacked the Ws because he was concerned that his efforts to create an alibi were undermined by the fact that he had struck VW since if EW escaped the house, she could alert the authorities.  Dr Reutens accepted that as a possibility, but believed that the appellant's reactions were also impulsive and aroused, and that he was acting without thinking rationally.
90Dr Reutens said that if the attack on the Ws were a momentary slashing, it would go towards a defence of mental illness.  If it were something more deliberate, it would suggest that he was not acting impulsively in a highly aroused state such that he was unable to judge the rightness or wrongness of the act.  Then the defence of mental illness would, on the balance of probabilities, be less likely to be made out.  Dr Reutens thought, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time when the acts were actually committed, he might not have been able to judge the rightness or wrongness with a reasonable sense of composure and reason.  However, shortly afterwards, when the screaming stopped, he could.  Dr Reutens said that going from one to the other suggests that the availability of the defence moves down in probability.
91In re-examination, Dr Reutens was asked to assume that the appellant had intended to use his knife to inflict grievous bodily harm.  She said that that proposition did not undermine her diagnosis of psychosis.  She expressed the view that the factual scenarios put forward by the Crown did not affect her opinion that, on the balance of probabilities, the appellant was mentally ill at the relevant time.  Having read the post-mortem reports and having considered the severity of the attacks, Dr Reutens nevertheless concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant was not acting with a moderate sense of composure.  She was of the view that the appellant had overreacted to perceived or actual provocation, in circumstances where his emotional and cognitive responses were impaired by his disease of the mind.  Again, one can understand why the jury might have been skeptical about that opinion.
Ground 1: Direction as to Expert Evidence
92By reason of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, the appellant requires leave to raise ground 1 since it was not raised at the trial.  Leave to appeal should be granted.  However, for the reasons that follow, the ground should be rejected.  
93The issue is whether the appellant had available to him the defence of mental illness or substantial impairment, on which he bore the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities.  The evidence did not support a finding that the appellant did not know the nature or quality of his act in killing his father.  Accordingly, there was a single issue in relation to the defence of mental illness.  The issue was whether he had the capacity to understand that his actions were wrong and the capacity to reason, with some modest degree of calmness, in relation to the moral quality of what he was doing.  
94Evidence on that single issue was led from the three physiatrists.  Where expert evidence is not challenged and there is no other evidence that casts doubt upon it, the trial judge should direct the jury that they should not reject it.  On the other hand, where the factual basis for the opinion may be incomplete or unreliable, or the opinions are challenged in cross-examination, such a direction is not necessary.  
95Each of the psychiatrists based opinions on a factual substratum consisting of the following:the appellant's description of his state of mind before, during and after he killed his father;statements from people to whom the appellant spoke after killing his father;statements from people with whom the appellant interacted before and after killing his father;the appellant's notes;VW's statement;crime scene evidence; andthe statements of the other psychiatrists.
96The appellant's first full account of what happened was to Dr Nielssen in March 2010, after he had decided to plead not guilty by reason of mental illness.  In his initial interview with Mr Owens, the nurse, he said that he did not get along with his father and that they had had a big fight before the offence occurred.  There was no reference to bikies.  That account was similar to the one the appellant gave Dr Goh on 20 February 2010.  On the other hand, the appellant told Dr Tahtouh on 20 December 2009 that ""they told me that if I didn't hurt them they would hurt me"".
97Dr Allnutt referred in cross-examination to the possibility that the appellant may have given an account of events that was more palatable than the truth.  Dr Nielssen agreed that a person's ability to explain conduct while in a psychotic state depends upon the detail of the person's memory, the amount the person is willing to disclose and the honesty of that disclosure.  Dr Nielssen agreed that the appellant's account was a significant matter upon which he relied in forming his opinion.  
98In his summing up, the trial judge told the jury that they should pay close attention to each expert's opinion and to the underlying facts upon which each opinion was based, in order to decide whether to accept the opinion evidence.  His Honour directed the jury, in orthodox terms, to the effect that they would need very good reasons not to accept an opinion about which all the experts agree and which was in their field of expertise.  His Honour also gave the jury his own opinion on the availability of the defence of mental illness in relation to the killing of Gervasio Da-Pra.
99The present case was not one where there was a danger that the jury, unless warned, might fail to appreciate the real meaning of the opinion evidence and might assess the appellant's conduct by attributing to him the kind of reasoning that a person without mental illness might employ.  Clearly enough, the jury accepted the opinion evidence that when he killed his father, the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of the mind arising from an underlying condition that substantially impaired his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong.  That must follow from the verdict of manslaughter rather than murder.  
100In the present case, there was evidence that cast doubt on the opinions expressed by the psychiatrists.  The appellant's accounts of his actions on the day in question were unreliable, thus casting doubt on the assumptions made by them.  There was other evidence capable of displacing the psychiatric opinion evidence and throwing doubt upon it, in circumstances where the opinion evidence was based on the appellant's self-serving statements and his accounts were shown to be unreliable.  Accordingly, it was not necessary in the present case for the trial judge to direct the jury that they must not reject unanimous medical evidence.  There was no error on the part of the trial judge and the first ground of appeal should be rejected.
Grounds 2 and 3: Unreasonable Verdicts and Section 7(4) of the Appeal Act
101Having regard to the substantial overlap between the matters that must be considered in dealing with the ground that the verdicts are unreasonable and the possible application of s 7(4) of the Appeal Act, it is convenient to deal with them together.  Although all three charges arise out of circumstances that occurred within close proximity to each other, it is necessary to draw a distinction between the death of Mr Da-Pra's father, on the one hand, and the offences involving grievous bodily harm to VW and the murder of EW, on the other hand.
102The appellant invites the Court to make a special order under s 7(4) of the Appeal Act on the basis that the evidence was so strongly in favour of the view that the appellant was mentally ill that he was not responsible according to law.  He contended that the defence of mental illness was established in relation to the charges concerning EW and VW.  
103Section 7(4) of the Appeal Act confers a power on the Court to examine the evidence and to act upon the Court's view of that evidence in appropriate cases.  The power may be exercised not only in cases where it might be appropriate to order a new trial, but also in cases in which the Court is not prepared to hold that the jury's verdict was so perverse and unreasonable as to require that the verdict be set aside.  Even if the jury's verdict is not unreasonable in that sense, but the Court considers that the evidence was so strongly in favour of the view that the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law, it is open to the Court to exercise the special power conferred by s 7(4).  The condition of the exercise of the power is simply that it appears to the Court that the accused was mentally ill.  Nevertheless, the cases that fall within the power will necessarily be of rare occurrence.  If the evidence, although strongly in favour of the accused's case, is such that a jury, acting reasonably, is not satisfied that the case was established, it will rarely happen that an appellate court, acting merely on a transcript of evidence, will be satisfied that a different view ought to be taken.  The appellate court does not have the benefit that the jury had of hearing the evidence as it was given and of seeing the witnesses and seeing the accused himself (R v Jenkins (1963) 64 SR(NSW) 20 at 29; R v Derbin [2000] NSWCCA 361 at [12]-[13]).
104The power conferred by s 7(4) is an exceptional one, insofar as it invites the Court to second guess a jury verdict even in circumstances where the Court does not conclude that the jury's verdict was perverse or unreasonable so as to require that it be set aside.  In order to determine whether the power should be exercised in the present case, it is necessary to examine in some detail the evidence at the trial, particularly the opinion evidence of the psychiatrists who gave evidence.  A significant aspect of that opinion evidence is, of necessity, the detailed assumptions made by the psychiatrists as the basis of their respective opinions.  In that regard, the Crown contends that it is highly significant that the relevant assumptions depend, for the most part, upon the appellant's histories given some considerable time after the events in question and after he had decided to plead not guilty on the basis of mental illness.
105The question is whether the Court is satisfied that the appellant was labouring under such a defect of reasoning, caused by a disease of his mind, as either not to know the physical nature of his acts or not to know both the physical and moral nature of his acts, such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons or whether he was not able to reason, with some modest degree of calmness, as to the moral quality of what he was doing.  All of the psychiatric evidence points clearly to the conclusion that the appellant knew what he was doing and so knew the physical nature of his acts on 18 December 2009.  
 Gervasio Da-Pra
106The Crown accepted that at the time of committing the offences, the appellant suffered from a mental illness.  However, the Crown contended that the severity of his mental illness fell short of rendering him not responsible for his actions according to law.  The psychiatrists all agreed that at the time of committing all of the offences, the appellant appreciated the nature and quality of his acts.  The area of dispute was whether, at the time he attacked his victims, he was able to reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure.  
107The Crown relied on the fact that the psychiatrists' opinions in relation to the attack on the appellant's father were based substantially on his own account of what happened.  The Crown contended that the jury's acceptance of the partial defence of substantial impairment, rather than the full defence of mental illness, was open for the following reasons:The appellant was ""a very unreliable historian"" and the psychiatric opinions relied heavily on acceptance of his version of what happened when he was with his father.The appellant said that he attacked his father in anger after his father hit him.The appellant acted in a calculated and rational manner after killing his father, by cleaning the house and garage, hiding the body away from the premises and staging a robbery at his parents' house, with a view to avoiding detection by the police.There was evidence that the appellant knew that what he had done was wrong.  Dr Nielssen accepted that he was clearly aware of the legal, if not the moral, wrongfulness of his actions.  Dr Nielssen accepted that the appellant understood that although he felt justified in killing his father, it was considered legally wrong to kill do so.
108The jury did not disregard the psychiatric evidence.  Rather, they accepted that the appellant suffered from an abnormality of mind, arising from an underlying condition that substantially impaired his ability to judge whether his actions were right or wrong.  The Crown contended that the Court, exercising a cautious and conservative approach, and giving the jury verdict the weight that it deserves, would not be convinced that the jury had come to a wrong conclusion and ought not to disturb the jury verdict in relation to the manslaughter of Gervasio Da-Pra, bearing in mind that the appellant carries the onus of proof on the issue of mental illness.  
109The appellant contended that it was clear beyond dispute that the verdict in relation to the charge of killing his father was unreasonable and cannot be supported.  He pointed out that there was no challenge to the evidence that he had delusional beliefs.  Further, he contended, all three psychiatrists concluded that at the time that he killed his father, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 110Clearly enough, the jury accepted the psychiatric evidence that the appellant suffered from an abnormality of the mind that substantially impaired his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong.  They did not accept, on the balance of probabilities, that, at the time he killed his father, he did not know that it was wrong to do so.  The question is whether that conclusion is unreasonable in the light of the evidence summarised above or whether the evidence was so strongly in favour of the view that the appellant was mentally ill that he was not responsible according to law.  
111According to all of Dr Allnutt, Dr Nielssen and Dr Reutens, the appellant had the defence of mental illness available to him in relation to the killing of his father.  I was originally disposed to conclude that there were factors that would justify the jury's disregarding the psychiatric evidence.  
112First, all of the opinions of the psychiatrist are based on unreliable histories provided by the appellant.  It is certainly arguable that the strength of the factual assumptions that underpinned the psychiatric conclusions regarding the charge of killing his father are greatly undermined by the unreliability of the appellant's versions of events that can be tested against independent evidence.  There were numerous instances where his versions of the circumstances of the attacks were incomplete or inaccurate when tested against such evidence.  Secondly, the acts committed by the appellant after he had killed his father were capable of being characterised as being calculated and rational acts.  
113On the other hand, there was ample evidence to support a finding that the appellant held a delusional belief that, in killing his father, he might be able to save his mother.  The other witnesses corroborated the appellant's evidence of his delusion that his family had been the subject of extortion and death threats.  
114The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence as it was given by the witnesses, particularly the expert witnesses.  The evidence concerning the appellant's mental illness in relation to the killing of his father was unanimous.  
115The jury is entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence.   Nevertheless, I am persuaded on balance that, at the time that he killed his father, the appellant was suffering from a defect of reason caused by a disease of his mind, such that he was unable to reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure.  While he knew that killing was wrong, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong in the relevant sense.  I would therefore be disposed to intervene under s 7(4) of the Appeal Act.  
 VW and EW
116Although the charges of causing grievous bodily harm to VW and the murder of EW are separate, they are sufficiently close together in time that it would be artificial to distinguish between them when considering the appellant's mental capacity.  The two charges are part of a single event.  
117The appellant accepted that in relation to the charges involving EW and VW, it was technically possible, on the basis of Dr Allnutt's evidence, to argue that the defence of mental illness was not made out.  He said that, nevertheless, the verdicts in relation to those charges were unreasonable and cannot be supported because of the tenuous basis for the convictions after taking into account all the relevant evidence.  He said that the basis for the convictions on the charges involving EW and VW can only be that the appellant was mentally ill at the time of killing his father earlier in the morning but not mentally ill or substantially impaired later in the morning.  The relevant time period for all three charges was between 7.30am and noon on 18 December 2009.
118The appellant contended that the basis for the jury's verdicts was fundamentally flawed because they must be based upon the following factual assumptions, which the appellant seeks to impugn:The appellant attended the W residence with the sole intention, at the outset, of diverting suspicion from himself in relation to the death of his father by staging a home invasion.Included in the appellant's thinking was the intention to obtain money so that he could leave the area and not be arrested in relation to the killing of his father.The appellant's attack on EW and VW was consistent with that intention and he took steps after the attacks to create the impression of a home invasion.The attacks were more than momentary slashing type attacks.The appellant's evidence that he believed he was being followed must be rejected.The appellant's evidence that he mistook EW for an attacker must be rejected.That there could have been ""an island of sanity in a sea of madness"", which is psychiatrically tenuous.
119The verdicts in relation to the charges involving EW and VW do not indicate that the basis of the verdict was that the appellant was mentally ill at the time of killing his father, but not mentally ill or substantially impaired later in the morning when he killed EW.  Rather, the verdicts indicate that the jury found, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant was substantially impaired by his abnormality of mind when he killed his father, though still knew that his actions were wrong, but that when he killed EW a few hours later, his impairment was not so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  
120The first six of the matters that the appellant impugns form the basis for Dr Allnutt's opinion that he did not have a defence of mental illness available to him in relation to his attack on EW and VW.  There was a firm evidentiary foundation for each of those six matters.  The trial judge, in his summing up, said that there was clearly evidence that could be said to argue for the view that the defence of mental illness was not made out in relation to the offences involving EW and VW.  His Honour said that that was a question on which he was not proposing to express a view, since it was a matter for the jury.  The task of this Court in relation to the second and third grounds of appeal is to ascertain whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied as to the relevant matters by reference to the complaints made on appeal.  
121It was open to the jury to prefer the evidence of Dr Allnutt to that of Dr Nielssen and Dr Reutens.  Thus, as indicated above, Dr Allnutt gave evidence to the following effect:The appellant's thoughts in planning some type of alibi or diverting attention from himself were consistent with someone who had an awareness that what had happened with his father may be considered wrong.The fact that the appellant thought that if he might be sent to gaol and that if he went to gaol he could be killed indicated an understanding that what he had done could be considered by others as wrong.  The appellant saw VW and EW as neighbours, not as part of any delusion, when he hit VW, when he was also thinking of tying them up and taking money to get away.  While EW was incorporated into his delusional thinking temporarily and erroneously, causing him to make decisions based on that interpretation, very shortly afterwards the appellant understood that EW and VW were not in any way associated with his delusions.  Assuming the alternative scenario that he was asked to assume, a defence of mental illness was not available to the appellant in relation to the attempted murder of VW and the defence of substantial impairment was not available in relation to the murder of EW.  
122Dr Allnutt was asked to assume that the appellant attended the W residence to divert suspicion from himself in relation to the death of his father and that he did so by trying to make it appear that there had been a home invasion.  The evidence supports that assumption.  When he was pulled from the burning car, the appellant admitted killing his father and attacking the Ws.  When asked why he had done that, he said that he ""did not mean to"".  When asked why he had killed EW, he said that it was not meant ""to happen like that"" and that, after he killed his father, he ""went over there to get an alibi"".  In the note that he handed to the nursing staff at the hospital he said that, after killing his father, he was ""looking for a way to create a diversion"".  On 19 February 2010, when he spoke to Mr Owens, the nurse, he said that after the incident with his father he decided he needed money and went next door.  On 20 February 2010, the appellant told Dr Goh that he thought he would go next door and ""pretend that a home invasion had occurred there, take money and then leave the city"".
123The appellant told Dr Nielssen that after killing his father and taking his body to the shops, he called on the Ws about 15 minutes later to ""create an alibi"".  He told Dr Allnutt that he thought of an alibi as he walked back home, namely to go to the neighbours and tell them that his car had broken down and he needed to use their phone.  He was going to call his father to establish the alibi. 
124The evidence in support of the assumption that the appellant's thinking included the intention of obtaining money, so he could leave the area and not be arrested in relation to the killing of his father, is found in his statements to Mr Owens, Dr Goh and Dr Allnutt, as indicated above.  The evidentiary basis for the proposition that the attack on the Ws was consistent with the intention of obtaining money and that he took steps to create the impression of a home invasion is found in his statement to Dr Goh that he would pretend that a home invasion had occurred there, take money and then leave the city.  There was unchallenged evidence that the appellant ransacked the W residence.
125The evidence is clear that the attacks on EW and VW were more than momentary slashing type attacks.  EW suffered extensive bruising to the lips and chin, which the pathologist who conducted the post-mortem thought was unlikely to have been caused by only one blow.  She suffered a fracture to her skull and other bruising in the area that could have had a number of causes, including falling to the floor.  There was also patent bruising to the upper chest.  The appellant sliced across EW's throat twice, causing lacerations that killed her almost instantly.  One cut extended through the back of her mouth to the spine.  The wound included marks in the adjacent skin, suggesting a sawing motion of the implement that caused the injuries.  The blood spatter indicated that EW was supine when her throat was cut.  In addition, VW suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured jaw, a severed trachea and slash wounds to her throat area.  The trial judge noted in his summing up that VW's evidence and the injuries to EW seemed inconsistent with the appellant's account of just lashing out, or slashing, with a knife.
126It was open to the jury to reject the appellant's evidence that he believed he was being followed.  He did not give evidence at the trial, so the jury did not have the benefit of hearing his own sworn evidence tested by cross-examination.  It is significant that he made no mention of believing he was being followed until some 15 months after the offences occurred.  The first time that he mentioned his belief that he was being followed was when he spoke to Dr Nielssen on 17 March 2011.  At that time, he had already decided to plead not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
127The jury was entitled to reject the appellant's evidence that he mistook EW for an attacker.  He made no mention of such a belief in any of his contemporaneous explanations for his actions.  He did not raise that matter until he had decided to plead not guilty by reason of mental illness. The versions that he gave some 15 months later, after having decided to plead not guilty by reason of mental illness, were unsworn, made out of court and were self-serving.  It was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant did not, at the time of the offences, believe that he was being followed or that EW was an attacker.
128The appellant asserts that the analysis of ""an island of sanity in a sea of madness"" is psychiatrically tenuous.  The contention appears to refer to Dr Allnutt's opinion that when the appellant killed his father, he was suffering a defect of reason such that he did not understand that his actions were wrong, but that when he killed EW a short time later, he did.  Dr Allnutt did not use the quoted phrase and it was not put to him in cross-examination.  Dr Nielssen used the phrase in cross-examination.  When invited to comment on the scenario upon which Dr Allnutt's opinion was based, Dr Nielssen responded that the problem with the scenario was that it assumed that somehow the appellant was cured of being mentally ill in that he had a lucid interval or a kind of ""island of sanity in a sea of madness"".
129Dr Allnutt's evidence as to his reasoning leading to his conclusion that when the appellant attacked the Ws he may not have had a mental illness defence available to him occupied a considerable time in the trial.  He was cross-examined both by counsel for the appellant and answered questions put to him by the trial judge, in the course of which he explained his evidence and maintained his opinion.  There was no suggestion that Dr Allnutt was not an appropriately qualified and experienced forensic psychiatrist.  In circumstances where there was competing expert evidence on an issue on which the appellant bore the onus of proof, it was open to the jury to prefer Dr Allnutt's evidence to that of Dr Nielssen and Dr Reutens.  That was not unreasonable.  
130When all of the evidence is considered, it is apparent that the jury's rejection of the defence of mental illness and the partial defence of substantial impairment in relation to the offences against EW and VW was open to them and was not unreasonable.  The Court is in no better position than the jury to determine the issue as to mental illness.  The appellant carried the onus of proof on the issue of mental illness.  The Court should adopt a cautious and conservative approach to its task and give the jury's verdict due weight.  When the evidence as a whole is considered, it is not apparent that the jury erred.  
131The psychiatric evidence indicates that the appellant was suffering from psychosis.  That, however, is not sufficient to establish the defences upon which he relies.  He must establish, on the balance of probabilities, that when he killed his father he did not have the capacity to reason, with some degree of calmness, as to the moral quality of what he was doing.  He must also establish, on the balance of probabilities, that when he attacked EW and VW he was incapable of reasoning, with some degree of calmness, as to the moral quality of what he was doing.
132The appellant has not demonstrated that the verdicts were unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.  Grounds 2 and 3 should be rejected.
Conclusion on the Conviction Appeal
133There was no error in the trial judge's direction in relation to the charge involving the death of the appellant's father.  However, the Court should exercise the power conferred by s 7(4) of the Appeal Act in relation to that conviction.  134On the other hand, the Court should not exercise the power conferred by s 7(4) in relation to the other two convictions.  It follows that the appeal against conviction in respect of those offences should be dismissed.  It is therefore necessary to consider the Crown's appeal against sentence.  
The Sentence Appeal
135The Crown contends that the sentences individually and the sentences as aggregated fail to reflect the very serious criminality of the offending and, accordingly, are manifestly inadequate.  The sentences for each offence may be summarised as follows:manslaughter of Gervasio Da-Pra:  imprisonment for six years commencing on 20 December 2009 and expiring on 20 December 2015, with a non-parole period of four and a half years expiring on 19 June 2014;attempted murder of VW:  imprisonment for six years, commencing on 20 December 2012 and expiring on 20 December 2018, with a non-parole period expiring on 19 June 2017; andmurder of EW:  imprisonment for a term of 15 years, commencing on 20 December 2014 and expiring on 19 December 2029, with a non-parole period expiring on 19 December 2024.
136The effect is that the sentence for the attempted murder of VW is almost entirely subsumed within the sentences for the manslaughter of Gervasio Da-Pra and the murder of EW.  Only six months of the aggregate non-parole period is referable to the attempted murder of VW.
137The grounds of appeal relied on by the Crown may be summarised as follows:(1)The sentence imposed in respect of the murder of EW was manifestly inadequate in so far as the sentencing judge failed to give effect to the jury verdict in relation to the murder;(2)The sentence imposed in respect of the murder of EW and the sentence imposed in respect of the attempted murder of VW were manifestly inadequate in so far as the sentencing judge failed to assess properly the objective seriousness of the murder of EW and the attempted murder of VW;(3)The sentence imposed in respect of the murder of EW and the sentence imposed in respect of the attempted murder of VW were manifestly inadequate in so far as the sentencing judge failed to give appropriate consideration to the standard non-parole periods and maximum penalties for the murder of EW and the attempted murder of VW; (4)The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the appellant's mental illness, leading his Honour to impose sentences that were, in the circumstances, manifestly inadequate;(5)The sentencing judge erred in reducing the sentences imposed on the appellant pursuant to s 22A and s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Sentencing Act);(6)The sentencing judge erred in failing adequately to accumulate the three sentences, leading to a manifestly inadequate total sentence and a manifestly total non-parole period; and(7)The sentences imposed were, in the circumstances, manifestly inadequate.
138The Crown contends that the sentencing judge's sympathy for the appellant's mental illness ultimately overwhelmed his Honour's consideration of the objective seriousness of each of the offences and diverted his Honour from making a proper assessment of their gravity.  The result, the Crown contends, was individual sentences and a total aggregate sentence that were manifestly inadequate.  Since I conclude below that the sentencing judge erred in failing adequately to accumulate the sentences involving VW and EW and that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate, it is unnecessary to consider grounds 1 to 5.   However, before dealing with the Crown's grounds of appeal, I should say something about the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence.  
The Sentencing Judge's Remarks on Sentence
139The Crown submitted that the appellant's actions at his parents' home after killing his father were undertaken with a view to diverting suspicion from himself and to gain time for him to leave Sydney.  The Crown submitted that the jury accepted that.  The Crown case in relation to the offences against VW and EW was that the appellant demonstrated a degree of rationality, such that neither the defence of mental illness nor that of substantial impairment had been established.  The Crown referred to inconsistencies between the appellant's various versions of what happened in the W residence, on the one hand, and the evidence of VW, on the other, which was accepted by the sentencing judge.
140The Crown contended to the sentencing judge that the jury's rejection of the defence of mental illness and substantial impairment in relation to the murder of EW, coupled with the very great heinousness of the offence, indicated that a life sentence was warranted under s 61 of the Sentencing Act.  The Crown contended that the attempted murder of VW fell into the worst-case category.  The Crown submitted that in the absence of a life sentence, significant accumulation was required, having regard to the high degree of criminality involved in each offence committed on different victims.
141The only evidence as to the circumstances of the death of Gervasio Da-Pra came from the appellant himself.  The sentencing judge said that the account that the appellant gave to Dr Allnutt was consistent with the other evidence and therefore could be accepted.  However, his Honour preferred the evidence of VW to the evidence of the appellant.  His Honour found that the appellant's various accounts concerning his attack on the Ws were inconsistent with VW's evidence.
142The sentencing judge accepted that EW had suffered repeated blows to her lips and chin and that she suffered a fractured skull.  The uncontested medical evidence was that EW had received at least two very forceful blows to her head, both front and back, which were probably not caused by falling to the floor.  She also received multiple blunt force injuries to her neck, in addition to the wounds caused by the knife.  The medical evidence indicated that it was likely that the blow to her skull occurred first, followed by multiple blows to the face, head and neck, with the cutting of the throat coming last.  His Honour accepted that EW was supine at the time that her throat was cut.  His Honour found that the appellant's assertions that he just lashed out with the knife when EW ran from behind could not be accepted.
143While it is not entirely clear, the sentencing judge appears to have accepted that the appellant went to the W residence with a view to obtaining an alibi.  His Honour rejected the Crown's submission that he went to the W residence to obtain money, notwithstanding his own statements to that effect.  His Honour found, however, that the appellant did not have a premeditated intention to attack or kill the Ws before he attended their home.  His Honour considered that the most likely explanation for the appellant's immediate invasion of the W residence was that he thought he was being followed and wished to hide.  On the other hand, his Honour observed that the first mention of the blue car was in March 2011.  Accordingly, the suggestion that the appellant went to the W residence to hide because he thought he was being followed should be given appreciably less weight than if those matters had been mentioned earlier.  It is significant that the appellant had decided to plead not guilty by reason of mental illness before his first mention of the blue car.
144The appellant was armed with a hunting knife when he entered the W residence.  He used the knife to attack VW and to kill EW.  The sentencing judge observed that the immediacy of the attack on EW and VW raised the possibility of premeditation.  However, his Honour found that the illogicality of the attack suggested that the appellant felt himself to be under attack.  His Honour observed that the viciousness of the attacks on the Ws was so awful that it militated in favour of something having gone badly awry in his mental processes, particularly in light of his non-violent past.
145The sentencing judge accepted the Crown's submission that the basis for the jury's rejection of the defence of mental illness in the case of Gervasio Da-Pra was most likely a finding that he had failed to establish that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  His Honour found, for the purpose of s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act), that the appellant's capacity to judge whether his actions in killing his father were right or wrong was substantially impaired.  His Honour also found that the appellant's capacity to control himself at the time of killing his father was also substantially impaired, notwithstanding the absence of any psychiatric or other evidence on that question.  His Honour found that, at the time of the attack on the Ws, the appellant's capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, and to control himself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind.  However, in light of the jury's verdict, the impairment was not so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
146The sentencing judge attached significance to the following matters in relation to the appellant's subjective circumstances:he was 45 years old and had no criminal record;numerous witnesses said that he had never been violent or threatened violence in the past;his part-time employer in a window tinting business provided a reference indicating that he was always punctual and reliable, energetic, honest and respectful and was a true tradesman; andhe was deeply sorry for his offences, as demonstrated by the note handed to Fairfield Hospital and his attempted suicide.
147The sentencing judge considered that subject to two qualifications, there was no reasonable possibility of the appellant re-offending, given his general attitude and conduct prior to the offence and also after his arrest.  While in prison he has always been compliant, polite and co-operative.  The first qualification was that he must remain on anti-psychotic medication as long as treating psychiatrists require him to do so.  The second qualification is that he must remain abstinent from alcohol, marijuana and other drugs.
148The sentencing judge took into account, as extra-curial punishment, the appellant's self-immolation and the severity of the burns he suffered.  His Honour also afforded an unquantified discount under s 22A and s 23 of the Sentencing Act by way of rewarding the appellant's facilitation of the administration of justice and his assistance in the investigation of the offences.
149The sentencing judge noted the standard non-parole period of 25 years applicable to the murder of a child and of 10 years for attempted murder, as well as the possibility of a life sentence being imposed pursuant to s 61 of the Sentencing Act.  His Honour referred to the principles of general deterrence and the kindred concepts of retribution and punishment, which should be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder.  His Honour held that, because of the appellant's schizophrenia, general and personal deterrence should be given little weight.  His Honour found that no further custodial time was necessary to further the appellant's reform or rehabilitation and that the protection of the community did not require further custodial time.  His Honour considered that it was only retribution that could justify any further substantial time in custody.
150The sentencing judge referred in general terms to the principles concerning the application of maximum penalties, including that they are reserved for worst-case offences.  His Honour did not make any formal finding of objective seriousness in relation to any of the three offences.  His Honour did not give consideration to the significance of the differences in the appellant's moral culpability in the light of the different verdicts of the manslaughter and murder.  
Ground 6 - Adequate Accumulation
151The Crown contends that the sentencing judge erred in failing to accumulate the sentences adequately, which led to a manifestly inadequate total sentence and a manifestly inadequate total non-parole period.  The Crown accepts that in structuring the sentence as he did, the sentencing judge was exercising a discretion.  The Crown complains, however, that his Honour failed to have regard to the essential consideration, namely, the need for the sentences as a whole to reflect adequately and proportionately, in their totality and structure, the criminality of the offences (see R v Amacha [2010] NSWCCA 180 at [68]).
152The appellant emphasises that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary.  He accepts that it is important that an appropriate sentence be imposed in respect of each offence and that the total sentence imposed properly reflect the totality of the criminality (see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]).  However, he says, the Crown has not established error in the sentencing judge's approach.
153There is no general rule for determining whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively.  Rather, that question is to be determined by the application of the principle of whether the sentence for one offence comprehends and reflects the criminality for the other offence or offences.
154If there would be a risk that combined sentences would exceed what would be warranted to reflect the total criminality of the offences involved, the sentences ought to be concurrent.  However, if the sentence for one offence does not comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence or offences, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative.  Otherwise, there would be a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the offences (Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27]).  
155Neither the total sentence nor the total non-parole period reflects the total criminality of the appellant's offences.  The overall result is disproportionately lenient for the three crimes that he committed, two of which resulted in death and one of which resulted in serious injuries.  In particular, the imposition of an almost wholly concurrent sentence in relation to the offence against VW fails to acknowledge the extreme harm done to her as a separate victim.
156While it is necessary to avoid a crushing sentence, public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that there has been some kind of discount for multiple offending (see R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [18]).  In the present case, a proper recognition of the extreme seriousness of each of the three offences committed by the appellant, each of which involved a different victim, required a greater degree of accumulation of the sentences.  It follows that this ground of appeal is made out.
Ground 7 - Manifest Inadequacy
157The Crown contends that the sentences imposed for the murder of EW and the infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to murder VW were, in the circumstances, manifestly inadequate.  The Crown says that neither the sentence imposed for each offence nor their aggregation serves to denounce sufficiently the appellant's criminal conduct.
158The Crown contends that the objective gravity of the offences against EW and VW has been rendered inconsequential by the great weight given to the appellant's mental illness, which, he contends, became the dominant and controlling factor on sentencing.  The Crown says that the subjective features of the appellant's case overwhelmed the objective seriousness of the offences.
159The Crown contends that while the jury must be taken to have concluded that each offence occurred at a time when the appellant had insight into his behaviour, the sentencing judge adopted an approach that was contrary to that conclusion.  The Crown maintains its position that the offences against EW and VW were the result of the appellant's stated aim of setting up an alibi for himself and creating a diversion.
160Inadequate sentences, just as much as excessive sentences, are likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their parts in deterring the commission of crimes (see Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 306).  The Crown contends that the sentences imposed in respect of each offence as well as the aggregate sentence are manifestly inadequate by reference to the objective facts, the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods.  It contends that the appellant's subjective case did not require the sentences to be ameliorated to the significant degree that each was ameliorated: there was insufficient accumulation of the sentences having regard to the totality of the criminality involved.
161The appellant contends that intervention by this Court is not warranted simply because the Court might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different from the manner of the sentencing judge.  This Court should not merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence for that of the sentencing judge.  It may interfere only where error, either latent or patent, is shown (see Wong & Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58] and [109]).  The appellant says that no error, either latent or patent, has been demonstrated by the Crown.
162An appeal against the leniency or inadequacy of the sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.  However, the power should only be exercised in order to achieve what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, namely, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand (see Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 299-300).  The appellant contends that the Crown has not demonstrated that the sentences are outside the appropriate range.  He contends that the overall sentence was within the appropriate range, having been imposed after due consideration of the particular circumstances of the offences and the offender.  He says that neither the process of fact finding, nor the identification and application of appropriate legal principles, demonstrates any error and that the sentences themselves and the overall sentence do not support the conclusion of error by way of inadequacy.
163The appellant contends that even if the Court concludes that error has been established, the Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene and re-sentence him, having regard to the delay and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards his rehabilitation.  He says that to the extent that the Court may be disposed to uphold the Crown's appeal, the sentencing outcome is not such as would dispose the Court to exercise its discretion to intervene and re-sentence him.
164The Court has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence, even though the sentence is erroneously lenient.  Various circumstances may combine to produce injustice if an appeal were to be allowed.  Such circumstances include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the offender's release on parole and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the offender's rehabilitation.  Such circumstances are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion that the Court has.  The guidance afforded to later sentencing judges by allowing an appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual (see Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1] and [43]).
Conclusion as to Sentence Appeal
165In all of the circumstances, while I have some reservation in reaching a conclusion different from that reached by such an experienced and respected trial and sentencing judge as R S Hulme J, I consider that, in the light of the jury's verdicts in relation to the offences involving EW and VW, his Honour erred as to the sentence imposed in respect of the murder of EW and the accumulation of the sentence in relation to the attempted murder of VW.  Further, I do not consider that there should be any discount under s 22A and s 23 of the Sentencing Act.  
166The sentence appeal should be allowed.  In the circumstances, it is appropriate for this Court to re-sentence the appellant.
Re-sentence
167It is necessary to re-sentence the appellant for the murder of EW and the attempted murder of VW.  I do not consider that the present case is one in which the Court should exercise its discretion not to interfere in the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge.  
168It is necessary to embark on the sentencing of the appellant for horrific crimes that he has committed against the observations made in dealing with the grounds of appeal.  There are several aggravating factors that must be noticed at the outset.  Both crimes involved quite extraordinary violence on two innocent females.  Both were vulnerable in that one was over 70 years of age and the other was no more than 12 years of age.  The crimes were unprovoked and were committed in the home of the victims.  They were committed with a weapon in circumstances that are without any possible excuse.
169The appellant knew that what he was doing was wrong.  He knew that his actions involved the attempted taking of a human life and the actual taking of a human life.  While he may not have intended to commit the crimes that he committed when he first set off with a view to establishing an alibi in connection with the killing of his father, that is a matter not without doubt.  His purpose in going to the W residence was to endeavour to create circumstances that would help him evade the consequences of the killing of his father.  It is open on the evidence to conclude that he went to the W residence with the intention of doing whatever might be necessary to achieve his purpose.  Knowing that he had killed EW and believing that he had killed VW, he set about endeavouring to cover his traces by staging a break-in.
170After endeavouring to create the appearance of a break-in, the appellant left the W residence and travelled some distance to the Central Coast.  It may be that at that stage, the enormity of his conduct came home to him, such that he wrote the notes described above.  He subsequently showed remorse and the fact that he endeavoured to kill himself indicates a degree of remorse as well.
171The psychiatric evidence indicates that the appellant is undertaking treatment.  Whether he will stay free of drugs and alcohol is not a matter about which a firm view could be formed.
172The horrific nature of the appellant's crimes is such that the community would expect a very significant punishment to be imposed.  He has been convicted of three crimes.  In a sense, the killing of his father is separate from the unprovoked attack on VW and EW.  There should be no concurrence as between the killing of Gervasio Da-Pra, on the one hand, and the attacks on EW and VW, on the other hand.  However, it is reasonable to treat the attacks on VW and EW as part of a single course of conduct.  To that extent, it would be appropriate that the terms of imprisonment imposed for those crimes be served partly concurrently.
173I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the joint reasons of R A Hulme and Bellew JJ, and in particular their Honours' reasons for concluding that the sentence for the attempted murder of VW should be one of 10 years and that the sentence for the murder of EW should be one of 20 years, for the reasons given by their Honours.  While I might have been disposed to impose a harsher sentence in relation to the murder of EW, I agree with their Honours, for the reasons given by them, that the sentences proposed by them are appropriate.   Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme and Bellew JJ.  
174R A HULME and BELLEW JJ:  Renzo Da-Pra was found guilty by a jury on 21 May 2012 of the manslaughter of his father, Gervasio Da-Pra, the murder of a 12 year old girl who lived next door, EW, and the causing of grievous bodily harm with intent to murder the girl's grandmother, VW.  
175Mr Da-Pra had been indicted for the murder of his father.  The verdict of guilty of manslaughter was based upon the jury being satisfied that the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind (see s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) had been made out.
176On 4 June 2012 Mr Da-Pra was sentenced by R S Hulme J to a total term of imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole component of 15 years: R v Da-Pra [2012] NSWSC 607.
177Mr Da-Pra seeks to appeal in relation to his conviction for each of the three offences on the following grounds:
1. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury, in relation to Count one, that they must not reject unanimous medical evidence in the absence of other evidence displacing or throwing doubt upon it. 2. The verdicts of the jury should be set aside on the ground that the verdicts are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 3. This Court should determine that the appellant was mentally ill at the time of the offences in accordance with s 7(4) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
178Leave is required in relation to the first ground because the point was not taken at the trial: r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  Leave is required in relation to the second ground because it does not involve a question of law alone: s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
179Ground 3 is unusual in that, if it were established, it is not a ground upon which the Court is authorised by s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act to quash a conviction.  Section 6 is headed, ""Determination of appeals in ordinary cases"".  Ground 3 is reliant upon a provision in s 7 which is headed, ""Powers of court in special cases"".  As the proceeding comes before the Court by virtue of s 5(1), and the only ground of an appeal under that provision that does not require leave is one that ""involves a question of law alone"", we think the better view is that leave is required in relation to this ground as well.  Having said that, nothing significant turns upon it as we are of the view that leave should be granted in relation to the second and third grounds because they raise matters of real substance.
180There is also an appeal by the Crown against the asserted inadequacy of the sentences imposed.  More will be said about that later.  Whilst dealing with the conviction appeal we will refer to Mr Da-Pra as the appellant.
181The killings of Gervasio Da-Pra and EW, and the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon VW, all occurred on 18 December 2009.  The appellant first killed his father and then, a relatively short time later, went to the neighbours' house and attacked the other two.
182A central issue in the trial, and now on appeal, was the appellant's mental illness.  It was his contention that he should be found not guilty in respect of each offence on the grounds of mental illness.  The jury obviously did not accept that beyond allowing that in relation to his father his mental impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for the murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
The appellant's background
183The appellant was born in 1964 to Ms Elsa Da-Pra and the deceased, Mr Gervasio (""Gino"") Da-Pra.  He had two younger brothers, Mario and Carlo. 
184He was involved in a motor cycle accident at the age of 27 in which he sustained multiple fractures.  Thereafter he was in receipt of a disability support pension but he managed to engage in occasional employment as well. 
185For a time the appellant lived in Queensland but he would come to Sydney occasionally and would stay at his parents' home in Wetherill Park.  They lived in Lamb Close.  Their next door neighbour around the corner in Langland Street was Ms VW who lived with her granddaughter, the deceased EW who was aged 12.
186There was evidence in the trial concerning the appellant's good character.  It was not challenged by the Crown and it included that he had never threatened violence or exhibited any tendency to violence in the past.
Events leading up to 18 December 2009
187There was a good deal of evidence in the trial about things the appellant did and said in Queensland, en route between Queensland and Sydney, and whilst in Sydney in the lead up to 18 December 2009. 
188The appellant was acquainted with Mr Charles Cramp and had worked for him in his window tinting business in Brisbane.  On the morning of Monday 7 December Mr Cramp arrived at his window tinting business to find a note under the door from the appellant saying that he had to go to Sydney unexpectedly as his brother had been in an accident.  He asked Mr Cramp to look after his dog and told him that he would speak to him later. 
189The appellant travelled to Sydney with a friend, Mr Danny Walton, also known as ""Joe"".  Mr Walton said that prior to this the appellant had told him that his family had been ""extorted"" by a person named Boris who was from the Strangers Motorcycle Club.  (The appellant had been a member of this club about 20 years before.)  This person was threatening his family and had demanded ""millions"".  He was going to kill the appellant's father and the whole family.  Mr Walton said the appellant had mentioned this about two years before and had said it more than once in that period.  He advised the appellant to go to the police.
190At some point the appellant told Mr Walton that his father had said that the police would look after them as his father had kept notes of all of the things that had happened to him concerning the extortion.  Also, whilst they were in Sydney, the appellant had mentioned that he might become violent in the protection of his family. 
191Mr Robert O'Keefe is Mr Walton's stepbrother.  Mr O'Keefe gave evidence of the appellant and Mr Walton arriving at his home in Sydney on 8 December where they both stayed the night.  He was given to understand the appellant planned to stay at his parents' home from the following night.  He described the appellant as being generally quiet and kept to himself.   In cross-examination, Mr O'Keefe said that he could tell there was something wrong with the appellant: he appeared as if he had a brain injury; he spoke slowly; and he would sit out the front of the house and talk to himself. 
192The trio went to the Milperra Hotel for lunch on 9 December.  The appellant arrived late.  Mr O'Keefe said that he heard the appellant telling Mr Walton that he had been followed all day.
193While they were in Sydney the appellant asked Mr Walton if he could find out where Boris lived.  Mr Walton knew him as the president of the Strangers Motorcycle Club.  He made an inquiry but was unsuccessful. 
194Ms Elsa Da-Pra, the appellant's mother, said that in the period leading up to 18 December 2009 he had been drinking too much.  He was drinking with his friend who was a mechanic (i.e., Mr Walton).  He would not act drunk but he was very tense.  There was one occasion when he rang her up and had told her with some persistence that she should go overseas.  He said he had heard that someone wanted to kill himself and his parents.  Ms Da-Pra had no idea why he said this.
195Ms Juanita Da-Pra, the appellant's sister-in-law, said that in early December the appellant asked her daughter to make purple paper flowers.  He later gave Juanita one of the flowers.  He wrote family names on it, hers and her husband Mario's name.  He said, ""If someone comes knocking on the door, hand them this and see if it is enough.  If it is, I might be able to write someone else's name down and save someone else"". 
196Mr Luis Palma had known the appellant since 1999 but saw less of him after the appellant moved to Queensland.  On evening of 10 December the appellant came to his home in Horsley Park.  After he left, Mr Palma's wife showed him a paper flower that the appellant had given to her.  He said that his niece had made it.  In giving it to Ms Palma he had said, ""This is something to remember me by"". 
197From late afternoon on 11 December through to the morning of 12 December Mr Palma had a number of phone conversations and an exchange of text messages with the appellant.   In the first he mentioned that he was heading back to Brisbane.  A short time after that he spoke of having to have a meeting at home because ""someone is saying something. I don't know who to believe"".  In another call he said, ""We'll sort it out, everything will be fine"".   About an hour later he called again and Mr Palma said that he sounded upset or down.  He said, ""If you don't hear from me between now and lunch time tomorrow, can you please go past my oldies' place, check to see if they're all right"".  
198In the early hours of 12 December Mr Palma received a text message from the appellant which said, ""My brother's phone number is ... just in case"".   Later that morning he sent Mr Palma a text and they then had a phone conversation in which the appellant conveyed that everything was alright.  Mr Palma said that the appellant sounded to be in better spirits.  In the earlier conversations he was ""not his usual self""; he seemed a little more nervous than usual; his mind was elsewhere.  Generally as to his contact with the appellant in this period Mr Palma said that there were some incidents which made him think the appellant had become paranoid and his presentation was uncharacteristic.
199Mario Da-Pra saw the appellant at a family dinner at their parents' home on Friday 11 December.  He said the appellant had a friend with him, a mechanic named ""Joe"".  He said the appellant did not talk much; he appeared nervous; there was something on his mind. 
200Mario's wife, Juanita, was at the family dinner.  She gave evidence that the appellant told her, ""People are watching the house. People are after me and Gino.""  He also said that ""Joe is really here to protect us"".  
201Mr Walton said that he returned to Brisbane with the appellant.  Other evidence indicated that they left Sydney on 12 December.  They had travelled to Sydney together in the appellant's car.  They returned to Brisbane with Mr Walton driving that car and the appellant driving another car his father had given him.  They were forced to stop on the Central Coast for a few days after Mr Walton was arrested for some traffic offences.  Mr Walton said that during this trip the appellant seemed the ""same as he always is"".  There was no mention of his family and extortion.  He did say that he was worried about what was going to happen to his family, but that was all. 
202Ms Judith Robinson had known the appellant as a good friend from when she lived in Queensland but she had moved to live with her parents on the Central Coast.  She received a phone call from the appellant on 12 December. He said that his friend had been pulled up by the police in relation to driving offences (police records confirmed this).  She arranged to meet him at the Wyong Leagues Club. The appellant stayed the night at her home at Lake Haven. They went to the Wyong police station the next morning when Mr Walton was released from custody.  The pair remained in her company until they left in the evening. 
203Ms Robinson agreed in cross-examination that in her statement she had said that when she saw the appellant on 12 December ""he just wasn't himself"".  She thought that something was bothering him badly.  She also said that he was sweating a lot.
204The journey to Brisbane was also broken by stopping for an hour or two at the home at Karuah of Elizabeth Austin and Ronald (""Bill"") Feeney.  Mr Feeney said that the appellant seemed to be in a good frame of mine; he was pretty happy.
205Mr Colin Gross lived in Queensland and was acquainted with the appellant who had lived with him for a time.  At some stage in this period he visited Mr Gross.  He told him, ""You might be getting a visit from two lots of people"".  Mr Gross asked what was going on and he replied, ""It's a visit from two different lots of people, one of them the police.  It's about my Dad upsetting someone.  These people run the country and they have done something to someone close to my family.  They did that just to show that they can do it.""
206Mr Gross asked the appellant again what was going on and received the reply, ""If you know any more there's a good chance you will get hurt, the less you know the better"".  The appellant also said, ""This is why these people are coming, my address is still listed as your place"".   Mr Gross persisted in asking what was going on; expressed concern that the appellant had involved him in something he did not know about; and asked whether he should be worried.  The appellant said, ""I can't tell you any more about it"".
207Mr Gross said that the appellant was not acting differently; he was not jumpy or acting out of the ordinary.  But this was the first time he had said things like this.  
208The appellant returned to the Karuah home of Elizabeth Austin and Bill Feeney around midday on 16 December.  He wanted to get rid of his car and gave it to Mr Feeney.  He cleared out his belongings and put them into a bag which he asked them to mind. He said he would pick it up next time he was coming past.  They gave him a lift to a town just south of Karuah where he said he had another car to pick up. 
209Ms Judith Robinson said that she saw the appellant on either 16 or 17 December.  He said that he had come from up north.  He stayed the night at Lake Haven and left at about 7.00 the following morning. 
210Ms Robinson said that on this occasion the appellant appeared exhausted.  She said he ""wasn't right the whole time I saw him at this stage"".  He was not his usual self.  She asked if he was in some trouble and he replied, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not fixable"".   He also said, ""My father's done something stupid. I'll just go away for a couple of years and it will all blow over.  Time will work it out"".
211Charles Cramp received a phone call from the appellant on 17 December.  He said to Mr Cramp, ""I have been delayed, can you look after the dog until after Christmas?  I can't get back until after then"".  Mr Cramp agreed.  He asked how the appellant's brother was and was told, ""Don't worry about it, it was a pub thing"".  
212Mr Cramp said that when he saw the appellant earlier in December he did not seem any different.  He never mentioned any threats to his family, or money or property being demanded of the family. 
213Mario Da-Pra said that the appellant arrived at Mario's home on 17 December and stayed there for the night.  It was on either this occasion, or when he had seen him on 11 December, that the appellant had spoken of someone being after the family for something that the appellant had done.  He did not say who, but he said that the person was going to kill the appellant, Mario and their parents.  In addition, this person was going to take everything that their parents owned including their house.  It was going to happen before the end of the year.  Mario said that they also discussed the prospect of their parents going overseas.
214Mario Da-Pra then gave evidence of such a conversation taking place on 17 December.  It included that the main two people the person was after were their parents but he would also come to Mario looking for their parents.  Mario asked the appellant whether he and his family should go away for a few weeks and the appellant replied, ""It's not a stupid idea"".  Mario asked him if he was sure this was real and the appellant said it was 98 or 99 percent.  He asked how they could take everything belonging to their parents and the appellant told him that they could arrange for another will to be made up naming other people as beneficiaries.
215Ms Elsa Da-Pra came over to Mario and Juanita's home in the late afternoon of 17 December.  Juanita overheard the appellant telling his mother that people were ""going to come and kill us and take everything, including our houses"".  He told his mother, ""If properties aren't signed over to them they would torture us"". 
The appellant's movements and statements on 18 December 2009
216Juanita Da-Pra was woken on 18 December at about 7.30am by the sound of the appellant's car.  The offences concerning Gervasio Da-Pra and V and EW occurred at some stage between then and midday. 
217Juanita Da-Pra said that the appellant returned to her home about midday and they had a conversation.  She tried to find out more about what was going on and she said he repeated the same sort of things about people coming after them.   She noted that the appellant had not said anything about his other brother, Carlo, being in danger and she asked him why.  He replied that this was because Carlo had no money.  But he added that Carlo's wife's family, who were ""quite well off"", could be in trouble.  She asked him who these people were who were going to hurt them but he only referred to them as ""someone"" and said he did not know who they were.  During this conversation he was whispering so that no-one else could hear. 
218Juanita Da-Pra said that she received a phone call from the appellant at about 5.00 to 5.30pm but the calling number that came up on her phone was not one that she had in her phone's address book.  She said there were other voices and noise in the background.  The appellant told her, ""Don't lose the flower"" and ""Delete this number from your phone when you hang up"".  That was the last she heard from him before his arrest.
219The appellant arrived at the home of Ms Elizabeth Austin and Mr Bill Feeney at Karuah late that afternoon.  He asked to make a phone call and Ms Austin lent him her phone.  (Phone records showed that a call was made to Juanita Da-Pra on 18 December at 5.33pm). 
220Ms Austin said that on this occasion the appellant was sweating profusely and was very agitated, shaking and fidgety.  He went to the garage to have a beer with Mr Feeney but she said he then went out the back and stood where his car was parked.  At some stage he again asked to use her phone to make a call and she obliged.  She did not hear the conversation but when he returned the phone to her he said, ""How do I delete this number. I'm not giving the phone back until I delete this number"".  He refused her offer to delete it.  She said he kept the phone for about 15 minutes and must have worked out how to delete the number himself.
221Mr Feeney's assessment of the appellant on this occasion was that ""he was quiet and a bit fidgety"".
222Ms Austin said that the appellant then changed his clothing and drove away.  He took with him the bag that he had previously left behind.  Mr Feeney's evidence was that before he left he said ""Where is my gear?  I'm in some trouble.  I won't stay long"". 
The killing of Gervasio Da-Pra
223Ms Elsa Da-Pra went shopping early in the morning on Friday 18 December 2009.  She returned home at 11.50am - 12.00pm and attended to various activities around the house.  She noticed her husband's car was missing.  At some stage prior to this the appellant had put his father's body in the boot of the car and driven it to the carpark of a nearby shopping centre and left it.  
224Later in the afternoon Ms Da-Pra unsuccessfully tried contacting her husband on his mobile phone.  Her son Mario came and picked her up at around 6.00pm, by which time she was concerned.  Mario told her of the threats the appellant had been speaking about.   He tried to contact his father by phone but there was no answer.
225Mario Da-Pra subsequently noticed that the mesh near the handle of a flyscreen door was damaged; it was ""ripped open"".  He also noticed that a computer tower was missing from a computer desk in the garage, although the monitor, keyboard and modem were still there.
226A crime scene examination commenced at some stage the following day (19 December). At about 7.30pm one of the examiners, Senior Constable Matthew Campbell, attended the car park of the Stockland Shopping Centre at Wetherill Park where he examined a car belonging to the deceased, Gervasio Da-Pra.  It was locked but after entry was gained the body of the deceased was found in the boot. 
227Dr Matthew Orde was the forensic pathologist who conducted post-mortem examinations of the two deceased.  He concluded that Gervasio Da-Pra died as a result of blunt force neck injuries.  In short, pressure to the neck caused death by asphyxiation, suffocation or the like.  He was found to have sustained multiple recent injuries including bruises and abrasions to the head, fracturing of the nasal bones, dense haemorrhage within the soft tissues of the neck, fractures of the laryngeal cartilages and fracturing of the hyoid bone.  There was also a fractured rib and various other bruises and abrasions to other parts of the body.
228Dr Orde was asked about what may have caused the blunt force neck injuries.  He could not be specific.  It could have been ""knocks or blows to the body surface by an object or by the body impacting against a hard surface"", and that would include contact with a fist.
The killing of EW and wounding of VW
229Ms VW said she had met Gino and Elsa Da-Pra and was aware they had children.  She had seen, but had never met, the appellant. 
230At some time during the morning of 18 December 2009 Ms W heard the doorbell ring.  She was at the kitchen sink and E was in the family room.  The front door was open but a security screen door was locked.  The appellant said, ""I am Renzo, Gino and Elsa's son, I've broken down a couple of blocks away and I am looking for my father"".  
231When she came to give evidence Ms W could not recall what she had been doing that morning.  However, there was evidence that she received a telephone call from a grandson at 9.50am and so the appellant's attendance at the home must have been sometime after that.
232Ms W said that she went to put her hand on the screen door to keep it closed but the appellant wrenched it open, breaking the lock.   She said he was talking about something but could not recall what he said.  He entered and ""sidled along next to the staircase and I sidled along opposite"".  She later explained that he was facing her and he was moving sidewards.  He was very red in the face.  He was moving his fingers as if rolling a cigarette but there was nothing in his hands.  When they entered the kitchen the appellant grabbed her hand, swung her around and then started punching her.  She turned to E and saw that she was at the right-hand end of the family room table closer to the window. 
233Ms W tried to ""wave [E] out"".  She then ""had a sinking feeling"" and lost consciousness.  When she later regained consciousness she saw E lying at the opposite end of the family room table from where she had earlier been.  Ms W was still in the kitchen.  She managed to make her way to near the front entrance where a Telstra mobile phone was being charged and she called triple 0 before losing consciousness again.  
234There was evidence that the triple 0 call was made at 7.32pm.  Ambulance paramedics and police arrived soon after. The front door was found to be locked but a rear door was ajar.  A police officer tried to ascertain from Ms W who was responsible and she managed to convey that it was a neighbour whose name started with ""R"".  
235When Ms W woke up she was in intensive care in Westmead Hospital.  She had received emergency surgical intervention for a cut to her throat which severed her larynx and vocal chord which required reconstruction.  She also had a fractured left cheek bone and fractures to both sides of the jaw.  She was discharged from the hospital on 4 January 2010.  Dr Chin was the on call otolaryngology head and neck registrar who was involved in the surgery.  He (modestly) gave great credit for the amazing survival of Ms W to the ambulance, emergency unit and anaesthetic staff. 
236Dr Orde said that EW had sustained both blunt force bruising type injuries to the soft tissues of the neck together with a large ragged incised wound to the front of the neck extending through the low pharynx (the back of the mouth) and the upper larynx to the depth of the vertebral column.  She had also sustained blunt force head injuries with further soft tissue bruises and abrasions, a right-sided skull fracture, bleeding around the brain and bruises to the brain substance.  
237In relation to the incised wound to the neck, Dr Orde noted that on the left side four shallow ""tails"" extended to the adjacent skin.  He explained ""that's where the implement or implements causing this injury had caused further shallow partial thickness injuries to the skin at the edge of the wound"".  This indicated more than one motion of the implement, if there was one implement, causing the injury. 
238A forensic biologist who was also an expert in bloodstain patterns, Ms Alison Sears, gave opinion evidence that when EW sustained the severe wound to her neck she was laying on her back on the floor in the position where she was eventually found deceased.
239Ms W returned to the home after she was released from hospital.  She noticed that there was a problem with the landline telephone connection.  An electrician was called and he found that a plug in the lounge room had been smashed and forced into the wall. There was evidence supporting the proposition that this damage occurred prior to 1.29pm on 18 December 2009.
240Aside from the Telstra mobile phone Ms W used to dial triple 0, she also had a Vodafone mobile phone which she last saw on the kitchen bench.  It was missing.
241There was evidence that the bedrooms on the upper floor of the home had been ransacked and were in a state of disarray.
242Ms W also said that the house had insect screens, none of which were damaged prior to 18 December 2009.  Leading Senior Constable Amy Jackson gave evidence of her subsequent examination of the premises and it included seeing damage to a flyscreen that had been attached to a lounge room window at the front of the house.  She also saw damage to flyscreens on a number of windows at the rear of the house.
The appellant's attempted suicide on 20 December 2009
243Between 6.30am and 7.00am on 20 December the appellant approached the front desk of the Fairfield Hospital.  He pushed a thick writing pad under the counter window and asked the administration assistant, ""Can you take this to the police? Make sure the police get this"".  He then walked to the exit.  The assistant noticed that the notepad smelled of petrol or gasoline and it was bloodstained as well.    She took the notepad to the triage nurse who saw that it read, in part, ""To whom it may concern, if you're reading this letter, I'm probably dead"".  
244A short time later there was an explosion inside the appellant's car.  Police and fire brigade officers responded quickly.  The appellant was removed and placed under arrest.  He had multiple severe burns.  Detective Sergeant Barnes spoke with him at the scene:
""Q.  Why did you do it?  A. I didn't mean to.
Q. Why did you kill the girl?  A. It wasn't meant to happen like that.  After I did my Dad I went over there to get an alibi and things got out of hand.  I panicked then the knife was in my hand and I just started slashing.
Q. Why did you go back there?  A. I didn't go back.
Q. What do you mean?  A. After I finished with Dad I went over there.
Q.  Where's the knife?  A. In the bush.
Q.  Which bush?  A. I lost it in the bush last night. I was going to cut myself last night but didn't.  I stopped on the side of the road on the way down last night.""
245The appellant was taken inside the hospital where he was examined by Dr Emilie Tahtouh.  The doctor asked him how he had burnt himself and he replied, ""I drove my car to the petrol station and poured petrol all over myself and the car and then set it alight"".  He was asked why and he said, ""I may have killed my father and my neighbour down the street from my house in Wetherill Park"".  The doctor asked him why would he have done that and he said, ""They told me that if I didn't hurt them they would hurt me"".  He was asked who ""they"" were, whether they were voices in his head or actual people and he said, ""Actual people"".  He did not elaborate.  He was then sedated and treated.
The appellant's handwritten notes
246The appellant wrote notes at some stage after attacking his three victims and before his arrest; one that he handed in at the hospital before his attempted suicide and another that was in a bag he left behind at Karuah.  The latter read in part:
""I was told (threatened) a few months ago that my parents were to die a bad death soon ... I would have preferred my parents to die more humanely.  That left me no choice but to do it myself.""
247The handwritten note the appellant gave to the administration assistant at Fairfield Hospital included the following:
""I was once told (threatened) that my parents and myself were going to suffer terrible death.  I had a time limit where I could have made their passing easier, but at the end of the day the result was going to be the same.""
248There was some reference to the other people who were not prepared to assist him (not supported by any other evidence in the trial).  It continues:
""I was left with having to do it myself.  After killing my father I was looking for a way to create a diversion, so I went to the neighbours.  I was intending to only threaten them, but between what I had just done and what I had to do, I lost all control & in the frenzy and became a person that even I believe should not exist.  I did have a choice of saving my mother as, I was going to die, but now my only mission in life is to make it home & end my life to hopefully show how sorry I am for what took place.  In trying to avoid something bad, I have only succeeded to make things so much worse, & what's worse, 2 more innocent victims were added to my list of dead.  What I would have done not to have this task at all.  Words are unable to explain how I regret my wrongdoings but I can only hope that my actions tonight will at least bring some closure & or comfort to the people, familys [sic] & especially the innocent victims that I regretfully involved.  I must now get home & try to complete the task that was once set, & pray that in doing so, will end this tragic event at least for some."" 
249The note was signed and dated ""Sat Night"" (presumably Saturday 19 December 2009).
Subsequent statements by the appellant
250A letter written by Dr Danielle Vandenberg to the Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Long Bay Hospital was read by consent. She held the position of Senior Staff Specialist in Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry at Concord Hospital.  She set out the history of the appellant having been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at Concord Hospital on 20 December 2009 after having sustained 30 percent total body surface area mixed partial and full thickness burn injuries.  He had also sustained a self-inflicted stab wound to the left arm.  She provided a summary of some of the medical treatment he received.  Anti-psychotic medication was commenced on 29 December 2009.  He was transferred to the Burns Unit at Concord on 31 December 2009.  He was interviewed by the psychiatric team on 4 January 2010.  
251Dr Vandenberg said that the appellant described a 15 year history of a psychotic illness characterised by persecutory delusions and delusions of reference which had waxed and waned in intensity.  He spoke of ""someone"" who was planning to extort money from his parents and, more recently, from other people in the local community, including neighbours.  There had been an intensification of his delusional beliefs in the days leading up to the alleged crimes and he had felt anxious and agitated.  The appellant said that he had felt that others were not taking his concerns seriously and the alleged crimes occurred as a result of his perceived need to draw attention to the situation. 
252There was no history of hallucinations, either auditory or visual.  He denied any disorder of thought.  There was no history of sustained mood elevation or depression.  There was no history of prior contact with mental health services.  He denied any history of head injury. 
253Dr Vandenberg opined that the appellant suffered from a chronic psychosis characterised by prominent persecutory delusions suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia.  However, there were also the influences of his long term abuse of marihuana and alcohol.  
254Brian Owens was a registered nurse employed by Justice Health and worked at the Long Bay Hospital.  The appellant was transferred there from Concord Hospital on 19 February 2010.  Nurse Owens read a file that had accompanied the appellant to acquaint himself with the history and the medical situation. He then interviewed the appellant.  He described the appellant as pleasant and co-operative. He denied any history of self-harm or treatment by a psychiatrist.
255The appellant indicated an awareness of what he was charged with.  He used the terminology ""Knocking down, knocked down two"" and ""Seriously hurt another"".  
256The appellant said that he moved from Queensland to live with his parents at Christmas 2009.  He did not get along with his father and they fought all the time.  His father did not want his dog to stay.  They ended up having a big fight and then the ""incident"" happened.  He then went next door looking for money because he didn't have any money.  The little girl screamed and ran past him and he used the knife on her. He said he ""didn't want to kill her"" and he ""then seriously hurt the other one, the grandma"".  He claimed that he ""didn't want to do it"" and that it ""feels bad"".   He went to a hospital and tried to kill himself.
257Nurse Owens asked him about trying to kill himself.  He said that he did not go to a police station to do it because ""they would have stopped him"".  He did not do it in the bush because he had a letter that had to be found.  He had a good friend who was with him several days before the incident and he needed to make sure it was clear his friend had nothing to do with what had happened. 
258The appellant made no mention to Nurse Owens of bike gangs or bikies.  He also made no mention of his family being extorted for money.  
259In cross-examination, Nurse Owens confirmed that his role was to assess the appellant as an ""at-risk patient""; to assess if he would be safe or at risk to himself or others.  He did not ask the appellant to provide a full account of the events surrounding the incident.
260Dr Huan-Tzin Goh was the psychiatric registrar at the Long Bay Hospital.  He spoke with the appellant on 20 February 2010.  The doctor described the appellant as tense and nervous ""with staring eyes and seemed to be evasive when asked some questions"".  Dr Goh also noted that he spoke rapidly and gave more detail than was required in his responses to questions.  However, he appeared to understand the conversation as it was taking place.  He did not appear to be distracted, which would have indicated he might be experiencing hallucinations.  Dr Goh also noted that ""there was no overt evidence for any on-going psychosis, although this should be kept in mind as a possibility"". 
261The appellant told Dr Goh that his father would not listen to him about an imminent raid on the house.  He said that he stabbed his father in this context. He also said that he thought he would go to the neighbour's house, pretend that a home invasion had occurred there, take money from the house and then leave the city.  The girl ran past him while he was holding the knife.  He was really sorry it happened.  He ruminated on these events for one and a half days; wrote a letter to the police saying he was sorry and blaming someone else; after which he added that he should not have done that.  He then spoke of going to the hospital.
262Dr Goh said that he explained to the appellant what the psychotic symptoms of auditory hallucinations, ideas of reference and passivity meant.  The appellant denied that he was currently experiencing such symptoms.
263The appellant was asked about his family.  He said that his father was a difficult man; ""I didn't like him but I respected him"".  He said, ""our tempers would flare up"".  His father was fixed in his ways and they argued a great deal. 
264As with Nurse Owens, Dr Goh confirmed in cross-examination that he was assessing the appellant for whether he presented any risk to himself or others.  He was not otherwise determining his psychiatric state as at December 2009.  He did not ask him for a full account of the events of 18 December 2009.  The appellant had been prescribed an antipsychotic medication yet his train of thought was still hard to follow at times.  As at February 2010, Dr Goh could not exclude the possibility of psychosis.  In re-examination he said that he did not ask about the possibility of psychosis the previous December.
The defence of mental illness and the psychiatric evidence at trial
265In R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108, which was concerned with a trial of a women for murder, the following summary of the principles relevant to the defence of mental illness was provided (at [15]-[21]):
""The only real issue in this trial is whether the accused has available to her the defence of mental illness. It is a matter for her to establish not beyond reasonable doubt but on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659.
Section 38(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 provides:
If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.
The Act does not define the term 'mentally ill'. That is something that must be determined in accordance with the M'Naghten Rules laid down in R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718:
Every man is to be presumed to be sane; and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary is proven ...; that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.
...
In relation to the concept of a ""disease of the mind"" which produces such a defect of reason, the law requires that the accused's state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition. The condition may be temporary or of long standing. It does not matter whether it is curable or incurable. It must result in the function of the reason, memory or understanding of the person being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what she was doing, in that she did not know the physical nature or quality of her acts, or did not know that those acts were wrong, that is, wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.
As to whether the accused did not know the acts to be wrong, the question is whether the accused could be said to know, in the sense of appreciating or understanding that the acts were wrong, if through a disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind she could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people, would make that act right or wrong.
A final matter to observe is that if through a disordered condition of the mind the accused could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it would be open to find that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong.""
266Three psychiatrists gave evidence at the appellant's trial, namely:
Dr Allnutt;Dr Nielssen; andDr Reutens.
267Because this evidence was of crucial importance to the issues raised at the trial it is necessary to refer to it in detail.
Dr Stephen Allnutt
268Dr Allnutt prepared three reports which were, in large part, read to the jury.  The first report was dated 26 July 2011 and was prepared following a clinical evaluation with the appellant on 23 June 2011.  On that occasion Dr Allnutt took the following history regarding the offending (commencing at T362 L6):
""The alleged offence occurred on or about 18 December 2009. At that stage he was 45, living at home with his parents. He'd been living there for the prior 6 months. Before that he was living in Brisbane and had been there for 2 years. He got tired of sharing with people and thought he should come down to New South Wales. At the time he was on a disability support pension. He'd been on a disability support pension for about 5 to 6 years, secondary to a serious bike accident wherein he had suffered a fractured pelvis, wrist and ankle and subsequently had fused vertebra in his neck.
At the material time that the alleged offending occurred, he was not seeing a mental health worker, he had had no contact with a mental health worker and denied prior contact with a mental health worker. He was not taking medication and had no history of previously taking medication. He had taken painkillers in the past, but could not recall the name, but he was not taking any painkillers at the time of the alleged offence.
In the time leading up to the alleged offence he was utilising cannabis, half an ounce once a week for the prior 2 to 3 years. He was drinking Grappa in the morning; three to four shots; a 6-pack of beers, a 6-pack of bourbon; and a bottle of wine at night and had been doing this for about a year. He was suffering back pain, but otherwise was not suffering any major medical illnesses at the time.
In Brisbane he was unhappy with his housemates: They were not cleaning, they were damaging his property. He was not sure why they were doing this. He said they used to scrape the pots and pans and never cleaned up.
He came back from Brisbane in about July 2009 and lived with his parents. In August 2009 he had an argument with a person who took his credits and started playing his machine. This person then went and sat down with a group of bikies; he explained he had been in a bikie club between the age of 21 and 29. At age 27 he was bashed by a rival gang who threatened to harm him if they ever saw him again. At the time that this person took his credit, that is August 2009, he watched the person and he noticed this person sat with a group of bikies. He said he was always paranoid about bikies since his assault. He subsequently decided to leave.
After this incident he began to think that he was being followed. In September 2009 someone approached him in an RSL and told him someone, with many contacts was 'pissed of' with him and they were after him. He assumed it was the President of the bikies club. He said he was not sure ... now if this was a real meeting that he had had with this person who gave him this information or whether he dreamed it. In October 2009 he thought he met with the President. He now thought this was also a dream. He said the President told him that he was going to extort his parents, family and friends. He could not recall the time or the date or the venue where this occurred. He said the President told him he was going to kill him and his father if his father did not give them what they wanted. He said he was going to torture his mother if his father did not give them the money and the house.
...
He said the president also told him that he would save his mother if the accused killed his father and saved the rest of his family and friends if the accused killed himself. He believed that the president knew where everybody was. He believed that they were tapping his phone. He would hear noises on the phone when he answered the phone and so he believed that the president knew where everybody was - everyone was. He also believed that they were following him. He would see cars up in front of his house and his brother's place, he would hear bikies coming into the street. He said he was having conversations in his head. He said the president told him that he could save two families by giving them a purple flower.
In the time leading up to the alleged offence he was hearing voices of the president outside his head. The voices were saying that he had until Christmas and that Boris was coming after his family to make him pay for what ... he had done. He said he had previously almost caused a breakup in the marriage of Boris and other bikie gang members 15 years previously when he was 30. 
He was unsure whether or not he was receiving any messages from the TV, radio or the newspaper. In the week prior to the alleged offence he gave his sister-in-law a purple flower. He was told to do this by Boris and that if he did this he would save two families.
Around the time he had started to carry a knife with him. He thought the bikies might kill him. Boris told him, if he went to the police, more people would die and would kill his family so he could not go to the police. He felt trapped; he saw no options for himself.
On the day prior to the alleged offence, he told his brother that people were after his family. He said he had spoken to his mum the week before; and his brother had inquired what was wrong. His brother wanted to know but he could not tell him because he was worried they would be killed if his brother knew.
The next morning he woke up feeling anxious and nervous. He wanted to speak to his father to tell him he had to give the bikies what they wanted. He did not know how to tell his father he was going to die, that the bikies were going to kill him. He decided he needed to tell his father, however, to save his mother and he intended to tell his father that the bikies were coming to the house and if he did not give them what they wanted they would kill him and torture his mother. This was about 1 week prior to Christmas and time was running out.
He went and spoke to his father; he told him people were going to come to the house demanding his mother. His father did not believe him. He showed his father the knife to prove he was serious. He told him it had to do with Boris and they were coming after the family.
...
He and his father started arguing. His father was blaming him. Hisfather thought he was organising the extortion. ... He told his father he had to give him what ""they"", the bikies, wanted. At this, his father hit him. He said he reacted. He lost his temper and knocked him out. He believed he had no choice. ... His father was not going to to listen and give the bikies anything. He thought his mother was going to die. He decided he had to kill his father to save his mother. He hit his father in the throat and suffocated him. At the time he was scared for his mother. He did not know what else to do. He had to kill his father to save his mother.
Afterwards he felt scared his mother might find the body, have a heart attack and a nervous breakdown. He put the body in the car and took it to the shopping centre. He left the car there. He thought the police might find the car. He did not want his father to be in the car for too long. He was hoping they would find him. He did not want to kill himself. At the time he thought bikies were coming after him and he needed to kill himself to save family and friends. He thought, if he came to gaol, the bikies would kill him in gaol.
He thought of an alibi. He walked back home. He went to theneighbours and told them his car had broken down and he needed to use their phone. On the way to the neighbours he thought he was being followed. He knocked on the neighbour's door with the intention of making a phone call to his father to establish an alibi. He believed he had to get away. The bikies were coming after him.
...
As the neighbours let him into the house he noticed that there was a blue car he saw following him and turn into the street. He rushed into the house hoping that they did not see him.  He was distressed at having just killed his father and was anxious. He went to the toilet and borrowed a phone. He felt nervous and scared. He was unsure what to say. He said the lady came up and grabbed him. He panicked and reacted. He hit her in the face. The lady and the girl started screaming. He thought the girl pushed him in the back. At that time he thought it was the people from the car who had come to kill him. ... He grabbed the knife, swung around and lashed out with the knife. He recalled he was slashing. At the time he thought he was slashing people from the car. He was scared for his life. The girl and the mother stopped screaming and he noticed there was blood and realised what he had done. He then ran out of the house and went to his sister-in-law to grab his wallet and things. He drove to a camping spot to hide from the police. He stated, 'I thought they'd put me in gaol and I was going to get killed.'""
269Dr Allnutt said (at T366 L41-L48) that the appellant's reference to driving to a spot to hide from police indicated an understanding on his part that what he had done could be considered by others as being wrong.
270Dr Allnutt's report continued (commencing at T366 L50):
""He was unable to sleep at night. All he could see were images of what he had done, they haunted him.
On the Saturday, he decided he was going to kill himself. He left the camping spot on the Saturday afternoon. He wrote a letter to the police. He stayed on the side of the highway. He did not sleep that night. He was nervous and anxious at having to kill himself.
He handed a note to the hospital in the morning, he gave it to a nurse at the front desk, a note saying how sorry he was. He went and got petrol, he came back to the hospital afterwards, he doused himself with petrol, he said a prayer and torched himself. He recalled being dragged out of the car by police. He was taken to hospital. He spent 3 months in the Burn Unit and then admitted to Long Bay Hospital for 1 month before coming to the MSPC. At the time he said, 'I was saving my mother' and he did not think that at the time that he attacked the other victims that they were the victims and he had no intention to kill them.""
271Under the heading ""Current Clinical Issues"" Dr Allnutt reported in the following terms (commencing at T367 L26):
""At the time that I saw him, he was feeling better. He was not experiencing any voices. He had last heard a voice at the time of the alleged offence and for a brief period afterwards. He had last heard voices in hospital where he continued to think the bikies were after him. He denied any visions, tastes or smells. He now did not think bikies were after him and he saw it as having occurred in his dreams. He denied that he was receiving any messages from the TV, the radio or the newspaper. He had an anxious mood. His sleep was adequate on the Avanza. He had reasonable appetite, energy and motivation and good concentration. His self-esteem was poor and he was depressed about what he had done. He maintained an interest in reading. He found pleasure in some things. He denied suicidal ideation plan or intent. He was not experiencing any panic attacks. He had last used drugs the night before the alleged offence when he had used alcohol. On the night before the offence he had used cannabis to try to get to sleep. He had smoked a fair bit, he was not sure how much, he had done this to reduce his anxiety.
He had not suffered any new medical problems. The most significant stressor impacting on him was the Court case. He denied at the time that he saw me he was experiencing irritability or short-temperedness. There had been no conflicts or aggression. He accepted that he had a mental illness, schizophrenia, and needed medication. He said he would continue to take the medication. He understood the risks of substances that had increased his anxiety and the voices and that he needed to avoid substances. With regard to the alleged offence, he said he was very sorry for what had happened. He had difficulty living with what he had done and he said he did not mean to harm the girl or the mother.""
272Dr Allnutt noted (at T368 L22) that the only occasion on which the appellant had indicated an attempt to kill himself was on the day of his arrest when he set fire to himself and cut his wrist.  The appellant also denied any knowledge of family history of mental illness.
273Dr Allnutt then conducted an examination of the appellant's mental status and reported (commencing at T370 L13):
""He presented as cooperative and fairly well-groomed; his speech was clear, coherent, soft and monotonous; his affect was restricted; he was clearly anxious during the interview and upset; he spoke in a clear and coherent manner; he maintained good eye contact; he did not manifest behaviour suggestive of either side effect psychiatric medication or neurological illness; he did not endorse any significant new or anxiety symptoms; and he denied any overt psychotic symptoms; he did not manifest significant intellectual impairment; his capacity for insight and judgment was adequate.""
274Dr Allnutt then proceeded to express a number of opinions concerning the appellant.  The first was an opinion in relation to psychiatric illness which was in the following terms (commencing at T370 L38):
""At the time that I saw the accused, he was not manifesting significant active symptoms of psychosis. He did, however, provide a history of cannabis for 2 to 3 years prior to the alleged offence as well as a relatively significant abuse of substances over a fairly lengthy period of time consistent with probable substance abuse disorder.
He lived a relatively unstable lifestyle, commuting between Sydney and Brisbane. In about August 2009, while playing pokies, he described developing a belief that bikies were in some way plotting to harm him and his family. He described and recalls being approached in September 2009 and October 2009 by members of this bikie group, in particular, the president named Boris, who said he was going to kill him and his father and torture his mother if his father did not give them what they wanted, namely money and the house.
He described these two meetings in interview with me as being a dream. He described subsequently becoming aware of people following him in the street and holding the belief that if he did not do what Boris had told him to do by Christmas, then his mother was going to suffer. There was evidence that he had disclosed these beliefs to a number of people in the time preceding the alleged offence and evidence to suggest that while he was a member of a bikie gang this had happened more than 15 years ago and that the gang had subsequently disbanded.
The symptoms described would be consistent with symptoms of a systematised persecutory delusional system probably due to paranoid schizophrenia. He derives from a relatively loving and supportive familial environment. He appears to have been relatively dependent on his parents for a number of years. He achieved sixth form at school and denied behaviour consistent with conduct disorder and was able to pursue gainful employment until he suffered a motor vehicle accident in about 1990, whereupon he was essentially on a disability support pension which likely aggravated his dependence on his parents. He hasbeen capable of interpersonal relationships but has not pursued a relationship for a fairly lengthy period of time. At this stage he does manifest, in my view, some evidence for dysfunctional personality traits. But I would not, at this stage, conclude a personality disorder.
He provides a history of substance abuse since age 18, including cannabis and speed which continued to date with periods of rehabilitation but no maintenance, but most predominantly alcohol, consistent with a likely alcohol dependence disorder. He was not manifesting any major medical problems when he saw me but I did not formally physical examine him. The most significant stressor impacting on him at the time that he saw me related to the current charges. His functioning appeared to be reasonable at the time that he saw me.""
275Dr Allnutt then proceeded to express his opinion regarding the appellant's mental state at the time of the offending (commencing at T371 L42):
""He describes the onset of a belief that he was in some way beingpersecuted by bikies in the context of witnessing certain interactions between individuals that occurred when he was playing pokies in August 2009.
He describes then having had an interaction with a person called Boris and members of a bikie gang in September and October 2009 which, in retrospect, he describes as a dream. He went on to describe developing a belief that his phone has been tapped, that cars were following him and that he was having conversations in his head. These symptoms would be consistent with a persecutionary delusional belief and, as such, there would be reasonable grounds to conclude that he was suffering from a psychosis and thus a disease of the mind at the material time that the alleged offending occurred.
It seems that in the context of his persecutory belief system he started carrying a knife.
...
He became increasingly anxious that if he went to police morepeople would die and Boris would kill his family so he did not go tothe police and subsequently saw no options for himself feelingtrapped. He formed the view that people were coming for his familyand believed that time was running out for him and he needed to actin order to protect his mother.""
276Dr Allnutt then dealt with the death of the appellant's father and stated (commencing at T372 L31):
""He stated he went to see his father on the day of the alleged offence in an attempt to have his father comply with the bikies' demands. In the context of this he had an argument with his father. After hitting his father to the ground, he determined that the best thing to do to save his mother would be to kill his father. Thereafter he took his father's body in the car to a shopping centre hoping it would be found and then further determined he would try and establish an alibi.
With regard to the behaviours leading to the death of his father, inmy opinion at the material time that the alleged offence occurred he was suffering a disease of the mind which was of a nature and severity that it severely impacted on his capacity to make rational decisions with regard to his father and was thus experiencing a defect of reason. With regard to the behaviours leading to the deathof his father, it is unlikely that the defect of reason was such that it significantly compromised his capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions.""
277Dr Allnutt agreed (commencing T372 L50) that his opinion was that there was a defect of reason because the appellant was suffering a disease of the mind which severely impaired his capacity to make rational decisions regarding his father.  He said (commencing at T373 L6) that despite holding that view, it was his opinion that the appellant nonetheless appreciated the nature and quality of the physical act in relation to the death of his father, in the sense that he had the capacity to understand that if he hit somebody or strangled them or stabbed them, that he could potentially seriously harm, if not kill, them.
278Dr Allnutt (commencing at T373 L20) went on to consider the question of whether, as a result of a defect of reasoning due to a disease of the mind, the appellant was capable of knowing that his actions in relation to his father were wrong.  In this regard he reported (commencing at T373 L28):
""However, with regard to the death of his father, given that he incorporated his father and other members of his family, mostprominently his mother, into his delusional system, he would havebeen compromised in his capacity to make rational decisions in relation to both of them. In addition to that, it appears that he had irrationally determined, due to his delusions of persecution, that he had no option but to kill his father in order to save his mother andthat given his circumstances, having regard to his delusional world, this was the better option, from his perspective, and in that sense the right thing to do.
In my opinion, under these circumstances he would have beenunable to reason about the matter of wrongfulness in relation to hisbehaviour towards his father with a reasonable degree of sense of composure, and in regard to the behaviour leading to the death of his father is available as a defence of mental illness [sic].""
279Dr Allnutt was then asked (at T373 L45):
""Q. In that regard, in your opinion as to his suffering disease of the mind which results in a defect of reason, that is on the basis of what he has believed about bikies is all a delusion, it's not real, it's a delusion; is that right? A. That's correct.
Q. So on the assumption that it is a delusion and was not real, then you come to the view he has a disease of mind; correct? A. Yes.""
280Dr Allnutt gave evidence (T374) that in his opinion not wanting to be arrested and put in gaol was consistent with an understanding on the part of the appellant that what he did was wrong.  He also expressed the view that intending to create an alibi or divert attention from himself as being the perpetrator of his father's death was consistent with the appellant having such understanding.
281Dr Allnutt expressed the view that the appellant's defect of reasoning in respect of wrongfulness was that on the basis of his delusions, he felt that he was morally right to do what he did to his father because it would save his mother (such that because he was saving someone else, he believed that what he did was not wrong in his own mind).
282The evidence of Dr Allnutt then moved to the circumstances surrounding the death EW and the injury inflicted to VW.  Dr Allnutt (commencing at T374 L36) set out the history that he had been given in this regard.  Dr Allnutt was then asked (commencing at T375 L38):
""Q. You noted, however, that the evidence suggests the behaviour that led to the death of [EW] and the attack on [VW] was in some way impulsive or reactive to circumstances? A. Yes.
Q. Did you come to an opinion that if it was accepted that when he entered the house he believed he had been followed and that at least a person had pushed him in the house, or he was pushed and he believed that person was from the car, then he has in some way incorporated those persons into his delusion, is that the situation?A. Yes. 
Q. And as part of that delusion, do you consider the issue of mental illness is a live issue then? A. Yes.
Q. Would it be though in relation to considering that that he still knew the nature and quality of the physical act when he was attacking the two persons in the house? A. Yes.
Q. But are you saying if he believed they became incorporated into the delusion by in some way being associated with those that were attacking him, then that would affect his ability to know or rationalise what he was doing was wrong? A. Yes.
Q. Can your opinion vary if there is consideration of some other rational explanation to the way he acted, that is, an explanation of someone trying to divert attention from themselves or what he had done to his father? A. Yes, there can be a rational explanation.
Q. And that can affect the opinion? A. Yes.
Q. So again it depends on what facts are accepted or assumed for this purpose, is that right? A. Yes.
Q. At least in relation to the death of [EW], depending on the facts assumed, did you then consider whether the defence of substantial impairment, or at least that part of it where his delusions, if he was suffering them, in any way affected his capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself? A. I put that as an option. I thought that it was a difficult determination to make because the facts weren't entirely clear as to what actually occurred at that time.
Q. In effect in your first report there was some issues because of concerns about the facts relating to the neighbours, is that correct? A. Yes, I think that was relatively less clear to me than the first series of events.""
The second report of Dr Allnutt
283Dr Allnutt carried out a second evaluation of the appellant on 22 September 2011 and provided a report of 30 September 2011.  On that occasion, the appellant had provided him with some further detail in relation to the relevant events which were set out by Dr Allnutt (by reading from the report) in the following terms (commencing at T377 L12):
""I undertook a further interview of the accused on 22 September2011. The purpose of this was to further clarify his thoughtprocesses around the material time of the killing of the second victim and the injuring of the third. He said that after killing hisfather he put the body in the car; he was worried that his mother would have had a nervous breakdown if she found the body.
He went to Stocklands and parked the car. On the way there he was thinking that people were going to kill him in gaol. He parkedthe car. He was thinking about an alibi. He decided he would makea phone call to his father. At that point I asked him to explain howthis might provide him with an alibi. He said at that point he couldnot explain but that was his thought at the time. He felt he had to get away.
At the shopping centre he thought the bikies were coming to kill him: that they had told him before that if he did not kill himself they would go after his family and friends. He believed that the bikies wanted him dead and they wanted his father dead.
He decided to go to the neighbours to ring his father. The neighbours were the first people who came into his head which is why he chose them. He had not really met them before. It was athought that came straight to his head. He walked to the neighbours. On the way he was trying to think about what to say. He decided he was going to say his car broke down and he needed to call his father. He thought by ringing his father this would establish a view that at the time he rang him, he did not know he was dead. There was nobody at his home who could witness him making the phone call so he went to the neighbours.
On the way to the neighbours he was anxious, nervous, agitated,because he had just killed his father. He also thought he was being followed on the way to the neighbours. He saw cars driving slowly behind him. He said there was a blue car.
Arriving at the neighbours he knocked on the door.  ... He told [VW] that he needed to use the phone to ringhis father. She opened the door and he thought he saw the sameblue car turning into their street. He panicked and rushed into thehouse. His recollection was that he made a phone call. He said there was a mobile in his hand. She must have given him the mobile. He made a call and the phone just rang.
He thought he was either in the kitchen or the lounge with thedeceased or [VW]. He recalled the deceased sitting in the lounge watching TV. He had no particular thoughts about her at the time. He was standing in the kitchen or the lounge thinking about what to say to [VW].
...
He believed that she went to grab him but then added that it waspossible that she did not grab him but went to grab the phone. Atthe time, however, he panicked and hit her in the face.
...
After he hit VW the thought came to his mind to tiethem up. He needed to get away. He was scared of getting caughtfor his father's murder. He was thinking of tying them up and takingmoney to get away. This was the first time that this thought came to his mind. He needed money to leave the city and get away from the bikies and the police.
...
He thought at this point he felt pushed from behind. At the time hethought this was people in the car coming to kill him. The last timehe saw the girl - that's [EW] - she had been sitting on the lounge. He grabbed his knife and started slashing anything thatmoved. He said at the time he was scared for his life. He denied atthe time that he was being aware that he was slashing the girl,[EW], until the screaming stopped and he saw blood.Until then he thought they were screaming because there was someone coming in the house, the people following him. He realised then what he had done.
He went back to his car and drove to his brother's place and grabbed things and then left for Karuah.  This is a place outside Newcastle, he drove there. On the way he felt panicky and scared. He thought he did not mean to harm [E] and [VW]. He knew he had done wrong then but at the time of the killing and the assault of [E] and [VW] he thought he was protecting himself. He went to the camping spot and hid there for a day.
On the Saturday he drove back to Sydney. He felt sorry for havingkilled the neighbour. He continued, however, to feel that he had nochoice but to kill his father and continued to feel justified in this. His killing his father had been able to keep his mother alive and he had no choice at the time and continued to feel justified in that regard.
At that time he did not continue to feel justified in having attacked[E] and [VW]. He did not need to kill them, he said. He killed [EW] because he thought he was killing people who were following him. He bashed [VW] because she wanted to grab him or she grabbed him and he just panicked. 
He went back to Sydney and went to Fairfield Hospital instead of thepolice because he thought the police would stop him. He handed anote in to say he was sorry and his friend Danny had nothing to dowith it. He went and got petrol. He came back to the hospital andset himself alight. He felt he had to kill himself. He was hoping thatby killing himself he would save his family and friends. He was sorry he had killed people.
I put to him that he had told people that [EW] had ranpast him. He said that when he told people these things after theoffence, his recollection was that it was something that he had assumed.""
284Dr Allnutt's opinion as to the appellant's mental state at the time of killing his father remained the same as it was at the time of his first report.
285Dr Allnutt's second report then turned to the circumstances surrounding the death of EW and the injury to VW as follows:
""Following the death of his father he decided to find a phone so hecould call his father's phone in order to set up an alibi. By calling his father's phone he could give the impression that he was unaware of his father's death. This led him to entering the home of the second set of victims.
He described on the way to the house believing that he was beingfollowed by people who were going to kill him and entering thehouse believing that he saw them turning into a street in which [E] and [VW] lived, at that stage feeling panicked.He describes that upon engaging with [VW], he wasscared and, having used a phone to make a phone call to his father, she gestured towards him that he interpreted as an attempt to grab him and he reacted to this and hit her in the face.
Soon after this he thought he felt someone hitting him in the back which he deduced were people from the car that were following him coming to harm him and potentially kill him and, in response to that, he reacted and slashed. At the material time that he did this, he was not aware that he was attacking [EW] but believed that he was protecting himself against people that he thought had come to harm him and that the screaming that he heard, he thought were the victims screaming about people coming to the house rather than him attacking someone.
The idea of staging some sort of robbery entered his mind after heentered the victim's home. Thus the two motives for entering thevictim's home, to stage a robbery and to establish an alibi, seemedto relate to a progression of his decision-making from the time thathe left the car.
After the incident he persisted in maintaining a strong sense of justification about killing his father but did not feel justified in hisattack on [E] and [VW]. This was because he hadnot incorporated [EW] and [VW] generally into his delusional system as he had his father. However, at the material time that the alleged offending occurred he was in an aroused emotional state, felt trapped, fearful and panicked andbelieved that others were intending to harm him.""
286The above history was recorded by Dr Allnutt based on what he had been told by the appellant.  Based on an assumption that such an account was correct, Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion regarding the appellant's mental state at the time of the death of EW:
""In relation to [EW], when he felt pushed from behind hetemporarily believed that [EW] was someone, or people,coming to kill him; that he reacted in a violent manner believinghimself to be justified in acting in that manner at the time as aconsequence of his delusional belief that he was being attacked byothers and, on this basis in relation to the death of [EW], I believe, on balance, he would be regarded as having available to him a defence of mental illness.""
287Dr Allnutt went on to explain (commencing at T381 L50) that EW had become part of the appellant's delusion. She was perceived by him as somebody who was attacking him and as a consequence of his delusional beliefs, the appellant misconceived what was occurring between the two of them and reacted to those events impulsively, potentially acting in self defence.  In this sense the appellant had, according to Dr Allnutt, temporarily and erroneously incorporated EW into his delusional thinking and had made decisions based on that interpretation (at T382 L10-12).  Dr Allnutt explained that his use of the term ""temporarily"" in that context arose from the fact that even on the appellant's own account, he understood that these persons were not in any way associated with this thinking. 
288Dr Allnutt then moved (commencing at T382 L26) to express an opinion regarding the appellant's mental state at the time of the injury inflicted to VW:
""In relation to [VW], while it does not appear he misperceived her as he had [EW], that is somebody outto kill him, he appears he reacted to a gesture towards him without thought. He was prone to react without thought, that is impulsively, as a consequence of his delusional experiences derived from his disease in the mind and defective reasoning. 
On balance, I believe it would be reasonable to conclude that, onbalance, he has a defence of mental illness in relation to this charge because his disease of the mind caused him to be unable to reason about the matter of the wrongfulness in attacking [EW] [sic] with a reasonable degree of sense and composure as a person with a rational mind would.
Thus, on balance, I believe he would have available to him adefence of mental illness in relation to the offences related to allthree victims.""
289Dr Allnutt again explained that this opinion was based upon an acceptance of the appellant's account to him, and the symptomatology that he described.  He explained (commencing at T383 L4) that there was a ""question"" as to whether the appellant met the test for a mental illness, in the sense that he would probably have had the capacity to think about things.  However, Dr Allnutt went on to explain that the appellant was so pre-occupied by his delusional experience that he never applied that thought.  He concluded (at T383 L7) that whilst it was ""marginal"", the appellant ""probably would have available to him a defence of mental illness"".
290Dr Allnutt explained (at T383 L22) that at the time of his second report he remained of the view that the appellant appreciated the nature and quality of his physical acts committed on E and VW.  He explained (at T383 L31) that it was the second part of the test, namely whether he knew that those acts were wrong, which was the predominant issue.
The third report of Dr Allnutt
291Dr Allnutt was asked to provide a third report and, in doing so, to consider a scenario which was in some respects different to that which had been provided to him by the appellant.  In particular, he was asked to assume the following (commencing at T383 L41):
(i)that the appellant attended a neighbour's house to divert suspicion from himself in relation to the death of his father;
(ii)that he did so by trying to make it appear that there had been a home invasion;
(iii)that included in his thinking at that time was to obtain money so that he could leave the area and not be arrested by the authorities in respect of what had happened to his father;
(iv)that the attack on E and VW was consistent with that intention;
(v)that he took steps after the attack to disturb things in the house to make it appear like a home invasion had taken place;
(vi)that the attacks on E and VW were more than momentary ""slashing type"" attacks;
(vii)that it was open to reject the appellant's assertion that he believed that he had been followed to the house by persons who had made threats previously; and
(viii)that it was open to reject that he mistook EW for an attacker or someone out to harm or kill him.
292Based on these matters, Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion (commencing at T384 L46):
""You've asked me to consider another scenario. If it is acceptedthat at the time of the alleged offence involving his father he wassuffering from symptoms of psychosis in the form of a delusionalbelief that he and/or his family were under threat, then it would be reasonable to conclude that at the material time of the allegedoffence involving [E] and [VW], that there's evidence of delusional beliefs of this nature preceding the offence involving his father."" 
293In evidence, Dr Allnutt was asked to clarify that and he said (commencing at T385 L10):
""If it is accepted that at the time of the alleged offence involving hisfather he was suffering from symptoms of psychosis in the form of a delusional belief that he and/or his family were under threat, then it would be reasonable to conclude that at the material time of the alleged offence involving [E] and [VW], that he was suffering from psychosis.""
294He continued (at T385 L22):
""That there is evidence of delusional beliefs of this nature preceding the offence involving his father and following the offences involving [E] and [VW], given that delusional beliefs, by their nature, usually tend to persist, then it would be reasonable to be of the view that no matter what the scenario was at the time of the alleged offences involving [E] and [VW] was, he would have met criteria to reach the legal definition of disease of the mind and/or underlying condition causing abnormality of mind at the time of the alleged offences involving [E] and [VW]."" 
295Dr Allnutt expressed the view (at T385 L37) that if it were accepted that the appellant was psychotic at the time that he killed his father, then he likely would have been psychotic at the time of the offences involving E and VW.
296Dr Allnutt then set out the various assumptions that he had been asked to make (set out above) and reported as follows (commencing at T386 L17):
""Under this scenario, if it is accepted that he was, notwithstanding this, experiencing psychosis and thus a disease of the mind, he would be regarded as having a defect of reason because psychosis is a mental condition that, by its nature, causes a defect of reasoning. The issue would be whether or not the defect of reasoning was, specifically in relation to [EW] and [VW], of a nature and severity that it significantly impacted on his capacity to know the wrongfulness of his actions as it pertained to [E] and [VW]. This is because it is clinically feasible that a person with psychosis can reason defectively about one situation of a person and not another and thus it's reasonable to consider the issue separately from the offence involving his father.
In my view it is unlikely that under the scenario, his defect of reason was of a nature and severity that it significantly impaired his capacity to know the nature and consequence of his actions.""
297He explained that this opinion was applicable equally to the circumstances surrounding the offences committed on both E and VW.  
298Dr Allnutt then addressed the issue of wrongfulness (commencing at T386 L44):
""The issue here is whether or not his defect of reason was of a nature and severity that he was unable to know the wrongfulness of his actions at the time of the offence involving his father, he was of the delusional belief that he and his family were under threat and had had beliefs that he was being followed by his persecutors. The propensity to continue to hold this belief would still have been there at the time of the offence involving [E] and [VW].
While he was aware that what he had done to his father was wrong at the time that he entered the home of the second set of victims, in my opinion this was in a sense that he understood it to have been wrong in the eyes of others and in the legal sense that the evidence suggests that he remained of the view that he had done the right thing in a moral sense and this is the basis for my argument that he had, on balance, a defence of mental illness in regard to his father.
This difficulty in reasoning about wrongfulness would have persisted at the time that he entered the home of [E] and [VW]. His reasoning capacity, at least as it pertained to the death of his father, remained impaired by his on-going delusional beliefs and thus he was still vulnerable to impaired reasoning at the time of the alleged offences involving [E] and [VW].
There is, however, evidence of thoughts, actions and feelings of guilt and regret, in particular to [E] and [VW], which suggests some degree of awareness of wrongfulness. If thescenario was that he attended the neighbour's house to divertsuspicion from himself in relation to the death of his father in trying to make it appear to be a home invasion for the purposes of obtaining money so he could leave the area and not be arrested by authorities in respect of his father, and that the attack on [E] and [VW] was consistent with that intention and that he took steps to make it appear that there had been a home invasion, and that the accused inflicted significant injuries on both victims other than slashing of their throats, and that the attack was more than momentary, and it is rejected that at the time the accused actively believed that he was being followed to the house and it is rejected that the accused mistook [EW] to be the attacker out to kill him, then I do not believe that a defence of mental illness would be available to him.
While he was probably anxious, emotionally aroused and paranoidabout his situation, the motive was rational to avoid recognition, detection and arrest by police. The behaviour planned [sic]. He would not be regarded as having involved the victims directly into his delusional belief system and that was thus likely to have known the wrongfulness of his actions in a legal sense and, having regard to his strong sense of guilt about events afterwards, likely had knowledge of moral wrongfulness of his actions.
This scenario would also support the conclusion as it pertained to[E] and [VW], that he likely retained capacity tounderstand events as it pertained to those victims, judge right from wrong in regard to those victims and control his actions, given the pre-planning, and the defence of such substantial impairment would be unlikely to be available to him.
And that's, in particular, substantial impairment to [EW], not [VW].""
299Dr Allnutt then continued (at T388 L28):
""If the scenario was that he attended the neighbour's house to divert suspicion from himself in relation to the death of his father in tryingto make it appear to be a home invasion and for the purposes ofobtaining money so he could leave the area and not be arrested by authorities in respect to his father, that it is rejected that at the time the accused actively believed that he had been followed to the house, and it is rejected that the accused mistook [EW] to be the attacker out to kill them, that the accused inflicted significantinjuries on both victims other than the slashing of their throats, and that the attack was more than momentary but that killing the occupants was not part of his initial plan at the time he entered, that it was only after he entered the home that the idea of the attacking or killing them occurred, then the issue is less clear.
A defence of mental illness is raised in a manner described in myprior report, that is, not being able to reason with a reasonabledegree of sense of composure due to panic derived from delusions, but in relation to [EW] the defence of substantial impairment may also be applicable, his mental state could have impaired his capacity to control his actions because he could have acted impulsively in a panic due to his delusions.
...
If the scenario was that he attended the neighbour's house to divert suspicion from himself in relation to the death of his father in trying to make it appear to be a home invasion and for the purposes of obtaining money so he could leave the area and not be arrested by authorities in respect of his father, that the accused inflicted significant injuries on both victims other than the slashing of their throats, and the attack was more than momentary, that it is rejected that at the time that the accused actively believed he had been followed to the house, and it is rejected that the accused mistook [EW] to be the attacker out to kill him, but that the underlying motive was he was seeking a way to avoid further harm to his family by others and thought he was going to be killed in gaol, if arrested, due to delusional beliefs and thus an irrational motive, then a defence of substantial impairment is raised in that he entered the home with the impairment in his capacity to understand events and, to some degree, felt justified-
...
Determining the threshold of the applicability of a mental illness orsubstantial impairment can be challenging. The accused hasprovided varied accounts, at times less detailed than others, which scenario, and there are likely others, is factually acceptable and which defence is acceptable, is applicable, is a matter for the Court.""
Cross-examination of Dr Allnutt
300Dr Allnutt agreed (commencing at T396 L47) that it was not uncommon for people, when recovering from, or even when still in, a state of psychosis, to have difficulty in providing an explanation for their actions.  He also explained that it was not uncommon for people, when they found themselves in difficult positions, to try and rationalise such positions in a way which was more palatable to the listener.  He agreed that the appellant was psychotic but took the view that he could fall into either of the categories which had been described.  
301He agreed (commencing at T397 L30) that going to a neighbour's house right next to where the crime had been committed to make a phone call, in order to set up a scenario that he was trying to telephone his father, did not make sense.  He took the view that wanting to establish an alibi was a relatively rational decision, but that trying to establish an alibi by killing other people, was irrational.
302Dr Allnutt accepted (commencing at T398 L5) that at the time that he approached the neighbour's premises, the appellant was vulnerable to the symptoms of his disease of the mind, that he was suffering from a defect of reason, and he was vulnerable to being deprived of a sensible appreciation and understanding of the unreality of his situation.
303He explained (commencing at T400 L14) that psychosis was characterised by hallucinations and delusions causing a person to see and hear things which did not exist and leading to a perception of reality which was non-existent.  He also agreed (at T401 L29) that a person labouring under an acute psychosis can behave in ways that are altogether uncharacteristic and that they perceive the actions of others in a way which is not reality based and are prone to misinterpret the actions of others.
304Dr Allnutt also explained (commencing at T403 L40) that expressions of remorse post the event were not inconsistent with a mentally ill person who was unable to reason with sense and composure at the relevant time.
305Dr Allnutt said (commencing at T404 L30) that the evidence established that the appellant was psychotic both before and after the offences.  He explained that his opinion that the appellant was psychotic did not arise from the fact the appellant had killed his father a short time before he attacked the Ws.  He explained that there was a long history of mental illness and that in stating his opinion that the appellant was psychotic at the time the offence occurred, he was talking about a period of days weeks or months before hand.  He explained (at T405 L3) that having regard to that opinion he accepted that the defence of mental illness was available to the appellant in relation to the acts giving rise to the offences concerning E and VW.
306Dr Allnutt also explained (commencing at T405 L12) that in making a determin",2014-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764957,El-Helou v R [2014] NSWCCA 209,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  On 10 July 2009 the appellant was sentenced by Solomon DCJ to a total term of imprisonment of 10 years and 6 months commencing on 11 July 2008, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.  He had pleaded guilty to an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) of knowingly taking part in the supply of the prohibited drug pseudoephedrine in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to pseudoephedrine.  The applicable maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 5,000 penalty units, with the prescribed standard non-parole period being 15 years.
2On 21 May 2010 this Court allowed a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence and re-sentenced the appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years commencing on 11 July 2008, with a non-parole period of 8 years (R v El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111). 
3On 1 June 2012 Solomon DCJ sentenced Mr Constantine Anagnostopoulos (the ""co-offender"") in respect of an offence, of which he had also pleaded guilty, of supply of pseudoephedrine.  The offence related to two distinct acts of supply of differing quantities of the drug, one being that to which the appellant's sentence related.  The co-offender was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years 9 months, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months commencing on 11 July 2008.  That sentence was wholly concurrent with his sentences for related offences of drug importation and dealing with the proceeds of crime, imposed by Hock DCJ on 16 December 2010.
4The appellant's sentence is presently before the Court for consideration as the result of an order made on 7 February 2014 by Button J sitting in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court that ""the whole case"", being the appellant's sentence, be referred to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The order was made pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) as a result of his Honour concluding, in accordance with s 79(2) of that Act, that he had a ""doubt or question"" about a ""mitigating feature"" of the sentence imposed upon the appellant, this feature being whether the appellant could have a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed by Solomon DCJ on the co-offender.
5Before this Court, the appellant relied first upon the parity ground to which Button J referred.  Secondly, he tendered, without objection from the Crown, the transcript of a lawfully intercepted telephone conversation between the appellant and the co-offender to support a submission that the appellant's criminality was not as great as that found by Solomon DCJ.  Thirdly, the appellant contended that his re-sentencing by this Court on 21 May 2010 miscarried because the Court applied its earlier decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 which was subsequently overruled by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
THE DRUG IMPORTATION AND SUPPLY
6The drugs that were the subject of the appellant's offence formed part of a shipment of 3,698,131 tablets of pseudoephedrine which the Statement of Facts tendered in the sentence proceedings stated ""is usually converted to Methylamphetamine (commonly known as 'Meth' or 'ice') via different reactions in illicit clandestine laboratories"".  The drugs were imported from Thailand in two shipping containers and comprised three consignments having a total gross weight of 839.4436 kilograms and 177.4434 kilograms pure weight.
7The first consignment, of about 582 kilograms gross weight and 117 kilograms pure weight, comprised 10 crates.  The Statement of Facts stated that the consignment could have yielded between 66 and 108 kilograms of ""Meth"" with a possible street value of between $10,560,000 and $19,440,000.  Prior to their delivery, the Australian Customs Service ascertained that the crates contained illegal drugs and the Australian Federal Police replaced them with inert material.
8About six months prior to the shipment's arrival, the co-offender instructed a customs broker to act on the importation.  On about 25 June 2008 the broker notified the co-offender of the shipment's impending arrival and arranged for its clearance by Customs.  In early July the co-offender sent a number of emails to the customs broker confirming payment for the delivery and the delivery address.  After initial delivery of the first consignment to the premises of a transport company, the co-offender arranged for six of its crates to be delivered on 11 July 2008 to a garage at the appellant's residence.  During that day, the co-offender and the appellant unloaded and unpacked the crates.  
9Immediately before the police entered the garage and arrested them on the afternoon of 11 July 2008, the appellant and a person later identified as Craig Earnshaw had a conversation at about 2.35 pm that was recorded.  The conversation included statements by the appellant as follows:
""Yeah, fifteen million dollars worth here this morning"".""He shit himself.  I had five hundred kilo's it's all, it's all, it's all been changed"".""It's all fake.  All bullshit.  Here taste that.  Is that, is that, is that Sudafed?""""There was fifteen mill here this morning"".""We've already been approved from Lebanon.  I'm not ... (indistinct) ... today.  Gaby's, Gaby's [the appellant's uncle], got one in the garage [the second consignment comprising four crates had been delivered to the appellant's uncle].  He's getting watched.  His house is getting watched.  They fucked it completely it's all been changed.  Everything's been changed""""Listen, I stashed five kilos at my house, a hundred grand just for me by myself and then this ... (indistinct) ... ""
THE APPELLANT'S SENTENCING
The appellant's sentencing by Solomon DCJ on 10 July 2009
10The sentencing judge's remarks included the following:
""As to the role played by the offender, I am satisfied on the evidence before me that he was a transporter of the drugs, that he was a warehouser of the drugs and that he was to be the deliverer of the drugs to persons within the organisation.  I am not satisfied that the offender was involved in the planning of the importation or in the planning of the distribution.  I am satisfied that the offender and his involvement with the drugs lasted two days.
The offender has given evidence as to his involvement.  He has given evidence that he believed the drugs with which he was to deal were steroids and that he was to be paid the sum of $2,000 to transport, warehouse and deliver the drugs to other persons.  I reject that evidence.  The drugs were of great value and I cannot accept the offender's evidence that he was merely to receive $2,000 for his involvement.  Additionally, I do not accept the offender's evidence that he only shortly before conversations were recorded became aware that the drug in question was pseudoephedrine.  The conversations as recorded indicate a deep knowledge by the offender of the drug's importation and the value of the drugs warehoused by him.
On considering the drug, the quantity of the drug and the offender's role, I am satisfied that the objective criminality of the offender is above the midrange of seriousness for the offence"".
11His Honour considered that the appellant was not frank with a forensic psychiatrist who interviewed him because the appellant told the psychiatrist that he believed the drugs were steroids.  As the appellant had no drug or alcohol problems, his Honour concluded that he was involved in the offence purely for profit but his Honour did not have sufficient evidence before him to make a finding as to the appellant's likely reward.
12His Honour noted a number of favourable references tendered by the appellant, that the appellant had no criminal record of relevance and that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.  His Honour allowed a utilitarian discount of 25% for the early plea and made a finding of special circumstances based on the appellant's age (24 when arrested), the fact that this was to be his first custodial sentence and his good prospects for rehabilitation.  As noted above, his Honour sentenced the appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 10 years and 6 months commencing on 11 July 2008, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.
The appellant's re-sentencing by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 21 May 2010
13The Court found that the sentencing judge had not had ""any real regard to the standard non-parole period"" (here, of 15 years) as required by R v Way and observed:
""81 Whilst the mere quantity of the drug may not generally be the chief factor to be taken into account, it retains significance: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584. Here, the amount of the drug (whether calculated by its admixture - over 250 kgs or by its pure form - 50 kgs) called for a sentence that 'reflected that enormity': Woodgate v R [2009] NSWCCA 137 at [32]; Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 257.
82 It is to be recalled that in Wong, at [132] the Chief Justice said that the courts have consistently refused to treat couriers or others low in the hierarchy of organisation involved in drug importation with the leniency that is sometimes appropriate in the case of other offences. The same approach should apply to supply under s 25(2). It is also to be recognised that a clear earlier record has less significance in drug trafficking than other crimes ... "".
14Balancing the appellant's personal circumstances and his early plea of guilty against ""the objective seriousness of the offence being above the mid-range and the statutory guideposts of a 15 year non-parole period for a mid-range offence and a maximum term of life imprisonment"", this Court re-sentenced the appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years commencing on 11 July 2008, with a non-parole period of 8 years.
THE CO-OFFENDER'S SENTENCING
The co-offender's sentencing by Hock DCJ on 16 December 2010
15Hock DCJ sentenced the co-offender for an offence of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor, namely, pseudoephedrine, contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime, being money worth $100,000 or more (s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code).  
16In relation to the first offence, her Honour found, in summary, that between 15 January 2008 and 11 July 2008, the co-offender made arrangements for the importation of the first consignment to which I have referred above in [7], containing a pure weight of 117.70 kilograms of pseudoephedrine.  The appellant's offence related to six of the ten crates of this consignment.  The second offence for which Hock DCJ sentenced the co-offender related to a sum of approximately $230,000 found in the co-offender's home after his arrest.
17Her Honour allowed a 35% discount to reflect the co-offender's early plea of guilty and the assistance he provided to authorities.  She then sentenced him to imprisonment for 11 years for the importation offence and 4 years and 6 months for the proceeds of crime offence, both dating from 11 July 2008.  Her Honour set a single non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.
The co-offender's sentencing by Solomon DCJ on 1 June 2012
18The co-offender was sentenced in respect of an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 of supplying 582 kilograms of pseudoephedrine, being the 10 crates of the first consignment to which I have referred in [7] above.  The sentencing judge referred to two distinct acts of supply.  The first was the supply on 10 July 2008 in four crates of 323 kilograms of the substance which the co-offender believed to be pseudoephedrine.  The second was the supply to the appellant on 11 July 2008 of 259 kilograms of that substance in the remaining six crates of the shipment. 
19His Honour concluded:
""I find that on 11 July 2008 the offender assisted Gary Matthew El-Helou with the breaking open of the crates in order to access what he believed to be pseudoephedrine.  I am satisfied that the offender played a crucial and necessary role in what can be described as a large-scale commercial supply.  He was responsible within the operation for the warehousing and distribution of a very significant quantity of drugs, for which he was to receive a substantial payment. I find the offence to be above the mid-range of seriousness for the offence"".
20His Honour found that the co-offender had no criminal record and was a person of good character, and allowed a 25% discount on sentence to reflect the co-offender's plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities. 
21In considering the question of parity with the sentence imposed on the appellant by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 21 May 2010, his Honour observed that the Court's decision may have been different had it been made after the decision in Muldrock.  In this context, his Honour also had regard to the fact that the co-offender was involved in two discrete acts of supply and found special circumstances justifying a variation of the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence.
22For these reasons, his Honour imposed a total sentence of 12 years and 9 months commencing on 11 July 2008, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months. 
23His Honour concluded that, because the offences were connected, the sentence to be imposed should be concurrent with those imposed by Hock DCJ on 16 December 2010 to the extent of those sentences.  The additional sentence imposed by Solomon DCJ (not being concurrent with the lesser sentences imposed by Hock DCJ) was one year and nine months, with the additional non-parole period being two years.
GROUND 1:  THE APPELLANT HAS A JUSTIFIABLE SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AS A RESULT OF THE SENTENCE IMPOSED ON THE CO-OFFENDER CONSTANTINE ANAGNOSTOPOULOS
24In Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ referred as follows to the parity principle upon which the appellant relies:
""28. ... Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is 'a reflection of the notion of equal justice' and 'is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice'. It finds expression in the 'parity principle' which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of 'equal justice', which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.
...
32. A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive ... "" (Citations omitted).
25Their Honours went on to say that whether or not a sentence can be reduced on the ground of disparity to a level which, had there been no disparity, would have been regarded as erroneously lenient, the court's discretion does not require it to consider reducing a sentence to a level which would be ""an affront to the proper administration of justice"" (at [33]; see also Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 at [50] and [67]; Ngati v R [2013] NSWCCA 203 at [80]).  
26As Mason J put it in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 613:
""... [t]he justification which the courts assign for intervention in the case of disparity is that disparity engenders a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant and an appearance of injustice to that impassive representative of the community, the objective bystander"".
27Further, in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301, Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed that ""[e]qual justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them"".  The Court may entertain a complaint based on the parity principle even though the co-offender was sentenced, as here, after the appellant (Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376 at 377). 
28The total term of imprisonment to which the co-offender was sentenced for his supply offence exceeded that to which the appellant was sentenced by nine months, with the difference in the non-parole periods being six months.  As the Crown submitted, these differences cannot be regarded as inconsequential.  Nevertheless, they do not in my view reflect the following very significant differences between the appellant's and co-offender's offences and circumstances.
29First there is the feature, absent in the appellant's case, of the concurrence of the co-offender's supply offence sentence with that imposed upon him for his related importation offence.  It is also concurrent with his sentence for the proceeds of crime offence.  The co-offender's additional head sentence attributable to his conviction on the supply charge is 1 year and 9 months, as the remainder of that sentence is concurrent with that for the importation offence (and with the proceeds of crime offence).  Likewise, his non-parole period was extended by only two years as a result of his supply offence.
30In comparing the sentences imposed upon the appellant and the co-offender regard must be had to the actual period that each is to serve by reason of his commission of the common offence (Postiglione at 301-2, 303 and 343).  This does not mean that there should be a simple comparison between the appellant's head sentence of 12 years imprisonment and the additional period of 1 year and 9 months that the co-offender is required to serve by reason of the common offence.  Such a ""merely arithmetical comparison"" would not be appropriate (Tran v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 266 at [24] and see Ayik v R [2013] NSWCCA 119 at [33]).  Nevertheless, the limited length of the additional sentence imposed upon the co-offender is a significant matter to consider in assessing whether the appellant would have a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the sentences imposed upon him and the co-offender (see R v Freeman [2005] NSWCCA 460 at [20]-[23]; Bell v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 206 at [37]-[40]).
31Another way of looking at the issue is that the co-offender's overall head sentence of 12 years and 9 months effectively reflected the co-offender's offence of importation as well as that of supply, whereas the applicant's head sentence of 12 years related only to his offence of supply.  
32Secondly, the co-offender's supply offence involved two distinct acts of supply, both involving substantial quantities of drugs, whereas the appellant's involved only one.  The co-offender's offence related to a gross weight of 582 kilograms of pseudoephedrine, whilst the appellant's related to a gross weight of 259 kilograms.  
33The weight of drugs involved in an offence cannot generally be regarded as the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence for drug importation and supply (Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [67]-[70]).  However it may be of significance in particular cases and was so regarded by this Court when re-sentencing the appellant ([2010] NSWCCA 111 at [81] - see [13] above).  This Court said in that context that it was necessary that the appellant's sentence ""reflected that enormity"", referring to the large quantity of drugs the subject of the appellant's offence.
34As the appellant submitted on this appeal, if the quantity of drugs involved in his offence was of such importance in the determination of his sentence, logically the much greater quantity involved in the co-offender's supply offence (more than double) should be reflected in the differences between their sentences. 
35The third difference relates to the roles played by the appellant and the co-offender.  I leave out of account for the present the additional evidence that the appellant relies upon under ground 2.  I acknowledge and take into account that the matters to which I refer in relation to this difference overlap to some extent with matters to which I have referred in relation to the first difference.
36Solomon DCJ sentenced the appellant on the basis that the appellant had ""deep knowledge ... of the drug's importation and the value of the drugs warehoused by him"" (see [10] above).  This Court did not interfere with that finding on appeal and it thus formed one of the bases upon which the Court re-sentenced the appellant.  However, the finding did not involve any conclusion as to the source of the appellant's knowledge and the circumstances in which he acquired it.  Thus there was no finding that the appellant obtained possession of the substance substituted for drugs in the context of a broader criminal enterprise in which he was also involved.  In contrast, it is clear that the co-offender's possession was of that character because of his involvement in the importation of the drugs and the supply of another parcel of the substance substituted for them.  
37Whilst the co-offender's criminality in relation to the supply offence could not be regarded as embracing the importation, for which a separate charge could be, and was, laid, it was permissible to have regard to it in considering the context in which his supply offence occurred.  As Hall J observed in Tu v R [2011] NSWCCA 31; 205 A Crim R 566 at [74]:
"" ... the possession if obtained in the context of a criminal narcotic venture may be different from possession obtained in unplanned or unsophisticated circumstances.  In this way, the overall context becomes pertinent to an assessment of the culpability of an accused for an offence of possession by seeing it in its context ... [so that] the circumstances relating to the process of importation may also be relevant to a charge of possession ..."".
38Consistently with this, Adams J (with the concurrence of Hoeben CJ at CL and Hall J) concluded in Balloey v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 165 at [31]:
""In the present case, so far as the judge used the evidence as to the appellant's involvement in the overall transaction to identify the particular nature of the conduct constituting the offence of attempting to possess the drug to determine the degree of his moral culpability and conclude it was of a high order ... , his Honour committed no error"".
Conclusion
39In my view, a reasonable bystander would consider that the appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance that the sentences imposed on him and the co-offender for their supply offences do not reflect the marked differences, to which I have referred, between their respective offences and circumstances particularly, as I have said, when the co-offender's sentence was made concurrent with that for his importation offence and the co-offender's supply offence sentence concerned two distinct acts of supply, whereas that of the appellant concerned only one.  The fact that the difference between their supply offence sentences is only limited cannot rationally be explained by reference to the subjective cases of the appellant and the co-offender.  No presently significant difference exists in that context.  
40I do not consider that the co-offender's sentence was unduly lenient or that to reduce the appellant's sentence would be ""an affront to the proper administration of justice"" (see [25] above).  In these circumstances, I do not see any reason why the Court should not intervene in relation to the appellant's sentence.  As I have indicated, there are in fact good reasons why it should.
41Ground 1 accordingly succeeds and the appellant should be re-sentenced.  
GROUND 2:  A LESSER SENTENCE IS WARRANTED AT LAW BASED ON EVIDENCE OF THE APPELLANT'S ROLE THAT WAS NOT BEFORE THE SENTENCING JUDGE
42As noted earlier, before this Court the appellant tendered the transcript of a conversation between himself and the co-offender which was not before the sentencing judge.  The Crown consented to its tender.  Accordingly it is unnecessary to consider the appellant's submission that the ordinary rules concerning new or fresh evidence do not apply where a matter is referred to this Court under s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, nor his submission that a miscarriage of justice would be occasioned if the further evidence were not considered.  The absence of a need to do this is confirmed by the fact that the evidence is admissible in relation to the re-sentencing necessitated by the appellant's success on Ground 1.
43The conversation in question commenced at 10.52 am on 11 July 2008, that is, nearly four hours before the conversation referred to in [9] above.  
44The appellant relied upon the following statements made by him in the course of the conversation with the co-offender:
● ""In response to the question - What is this thing? - I don't know bro.  I know nothing ... (indistinct) ... They just told me they would look after me.
● Do ya reckon - they'll look after me ya reckon?
● In response to the question - Oh it's all powder is it? - I don't know, yeah I, I, I'll tell ya I haven't stopped doin' it and I just was finished about five minutes before you came.
● ... Yeah, I, I don't know.  I'm a dumb cunt, I, I, I know nothing.  All I know is break up.  That is it; and
● And, this could be worth millions and I'm here like a dumb cunt.""
45The Crown relied upon the following further statements made by the appellant:
● ""Hey, I'm taking the risk, all the risk ... (p 7.2)
● ""Could get, could ... could get done for twenty years or something"" (p 10.5).
46The appellant submitted that the evidence of this conversation indicates that it was not until after the conversation that he acquired what the sentencing judge described as ""a deep knowledge ... of the drug's importation and the value of the drugs warehoused ... "" (see [10] above).  This was said to be significant because the level of the appellant's knowledge when he agreed to become involved in the venture (as distinct from that which he acquired in the course of it) impacted on the level of his criminality and his role in the offence.
47These statements of the appellant were made in circumstances in which he had no obvious reason to disguise the truth, and in my view they indicate that at the time of making them he had only limited relevant knowledge.  In particular, he does not appear to have known at the time of this conversation what the shipment was worth (other than to speculate that it ""could be worth millions""), was unaware of the form of the drugs (whether powder or pills or both) and did not know what he could expect by way of payment for his involvement (other than an expectation that he would be ""looked after"").  Certainly the conversation relied upon by the sentencing judge (see [9] above) suggested that he had greater knowledge by the 2.35 pm conversation but that is consistent with him having, as he said in evidence he did, acquired additional information in the four hour period between the two conversations.  As the appellant submitted, acquisition of knowledge only at that time, rather than prior to his agreement to become involved, indicated a lower level of criminality on his part.  
48The additional evidence points to a difference between the appellant's and co-offender's knowledge at the time they committed the supply offences as, through his involvement in the importation, the co-offender is likely to have been aware of the quantities of the drug involved, whilst such knowledge as the appellant had was only acquired in the midst of his involvement.
49The appellant's submissions in support of Ground 2 are accordingly well-founded and should be taken into account in his re-sentencing.
GROUND 3:  THE SENTENCING OF THE APPELLANT MISCARRIED AS A RESULT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS COURT HAD REGARD TO THE APPLICABLE STANDARD NON-PAROLE PERIOD
50As the appellant accepted, this ground does not arise for consideration if the first ground of appeal succeeds.  As it has succeeded, I refrain from dealing with this further ground.  Clearly the ground is arguable in light of the Court's professed, and understandable, reliance in its judgment of 21 May 2010 on the then current authority of R v Way.  In the circumstances of this case, I see no benefit to the parties or to the administration of justice to add to the multiplicity of decisions scrutinising earlier decisions to determine whether an impermissible use was made of the applicable standard non-parole period. 
RE-SENTENCING OF THE APPELLANT
51It is unnecessary to repeat the original sentencing judge's description on 10 July 2009 of the relevant subjective factors, nor this Court's description on 21 May 2010 of the considerable seriousness of the appellant's offence (see [12] and [13] above).  The important event that has occurred since the appellant was re-sentenced by this Court is the sentencing of the co-offender.  Regard is to be had to this as well as to the evidence of the further conversation to which the appellant was a party (see [44] to [45] above).
52Taking these matters into account and that the maximum sentence is life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 15 years, I conclude that the appellant's head sentence should be reduced by 2 years to imprisonment for 10 years commencing on 11 July 2008.  Any lesser sentence would not in my view adequately reflect the gravity of the appellant's offence.  The sentence reflects the same discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the appellant's early plea as was previously afforded.  Accepting and applying the previous finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period should represent two-thirds of the head sentence.  As a result, it should be fixed at 6 years and 8 months.
53For these reasons, I propose the following orders:
(1)Allow the appellant's appeal against sentence.
(2)Set aside order 4 made by this Court on 21 May 2010 and in lieu thereof: 
(a)set aside the orders of the District Court made on 10 July 2009; and 
(b)sentence the appellant Mr Gary El-Helou to a term of 10 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months commencing on 11 July 2008 and expiring on 10 March 2015, and a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months commencing on the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 10 July 2018.
(c)Accordingly the appellant will become eligible for release on parole on 11 March 2015.
54HIDDEN J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.
55ADAMS J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

		07 October 2014",2014-10-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764958,New South Wales Crime Commission v Milad El Araiji [2014] NSWSC 1372,"Judgment

1By motion filed on 24 September 2014 the New South Wales Crime Commission sought orders under s 10B of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), as well as orders dispensing with service. 

2The proceedings were commenced by summons in 2008. On 26 June 2008 orders were made under s 10 of the Act in relation to specified assets belonging to Mr El Araiji. In September 2011, the Court made orders dispensing with service of the summons. 

3The Crime Commission's case is that the defendant was engaged in serious crime related activity, involving an offence under s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of publishing false and misleading statements in making a loan application to the Commonwealth Bank.

4The application was supported by affidavits sworn on 22 September by Mr Spark, the Commission's Director (Financial Investigations) and an authorised officer under the Act; on 16 September by Mr Manassa, formerly a joint director of the Mann Group; on 10 September by Mr Borg, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Quality Assurance & Liaison Manager; and on 18 September by Detective Sergeant Fairclough. The Crime Commission also relied on a statement of facts and circumstances of 19 September 2014 which was filed in accordance with r 1.26 and Sch 10 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).

5Mr Spark deposed that since 28 April 2011, the NSW Trustee and Guardian has held $161,767.70 of the proceeds of the sale, of one of the properties the subject of the 2008 orders. Mr Spark also deposed that his enquiries had established that in 2004, Mr El Araiji was charged with two sets of fraud offences and that two warrants for his arrest were issued. On arrest he was discovered to be an unlawful non-citizen of Australia. He was granted bail and his migration status required that he be held at the Villawood Detention Centre. He left Australia pursuant to a supervised departure under the Aviation Transport Security Regulation 2005 (Cth) to Lebanon in August 2004 and has not returned since. His whereabouts are now unknown.

6On 18 September 2014, the Commission made a determination under cl 5(2) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Regulation 2001 (NSW) that reasonable efforts to serve documents it had filed in the proceedings on Mr El Araiji would be unsuccessful.

7Mr Fairclough deposed to the circumstances of Mr El Araiji's arrest; admissions which he then made and his departure from Australia. Further arrest warrants remain current, he also having been charged with offences under s 300(2) of the Crimes Act for using false instruments.

8Mr Borg annexed documents to his affidavit on which the case against Mr El Araiji rested. They showed that the Bank made loan drawings in his favour in December 2003 of some $490,000; that the loan related to the property at Potts Point; that he had signed an application for the loan in November 2003, supported by a letter which stated that he was employed for 3 years, 6 months by the Mann Group, earning $98,000 per annum, together with fortnightly pay slips showing earnings of some $3,746. 

9Mr Manassa deposed that the contents of the letter from the Mann Group were incorrect, even though written on its letterhead and purportedly signed by one of its staff. Mr El Araiji had only done about six months work for the company and was not earning the sums claimed in the letter or pay slips.

10On the evidence I am satisfied that the Crime Commission's case that the orders sought under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act must be made. Section 27 of the Act provides that the Commission may apply to the Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity that took place not more than six years before the making of the application. In the circumstances outlined, that requirement has been met.

11The Court must make a proceeds assessment order if it finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time, not more than six years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. That has also been established on the evidence relied on, which establishes that the statements Mr El Araiji made in his loan application were knowingly false and made in order to obtain a loan which the Bank would not have made, but for those false statements. 

12It is evident that Mr El Araiji obtained $490,000 from the Bank as the result of his illegal activity. As the consequence of orders made in these proceedings, his Potts Point property has been sold and the Trustee holds the balance of the proceeds of the sale. The evidence well establishes that Mr El Araiji, whose whereabouts since he left Australia for Lebanon are unknown, is unlikely to return to Australia willingly, given the charges which he faces and the outstanding warrants for his arrest. 

13In all of those circumstances the orders sought must be made. That it is also appropriate to make the order sought dispensing with service of the present application and supporting affidavits relied on, was also well made out on the evidence.

Orders

14For all of those reasons I order:

(1)Pursuant to section 14 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, the requirement for service on the defendant, Milad El Araiji (also known as Tony Pasterio) of any documents filed by the plaintiff in these proceedings and the giving of notice of the hearing, to be dispensed with.

(2)Pursuant to section 10B(4) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, the interest in the property of the Defendant in the property specified in the Schedule hereto be applied in partial satisfaction of the proceeds assessment order

Schedule

The net proceeds of sale of the property described as Lot XX in Strata Plan XXXXX at Redfern, Local Government Area Sydney, also known as Unit XX, X XXXXXX Street, Redfern, New South Wales, currently held by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian pursuant to an order made on 26 June 2008 in these proceedings.

2764962,Sutcliffe v R [2014] NSWCCA 208,"Judgment

1THE COURT: Sean Robert Sutcliffe appeals against his conviction, following a 28 day trial before Grove AJ and a jury of 12, of the murder of Jamie Lefoe on 18 January 2011. Leave to appeal is required because the ground of appeal does not involve a question of law alone. For the reasons which follow there should be a grant of leave, and we shall refer to him as the appellant. 

2The appellant, together with Darren Michael Hoskins, Michael Patrick Brown and Darrin Troy Moulds, were arraigned before Grove AJ in 2013. The Crown case was that the four men, acting pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise, assaulted the deceased with the intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of murder in the case of the appellant, Darren Hoskins and Darrin Moulds. Michael Brown was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 

3The sole ground of appeal is that there has been a miscarriage of justice because the verdict of guilty of murder instead of manslaughter was unreasonable given the jury returned a verdict for the co-accused Michael Brown of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 

4Darren Hoskins also sought leave to appeal from his conviction. That appeal was heard immediately following the present appeal. Neither appellant relied upon the ground of appeal of the other. A more detailed summary of the facts is contained in this Court's reasons in dismissing the other appeal. 

5Given the narrowness of the grounds of appeal, the factual background so far as it is relevant may be summarised very concisely. For present purposes it suffices to say that there was a dispute between the four men and the deceased. The deceased believed that the appellant, Hoskins and Moulds were involved in burning cars in their neighbourhood of Ruse in south-western Sydney, including that of his mother, in the early hours of 18 January 2011. The deceased went to the appellant's house to confront him over the burning of his mother's car. The appellant was not at home. He learnt of the visit from his partner, who said that the deceased had said that he would burn the appellant's car if he did not say who had burnt his mother's car. The appellant then caused a group of men to assemble, to assist him in confronting the deceased. 

6The deceased met the appellant at the front of his house later that evening. The deceased was armed with a gun and threatened to shoot Sutcliffe unless he said who had burned the car. At this stage, eight men in two cars including the three co-accused arrived. The victim discharged his pistol, with one of the bullets grazing Darrin Moulds' head. The deceased then ran away from the group and was pursued by the four co-accused. They apprehended him, brought him to the ground and attacked him. The deceased was hit with a blunt object to the head. He was also struck with a knife or machete, including two deep stab wounds in his back as well as cuts to his arm, shoulder and left leg. Some of those cuts went to the bone. 

7Each of the four co-accused participated in electronically recorded interviews with police immediately after the attack. None gave evidence at the trial. 

8In his interview, the appellant denied striking the deceased in any way. 

9Michael Brown's account was quite different. He told police that he was picked up at his home in a car driven by Darrin Moulds, who told him ""someone was waving a gun"" and ""You have to grab your knife um, your machete um, just in case"" (A.156). He said that:

""That bloke shot at our driver um, several times. We ended up getting out of the car, one of them nearly got run over by the other Darren in the [Pajero], I ended up trying to take the gun of one of the guys who shot Darrin. I swung a machete at his leg um, after that a car got in the way, so I had to move out of the way um, and they were speeding, they crashed um, I ended up going up to the top where the whole scuffle was. ... Darren and Darrin were hitting him, Sean stabbed him um, I ended up holding the majority of every, the machete in my hand and a crowbar or a pole in my hand. I was speaking to a male and a female who own the property and I told them that these guys had guns and they just shot at our car and someone got shot in the head. I ended up pulling Darren off the guy, I don't know if I grabbed his shoe or the guy underneath's shoe, but I grabbed someone's shoe to pull them away. I didn't want no more drama, I was scared um, I wanted to get out of there, I just, I wanted to go home, like I didn't especially want to be shot at.""

10Michael Brown also gave this answer to police (A.168):

"" ... then everybody jumped out of the car, including myself um, I tried to take the gun off the dude or hit it out of his hands and I swung my machete at the back of his legs, 'cause he aimed it at us and myself um, I thought like he was going to shoot me, like he'd shot my mate um, I just didn't want him to have it, but 'cause he still had it I was still scared. I hit him once, I don't know if I hit him after that, I wouldn't, I don't recall me hitting at all. I pulled Darren, not Darrin Moulds, like off the guy, Sean come in from the right from where I was pulling Darren from his leg, he stabbed him, 'cause Darren was pretty much laying on top of him. He stabbed him, the other Darrin was hitting him um, probably in the face, I think Darrin was hitting him, I'm not sure, I don't know.""

11The jury's verdict of manslaughter in the case of Michael Brown must have been on the basis of excessive self-defence. The operation of s 421 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) has been restated in this Court in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [50] and Grant v R [2014] NSWCCA 67 at [62]-[65]. The jury's verdict necessarily amounted to (a) the jury being satisfied that the elements of murder had been proven beyond reasonable doubt (b) that Michael Brown genuinely believed that it was necessary to participate in the joint criminal enterprise in order to defend himself, and (c) a reasonable person in his position would not have considered his response reasonable in the circumstances. 

12The critical difference, therefore, between the verdicts claimed by the appellant to be inconsistent is the mental state of the appellant, on the one hand, and Michael Brown, on the other. 

13The applicable principles governing setting aside jury's verdicts were not in dispute. In MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (citations omitted):

""a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. 'It all depends upon the facts of the case'.""

14Absent from the circumstances of this appeal is any ""affront to logic and common sense"". The evidence clearly supported the jury concluding that the appellant's mental state was different from that of Michael Brown. The appellant was the organiser of the posse, who was confronted by the deceased. Michael Brown had never met the deceased. He had only met the appellant twice. He was not an organiser. He was younger than his co-accused (at the time of the offence he was aged 20, the appellant was 37, Darren Hoskins 36 and Darrin Moulds 28).

15Most importantly, Michael Brown gave credible answers to the police immediately after the attack as to his involvement, why he was involved in the attack and what he did when it was plain that the deceased no longer posed any threat. Those answers, reproduced above, sustain a finding that it was reasonably possible that Michael Brown subjectively believed his response was necessary to defend himself. 

16The appellant's submissions acknowledged the different evidence, open to be accepted by the jury, in relation to him and Michael Brown, but said, nonetheless, that in circumstances where all four men participated in the attack, and indeed Michael Brown carried the machete, the different verdicts satisfied the test in MacKenzie. As it was put orally:

""[The jury] had a doubt in relation to Mr Brown that he was acting in self-defence. Why on earth wasn't there a doubt in relation to the others given that it was, as it were, one scenario of events that ultimately led to the death of the deceased?""

17But that submission does not withstand analysis. All four men participated in the attack on the deceased, but there was credible evidence that they did so in different ways and, importantly, with different mental states. The jury's acceptance of the different mental states of the co-accused was plainly open to them in light of the evidence referred to above. That is sufficient to reconcile the verdicts.

18While there should be a grant of leave to appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.

2764963,Hoskins v R [2014] NSWCCA 207,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The sole ground of this appeal against the appellant's conviction of the murder of Jamie Lefoe on 18 January 2011 is that:

""The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury with respect to an alternative verdict of manslaughter.""

2The appellant was one of a number of men who attacked the victim, who died from the injuries inflicted by them. Four men, Sean Sutcliffe, Michael Brown and Darrin Moulds, together with the appellant Darren Hoskins, stood trial charged with murder. The Crown case was that they were part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. 

3On at least two occasions during the 28 day trial before Grove AJ and a jury of 12 (day 14, T771.3, and day 15, T850.6), the trial judge raised whether manslaughter ought be left open to the jury. The appellant, and two of his co-accused, were separately represented by senior counsel. The fourth co-accused was represented by junior counsel. None of the counsel for the accused submitted that it should. The trial judge then indicated that he would not leave manslaughter open to the jury. No counsel made any submission to the contrary. 

4Senior counsel for the appellant (who did not appear at the trial) properly acknowledged that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied, no point having been taken below. However, he submitted that leave should be granted if he could demonstrate that there was an error leading to a miscarriage of justice: see the authorities in Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223; 217 A Crim 201 at [67]. So much is consistent with what was recently said in James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6; 88 ALJR 427 at [31]-[32]. As much was accepted by the Crown.

5The appellant contended that although he had participated in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict harm on the deceased, it was open on the evidence for the jury to find that he had not participated in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm or death. In that event, it was open for the jury to find the appellant guilty of involuntary manslaughter through having engaged in an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury: Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334 at [6]-[7]; Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [54]-[57]. 

6Manslaughter should be left for the determination of the jury if there is evidence to support such a verdict. That turns on whether manslaughter is a ""viable"" alternative verdict: see R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 64 NSWLR 527 at [75]; Lane at [42] and [66]. If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict, and the judge has not left it to the jury, then there has been an error of law. (It follows that the appellant's appeal to this Court is as of right.)

7The Crown submitted that there was insufficient evidence to support a verdict of involuntary manslaughter; it said that there was no factual foundation for inferring in the appellant any intent other than to participate in an assault with the intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm. Alternatively, the Crown submitted that the proviso should be applied because no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. 

8In such cases, it would ordinarily be necessary to review, in some detail, all of the evidence at the trial. However, as will be seen below, an abbreviated course is available to resolve this appeal.

9The following four facts were agreed (pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)). In December 2010 a car was stolen from a shed at Cattai. On 16 January 2011, the car was (re)stolen from a carport in Ambarvale. On the morning of 17 January 2011, two vehicles (at two separate addresses) were set alight. One was owned by the mother of the deceased, the other was owned by an associate of the deceased. 

10There was no dispute as to the following facts (which are provided by way of overview). The deceased believed that Sean Sutcliffe was involved in burning the cars. On 18 January 2011, the deceased went to Sean Sutcliffe's house to confront him about it. Sutcliffe was not at home, but learnt that he had visited, and was told that the deceased had a gun. The deceased returned at around 9pm on 18 January to Sutcliffe's house, whereupon eight men were summoned, including the four co-accused who stood trial. The deceased discharged his pistol repeatedly, one of the bullets grazing Darrin Moulds' head. The deceased then ran away. A group of men pursued the deceased, brought him to the ground, and beat and stabbed him. His head was beaten with a blunt instrument, there were cuts to the bone on his left leg and wrist, and two deep stab wounds to his back. He died of those wounds.

11The Crown case included the evidence of a witness, Mark Reid, who said he saw Sean Sutcliffe and Darren Hoskins, one with a bar, the other with a machete, each hitting the deceased who was lying on his back at the time. However Mark Reid conceded in cross-examination that he was affected by alcohol and prescription medication at the time, that it was dark and that his vision was impaired. The Crown did not dispute that the jury could reject that evidence.

12The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. Nor did the other co-accused. Tendered against him was an electronically recorded interview he gave to police, commencing at 12.39am on 19 January 2011 in the immediate aftermath of the attack. 

13During his interview, the appellant said that he had been told that day that the deceased had said ""they've got guns and they were going to use them"" (A.706). There was a deal of evidence about how the appellant and a group of men arranged amongst themselves to arrive at Sutcliffe's house to confront the deceased, which it is not necessary, for present purposes, to recount. 

14The appellant was armed with a miniature wooden baseball bat (approximately 60cms long). At the forefront of the appeal was the submission that it was open to the jury to find that the appellant was unaware that one of the group was armed with the knife or machete which caused the most serious injuries to the deceased. 

15It may be acknowledged that there is some equivocation in the answers given by the appellant to police on this point. He said:

""I don't know which one it was ... but one of them had a machete and they were swinging. And ... I got to probably near the driveway and I slipped and the guy fell down and I fell on top of him."" (A.52)

16When the men were pursuing the victim, the appellant said that he ""dropped my bat and I stopped and they all kept running"" (A.228). He was then asked:

""Q. And is [that bat] the only weapon that, apart from the gun, is that the only weapon that you've seen at this stage?
A. No, somebody had a machete."" (A. 231) 

17He said that one of the three men running in front of him had a machete. He then said that someone yelled ""machete"" and was asked ""did you actually see a machete?"" and answered ""no, not really"" (A.247). When he was reminded that previously he had said that he had actually seen the machete, he said:

""A. I thought, well, I've got to be honest there, I heard them say it so, you know.

Q. Alright. So did you or did you not see a machete at any stage?
A. I didn't see, no, I heard somebody say it."" (A.250)

18At A.275, the appellant said 

""there was somebody swinging, I don't know if it was Darren or Mick, ... I believe it was Mick.

... 

Q. And what was he swinging? 
A. I believe it was a machete.""

However, the appellant said that he did not see the machete. 

19The appellant accepted that he tackled the deceased, and agreed that that was the purpose that he was chasing him for (Q.294), as he said ""to try and, you know, take his gun"" (A.295). 

20It was open to the jury to find that the appellant did not himself wield the bat so as to inflict grievous bodily harm, although there was evidence that the deceased's blood was on the bat. He gave these answers (at A.422 and 423):

""Q. Did you use that bat at any stage?
A. I tried to swing it but I missed.

Q. OK so ... 
A. Or if I did hit, it was just like a scrape along ... ""

21Although the deceased's blood was found on the baseball bat, it was open to the jury to find that the appellant had not himself used it to attack the deceased.

22To return to the knife or machete which was used (and which was not recovered), there had been some evidence about what was held by Michael Brown, to which the interviewing officer returned:

""Q. You say you saw something in Mick's hand which is about thirty to forty centimetres in length.
A. Yep, a bent looking shape.

Q. A bent looking shape. But you can't say exactly what it is.
A. No.

Q. All right. Did it look more like a bar or did it look more like some sort of ... 
A. No, it didn't [look] like a bar.

Q. All right. How would you say it looked?
A. Thin.

Q. Yep.
A. Like with a handle like a knife.

Q. OK. All right. Did you at any stage have a machete or a knife in your hand?
A. No, never.

Q. Did you see anyone else apart from Mick have something similar to that, a machete or a knife?
A. No, no.""

23Ultimately, as will be seen below, the most important evidence was the questions and answers directed to the blood on the appellant:

""Q. ... you obviously got blood on you.
A. That's right, yes. 

Q. And that's blood from the person you're struggling with.
A. That's it, yep. 

Q. When did you notice the blood that was on you?
A. Well, it felt like, I thought I'd been cut or something ...

Q. Yeah.
A. ... or, or shot or whatever and when I walked down the street and I noticed it all and they said, ""What happened to you?"" And I said, ""It was, I don't know, it came from him.""

Q. OK. So when did you notice that he was injured?
A. When I was running up the street.

Q. What did you notice?
A. I could feel the blood hitting me.

...

Q. Did you, could you tell roughly where he was being struck?
A. No idea.

Q. OK. So as you're chasing him he's being struck with obviously ...
A. I could feel the blood.

Q. ... a machete or a knife.
A. Well, I felt the blood, it sort of like, it felt like it sort of sprayed on me sort of thing or ... 

Q. Got something, something of liquid ... 
A. ... yeah, something wet, yeah. 

Q. ... was hitting you. OK. Where did you feel that?
A. Ah, first of all on my leg. I thought it was maybe from when, um, you know, I dropped the bat and sort of slipped. 

Q. So you must have been reasonably close behind him, would you agree?
A. Ah, yeah, for sure.

Q. How close would you say?
A. A metre, maybe a bit more. When I landed like tackled him I felt it straightaway from ... 

Q. And Mick must have been almost right beside you, he couldn't have been too much in front of you, I mean, if you're ... 
A. Oh, he was still in front of me. 

Q. But if you're only a metre behind the bloke that he struck.
A. Oh, a metre, oh, probably a metre and metre and half.

Q. OK. 
A. And I've tried to get the, the gun and then went back down the street.

Q. How many times did you see Mick swing at the deceased?
A. While he was chasing him.

Q. Yeah. 
A. I think three times, twice.""

24The appellant contended that some of those answers might have reflected reconstruction by the appellant of what had happened. As it was put in oral submissions:

""It becomes apparent very quickly that much of what [the appellant] said in his record of interview was him exercising hindsight, assisting the police by telling them what he thought had happened which is a quite different thing from his awareness at the time.""

25In particular, it was said that the answers reflected his after the event knowledge that one of his co-offenders had a knife or machete, and his after the event explanation for why blood was found on his body, so that nevertheless, it remained open for the jury to find that his participation was in a joint criminal enterprise which fell short of one whose purpose was to inflict grievous bodily harm.

26It was then submitted that if the jury had concluded that the appellant was party to a criminal enterprise to cause harm falling short of grievous bodily harm to the deceased, then they might have taken a different view as to whether the appellant was acting in self-defence. It was also submitted that even if two or three of the co-offenders had agreed between themselves to inflict grievous bodily harm or worse, it remained open to the jury to conclude that the appellant had only agreed to inflict violence falling short of that.

27However, in the course of oral argument, the position was refined, culminating in the following exchange in the course of the appellant's reply:

""FULLERTON J: Mr Odgers, is it fatal to your case were we to reason to the view that your client did in fact say that he knew Brown was swinging at the deceased with a machete before he was tackled to the ground and close enough to be aware that blood was being shed. Is that fatal to your--

ODGERS: I think I'd probably come close to concede that.

FULLERTON J: So it really is a question then for us, without chopping you into a briefer reply, for us to look at what we can conclude from what your client said in his record of interview.

ODGERS: And putting it slightly more technically precisely was it inevitable that the jury would have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was admitting that at the time he was aware that Brown was slashing the deceased with a machete and that he'd actually succeeded in striking him and blood flying. Yes I concede that.""

Hence the focus on appellant's answers in the record of interview in these reasons.

28We are conscious of the fact that merely reading the transcript of the interview may not fully disclose the full force the evidence would have had upon the jury (who saw and heard it). However, the gravamen of the evidence was that (a) the appellant armed himself prior to the confrontation, (b) he with his co-offenders pursued the deceased after he began to flee, (c) during the pursuit, he saw one of his co-offenders strike the deceased with a knife or machete, repeatedly, inflicting wounds such that the deceased's blood hit him, and (d) the appellant then tackled the deceased, bringing him to the ground, rendering possible the deep stab wounds which caused his death.

29We are likewise conscious that it is no small thing to find that it was not open to a jury to make a particular finding. The issue as framed by Gageler J (dissenting on unrelated grounds) in James v R [2014] HCA 6; 306 ALR 1 at [68], relying on Beavan v The Queen (1954) 92 CLR 660 at 662, was whether ""on no view of the evidence which might reasonably be adopted, would the crime amount to manslaughter and not murder"".

30The answers given by the appellant about pursuing the deceased, feeling his blood hitting him when he was struck by his co-offender three times by a knife or machete are reproduced above. At first, aspects of the uncertainty in the answers might arguably support the submission that they did not reflect the appellant's belief at the time, but were infected by what he later learned. We have in mind the evidence that he merely believed there was a machete (which he said he did not in fact see) and, in particular, his answer that at first the appellant believed that the blood on him came from his having been cut or shot (""I thought I'd been cut or something""). However, the long concluding passage reproduced above falls into a different category. In particular, the final questions and answers, to the effect that the appellant saw his co-offender swing at the deceased three times while they were chasing him, and that he felt the blood hitting him, are incapable of sustaining any such explanation. 

31The appellant's answers reproduced above do not, on any view of them which might reasonably be adopted, amount to a proper evidentiary foundation for the appellant having a state of mind other than that of awareness that his co-offender was striking the deceased with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, following which the appellant pursued the deceased and brought him to the ground, enabling further wounds - including those which were fatal - to be inflicted. Contrary to the appellant's submission, those answers cannot be reconciled with an after-the-event reconstruction of events of which he was unaware at the time.

32That evidence leads to a conclusion that the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was admitting that he was aware that Michael Brown was slashing with a knife or machete, and that he had succeeded in striking the deceased whose blood was hitting him. 

33Our conclusion is strengthened by the consideration that counsel representing the appellant at the trial, who were better placed to assess the force of that evidence, made no application to the trial judge, despite the issue being raised squarely, and on two occasions. 

34Against all this, counsel for the appellant observed that none of this evidence was raised before the jury by the Crown in closing submissions. That is so. But it does not detract from the force of the appellant's answers. The arguments advanced on this appeal are completely different from trial, where manslaughter was not left to the jury. It follows that it is no answer to the force of the evidence to say that the Crown did not take the jury to it.

35For those reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.

2764977,Lee v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 172,"Judgment

1This is an application for rulings on the form and capacity of imputations pleaded as arising from two publications (Internet and newspaper) dated 20 April 2014. The subject matter is the police investigation of the murder of Mrs Joo Won Choi on 12 August 2008. The plaintiff is referred to by name as one of 17 ""persons of interest"" in that murder, and as having come ""under police gaze"" in the murder of the Lin family. The text for both publications is set out as an annexure to this judgment. Apart from minor differences in the headline, the Internet and newspaper publications are identical.

2The imputations originally pleaded as arising in each the first and second matters complained of were:

(a)The Plaintiff may have murdered the Lin family (paragraphs 7, 16, 17, 18).

(b)The Plaintiff was tracked down by police as part of the Lin family murder investigation (7, 16, 17, 18).

(c)The Plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as having murdered the Lin family (7, 16, 17, 18).

(d)(i) The Plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as being a mass murderer (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24)OR(ii) The Plaintiff may be a mass murderer (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24).

(e)The Plaintiff may have participated in the murder of Joo Won Choi (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24).

(f)The Plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as having murdered Joo Won Choi (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24).

3In the course of the argument the plaintiff:

(a)Proposed, in the amended statement of claim, to reverse the order of the imputations, to commence with (e) and (f);

(b)Proposed a redrafted version of imputations (a), (d) and (e); and

(c)Indicated that further imputations may be relied upon when the amended statement of claim is redrafted.

4These are my reasons for rulings concerning:

(a)The striking out of redrafted imputations (a), (d) and (e);

(b)The striking out of imputation (b), with leave to replead;

(c)My ruling that imputations (c) and (f), namely that the plaintiff was reasonably suspected by police in relation to both murders, are capable of being conveyed.

Imputations (a), (d) and (e)

5The principle issue for determination is whether the publications sued upon carry imputations that the plaintiff murdered the Lin family and/or Mrs Choi, and whether an imputation that the plaintiff is a multiple murderer, mass murderer or serial killer is also capable of being conveyed as the condition relating to such acts (Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 20 February 1980)).

6The principal topic of the matter complained of is the investigation of Mrs Choi's murder; the Lin family murder is referred to only in paragraphs 7 and 18. The opening paragraphs explain that the killer of Mrs Choi left a trail of forensic clues, including ""19 fingerprints from the same unidentified person"", a palm print, DNA under the victim's fingernails and ""several"" sock imprints. However, although police identified 17 persons of interest, none of these persons (including the plaintiff) matched the ""mystery DNA and prints"", leaving police ""at a dead end"" (paragraph 7), in that this made it impossible for any of these persons to have been the murderer of Mrs Choi. The remaining factual material consists of the movements of the family of the victim on the day in question, police speculation that theft was the motive (the victim was known to keep large amounts of cash in the family home), and information about the inquest and the offering of a reward, without any result; police were at a ""dead end"". 

7Mrs Choi's murder occurred on 12 August 2008, and the Lin family murder not until a year later, but I have to proceed on the basis that the reader of the matter complained of does not have these fine details in mind. Although the matters complained of principally deal with the murder of Mrs Choi, I shall set out the allegations about the Lin family first, as these are the key to the issue of capacity. The connecting factors between the two murders, from the plaintiff's point of view, are that he has been a person of interest in both. In part, this is because the Choi family businesses included a tutoring college for children, because the plaintiff in fact worked for a rival tutoring college, run by his own parents. The plaintiff, according to paragraphs 7 and 18, came ""under police gaze"" in the Lin family murders due to his having tutored the Lin children. This would be slight evidence of itself, but there were additional reasons for suspecting him. First, the plaintiff had to be ""tracked down"" by police investigating the Lin murders, because he had ""suddenly left"" his apartment, taking only his passport, weeks after Mrs Choi's death in August 2008. Secondly, he was one of 17 persons of interest in her murder.

8Nevertheless, the matter complained of goes on to state, in the next sentence, that the plaintiff's DNA and fingerprints ""did not match the profile in the Choi case"" (paragraph 18), from which the reader would infer that his exclusion from suspicion as the person who murdered Mrs Choi was considered of relevance by the police conducting the Lin investigation.

9This brings me to the principal subject of the article, namely Mrs Choi's murder. The statement at paragraph 18 (concerning the Lin family murder) that the plaintiff's DNA and fingerprints did not match those of Mrs Choi's killer is one of a series of statements that all known persons of interest, including the plaintiff, have been excluded on this basis. This is reinforced by paragraphs 19 - 22, which describe the police as going on to investigate the other 16 persons of interest, such as the ""church friends"" of the victim who had unsuccessfully asked her for loans (including one churchgoer who threatened another with a similar fate to the victim), looking ""further afield"" to an offender who had stabbed another woman the following month, and to inquiries made in South Korea, as it was believed the murderer could have fled there. In each case, the DNA and fingerprint evidence was not a match, and the final paragraph notes that despite a coronial inquest and a reward, the family are ""still waiting for a breakthrough"" in what was called ""one of Sydney's greatest murder mysteries"". 

10The plaintiff's argument is that he is the only person named amongst these 17 persons of interest, and that the greater amount of information (especially the Lin family murder details), and the use of his name, where other suspects are unnamed, are strong hints to the reader (reading between the lines) that despite the total absence of forensic evidence, he is the murderer. Additionally, the plaintiff, who had attended Trinity Grammar School with Peter Choi (the victim's son), was being investigated for fraud, and had asked Peter Choi's wife if he could borrow money from her. Mr Rasmussen submits that this material rises above an imputation of mere suspicion and is capable of conveying an imputation of guilt in relation to both the Lin family murders and Mrs Choi's murder. 

The relevant principles

11In Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 the High Court stated at [6]:

""Whether or not [the pleading] ought to and will be struck out [as disclosing no cause of action] is ultimately a matter for the discretion of the judge who hears the application. Such a step is not to be undertaken lightly but only, it has been said, with great caution. In the end, however, it depends on the degree of assurance with which the requisite conclusion is or can be arrived at. The fact that reasonable minds may possibly differ about whether or not the material is capable of a defamatory meaning is a strong, perhaps an insuperable, reason for not exercising the discretion to strike out. But once the conclusion is firmly reached, there is no justification for delaying or avoiding that step [at] whatever stage it falls to be taken."" [Emphasis added].

12See also Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158.

13I note the warning by the NSW Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135] - [136] that the determination of capacity is an issue of generosity and not of parsimony and a ""matter of impression ... the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant"" (Berezovsky v Forbes [2001] EWCA Civ 1251 at [16]). Mr Rasmussen submits that the plaintiff should therefore be given wide latitude, but Mrs Barnett submits that the word ""sensibly"" in Favell at [6] must be given its full import.

14McColl JA outlined the correct approach by the judge at the capacity stage of determining the imputations (at [133]) as being:

""[133] The judge's function at the capacity stage is to determine ""the outside boundaries of the possible range of meanings and [set] the 'ground rules' for the trial"": P Milmo and WVH Rogers, Gatley on Libel and Slander (11th ed 2008, Sweet & Maxwell) (""Gatley""), at [3.13] (see also [32.5]) citing Mapp v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1998] QB 520.""

15The reasons for such caution being required at the capacity stage are explained at [136]:

""[136] One reason ""great caution"" is mandated at the capacity stage, is because the conclusion which necessarily underpins a determination that the matter complained of is not capable of conveying the pleaded imputations is that ""no reader could reasonably understand the words to bear any meaning outside the range delimited ... by the judge; and that it would be 'perverse' for any jury to do so"": Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe SPRL [2003] EWCA Civ 1694 ; [2004] EMLR 89 (""Jameel"") (at [9]) per Simon Brown LJ (Mummery and Mance LJJ agreeing).""

16In Corby v Allen & Unwin, the Court considered that imputations of guilt were conveyed; the first instance judge erred in failing to find certain of those imputations were conveyed but, more importantly, in holding that where imputations were conveyed, the antidote could outweigh the bane. 

17The question for determination here is not whether the bane outweighs the antidote, but the more commonly encountered problem of whether a publication relating to police investigation identifies the plaintiff not just as a person under suspicion (or even the prime suspect) but the person who actually committed the crime. 

18Care must be taken, even at the capacity stage, to ensure that these questions are addressed to the imputations that are actually pleaded, and not to other imputations which might be available. The contested imputations here are two specific acts (that the plaintiff murdered Mrs Choi and the Lin family) and a condition (that the plaintiff is a multiple murderer). These are Chase level 1 imputations (Chase v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1772 ; [2003] EMLR 11 (""Chase"") at [45]) of outright guilt (see R Parkes QC; Professor A Mullis; G Busuttil; A Speker; A Scott; C Strong, Gatley On Libel and Slander (12th ed, 2013, Sweet & Maxwell) at [11.13]), and the question is whether they, or alternatively a Chase level 2 imputation of reasonable grounds for suspicion, arise: see the discussion of such imputations at the capacity stage in Moran v Schwartz Publishing Pty Ltd [2014] WASC 334 at [32]). 

19I shall deal first with imputation (a).

Imputation (a) (as redrafted): the plaintiff murdered the Lin family

20As is noted above, the matter complained of states that the plaintiff first came ""under police gaze"" in this inquiry because he had tutored two of the Lin children. Additionally, he had to be ""tracked down"". The facts relied upon are the reference to the plaintiff being ""tracked down"" because he left his Newington apartment the year before the Lin murders and taking only his passport. Finally, and most importantly, he had been a person of interest in relation to the murder of Mrs Choi, which the ordinary reasonable reader would read between the lines as being a violent murder similar to that of the Lin family, and which similarly occurred in the victim's home. 

21This is not a publication where the ""whole tenor"" (Corby at [154]) is that the plaintiff is guilty of the murder of the Lin family. He only came to police attention because he tutored the Lin children. The other suspicious circumstances, such as his leaving his apartment suddenly the year before the Lin murder and the fact that he was under suspicion in Mrs Choi's murder, are stated in paragraph 18 as having been matters which aroused police suspicion, which suspicion was allayed because ""his DNA and fingerprints did not match the profile in the Choi case"". 

22The question is whether these statements take the imputation beyond mere suspicion and amount to an allegation that the plaintiff was in fact the murderer of the Lin family. As is set out above, Mr Rasmussen relies upon:

(a)The fact that there is a reference to both murders ""makes the inference very strong"" (outline of submissions, at 1.3). 

(b)No other suspects are named in relation to the Lin family or Mrs Choi murders.

(c)He had been in hiding since shortly after the murder of Mrs Choi in 2008 and this meant that the Lin investigators had to track him down in 2009.

23Mr Rasmussen's submissions on this issue elided the imputations in relation to both murders. Each imputation needs to be considered separately. 

24Mrs Barnett submits that it would be perverse for the ordinary reasonable reader to conclude that these statements conveyed an imputation that the plaintiff had murdered the Lin family and that although the bar for capacity of imputations is set low, this imputation clearly is not conveyed.

25Grounds of suspicion may range from the slight to the strong (Rakhimov v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2000] NSWSC 10 at [27]; Channel Seven Adelaide Pty Ltd and Anor v S, DJ [2006] SASC 10 at [24]), but for a Chase level 1 imputation of murder, such shades of meaning are unavailable. The plaintiff either committed the murder, or he did not. Mr Rasmussen conceded it was not possible to plead an imputation that the plaintiff ""may have murdered"" the Lin family, not only because ""may"" is impermissible (Christiansen v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1258 at [33]; Alex v Gridneff [2013] NSWSC 2035) but also because these shades of meaning elide the concepts of reasonable suspicion and actual performance of the deed. However, the solution is not to replace the current imputation with its defective plea of ""may"" by a stronger imputation of guilt, but to accept that suspicion is all that is conveyed.

26The matter complained of states only that the plaintiff was located by police and interviewed in relation to the Lin family in his capacity as the children's tutor, the murder of Mrs Choi having been discounted as an indicator of guilt for lack of forensic evidence. In other words, he came ""under police gaze"", but was discounted, not least because he was excluded on forensic grounds in relation to Mrs Choi's murder (paragaph 18). The matter complained of is accordingly incapable of giving rise to an imputation that the plaintiff murdered the Lin family.

Imputation (e) (as redrafted): The plaintiff murdered Joo Won Choi

27I have dealt with this imputation out of turn because it raises the same issue as imputation (a).

28The matter complained of categorically states in the two headlines, paragraphs 6 - 7 and paragraphs 18 - 22 that the significant DNA and fingerprint evidence found at the murder scene cannot be matched with any of the persons of interest, and specifically with the plaintiff, which cannot give rise to an imputation that the plaintiff physically performed the act of murdering Mrs Choi. Police are ""baffled"" (Headline 2) by ""one of Sydney's greatest murder mysteries"" (paragraph 6) and ""at a dead end"" (paragraph 7) despite a coronial inquest and a $100,000 reward; the family are still waiting for a breakthrough in this ""unsolved"" (paragraph 24) six-year-old murder. 

29Mr Rasmussen relies upon the same factual nexus as for the imputation that the plaintiff murdered the Lin family. The same (or perhaps greater) problems apply, because the matter complained of refers to police investigation of a series of other persons of interest such as the local break-and-enter offender, church friends who had unsuccessfully asked the victim for loans, a man heard to make a threat concerning the circumstances of the victim's death, a mentally-ill man who stabbed a prostitute the following month, and inquiries of Interpol in South Korea, none of the results of which matched the extensive DNA and fingerprint evidence. All these persons (including the plaintiff) were therefore deemed not to be the murderer. The allegations about the plaintiff take up four paragraphs, and he is the only person named, but the whole tenor of the publication is that police are at a dead end, because they cannot find the person matching the killer's DNA and fingerprints.

30Mr Rasmussen submitted that, on the low level of a capacity hearing, I should take into account that a person reading between the lines would assume that the police were incompetent, or that the DNA and fingerprint evidence could be wrong. However, that is the sort of perverse conclusion that a person avid for scandal would draw. The evidence of suspicion against the plaintiff may be strong rather than slight (Rakhimov, supra, at [27]), but that is insufficient to convert a Chase level 2 into a Chase level 1 imputation, even at the capacity stage. 

31This imputation is not capable of being conveyed. 

Imputation (b): The plaintiff was tracked down by police as part of the Lin family murder investigation

32The NSW Court of Appeal has recently explained the nature of ambiguous imputations in Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273 at [19] - [24], and I respectfully adopt their Honours' statements of the relevant principles. This imputation is a good example of the sting of the libel not being captured by the mere repetition of the matter complained of. This sentence in the matter complained of goes on to state that he was tracked down ""because he tutored the Lin children"", this being the reason the police wished to interview him, but the real sting is in the previous paragraph. 

33The defendants submit that the imputation is ambiguous as it fails to distil a clear defamatory act or condition of the plaintiff. The statement that police have had to track someone down may not, by itself, distil a defamatory meaning, as police have to find many potential witnesses or persons of interest whose whereabouts are unknown to them. The defendants submit, and I agree, that what the plaintiff intends to convey is an imputation based upon the reference to the circumstances in which the plaintiff ""suddenly left"" (paragraph 17) his Newington apartment in the weeks following Mrs Choi's murder, and that this is what should be pleaded.

34This imputation is struck out with leave to replead.

Imputation (d): The plaintiff is a mass murderer/multiple murderer/serial killer

35This imputation relies upon the acts in each of the matters complained of as creating a condition, namely the plaintiff is a person who, having murdered more than one person, is either a mass murderer, or a multiple murderer, or a serial killer. Mr Rasmussen was uncertain which of these terms should be used.

36If imputations of murdering more than one person had been conveyed, the plaintiff would, additionally to imputations of committing the murders, be entitled to plead an imputation of condition, namely that he is a murderer or a multiple murderer. However, as I have found that neither of the Chase level 1 imputations of murder are conveyed, this imputation cannot be conveyed.

Imputations (c) and (f): reasonably suspected by the police as having murdered the Lin family/Joo Won Choi

37For the reasons set out above, and discussed in the course of argument, the matter complained of is capable of conveying these two Chase level 2 imputations that the plaintiff was reasonably suspected by the police as having committed each of these murders.

Costs

38The plaintiff's submissions were not available until this morning, at the hearing, and Mr Rasmussen has effectively sought to replead and reorganise the imputations. I am grateful to Mrs Barnett for dealing with these changes ""on the run"". As the plaintiff has been substantially unsuccessful, even in relation to the proposed amendments, the plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs.

Orders

(1)Strike out the imputations currently pleaded as imputations (a), (b), (d) and (e), with leave to replead imputation (b).

(2)Plaintiff to file an amended statement of claim in 7 days.

(3)Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 31 October 2014.

(4)Plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the argument today.

Annexure A

(1)No arrests yet, despite killer's trail of clues

(2)The torture and murder of a kind, generous woman continues to baffle police.

(3)writes Rachel Olding

(4)The killer of well-known business owner Joo Won Choi did not leave the scene without a trace.

(5)Around the blood spattered through her family's neat Croydon home were crucial clues: 19 fingerprints from the same unidentified person, a palm print on the front verandah, unknown DNA under Mrs Choi's fingernails and several sock imprints on the bathroom floor only visible under special lighting.

(6)But, nearly six years on, the stabbing of the popular, generous mother remains one of Sydney's greatest murder mysteries.

(7)Police have identified 17 persons of interest - from a local break-and-enter offender to a man who came under police gaze during the Lin family murder investigation - but none matches the mystery DNA and prints, leaving police at a dead end.

(8)Mrs Choi, 56, and her husband Suk Bong Choi, 63, worked seven days a week in their four businesses - a neon sign business in Marrickville, a bag shop in Roselands Shopping Centre and two James An tutoring colleges.

(9)Tuesday mornings were Mrs Choi's only time off and her son Peter, 33, was the last to see her on August 12, 2008, as he ran out the door of their Fitzroy Street bungalow, late for work at Suncorp in the city.

(10)Mr Choi was due to meet his wife for lunch in Marrickville but when she did not arrive, he went home and found her lying in a pool of blood in the hallway, stabbed eight times.

(11)A bloodied knife was on the bench. A box containing the traditional dress she wore to her other son David's wedding was open on the bed. Blood trailed through the bathroom and bedrooms, indicating someone tortured her for an extended period.

(12)Mrs Choi would pay her employees in cash and sometimes had up to $20,000 in the pockets of her clothes at home, leading police to believe theft was the motive.

(13)The Chois were a generous and successful couple who played at Strathfield Golf Club every weekend and were heavily involved in the local Sydney Full Gospel Church.

(14)But they lived modestly and gave discreet loans to those in need, Detective Senior Constable Danielle Rogerson said in a statement tendered at Mrs Choi's inquest.

(15)''However, to persons outside the family, it appears that [Mrs Choi] was well-off and looked up to for having several businesses,'' she said.

(16)Among the persons of interest identified by Detective Rogerson was Albert Lee, an old school mate of Peter Choi's from Trinity Grammar School, who was being investigated for fraud and had asked to borrow money from Peter's wife.

(17)Detective Rogerson said Mr Lee's parents ran training colleges that competed against James An and, weeks after Mrs Choi's death, he suddenly left his Newington apartment, taking only his passport.

(18)In 2009, he was tracked down as part of the Lin family murder investigation because he tutored the Lin children. His DNA and fingerprints, however, did not match the profile in the Choi case.

(19)Police investigated church friends who had unsuccessfully asked Mrs Choi for loans. One man was heard threatening another churchgoer who owed him money, ''Do you know what happened to that lady at Croydon? Those are the sort of things that happen.'' However, no one matched the mystery profile.

(20)Investigators looked further afield to a serial break-and-enter offender and a mentally ill man who stabbed a prostitute in September 2008. Once again, there was no DNA match.

(21)Fearing the attacker fled to South Korea, Interpol was contacted but it had no fingerprint matches.

(22)After a coronial inquest and a $100,000 reward announced in December, the Choi family are still waiting for a breakthrough.

		22 October 2014",2014-10-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764985,WorkCover Authority of NSW v Merhis Construction Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 373,"The defendant, Merhis Constructions Pty Limited (Merhis Constructions), pleads guilty to the charge that on 21 February 2011 at Sutherland it contravened section 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 in that being an employer it failed by its acts or omissions to ensure that a person not in its employ, Mr Paul Smith, was not exposed to risks to his health and safety.
	
	
	On the day in question Mr Smith fell from an A-frame ladder upon which he was standing, installing plumbing on the site of a construction project in which Merhis Construction was the head contractor.
	
	
	Mr Smith did not fall far, perhaps one to one and a half metres, but he fell upon the stillage of a scaffolding pallet. Mr Smith was impaled in the area of his armpit upon a steel upright some 70 centimetres high.
	
	
	The defendant’s failures were manifold. It failed to ban the use of A-frame ladders on the site, and require that platform ladders be used for all work at heights. It failed to ensure that that subcontractor did not use A-frame ladders, and it failed to ensure that good housekeeping practices were followed so that the stillage was not in a position where Mr Smith may fall upon it.
	
	
	Merhis Constructions was not unconscious of its responsibilities in relation to matters of occupational health and safety. It engaged Mr Bob Turner, an experienced Occupational Health and Safety Consultant, to provide advice. It employed Mr Simon Turner and Mr Noah Iakopo as full-time Occupational Health and Safety Coordinators. It also employed Mr Grace as a supervisor on site. Mr Turner and Mr Grace conducted regular toolbox talks.
	
	
	The defendant commissioned a Corporate Safety Management Plan that sought to identify all risks arising from the work in hand. The defendant also required that its subcontractors, including Mr Smith’s employer, provide Merhis with Safe Working Documentation.
	
	
	Unfortunately by virtue of a lack of adversion rather than a want of care, the Safe Work Method Statement provided by Mr Smith’s employer to the defendant did not deal specifically with the problems associated with the work upon which Mr Smith was engaged. The Safe Work Method Statement spoke of the use of ladders and merely required that the worker was not to climb higher than the third rung from the top and ensure that the legs were spread apart.
	
	
	The Safe Work Method Statement prepared in relation to vertical pipe work provided as follows:
	


“In installation ensure clear flat floors are available and appropriate access of equipment eg ladders, mobile scaffolding et cetera is provided.


	
	The safe work instruction in relation to step ladders merely required that the worker ensured the step ladder legs were fully spread and the worker wasn’t to climb higher than the third step from the top.
	
	
	I think it reasonable to recognise that a platform ladder would have been a safer alternative, and in failing to ensure that Mr Smith used such a ladder, the defendant failed in its duty.
	
	
	The reason that it failed is in part lack of adversion but I think it relevant to note that the only regulation extant at the time within Division 6 of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 addressed itself to prevention of falls from heights in these terms:
	


1. An employer must ensure that risk associated with falls from a height are controlled by use of the following measures:

   a) provision and maintenance of 

   (i) stable and securely

   fenced platform such as scaffolding or other form of 

   portable work platform

   or

   (ii) if compliance with subparagraph (i) is not reasonably

   practicable secure perimeter screens, fencing, handrails, 

   or other forms of physical barriers that are capable of 

   preventing the fall of a person, 

   or 

   (iii) if compliance with subparagraph 2 that is (ii) is not

   reasonably practicable other forms of physical restraints 

   that are capable of arresting the fall of a person from a 

   height of more than two metres.


	
	Mr Smith was not at risk of falling from a height of more than two metres and if the persons preparing the Safe Work Method Statements had been concerned to seek assistance from the regulations they would not have come across a regulation banning the use of A-frame or requiring the use of platform ladders on construction sites.
	
	
	A safety alert issued by WorkCover in May 2010 reminded employers that the use of ladders should only be considered if other safe alternatives such as scaffolding or elevated working platforms are not reasonably practicable and that ladders should only be used to carry out light work of short duration.
	
	
	While the work upon which Mr Smith was engaged, installing plastic pipes, was light work, and at each place of short duration, the safety alert directed the workers to ensure that they had at least three points of contact while working from the ladder.
	
	
	There is no evidence that this alert ever came to the attention of the defendant or the subcontractor.
	
	
	The gravity of this offence is in part reflected by the injuries suffered by Mr Smith and the extent to which the defendant departed from the standards of a reasonable man is not that great. The defendant was most active in attempting to ensure work place safety and required of its subcontractors that they turn their mind to all possible risks that may have occurred.
	
	
	There is evidence that the defendant did turn its mind to such risks as it perceived and so did the subcontractor Mr Smith’s employer. The failure was a failure of adversion not a failure of care in relation to the use of A frame ladders.
	
	
	I think a more serious omission was the failure to ensure good housekeeping on the site. The presence of an upright steel post beside a ladder from which a man may fall created a recognisable risk which should have been observed by the supervisors on the ground at the site. Bearing in mind the correlation between the gravity of the risk and the culpability associated with its existence, the gravity of this offence is, while not modest, not great.
	
	
	The evidence is that the defendant went to some trouble and expense after this event purchasing A-frame ladders for use by its subcontractors rather than merely requiring those subcontractors to provide them in discharging the works.
	
	
	The defendant company when it traded was a large company involved on multiple products in a high risk industry and has no previous convictions. In the circumstances this record is commendable
	
	
	The company has expressed contrition and remorse and entered a plea at the first reasonable opportunity. I believe that an appropriate penalty is $100,000 from which the defendant is entitled to a deduction of 25% in respect of its early plea and cooperation.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $75,000.
	
	
	I order that a moiety of the fine be afforded to WorkCover and I order the defendant to pay WorkCover’s costs as agreed or assessed.

		14 December 2015",2014-10-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764992,Brough v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWSC 1396,"Judgment

1On 5 September 2013, Mr Corey Brough was sentenced in the Local Court of New South Wales at Lithgow by Magistrate Toose for three offences. At the time, he was serving a number of pre-existing sentences, with regard to which the overall non-parole period was less than 75% of the overall head sentence. His solicitor submitted to the learned Magistrate that the new offences could commence before the expiry of the pre-existing overall non-parole period, but also submitted that ""your Honour can choose any date your Honour feels is appropriate"". His solicitor made no submission about special circumstances that could alter the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence of the new sentences. 

2In the event, her Honour imposed three wholly concurrent sentences of imprisonment to commence on the day upon which the pre-existing overall non-parole period came to an end. In her Honour's remarks on sentence, nothing was said about special circumstances, and the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence confirms that none were found.

3A severity appeal to the District Court on the part of Mr Brough is statute barred due to the effluxion of time.

4Mr Brough has appealed to this Court. Based upon the grounds of appeal, the issues that I must determine are: can the approach of her Honour constitute a question of law alone, thereby permitting an appeal to this Court pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2011 (NSW) (the Act)? If so, has any error of law been demonstrated that would lead me to vary the sentence (pursuant to s 55(2)(b) of the Act) or remit the matter for further hearing in the Local Court (pursuant to s 55(2)(c))?

Some preliminary matters

5Mr Brough is the appellant, and according to the interaction of s 61 of the Act and rr 51B.9 and 51B.10 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) is the plaintiff. He was, of course, the defendant at first instance. The Crown is the defendant to the appeal. However, for ease of comprehension, I shall refer to Mr Brough as the appellant, and his opponent as the Crown.

6The appellant lodged his appeal somewhat out of time. The Crown did not submit that I should refuse an extension, pursuant to r 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, if I were to find the appeal to be meritorious. Because I consider the submissions of the appellant to be reasonably arguable and to raise some important issues, I consider that an extension of time to institute the appeal should be granted.

7Neither party sought costs if that party were to succeed before me.

Grounds of appeal

8As amended at the commencement of the hearing with the consent of the Crown, these were as follows:

(1)The Magistrate erred in failing to have regard to the principle of proportionality in structuring the appropriate sentence for each of the subject offences.

(2)The Magistrate erred in failing to have regard to the principles of totality in the context of the plaintiff serving existing sentences at the time of the imposition of the subject sentences.

(3)The Magistrate erred in failing to have regard to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ('special circumstances') in the context of the plaintiff serving existing sentences at the time of the imposition of the subject sentences.

(4)The Magistrate erred in failing to correctly apply the principle of totality when considering the commencement date of the subject sentences.

9Whilst ground one was not formally abandoned, in oral submissions senior counsel for the appellant made clear that he was content for my focus to be on the last three grounds.

Background

10On 15 January 2011, while in custody for other offences, the appellant escaped from the Coffs Harbour Police Station holding cells. To state things very succinctly, he travelled on foot to a ""Windscreens O'Brien"" business in the north of Coffs Harbour. He used a piece of wire to manipulate a lock and gain access to the building there. Inside he found an unsecured van with keys in the ignition. He drove the van out of the building via a roller door, and all the way south to Sydney, where he gave custody of it to an unknown man. En route, he stopped at a service station in Kempsey, where he obtained $56 worth of fuel and drove off without paying for it. These crimes (except for the escape) led to the sentences under appeal.

11In late January 2011 the offender was arrested and sentenced in the Local Court of New South Wales at Coffs Harbour for the escape and other, unrelated offences. At that stage he was not charged with the other offences of 15 January 2011. He was released to parole on 25 July 2011.

12On the night of 28 August 2011, the appellant broke into a pharmacy and a gym in Parramatta, and stole cash and goods. He was arrested the following day, and on 30 August 2011 was charged with two counts of aggravated break, enter and steal. His parole was revoked and he began to serve his balance of parole. Judge Coorey sentenced the appellant in the District Court of NSW with regard to those two offences on 2 January 2012.

13While in custody, after being informed that police intended to conduct a forensic procedure in relation to the events of 15 January 2011 after his escape, the offender confessed. He was charged with the three offences that are the subject of this appeal, namely: break enter and steal, take and drive a conveyance, and dishonestly obtain property by deception.

14It can therefore be seen that when the appellant appeared before her Honour on 5 September 2013 for sentencing, he had been, and still was, serving a number of sentences. The first of those was balance of parole, which commenced on 30 August 2011 and had expired on 30 January 2012. The second were the sentences imposed by Judge Coorey. Considered as a whole, they featured a head sentence of three years eight months, with a non-parole period of two years and two months. They commenced on 2 January 2012 (that is, about a month before the balance of parole expired), and their head sentence was due to expire on 1 September 2015. The non-parole period with regard to those sentences was to expire on 1 March 2014. 

15Attached to this judgment is a diagram that sets seeks to set out the sentence structure described above, along with the sentences imposed by the Magistrate, in readily comprehensible form.

16It can be seen that the ratio between the non-parole period and the overall head sentence imposed by Judge Coorey was 59%. Taking into account the pre-existing period of balance of parole (which extended the effective period in custody by four months and four days from 30 August 2011 to 2 January 2012), the overall head sentence being served by the appellant on the day he appeared before her Honour was just over four years. The overall non-parole period being served by the appellant was two years and six months. The ratio between the overall non-parole period and the overall head sentence was 62.4%.

17As I have indicated, it was not disputed at the sentence hearing by the appellant's then lawyer that the Magistrate had a broad discretion as to the commencement date of the new sentences. However, she submitted that, because the offences founding the new sentences pre-dated the offences for which the appellant was already serving sentences, and were temporally connected to the escape, their non-parole period could be made concurrent with the pre-existing non-parole period to some degree. It was not disputed that the appellant had a very long record for criminal offences generally, and offences of the kind for which he was to be sentenced again in particular. Nor, as I have said, was any submission made about special circumstances.

18Before me it was accepted by both parties that, by way of the operation of s 58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the CSP Act), the longest head sentence that her Honour could impose was one year four months, cumulative upon the pre-existing overall head sentence. Section 58 relevantly provides:

58 Limitation on consecutive sentences imposed by Local Court

(1) The Local Court may not impose a new sentence of imprisonment to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with an existing sentence of imprisonment if the date on which the new sentence would end is more than 5 years after the date on which the existing sentence (or, if more than one, the first of them) began.

(2) Any period for which an existing sentence has been extended under this or any other Act is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.


...

(4) In this section:

existing sentence means an unexpired sentence, and includes any expired sentence or unbroken sequence of expired sentences with which the unexpired sentence is being served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively).

sentence of imprisonment includes an order referred to in section 33 (1) (g) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

Because of the joint position of the parties, I shall not pause to consider the mathematical correctness of that proposition.

19In concise extemporaneous remarks on sentence, her Honour at one stage said: 

The matters before the Court are break and enter and steal, there's take and drive conveyance and dishonestly obtain property by deception. The offences occurred on 15 January 2011, I have read the facts of the matter, had a look at the history, they each carry, well significant periods in custody which is impacted by the fact though that you are presently serving a sentence of three years and seven months so I could only - I am limited really in what I can do.

20Ultimately, with regard to each offence her Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of nine months to commence on 1 March 2014. A number of aspects of the effect of those new sentences on the overall custodial position of the appellant may be noted. 

21First, the sentence for each offence was wholly concurrent with the sentences for the other two offences. 

22Secondly, the learned Magistrate imposed the sentences to commence at the end of the pre-existing non-parole period. In other words, there was no partial concurrence between the pre-existing non-parole period and the new sentences. 

23Thirdly, there was no deviation from the ratio of 75% between the newly imposed non-parole period and the newly imposed head sentence. 

24Fourthly, considering the continuous custodial position of the appellant as a whole, he is now serving an unaltered overall head sentence of four years and three days that commenced on 30 August 2011 and expires on 1 September 2015. His new overall non-parole period is three years, three months and one day, comprising the four months and four days spent in custody for the balance of parole, the two years two months imposed by Judge Coorey, and the nine months fully cumulative imposed by the learned Magistrate (the apparent discrepancy of three days is caused by the differing lengths of calendar months). That new overall non-parole period expires on 30 November 2014. 

25Fifthly, to the extent that it is agreed that the Magistrate, because of the operation of s 58 of the CSP Act, was empowered to increase the overall non-parole period but not the overall head sentence, it was inevitable that any cumulation on the pre-existing non-parole period would ""cut into"" the pre-existing period on parole. 

26Sixthly, it can be seen that the new ratio between the extended overall non-parole period and the unaltered overall head sentence is 81.1%. 

27Seventhly, to express things another way, after having spent three years, three months and one day in continuous custody, the appellant will spend only nine months and two days on parole.

Legislative provisions

28Parliament has chosen to circumscribe sentence appeals from the Local Court to the Supreme Court. An appeal as of right must be founded on ""a ground that involves a question of law alone"": s 52 of the Act. Leave of this Court is required in order to appeal from the Local Court to the Supreme Court on a ground that involves a question of fact, or a question of mixed fact and law: s 53(1). The appellant did not seek that leave; he was content to found the appeal solely upon s 52 of the Act.

29Section 52 of the Act provides:

52 Appeals as of right

(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.

... 

30Section 55 relevantly provides:

55 Determination of appeals

...

(2) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against sentence:

(a) by setting aside the sentence, or

(b) by varying the sentence, or

(c) by setting aside the sentence and remitting the matter to the Local Court sitting at the place at which the original Local Court proceedings were held for redetermination, in relation to sentence, in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions, or

(d) by dismissing the appeal.

...

Submissions of the appellant before me

31The appellant accepted that, in the normal course, there would have been a severity appeal to the District Court. Due to oversight, that had become impossible. But the appellant submitted that, if it be the case that this matter falls within the parameters of the provision that permits an appeal to this Court, that foregone opportunity should play no role in me refusing relief.

32The appellant submitted that there was a question of law about the principles of totality that arose in these proceedings on sentence. It was said that the question manifested itself not only by way of the failure of her Honour to backdate the commencement of the new sentences to some degree (thereby failing to make the new head sentence and new non-parole period partly concurrent with the pre-existing non-parole period), but also by the failure of her Honour to find special circumstances and adjust the ratio between the newly imposed head sentence and new non-parole period (thereby failing to replicate, at the least, the pre-existing state of affairs that favoured the appellant).

33The appellant accepted that the appeal under consideration is more circumscribed than an appeal against sentence to the District Court, and indeed more circumscribed than an application for leave to appeal against sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. However, in submitting that what was before me was a question of law and not a question of mixed law and fact, the appellant relied in particular upon what was said by Bathurst CJ (with whom Adamson and Simpson JJ agreed) in his judgment in R v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31. That was an appeal by the Crown against a directed verdict of acquittal in a trial for manslaughter. Section 107(2) of the Act, the appeal creating provision, was in identical terms to s 52: 

The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any such acquittal on any ground that involves a question of law alone. 

34The Chief Justice said at [37]-[39]:

There remains the issue of whether the error of the trial judge was an error of law alone or an error of mixed fact and law. It was correctly accepted by the parties that the Crown was not entitled to appeal on a question of mixed fact and law. If what the trial judge did was to wrongly apply the correct principles to the facts, that would be an error of mixed fact and law and an appeal would not lie (see Smith v R (2000) 1 WLR 1644 at 1653).

The respondent contended that in the present case any error of the trial judge was an error of that nature and that at most the trial judge had wrongly concluded, in accordance with the correct principles, that there was not evidence on which a jury could convict, thereby committing an error of mixed fact and law.

Although support for this argument can be derived from the correct statement of the principles in the opening paragraphs of the judgment of the trial judge, it seems to me for the reasons set out above he failed to apply these principles in reaching his conclusion, in particular in his requirement of sufficient certainty and in his consideration of various hypotheses favourable to the accused. The trial judge in these circumstances in my view, applied incorrect principles to his consideration of the issue and thereby committed an error of law alone.

35Senior counsel also invited my attention to David Morse (Office of State Revenue) v Chan and Anor [2010] NSWSC 1290 at [26]-[28]. 

36With regard to interpreting the remarks on sentence of her Honour, the appellant submitted that the portion of them that I have extracted at [19] should be read as follows. Her Honour was referring to a restriction on her Honour's ability to backdate the commencement of the sentence, and not to a restriction on the quantum of the sentence able to be imposed beyond the expiry of the pre-existing overall non-parole period. In other words, I should interpret that passage as demonstrating an erroneous understanding and application of the law by the Magistrate, in that her Honour wrongly believed that there was some fetter on the Magistrate's ability to backdate the new sentences, thereby causing the Magistrate to reject that option after it had been raised by the solicitor for the appellant.

37It was accepted that no mention was made by the solicitor for the appellant of a finding of special circumstances. But the appellant submitted before me that, in the circumstances of this case, the seeming failure of the learned Magistrate to turn her Honour's mind to that question, and the undoubted failure to find special circumstances, itself constitutes a question of law alone and an error of law.

38The appellant submitted that, if I were satisfied that either error of law had occurred, in light of the imminent expiry of the non-parole period of the appellant in any event, it would not be practical for me to remit the matter to the Local Court. Rather, I should vary the commencement date of the new sentences or the length of the non-parole period myself, with the result that the appellant would be immediately eligible for consideration for release to parole.

Submissions of the Crown

39The Crown did not submit that the foregone opportunity to pursue a severity appeal in the District Court should play any role in forestalling the appellant from relief in this Court.

40The Crown placed a different interpretation on the passage that I have extracted at paragraph [19] above. It submitted that the passage should be read as a reference by the Magistrate to her Honour's understanding of the limitation imposed by s 58 of the CSP Act, and not any fetter on her Honour's discretion with regard to the starting date of the sentences.

41The Crown submitted that the appeal as framed did not pose a question of law alone, as required by s 52 of the Act. It referred to what was said by the Spigelman CJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and R A Hulme J agreed) in his Honour's judgment in R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A Crim R 199 at [26] as support for the proposition that application of a legal principle to the facts of a case involves a mixed question of fact and law, not a question of law alone.

42It was submitted that a question of law alone must be able to be stated with a degree of abstraction: see Bimson, Roads and Maritime Services v Damorange Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 734 at [40]. That is impossible here: the real complaint of the appellant is not about (for example) the correct interpretation of s 55 of the CSP Act (which deals with the question of concurrence with, and cumulation upon, pre-existing sentences), or the correct interpretation of s 44 of the same Act (which deals with the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence). Rather, the complaint of the appellant is a question of application of settled law to the particular facts with which her Honour was confronted.

43In any event, the Crown submitted that there was no error in the commencement date of the new sentences. The approach adopted was quite consistent with the CSP Act. Her Honour had a broad discretion as to when to commence the new sentences with regard to the pre-existing structure of the old ones: see generally R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 119 A Crim R 66. Furthermore, the solicitor for the appellant had specifically left open the option of commencing the new sentences on any date that seemed appropriate to the Magistrate.

44As for the question of special circumstances, the Crown emphasised that they were not sought in the Local Court. On the authority of Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 and subsequent cases, the Crown submitted that one should be cautious in permitting the appellant to complain about an aspect of sentence structure about which no submission was made in the Local Court.

45Leaving that aside, although it was perhaps open to the Magistrate to adjust the non-parole period downward, the circumstances hardly demanded that course. In short, the Crown submitted that there was no error of law or otherwise in the Magistrate not finding special circumstances and adjusting the new non-parole period.

46In summary, the Crown submitted that there was nothing wrong with the new sentences. It was well open to the discretion of the Magistrate to start the sentences when her Honour did, and not to find special circumstances. The sentences were unremarkable; indeed, lenient in light of the record of the appellant. 

What did the magistrate mean? 

47Turning first to determine the question of interpretation of the extract from the judgement, I do not regard it as a reference to a fetter on the starting date of the new sentences. I consider that it was a reference to the limitation founded on s 58 of the CSP Act. That is because, towards the end of the passage, her Honour referred to the ""significant periods in custody"" that could be imposed, but thereafter drew a contrast by way of limitation by using the word ""though"". I accept the submission of the Crown that her Honour was contrasting the substantial sentences of imprisonment that were available to her Honour, as a matter of theory, with the practical limitation on cumulation that arises from s 58 of the CSP Act. 

48It follows that I respectfully reject the submission of the appellant that that passage demonstrates an error of law with regard to possible commencement dates.

Question of law alone established?

49Turning next to the question of whether the appellant has established that a question of law alone has been demonstrated, I accept that there is no bright line between a question of law and a question of mixed fact and law. However I consider that a question concerning the application of correct legal principle to the facts of a particular case is a question of mixed fact and law: R v PL [2009] at [26]. The application of incorrect legal principle to the facts of a particular case on the other hand could give rise to a question of law alone: R v PL [2012] at [39].

50In my respectful opinion, the decision of David Morse (Office of State Revenue) v Chan is authority for the proposition that questions about the application of the principle of totality (correctly understood) are questions of mixed fact and law, not questions of law alone: see [26]-[30].

51To my mind, the appeal is founded upon a critique of the way in which a sentencing magistrate applied well-established principles to the evidence that was placed before her Honour. I think that the Magistrate applied the correct law of totality (including questions of cumulation and concurrence) in general, and commencement dates in particular, to the facts of this case. Those facts included, of course, the existence of the pre-existing sentence structure. In light of my finding about the passage extracted above at [19], I do not consider that the Magistrate misstated the principles of cumulation and concurrence, or somehow misunderstood them. Nor can one infer from the fact that the new sentences commence at the end of the pre-existing overall non-parole period that some error of law has occurred.

52As for the failure to find special circumstances that would reduce the ratio between the new non-parole period and the new head sentence, again there is no misstatement of principle or statute. It is possible that the learned Magistrate simply overlooked the question; it is also possible that, in a concise extemporaneous judgment with regard to the imposition of relatively short sentences, her Honour felt no need to refer to it. Speaking more generally, it is hard to accept that it is an error of law for a sentencing magistrate or judge to fail to refer in remarks on sentence to a legal principle if that judicial officer is not taken to it in the plea in mitigation by the lawyer for the defendant.

53I accept the submission of the Crown that what really founds this appeal is not a question of law alone, but rather a question about the application of well-settled legal principles to particular facts.

54Because the appeal was founded on establishment of one or other question of law alone, it follows that on this threshold basis the appeal should be dismissed.

Contingent determination - error of law leading to intervention?

55As against the possibility that I am wrong in my analysis to the effect that the appeal is not founded upon a question of law alone, I shall briefly turn to the question of whether, on the assumption that there is a question of law alone, the appellant has demonstrated an error of law that should lead me to intervene.

56As for the commencement date, it was not an error to commence the new sentences at the end of the pre-existing overall non-parole period. It is true to say that the Magistrate could have commenced the new sentences at an earlier date, thereby providing the appellant with the benefit of a degree of concurrence between the pre-existing non-parole period and the new head sentence and non-parole period. But it is well known that sentencing magistrates and judges have a broad discretion in that regard. It is also true to say that the absence of an earlier commencement date meant that every day of the new non-parole period ""cut into"" the pre-existing parole period, without the pre-existing overall head sentence being extended commensurately. But that is an inevitable side-effect of the limitation upon cumulation in the Local Court contained in s 58 of the CSP Act that generally markedly favours a defendant.

57I now turn to whether the failure to find special circumstances and consequently shorten the new non-parole period is an error of law. Special circumstances were not sought. If they had been sought, it is true that the Magistrate may have granted such an application, especially in light of the cumulation on the pre-existing sentence structure. But it is well known that the question of whether or not special circumstances have been established is a matter of discretion very much reposed in the sentencing magistrate or judge: see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704. It cannot be said that anything in the evidence before her Honour legally compelled a finding of special circumstances. As a result, I do not consider that it that it can be said that it was an error not to find special circumstances.

58In short, even if I am wrong in finding that there is no question of law alone that founds the appeal, I would nevertheless decline to interfere, on the basis that the appellant has not established either error of law for which he contends.

59It follows that I respectfully consider that the appeal must be dismissed.




Orders

60I make the following orders:

		15 October 2014",2014-10-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764994,R v Munoz [2014] NSWSC 1408,"Judgment

1By an indictment presented on 29 July 2014, Daniel Munoz is accused of murdering his wife, Melissa Munoz, on 20 October 2013 at Hobartville, NSW.

2Mr Munoz (""the accused"") has pleaded not guilty to this offence.

3He has elected to be tried without a jury: s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

4The Crown Prosecutor and senior counsel for the accused each submit that I should return a special verdict in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, of not guilty, upon the basis that Mr Munoz was:

""... mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his ... action, at the time when the act was done ..."".

Trial by Judge Alone

5Where an accused is tried without a jury, s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 imposes certain obligations upon the judge in reaching a verdict. That section provides:

""(1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.

(2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

(3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.""

6Section 133(2) requires me to expose in this judgment my reasoning process linking the principles of law with the facts found and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict reached: Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250. This requirement however does not extend to publishing a judgment in the form a summing up would have taken had the trial been before a jury: R v Winningham (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 May 1995).

7Section 133(3) requires me to set out any requirement on me to give a warning to the jury, had this trial been before a jury, as well as the reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or in consequence of it, I have reached a particular verdict: Fleming at [28].

Agreed Facts 

8The Crown and the accused agreed on all of the relevant facts surrounding the death in October 2013. The Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the Court. What follows is drawn from that statement. Although I am not bound by that statement, I am satisfied that I should make findings in accordance with the facts there set out.

The Initial Scene 

9As at October 2013, the accused, then 41 years old, was living with his mother in Westmead. His wife, the deceased, and their seven children were living at 14 Harold Avenue, Hobartville in NSW.

10At approximately 3.20pm on 20 October 2013, police responded to several 000 calls reporting a domestic assault at the deceased's house at Hobartville. 

11On arrival, police noticed the front screen door was closed, however the internal front door was open. Through the screen door, police observed the accused holding a knife and covered in blood. Police asked the accused where his wife was, to which he replied, ""I stabbed her, she's dead"". The accused was asked to come outside. He refused, and closed and locked the front door. The police kicked in the front door and a struggle ensued between the police and the accused in the lounge room of the house. The accused was ultimately subdued and handcuffed.

12The deceased was observed to be lying on the lounge room floor, suffering from multiple stab wounds to her stomach, chest and neck. Police commenced first aid, however after a short period of time it was clear she was deceased. Ambulance officers arrived shortly after, and pronounced life to be extinct. 

13The accused was conveyed to Windsor Police Station. A support person was nominated by the accused, and also attended the Police Station. 

Events leading up to the Killing 

14At the time of the killing in October 2013, the accused was married to the deceased. They had seven children together. 

15The accused had been in contact with mental health professionals since 1999, when he was first diagnosed with schizophrenia. He had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals and mental health facilities on various occasions over the years, including a period of hospitalisation at Cumberland Hospital. After discharge from that hospital, he was followed up at the Outpatients Department at St John of God Hospital. 

16Over time, the accused had been prescribed, and took, the anti-psychotic drug Risperidone as treatment for schizophrenia. Approximately two months prior to the day of the killing, the accused ceased to take his prescribed anti-psychotic medication. 

17Around this time, members of his family and neighbours noticed a significant deterioration in his mental condition. They observed that he had become increasingly irritable and aggressive, and had withdrawn from social interaction which he normally engaged in. During this period, he committed a number of traffic infringements and lost his driver's license. As a result, he also lost his job.

18On 7 September 2013, he assaulted his eldest son, Daniel. On 11 September 2013, an Apprehended Violence Order (""AVO"") was issued against him at Windsor Local Court. 

19In order to comply with the AVO, the accused moved out of the family home in Hobartville and returned to live with his mother at her home in Westmead. He remained in contact with his family and called his children nightly. He and the deceased argued frequently during this period.

20At some point during the two months leading up to the killing, the accused developed the delusional belief that the deceased and several of their children were having sexual intercourse in their house with a number of men. He spoke frequently with his elder sisters, Ms Sandra Walker and Ms Erika Brinsmead, along with other family members, about this belief. He told them that he had heard the sexual encounters taking place for a period of over 14 hours, through the telephone, which had not been correctly hung up by one of his children after his call one evening. He attempted to get assistance from his sisters to have the telephone company make a recording of what he said he had listened to. 

21On another occasion, the accused made a recording of what he had listened to on the telephone. He believed the recording captured similar conduct. He played the recording to his sister, Ms Erika Brinsmead. She stated that all she could hear on the recording was the deceased getting the children ready for bed, and then the deceased apparently watching television. The accused insisted that he could hear sexual activity and men present in the house. According to Ms Brinsmead, the accused was adamant that his children were being abused, and told her he was going to call the Department of Community Services to report the abuse. He became angry with both Ms Brinsmead and Ms Sandra Walker when they attempted to reason with him.

22At some point, the deceased and children became aware that the accused had formed these delusional beliefs. The deceased told the accused that these views were entirely incorrect. 

23On one occasion prior to the killing, the accused questioned two of his daughters about his beliefs. On this occasion the deceased was not present, however Ms Brinsmead was. At one stage his eight year old daughter nodded. The accused perceived this as indicating the veracity of his beliefs; however Ms Brinsmead stated the response was made out of fear. When the accused refused to desist in questioning the children, he was made to leave the premises. 

24During these two months leading up to the killing, various attempts were made by a number of the accused's family members to assist him in receiving medical treatment. They perceived him to be mentally unwell, in particular when he spoke of his belief that the deceased and children were engaging in sexual activities at the family home. Members of his family have stated that his eyes took on an appearance they had seen on previous occasions when he was mentally unwell or not taking his medication. 

25On 14 October 2013, a little under a week prior to the killing, the accused obtained a script for fortnightly injections of Risperdal. 

26On 17 October 2013, his eldest son, Daniel, took him to a doctor where the injection was administered. Daniel stated that he believed his father was happy because this was a step forward in allowing him to come home and see his family, as the deceased had said she would not consider getting back together with the accused unless he resumed taking his medication. The unchallenged medical evidence is that the drugs delivered by this injection would take at least two weeks before becoming effective.

Detailed Account of the Day of the Killing 

27At some point prior to 3.20pm on 20 October 2013, the accused was driven to the family home in Hobartville by his eldest son, to visit his children. 

28During the course of this visit, the two elder daughters, M (aged 16) and N (aged 14), took the three younger daughters, S (aged 10), Ml (aged 8) and H (aged 3), to a nearby park. Daniel, the eldest son was not present at either the house or the park. The youngest of the children, C (aged 20 months), remained at home with the deceased and the accused. 

29It was initially intended that the accused himself take the five children to the park, however just as they were leaving the house to go to the park, the accused told his children he needed to use the bathroom. The children left the house without him.

30In statements given to the police, both M and N stated that they heard the deceased cry for help from the house, whilst they were playing at the nearby park. M stated that they had only been at the park for a couple of minutes before she heard the deceased yell, ""Daniel, no!"" M and N returned to the house. 

31M told police that when she entered the house through the front door, she saw the deceased on the floor of the lounge room attempting to crawl away from the accused. She observed that there was blood everywhere. She left the house and noticed her neighbour speaking to the police over the phone. M re-entered the house and saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood on the lounge room floor. The accused was standing near the deceased. 

32N told police that when she returned to the house she saw blood everywhere. The deceased was on the ground telling the accused to get off her. N threw her mobile phone at the accused, which hit him in the head. She also yelled at him and hit him in an attempt to get him off the deceased. The accused, undeterred, continued to stab the deceased saying ""die bitch, die in the name of God die."" 

33N noticed that the knife used by the accused in the attack, was one from the family kitchen. 

34M and N left the premises and sought help from a nearby neighbour, who in turn contacted the police. 

35N returned to the house to collect her infant brother C, who was still inside the home. An emergency call made while N was inside the house recorded the accused saying, ""I know what's been happening in this house"".

36The two younger daughters, S and Ml, also witnessed the attack and gave accounts to the police consistent with those given by M and N.

Interview of the Accused at the Police Station

37At Windsor Police Station, the accused participated in an electronically recorded interview with police.

38During the interview, the accused admitted to stabbing the deceased multiple times. He told police that in stabbing the deceased, he was hoping to set her free from the evil spirits inside her. He said god had told him to stab her, and he knew she was going to die. 

39He told police that the deceased had been having sexual encounters with a number of men at the house which had lasted for many hours. He told them he believed the children were also involved. 

40The accused informed the police that he suffered from schizophrenia and had been on medication since 2000, though he had recently stopped taking his medication. 

Post-mortem Examination of the Deceased

41A post-mortem examination was undertaken by Dr Szentmariay, an expert forensic pathologist. The direct cause of death was multiple stab wounds. 

42Dr Szentmariay indicated that there were multiple stab wounds over the front of the left chest, and additional stab wounds over the front of the right chest. These stab wounds were relatively deep, injuring the underlying ribs, soft tissues, the heart, both lungs, and liver. The injuries caused haemorrhage and cardio-respiratory compromise. 

43In short, the injuries were many, and indicative of significant force, uncontrolled rage, and homicidal intent. 

Factual Conclusions

44From all of the Agreed Facts, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt that, on 20 October 2013, Mr Munoz, the accused, stabbed his wife, the deceased, thereby causing her death. I am satisfied that he did so, intending to kill her.

45I am satisfied of his intent beyond reasonable doubt because, of what he told police after the events, and, secondly, because of the number of stab wounds inflicted on the deceased, the locations where those stab wounds were inflicted, and the accused's failure to cease inflicting those injuries when his daughter attempted to stop him and whilst the deceased was lying, obviously incapacitated, on the ground. These features combine to make it plain that the killing occurred at a time when Mr Munoz was acting with the intention of killing his wife. 

46But for the defence of mental illness, to which it will be necessary to come, I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Crown has proved all of the elements of the offence of murder.

47Indeed, senior counsel for the accused did not submit to the Court that such findings ought not be made, nor did she present any argument which cast doubt on these being the appropriate findings. 

Mr Munoz's History and Mental State 

48The mental history and state of Mr Munoz was proved through the expert reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, an expert forensic psychiatrist, dated 16 February 2014, and Dr Stephen Allnutt, also an expert forensic psychiatrist, dated 2 April 2014. 

49Dr Nielssen examined Mr Munoz at the MRRC on 14 January 2014 and Dr Allnutt examined him at the MRRC on 24 March 2014. There is no significant disagreement between each of the experts. 

50In their reports, each of the experts has paid significant attention to the accused's medical history, acquired from medical records and orally from the accused. 

51I am satisfied that I should approach the histories provided to the psychiatrists, although principally admitted for the purpose of demonstrating their psychiatric opinions, as evidence of the truth of what the psychiatrists were told: s 60 Evidence Act 1995. 

52Mr Munoz was born on 14 August 1972 in Australia. He was the youngest of five children born to his parents who were of Mapoochie Indian heritage. He was the only one born in Australia after his family migrated from Chile. His father was a machinist, and his mother was a factory worker. His elder brother was a forklift driver, his eldest sister looked after students, his next eldest sister was a social worker and the youngest of his sisters was a florist, and now cares for his children. 

53Mr Munoz was born in Macquarie Fields and lived in that suburb for thirty years until he purchased the property at Hobartville. He had an apparently difficult childhood. His father died of a heart condition when he was aged nine or ten years old. He reported that while his father was alive, he was exposed to domestic violence and physical abuse. 

54He attended school to the end of year ten. He stated that he was in the ""low classes"" at school and had learning difficulties with reading and mathematics. He had many friends and got on well with teachers. However, he also had some behavioural problems which included, running away from home on one occasion, fighting, stealing, frequent truanting, damaging property and early onset substance abuse. 

55After leaving school, the accused had difficulty maintaining employment. He reported that this was due to his being unable to find something which he enjoyed, together with interpersonal conflicts in the workplace, poor motivation and concentration problems. He worked initially as a storeman at an Army depot in Moorebank, then fabricating sheets, and then in a frame and truss factory. He did not work for a period after his first children were born. In recent years, he worked as a forklift driver and as a security guard. He lost his job at a club in Springwood prior to the killing. 

56Mr Munoz met the deceased in around 1990 when she was working at McDonalds. They began seeing each other on weekends, and then moved in together in his mother's home. They had five children together, and were formally married in 2005. After marriage, they had another two children. They had never been separated, apart from the months before her death. The accused and the deceased separated after he assaulted his eldest son.

57Mr Munoz has a history of drug abuse. He began smoking cannabis at age 12, and began drinking alcohol at age 16. As well, he tried other drugs, including smoking heroin and inhaling cocaine. He also used some anabolic steroids while training in his early life. He has not used any other drug for many years.

58He discontinued smoking cannabis at age 27, after his first episode of mental illness and has not consumed it since. By the time he stopped using cannabis he was smoking around 18 cones per day, beginning first thing in the morning. 

59Mr Munoz was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1999, during a period of incarceration. He has a family history of the illness. He was first seen on 8 December 1999 by a psychiatrist, Dr Reed. He presented as perplexed and had a limited flow of thought. He had fears of going mad, believed people on television were laughing at him, he had persecutory ideas and was hallucinating. He was admitted to Long Bay Prison hospital. His reported psychotic symptoms resolved rapidly with neurological medication. 

60Mr Munoz also experienced periods of severe depression. He attempted suicide in 1999 in response to hearing voices. 

61On 13 August 2005, he was seen to be manifesting childlike behaviour. The deceased reported that he had bouts of aggressive behaviour since his diagnosis. He tended to drop off to sleep, have twitching in his hands and around his shoulders, and had a thickness of speech at times. 

62On 15 August 2005, he was admitted to Cumberland Hospital. His thoughts were disordered, he was wandering, he was removing clothes in front of his family and was easily agitated. He had ceased taking his prescribed Risperidone several months prior. It was noted he had a low TSH and a raised T2. Risperidone was commenced and he improved within one week, however he continued to have residual negative symptoms after he was discharged on 30 August 2005.

63A letter dated 30 August 2005, noted that he had commenced on Risperidone since his hospitalisation. He had a series of tests including a CT scan, which was normal. There was evidence of thyrotoxicosis, and a laboratory endocrinology showed results consistent with hypothyroidism. 

64A referral note dated 13 October 2005 noted that he had repressed behaviour, drowsiness, twitches, echolalia, inappropriate response and front lobe signs on cognitive testing. He had a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia. 

65In August 2013, approximately two months before the killing, the accused discontinued Risperidone, because he felt he did not need it. At that time he was living with his wife and children at their home in Hobartville. He was working in security, a role in which he had been working for around three years. There were no performance issues or conflicts with work colleagues and his relationship with his wife was good. He did not have concerns about her fidelity, and there were no significant arguments at that time. 

66After he discontinued his medication, he became more irritable and aggressive when driving, and ultimately lost his license. As a consequence of losing his license, he also lost his job. His mood deteriorated, and he spent his time looking after his children. He and his wife began to argue. He told Dr Nielssen:

""I became very aggressive ... I knew I wasn't the same ... I started arguing with my wife a lot ... the police were called a number of times ... she did not know I wasn't taking [the medication] ... I used to show her when I took it ... but I was putting it into a tissue and putting it in the bin.""

67In addition to these mood changes, the accused also began to hear voices coming from the left side of his brain. He described them as demon voices, soft and male, which worsened over time. Of these voices, he stated:

""They started overpowering me ... I started doing what they wanted me to do ... telling me to kill myself and hurt other people... they also said 'kill yourself, kill yourself'.""

68The accused also heard another voice on the right side of his brain, which he described as a ""good voice telling me Daniel no"". 

69In September 2013, the accused had a fight with his eldest son, Daniel, during which he got Daniel in a headlock. He stated that at this time the voices had told him to bash Daniel. His wife rang the police, and, as previously mentioned, an AVO was issued against him, and he left the matrimonial home and went to live with his mother. 

70Mr Munoz also had a confrontation with his brother. He told Dr Allnutt that it was because his brother had said something to him the wrong way. He heard voices saying ""hit him, hit him"". The police were not called. 

71On or around 23 September 2013, the accused had an argument over the phone with the deceased. He told Dr Allnutt that after that argument the deceased slammed the phone down, but it remained off the hook and he continued to listen. He heard people snorting something and heard the deceased say, ""hail Mythias"". He then heard people having sexual intercourse. He described hearing the bed head banging on the bedroom wall, and heard his son Daniel and another man engaging in sexual activity, identifiable by heavy breathing. He remained on the phone for a period of 14 hours and 11 minutes. 

72He told Dr Allnutt that during this time he passed the phone to his mother, she listened for a short time, and she said it was ""disgusting"". However, neither he nor his mother phoned the police. He stated that he did not call the police even though he could hear that his children were involved, because his ""head was everywhere at the time"", he was not thinking right and felt a ""buzzing feeling"" in his brain. 

73Mr Munoz did however, return to the house at Hobartville to check for evidence of what he had heard over the phone. He checked the bed and could see where the bed had hit the wall. He stated that there were black marks on the wall and the bars of the bedhead were broken. He took photographs for evidence. At a subsequent visit a few days later, he saw the bed was changed and believed this was evidence for what he had heard. 

74He told Dr Allnutt that until the telephone call he did not have thoughts regarding his wife's fidelity, however after the call he formed the view that she was prostituting herself and their three eldest children for money. Notwithstanding this, he continued to see his children on the weekends, but did not raise it with them. He could not recall discussing the matter with the deceased. 

75Leading up to the killing, his mood became increasingly irritable, his sleep was restless, he lost his appetite and weight, his energy levels were diminished and he felt lethargic. He had reduced motivation, he felt poorly about himself, he was more forgetful, and had reduced capacity for pleasure. He also believed he was going to die because he developed bad pains in his stomach. 

76During this period, he began to hear the voices in his head on a daily basis, saying things which tormented him. He had no sense of taste or smell but continued to see different colours. He believed the television was talking to him, and when he watched television it felt like people were staring at him with different coloured eyes. He interpreted this as something ""spiritual"", with the demon voices remaining on the left side of his brain when he watched television. 

77Mr Munoz also changed his religion from Christianity to Islam, at some point prior to the killing. He told Dr Allnutt that having heard his wife ""change to Mythias"", which he said was a Prophet of a Jewish God, he met some people in Parramatta who were handing out pamphlets and spoke to him about Islam. He said they spoke a few words and ""that was that"". 

78Both expert psychiatrists reviewed the electronically recorded interview in which the accused participated after he was arrested on the day of the killing. In that interview, he told police about his beliefs that the deceased and some of their children were participating in sexual activity in their house, and his beliefs had been confirmed by his inspection of the bed, and a conversation with one of his daughters. As recorded by Dr Allnutt, in the interview:

""[the accused] admitted that he stabbed her because of what was going on in his house, her affairs with different men and his kids having sex with he did not know who and worshipping Mythias... He was hoping to set [the deceased] free from the evil spirit that she had in her because there was life after death. He thought she would be with God because God told him to do it when he was at the house... He was in the kitchen when God spoke to him... God told him to stab her when he grabbed the knife. He could not recall how many times he stabbed her. He felt nothing at the time. God told him to keep stabbing her...When asked what God thought about the fact that he stabbed her he said ""it depends which God you worship it comes down to it, it depends which God you worship"" and stated that he worshipped Allah. He had been worshipping Allah for a number of months. He had turned to Islam and that in Islam they suggest if somebody does something wrong you can kill them if they have committed a great sin.""

79On 23 October 2013, three days after the killing, Mr Munoz was interviewed. It was reported that he had no thoughts of self-harm, though he acknowledged he had previously had those thoughts around 1999 and 2000 when he attempted suicide. He stated that he loved his wife but did not know what was going on in the house. He was hearing generally positive female voices saying ""you all right"" and sometimes saw figures. 

80On 25 October 2013, he was seen by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist noted that he had been previously diagnosed with psychosis within the prison environment. He restated his beliefs regarding sexual encounters in the house. He stated that he did not go to the house with the intent of killing the deceased, however he believed that in killing her he was protecting his family and there was no other option. At the time of the assessment he was dishevelled, thought to be suffering from delusions, he had poor insight and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. 

81He was subsequently seen on multiple occasions by the Psychiatric Registrar. On 4 November 2013, the Registrar concluded that he had a psychotic illness and a fixated paranoid belief surrounding his wife, likely of a delusional extent. He prescribed antipsychotic medication. In subsequent entries, the Registrar noted some inconsistencies in his psychotic symptoms, however he continued to prescribed antipsychotic medication.

Expert Opinion 

82When the accused was interviewed by Dr Allnutt he gave an account of the killing. Dr Allnutt records it as the following:

""On the day of the alleged offence he went to his wife's house to visit the children. They watched a movie. It was a Christian movie and then the movie finished. His wife told him to take his kids to the park. He said that the kids walked out ahead of him and he was the last to leave. As soon as he walked out of the front door he felt a spirit come towards him on the left. The kids had left for the park and he heard a voice saying that he should kill her, do it now. It was a male voice coming from the left side of his head and it sounded like a demon's voice. It felt as if he was a different person, it did not feel like it was him, it felt as if the demon was controlling him, he felt overpowered. He went to the kitchen and on the way to the kitchen he had thoughts of killing. He could not stop himself. He said, ""the demon's voice was too overpowering"". He got a knife, he went to the lounge and he stabbed her in the heart with the intention of killing her. The voices were telling him to do so, they were saying ""Daniel, kill her now"". He was still standing over her when the children returned and he told them to get out. He then remained in the lounge. He could not say why he would not allow the police in when they arrived.""

83Dr Allnutt asked the accused why he had told him it was a demon voice that he heard, Dr Allnutt recorded:

""[The accused] could not say why ... it was a demon voice that he heard and that it was Allah's voice when [he] spoke to police however he said the demon inside had told him that it was Allah."" 

84When interviewed by Dr Nielssen, the accused gave a similar account of the killing, he said:

""...my son came to pick me up from mum's house ... I went to my place to see the kids ... I said hello and we were watching a movie ... then I was trying to talk to [the deceased] and I said to [his daughter] take the little kids to the park ... I will be over there soon ... then I felt a spirit come in me ... then I went to the toilet and heard a demon voice telling me to do it now ... you won't get a chance like this again so I went and grabbed a knife and started stabbing my wife."" (sic.)

85Dr Allnutt, in his report of 2 April 2014, expressed the following expert opinion:

""In my opinion the defendant manifests symptoms consistent with a paranoid schizophrenia dating back many years with multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals characterised by persecutory delusions, religious delusions, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations and ideas of reference which has affected his interpersonal and occupational functioning through the years. 

...

He was maintaining adherence to Risperidone (at a relatively low dose). He discontinued medication in August 2013 and likely became unwell...Maintaining non-adherence to the medication his mental state gradually declined with the increasing emergence of auditory hallucinations.

...

He describes a telephone call that he had with his wife on 23 September 2013 in which for 14 hours 11 minutes (a significant period of time) he said he heard his wife and children having sex with various men. Paradoxically he did not call the police ... and he continued to see his children thereafter ... This kind of behaviour is consistent with irrational thought processes related to psychosis.

The [accused] has a ""disease of the mind"" characterised by psychosis which caused him a ""defect of reason"" at the material time of the alleged offence.

He maintained capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions.

On the day of the alleged offence he was at his wife's house visiting the children and experienced a voice consistent with auditory hallucinations. He describes that [he] felt overwhelmed by this experience and acted on the voice. He had incorporated his wife into an irrational belief system driven by a delusional belief of his wife's infidelity and sexual abuse of the children.

Under these circumstances he would not have been capable of reasoning about the matter of wrongfulness with a moderate degree of sense of composure as an ordinary person might.

Thus I believe that the defendant has available to him a defence of mental illness.""

86Dr Nielssen, in diagnosing Mr Munoz with chronic schizophrenia, expressed this opinion:

""The diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia is made on the basis of the history of typical symptoms of the illness, the history of a fairly typical pattern of treatment, and aspects of Mr Munoz's presentation, as he had the poverty of thinking and ambivalent insight that is also typical of chronic forms of the illness. Mr Munoz described experiencing irritable mood and irrational anger, hallucinations of voices and the emergence of beliefs that were interpreted to be delusional after ceasing treatment with antipsychotic medication. 

The statements of Mr Munoz's children, and the entries in the Justice Health medical records after his reception to prison confirm that he was affected by an exacerbation of schizophrenia at the time of the offence. He told the police that he had received an injection of Risperidone a week before the offence. However, there is a two week delay in the release of that preparation into the blood stream, and it is unlikely to have had much effect on his mental state at the time of the offence. 

...

Mr Munoz was thought to have the defence of mental illness available to him, as he has a chronic schizophrenic illness, which produces a pattern of abnormality or mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. At the time of the offence he was affected by a defect of reason in the form of the delusional belief that his wife was using drugs and was unfaithful to him and was also selling the children for sex. It is clear from his account that he was aware of the physical nature and quality of his actions in stabbing his wife. However, at the time of the offence he was deprived of the ability to recognise that his actions were morally wrong by the effect of his delusional belief and the irrational anger associated with the exacerbation of mental illness. He also told the police that he had experienced what might have been hallucinations of voices he took to be the voice of God telling him to commit the offence.""

87I accept the expert opinions of Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt and their evidence. Neither party submitted that I should not.

88However, I should say that I have formed the opinion that both of these experts have undertaken their task diligently and thoroughly. Their opinions are unqualified and seem to me to be properly based upon the material that they had. As well, the opinions accord with the inexpert and untutored view, which I would have reached as a matter of common sense. 

89As the tribunal of fact I am not bound by the opinion of any expert witness or any number of expert witnesses. However, this is a circumstance in which the expert witness engaged by the Crown, and whose evidence was not challenged by the accused, and the expert witness engaged by the defence, agree with each other. In those circumstances I should not reject the unanimous opinions of the expert witnesses unless there is evidence before me which would cast doubt on those opinions: R v Huy Pham [2007] NSWSC 1313 at [42] per James J; R v Coles [2008] NSWSC 682 at [9] per Grove J. Here, there is no such evidence.

Should a Special Verdict be Found?

90The issue to which I now turn my attention is whether that mental illness, which I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt existed, is sufficient to satisfy the legal tests to enable a special verdict to be found.

91Before I do so, I note that, had the proceedings been heard in a trial with a jury, there would have been an obligation on me to inform the jury of the legal and practical consequences of a special verdict. I bear all those matters in mind in considering my verdict in this case. In particular I note, and have regard to, the following matters:

(a)if my verdict is ""not guilty by reason of mental illness"", I have to decide what should then be done with the accused. If I am satisfied that neither his safety, nor the safety of any other member of the community is seriously put at risk by his release, I can order his release into the community either unconditionally or on conditions that I believe are necessary for his welfare and that of the community.

(b)if it is not appropriate to release the accused at this point in time, I can make an order that he be detained in custody until he is released by due process of law. This means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

(c)the composition and functions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, including its obligation to review a case of a forensic patient as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody, its obligation to review the patient at least once every six months, and its obligation not to release a forensic patient unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. 

92The real issue in this trial is whether the accused has available to him the defence of mental illness. The defence is a matter for the accused to establish, not beyond reasonable doubt, but on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659. If the accused does establish the defence of mental illness, then a special verdict is to be returned.

93Section 38(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides: 

""38 Special verdict

(1) If, in an indictment ..., an act ... is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his ... action at the time when the act was done ..., then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act ..., but was mentally ill at the time when the person did ... the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.""

94That section, and the Act as a whole, does not provide any definition of the term ""mentally ill"". The meaning of that term is determined in accordance with the M'Naughten Rules: R v M'Naughten (1843) 8 ER 718 at 722:

""Every man is presumed to be sane; and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, unless the contrary is proven ...; that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.""

95In order to persuade the Court to return a special verdict, it is necessary for Mr Munoz to persuade me, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time he killed his wife, he was suffering from a mental illness, which led to a defect of reason such that he did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 

96I am well satisfied that Mr Munoz knew what he was doing. He intended to kill his wife by stabbing her a number of times to the chest. Both expert psychiatrists were of the opinion that the accused knew the nature and quality of the acts he was performing. This was a brutal, vicious and unconstrained attack in the presence of several of the accused's children, which only stopped when Mr Munoz thought that his wife was dead. I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Munoz knew the nature and quality of his acts. 

97However, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the killing, Mr Munoz was mentally ill. He was at that time, and had been for a significant period, suffering chronic paranoid schizophrenia. This type of illness is a ""disease of the mind"". It was in an acute phase at the time of the killing, and was characterised by a number of delusional beliefs.

98The evidence of the two expert psychiatrists who are well qualified, highly experienced and eminently respected in their profession, persuades me to accept the view, and I find that, Mr Munoz did not know that what he was doing was wrong. He could not make that judgment because of his mental illness.

99Paranoid schizophrenia, a mental illness recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders - 5th Edition (DSM-V), generally has features such as the presence of prominent delusions, or auditory hallucinations. The delusions are typically characterised by being either persecutory or grandiose, or perhaps both. Religiosity is often a feature of the delusions. It is atypical of paranoid schizophrenics to see disorganised speech, disorganised or catatonic behaviour or negative symptoms.

100Because of his mental illness, Mr Munoz did not know what he was doing was wrong. Counter-intuitively, Mr Munoz thought that what he was doing was right.

101This issue is raised by the second part of the M'Naughten Rules. It is necessary here to remind myself of the proper direction which would in substance be given to a jury on this issue. I do so by reference to legal authority.

102In R v Porter [1933] HCA 1;(1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190, the test was formulated by Dixon J in the course of his summing up to a jury in these terms:

""The other head is of quite a different character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing, but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. That is the issue, the real question in this case. Was his state of mind of that character? I have used simple expressions, but when you are dealing with the unseen workings of the mind you have to come to close quarters with what you are speaking about, and it is very difficult to be quite clear as to what is meant in describing mental conditions. I have used the expression 'disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind.' That does not mean ... that there must be some physical deterioration of the cells of the brain ... you are dealing with a very different thing - with the understanding. It does mean that the functions of the understanding are through some cause, whether understandable or not, thrown into derangement or disorder.

Then I have used the expression 'know', 'knew that what he was doing was wrong'. We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act of killing at a particular time, a particular individual. We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.

If you think that at the time when he administered the poison to the child he had such a mental disorder or disturbance or derangement that he was incapable of reasoning about the right or wrongness, according to ordinary standards, of the thing which he was doing, not that he reasoned wrongly, or that being a responsible person he had queer or unsound ideas, but that he was quite incapable of taking into account the considerations which go to make right or wrong, then you should find him not guilty upon the ground that he was insane at the time he committed the acts charged.""

103The terms of this explanation of the second part of the M'Naughten test has been judicially approved: Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 55; (1952) 86 CLR 358; Regina v Matheis (1958) 58 SR (NSW) 321 at 322 per Owen J, Street CJ and Herron J agreeing; R v Matusevich & Thompson [1976] VR 470 at 477 per Young CJ, Starke and Nelson JJ.

104It is appropriate that I regard what Dixon J said as a practical synthesis of the concepts involved, and have regard to it, in undertaking the task which follows. 

105I have relied heavily on the expert opinions and evidence of Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt. Both counsel for the Crown, and counsel for the accused, submitted that I should accept these opinions, and hence I should be satisfied that Mr Munoz has available to him the defence of mental illness because he did not know, in all of the circumstances, that what he was doing was wrong. 

106In all of the circumstances, I consider that I should accept the expert psychiatric opinions and their evidence and, accordingly, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time he killed his wife, the accused, Mr Munoz, did not know that what he was doing was wrong. Accordingly, he was mentally ill, and a defence under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act has been established. 

107The consequence of finding in the accused's favour on the defence of mental illness is that I return a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. One possible consequence of that is that the accused could be discharged, either conditionally or unconditionally, into the community. Neither the Crown, nor counsel for Mr Munoz submitted that in all of the circumstances of this case, this would be appropriate. It clearly would not be appropriate.

108What will happen in this case is that the accused will be detained as a forensic patient until he is released by due process of law. In other words, he will remain in a secure facility and and come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

109In coming to my decision as to the appropriate verdict, I have taken into account the composition and functions of that Tribunal and the fact that the accused will not be released until it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release. His case will be reviewed by the Tribunal as soon as practicable and, if further detained, his case will be reviewed at six monthly intervals. If at some stage the accused is released, it may be on conditions that if any of those conditions are breached, or his mental condition deteriorates to a point where he may be a serious danger to others, the Tribunal may order that he be apprehended and further detained. 

Additional Charge

110There is an additional charge of breach of Apprehended Violence Order, which has been brought before this Court pursuant to a certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

111The Crown submitted that it would be in the interests of justice for this matter to be remitted to the Local Court, to be disposed of there after submissions are made to the presiding Magistrate.

112I am satisfied that it is in the interests that this matter be remitted to the Local Court for determination. Accordingly, I will order that the charge contained on the s 166 Certificate be remitted to the Local Court at Penrith for mention on 12 December 2014. 

Conclusion

113My conclusions, which I reached at the end of the trial on 13 October 2014, were that:

(2)I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts of the accused, Daniel Munoz, on 20 October 2013 caused the death of Melissa Munoz.

(3)I was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of that killing the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from a disease of the mind that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.

Verdict

114Accordingly, on 13 October 2014, for all of the reasons which I have set out above, I found the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness with respect to the sole count on the Indictment being the offence of murder contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900.

Orders

115On 13 October 2014, for all of the reasons which I have here set out, I made the following orders pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990:

(1)Order that Daniel Munoz be detained at the Psychiatric Ward, Long Bay Prison Hospital, or at such other place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of law.

(2)Direct the Registrar of the Court to notify the Minister for Health of this judgment and order.

(3)Direct the Registrar of the Court to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of this judgment and order and to provide to that Tribunal the following documentation:

(a)A copy of this judgment and orders;

(b)A transcript of these proceedings;

(c)A copy of each of the exhibits tendered at the trial.

116On 13 October 2014, I made the following order pursuant to s 169 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986:

(1)Order in the interests of justice that the offence set out in a Certificate dated 23 June 2014 pursuant to s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act, be remitted to the Local Court at Penrith for mention on 12 December 2014. 

(2)I excuse Mr Munoz from attendance at the Penrith Local Court on 12 October 2014, provided that he is legally represented.

2764996,Brown v R [2014] NSWCCA 215,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I agree with Garling J.
2R A HULME J:  I agree with Garling J. 
3GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court by his Honour Frearson DCJ, on 18 October 2013.  
4The applicant had pleaded guilty on 29 July 2013, to one offence contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Monique Latini.  
5The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 4 years was prescribed.  
6On 18 October 2013, the sentencing Judge imposed a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 4 months by way of a non-parole period, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months.  He ordered that the term of imprisonment commence on 26 November 2012.  
Facts
7An agreed Statement of Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge.  A brief summary of the relevant facts follows.
8The victim, Ms Latini, and the applicant, had, at the time of the offence, been in a domestic relationship for six years.  
9On 7 October 2011, a little over 12 months prior to the offence in question, an apprehended violence order had been granted against the applicant at the Wollongong Local Court.  The victim, Ms Latini, and her two children, were named as protected persons under that order.
10On 10 November 2012, the applicant and the victim went out for dinner together and later attended a rodeo held at a stadium in Wollongong.  During the evening they both consumed alcohol and argued.  After the rodeo finished, they returned to the applicant's home at about 11pm.  Both were affected by alcohol.
11After arriving at the applicant's home, he and the victim continued their argument.  During the course of the argument the applicant asked the victim to leave.  She did not, and the argument continued.  
12The applicant lost control and punched the victim on both sides of her face with his fists a number of times.  The victim felt that her left eye area had been badly injured, and thought she was going to lose consciousness.  Later, the applicant offered her some headache tables and anti-inflammatory tablets.
13The following morning the applicant drove the victim to a medical centre and instructed her to tell the doctor that it was not him that inflicted the injuries.  The victim was referred for x-rays and to the Wollongong Hospital for further examination.
14Upon examination, it was found that the victim suffered facial numbness, swelling and bruising to her face.  X-rays and scans showed that she had suffered fractures to her left lateral maxillary antrum (upper jaw), the zygomatic arch (cheek bone) - which fracture extended to the upper left inferior orbital margin (the eye socket).  As well, she had tenderness to the right side of her face.  
15She was referred for surgery.  The surgery required was an open reduction internal fixation of the left zygomatic fracture with the insertion of a 1.5mm plate.  
Proceedings on Sentence
16A Victim Impact Statement was read.  The victim set out the significant effect that the offence had had upon her.  
17A Pre-Sentence Report, which had been prepared with respect to the applicant, was also tendered.  The applicant had a considerable prior criminal history.  He had been the subject of prior management by Community Corrections, a part of Corrective Services.  The report in part dealt with that prior interaction.
18The Pre-Sentence Report noted that the applicant had been educated to School Certificate level and, at the time of his arrest, had been working as a general hand at a hotel where he had been in employment for about two years.  
19It recorded that the applicant had reported long-term untreated alcohol abuse, which had not been managed successfully.  The applicant gave an account of what occurred and, having agreed with the police facts, said that alcohol was a significant contributing factor to the offence.  He apparently also told the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that:
""... the victim was a very jealous person and this also contributed to the incident"".
20The Pre-Sentence Report assessed the applicant as being at a medium risk of re-offending.  
21It concluded with this assessment:
""The offender has displayed through the execution of his current offences and a number of historical violent offences, an inability to manage his own emotions.  He has displayed a lack of insight into the role of alcohol in both his historical and current offences.  In particular he tends to blame the victim for his record of violence towards her, and by doing so is indicating that he does not accept full responsibility for his domestic violence.
The offender's statements during this assessment committing to any identified program superficially appear to be reasonable.  However, he has in the past failed to attend such identified programs.  Additionally Mr Brown fails to see any difficulty between his untreated alcohol abuse issues and working in the role of a general hand at [a] hotel.""
22The applicant gave evidence himself, and tendered a report from Ms Duffy, an expert psychologist.  There were also a number of personal references tendered.  
23Ms Duffy recorded her opinion in a report dated 9 September 2013.  The report contains a comprehensive account of the applicant's personal background, and his educational and work history.  The applicant gave evidence that his history and background had been given accurately to Ms Duffy.
24The applicant told Ms Duffy that he had always experienced feelings of insecurity and had been easily roused to jealousy, and that these emotions were prominent in his relationship with Ms Latini.  Of his emotions and relationship with the victim, he said:
""Mr Brown acknowledged that his emotions have overwhelmed him at times, particularly during his relationship with Monique.  Whereas he could exercise controls whilst working in the pub and defuse situations, resolve conflicts and avoid physical confrontations, he had always found it much more difficult to deal with conflict in his personal relationships, particularly if he had been drinking.""
25The applicant reflected upon the offence in this way to Ms Duffy:
""Mr Brown expressed extreme remorse for his actions.  He recognised that it was the 'wrong thing', but then agreed that he did try and help her and take her to the doctor.  He acknowledged the feelings of insecurity and jealousy have undermined their relationship as he felt that he had never been able to trust her again because she was unfaithful to him while he was in jail.  He acknowledged that there has 'got to be a better way' than fighting, to the point where it reaches a physical altercation.  He stated that even when they started arguing at home, he had tried to get her to leave but she would not go, and the situation escalated.""
26Ms Duffy identified a series of programs, which would be suitable for the applicant, all of which addressed aspects of his offending behaviour.  She did not express any direct view as to his likelihood of re-offending.  
27The applicant himself gave evidence, and was cross-examined.
28He was asked what effect hearing Ms Latini's Victim Impact Statement had had on him.  He said it did not make him feel very good and that he appreciated how his conduct had impacted upon his victim.  Of that impact, he said this:
""Well, she sounded pretty emotional.  Yeah, it's not good I suppose her partner striking her, yeah, it's pretty bad.  I don't know, I don't really know what to say.  I'm sorry, ...""
29He told the Court that when he was released on parole he would attend various programs and obtain treatment for his alcohol abuse.  
30It was apparent from the material before the sentencing Judge that at the time he stood for sentence, the applicant was 46 years old.
Prior Criminal History
31As I have earlier said, the prior criminal history, which was before his Honour, was extensive.  The applicant first came before a court when he was 19 years of age, and continued to do so reasonably regularly until the offence in question.  Many of the offences, which brought him before a court related to conduct when he was affected by alcohol, and included offences of violence.  
32In 1997, the Sutherland Local Court dealt with the applicant for a series of offences, including two offences of breaching an Apprehended Violence Order, for which he was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service.  
33In 2002, he was before the Gosford Local Court for, amongst other things, contravening an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order, and for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 weeks.
34In 2004, the applicant was sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  Later in 2004, in the Blacktown Local Court the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 months for a common assault.
35In 2009, the applicant was sentenced in the Wollongong Local Court for offences that occurred in May of that year whilst he was on parole.  Those offences involved Ms Latini, who is the victim in the offence for which the applicant was sentenced, giving rise to this application.  The offences were stalking/intimidating the victim with the intention of causing her to fear physical or mental harm.  For this, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 months with a non-parole period of 6 months between May and November 2009.  He was also convicted of an offence of common assault against Ms Latini, for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months.
36In October 2010, he was brought before the Wollongong Local Court on one offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, where the victim was again Ms Latini, and also an offence of stalking/intimidating the victim with the intention of causing fear of physical or mental harm.  In respect of these offences, he was imprisoned for a period of 12 months, commencing in October 2010 with a non-parole period of 9 months.
37Whilst in jail, the applicant used the telephone to threaten to kill Ms Latini and her children.  For this further offence he was convicted and imprisoned for an additional term of 3 months, which commenced at the expiry of his previous term.  He was also sentenced to the same period of imprisonment because, in using the telephone in the way he did, he had contravened an apprehended violence order.  
38On 7 October 2011, the Nowra Local Court made an Apprehended Violence Order.  It was due to last for 2 years and the victim Ms Latini, and her children, were the protected persons.
39It was during the currency of this Apprehended Violence Order that the current offence occurred.  
40All of these matters were put before the sentencing Judge.  
Remarks on Sentence
41In his Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing Judge described the procedural background.  He noted that the plea had been entered on the first day of the trial, and that the plea was to an alternative count.  He noted that, in the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea was 10 per cent.
42His Honour then went on to note the existence of the offence of contravening a prohibition or restriction in an apprehended domestic violence order in respect of Ms Latini.  This offence had occurred at the time of the principal offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm recklessly on Ms Latini.  The offence of being in breach of the apprehended domestic violence order was to be taken into account on a Form 1.  His Honour noted the existence of the Form 1, and noted in particular that the fact that the applicant had been in breach of an apprehended violence order was of itself an aggravating factor, and that he needed to be cautious not to double count the circumstances of aggravation arising by reason of this breach.
43His Honour went on to set out the relevant facts, and he recounted in brief terms, the applicant's prior history.  In particular, he noted the prior offences of violence occasioned upon the same victim by the applicant, as was concerned with this offence.
44He concluded his review of the past conviction history in this way:
""I appreciate I have not read them all out, but the upshot is that the offender has a history of assaulting this partner and partners, and otherwise he has a Veen 2 record, which is morally illuminating and shows persistent disobedience.  In terms of s 21A, it is aggravating in terms of the sentence, not of course the objective gravity, but it is aggravating of the sentence itself and I take it into account in that way.""
45The reference to ""a Veen 2 record"" is a reference to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Veen v The Queen (No.2) [1988] HCA 14; (1987 - 1988) 164 CLR 465.
46The sentencing Judge then went on to summarise the facts in this way:
""When I look at the actual offence, it involves punches by a large strong-looking man, who has had a bit of boxing training, to a woman's face, indeed both sides of the face.  He fractured her jaw, cheekbone extending to the eye socket.  She has needed a plate in the head.  True it is he was intoxicated, and there is some, what one may term provocation, in terms of s 21A, but nothing that could remotely justify this type of drunken violence perpetrated on a woman, or the degree of it, not that any such violence is acceptable.  I accept that alcohol may contribute to a loss of self-control.  It obviously did not make the offender act out of character, this is the way he acts when he is intoxicated.  It may detract from the extent of deliberation.  I accept it was a spontaneous incident, a spontaneous assault, and I take that into account.  It was not planned, I take that into account.  There are countervailing considerations herein that the community and females in particular need to be protected from the offender, who has this propensity for drunken extreme violence.""
47His Honour then went on to consider where he might find the range of offending and said that if he were ""forced to say"" where the offence fitted, he would consider it to be a mid-range offence ""... somewhere in the mid-range"".  
48His Honour went on to deal with the subjective material.  He concluded that the applicant had shown remorse, but that he could not find that he was unlikely to re-offend.  He found that he had some prospects of rehabilitation, but they were guarded.
49The sentencing Judge noted that he had been provided with statistics of apparently comparable cases and, with respect to them, said this:
""I have been provided with the statistics.  They are a very blunt tool because one would need to know more particularly the facts of the cases, but here, there is a combination of the facts plus the Veen 2 record.""
50His Honour found special circumstances.
51Having imposed the sentence, he expressed the view that he considered the non-parole period to be ""the minimum that could possibly accommodate the gravity of the offence"".
Grounds of Appeal
52Together with the Application for Leave to Appeal, the applicant filed a Notice of Grounds of Appeal.  He nominated three grounds.  They are:
""1. His Honour erred in the way he used the appellant's criminal record.
2. His Honour erred in characterising the level of objective seriousness as being within the mid-range for offences of this type.
3. The sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive.""
Ground 1: Applicant's Prior Criminal Record
53The applicant submitted that the sentencing Judge erred in using the applicant's criminal record in the way he did.  The applicant drew attention to the Remarks on Sentence, which I have set out above at [4442] and [49], and submitted that the words were suggestive of the fact that his Honour had used the applicant's previous criminal record in determining the range of sentence appropriate for the offending conduct.  
54The applicant drew attention to the principles in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 2010 with respect to the proper use of a prior criminal record and, in particular, that prior offending was not an objective circumstance for the purpose of the application of the principle of proportionality, and nor was it open to a court to use prior convictions to determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence.
55Veen (No.2) is authority for the proposition that an antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but that it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence for which sentence is being imposed.  
56As Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said at [14]:
""The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence, a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law.  In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.  It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.""
57Their Honours made it plain that antecedent criminal history was relevant to more than simply an offender's claim for leniency.
58In Aslett v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 360 at [24], McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Hoeben JJ agreed) said:
""24. ... An offender is required to be sentenced to a punishment which can be no greater than the maximum range of punishment appropriate of the particular offence.  The role of any previous offending will not increase that punishment but may be taken into account in determining whether that maximum or some lesser punishment within the range should be imposed.  Prior offending may diminish any leniency which might otherwise be showed to the offender. ... ""
59In sentencing the applicant, the Judge was entitled to, and ought to have had regard to his previous criminal history.  He was, in accordance with authority, able to have regard to the record for the purpose of determining where, within the range of penalties properly open to be imposed, he should sentence the applicant.  The existence of the prior record diminished any claim which the applicant had to leniency.
60It seems to me that when his Honour, in his ex tempore Remarks on Sentence, referred in a shorthand way to a ""Veen 2 record"" which he described as ""morally illuminating and shows persistence disobedience"", his Honour was using no more than a shorthand description of the authorities to which I have just drawn attention.  That is, that the antecedent criminal history of the applicant is relevant in the ways described.  
61The Remarks on Sentence delivered by his Honour do not indicate the presence of any error on their face.  Nor can it be said, as the applicant submits, that such an error must have occurred by reference to the overall sentence which is less than 50 per cent of the available maximum.  The applicant's previous history was lengthy.  His history was one correctly characterised as showing ""persistent disobedience"".  
62I would not uphold this Ground.
Ground 2: Level of Objective Seriousness
63His Honour extensively dealt with the facts and confined his remarks on the level of objective seriousness in the way to which reference has been made in [46].
64The applicant submits that the characterisation of the level of objective seriousness as being within the mid-range or, as the sentencing Judge described it ""...somewhere in the mid-range"", is an error of a kind which justifies intervention by this Court.  
65The applicant submitted that the seriousness of the injury will be a major factor in the determination of the objective gravity of the offence and that, having regard to the injuries sustained here, which were at the low end of the scale, there ought to have been a finding that the offending was at that end of the scale.  
66As well, the appellant pointed to the fact that the offence did not involve the use of any weapon other than the applicant's fists, it was of brief duration, it was not pre-planned but was spontaneous, and it occurred in the context of the victim being asked to leave the applicant's premises.  
67The applicant noted that the sentencing Judge had found that the offence was one of impulsivity, and that it occurred in circumstances where both parties were probably well affected by alcohol.  His Honour found, and the applicant relied on, the fact that the consumption of alcohol may have contributed to a loss of self-control on the part of the applicant.
68In seeking to challenge the sentencing Judge's assessment that this crime fell within the mid-range, the applicant is confronted with the clear authority of this Court that the assessment by a sentencing Judge of the objective seriousness of an offence is a matter which is not ordinarily susceptible of interference on appeal.
69Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson J agreed) said in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] this:
""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.  This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.  The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.""
70It is not contended by the applicant that there was any discrete error in the fact finding process by the sentencing Judge.  Nor is it suggested that any part of the objective circumstances were overlooked.  Rather, the applicant seeks to attack the characterisation of the facts as being within mid-range.
71I am not persuaded that the characterisation of the objective seriousness was not open to his Honour, the sentencing Judge.  It may be accepted that the assault was brief, but on the other hand it was fierce.  There were a number of fractures which required open fixation and the insertion of a plate to enable them to heal.  Both sides of the victim's face were involved and she has been left with no feeling in the left side.  The appellant was much stronger than the victim, and used his physical strength in the assault.  
72Not only was it, in my opinion, open to his Honour to find the characterisation as he did, but in my view, his Honour was correct.
73I would not uphold this Ground.
Ground 3:  Manifest Excess74To succeed on this Ground, the applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6].  
75In Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [58] with respect to the issue of manifest inadequacy or excess of a sentence:
""In this ... kind of case appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases.  Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons.""
76The applicant submitted that by reference to Judicial Commission Sentencing statistics, only a very small percentage, approximately seven per cent, received a comparable sentence to that of the applicant in cases where a plea of guilty had been entered.  It was submitted that by reference to those statistics, at least 90 per cent of offenders received a head sentence less than the applicant.  
77Finally, the applicant submitted:
""... that when proper consideration is given to the objective seriousness of this offence, it does not warrant a head sentence nor a non-parole period in the top 10 % of sentences for this type of matter, and it is submitted that the sentence is therefore 'unreasonable or plainly unjust'. ""
78The Court has cautioned about the use of statistics as the sole measure for determining manifest excess.  
79In Barbaro v The Queen, Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 305 ALR 323 at [41], French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ said:
""... in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases.  Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed.  But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion.  The history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence.""
80It is important to note that the High Court has said in many cases that the consistency in sentencing which is sought from intermediate appellate courts, is not numerical equivalence but rather consistency in the application of relevant legal principle: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010 HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [48]-[49]; Barbaro at [40].
81In offences such as the one with which the Court is here concerned, the statistics from the Judicial Commission are a particularly blunt tool because the injuries which were actually inflicted are not described.  Whether the sentences which were imposed upon offenders who had a prior criminal history, and what that criminal history was, are not described and, the range of possible factual circumstances involved in an offence such as this is broad.  
82The statutory guidelines in this case of the maximum penalty, and the standard non-parole period can be another point of reference.
83I would be prepared to accept that the sentence which was imposed was not a lenient sentence.  Some would describe it as being at the upper end of the range of available sentences.  What is plain, however, is that the sentence is not so harsh as to take it outside of the legitimate bounds which were reasonably open to the sentencing Judge.  
84I am wholly unpersuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
85I would not uphold the appeal on that basis. 
Conclusion
86It follows that were leave granted to appeal, the appeal would not succeed.
87However, I would grant leave, because, having regard to the nature of the submissions, the applicant had a legitimate concern about the length of the sentence, and whether, in all of the circumstances, the findings of the sentencing Judge were appropriate.
88In those circumstances, I would propose the following orders:
(1)Application for leave to appeal granted;
(2)Appeal dismissed.

2764998,R v Viridian [2014] NSWDC 265,"Judgment


	
	A boy barely into his teenage years and driven by curiosity sexually assaulted a six year old girl. The assault was very serious. He penetrated her vagina with his finger. The girl - commendably and sensibly - immediately reported what had happened to her parents. The boy owned up straightaway.
	
	
	The boy soon realised how serious his behaviour had been. He was arrested and charged with a crime. It was no ordinary crime. The crime is called sexual intercourse with a person under ten. It is made into a crime by s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, a law enacted by the Parliament of New South Wales.
	
	
	Parliament regards that crime as so serious that it has fixed to it a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. Not only that, Parliament has specified that a judge should take into account in sentencing a person for that offence - as a guide - that normally a person would serve a minimum of fifteen years imprisonment in full time gaol as a standard non-parole period for that crime.
	
	
	The boy also realised the other consequences of his criminal behaviour. There was an estrangement between the two families, his and the little girl’s family, who were formerly friends. There was a significant degree of active community disapproval within the small country town where he lives.
	
	
	It is my job today to sentence the boy, having heard evidence from him yesterday and arguments from his barrister, Mr X, and the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Y.
	
	
	First it is important to say that I have not referred to the name of the boy. These remarks that I am making in sentencing the boy are likely to be published. The boy will be referred to by a pseudonym. I will not refer to the town where he lives, and I will direct that in any publication of these remarks that there be no reference to where I am sitting in these sittings.
	
	
	I should say briefly what is agreed between the prosecution and the defence as a statement of what happened.
	
	
	As I said, the victim was a six year old girl. The boy had just turned fourteen a month beforehand. Both families were friends. On 2 April 2014 the little girl was at a birthday party of the boy’s sister. During the afternoon the boy and the little girl were in the yard when the boy asked the girl what she was wearing under her dress. She said “gym nicks” and he asked to see under them. What happened then is described in the agreed facts as follows - “He pulled down the nicks and placed his finger just inside her vagina. She asked him to stop as it hurt and he did so.”
	
	
	As I said, the little girl disclosed what had happened to her mother who immediately returned to the party and asked the boy’s mother. They both asked the boy who confessed straightaway. He ended up at the police station where he appeared to the police officer “quite remorseful and continued to make admissions” about what he had done.
	
	
	The little girl had to be taken to a hospital. She was examined by a doctor. The “results of the examination were consistent with the allegations” made by her. There were “no identified physical injuries” to her fortunately.
	
	
	The boy was arrested and charged. The boy has no prior criminal convictions.
	
	
	A victim impact statement has been prepared by the little girl’s mother. I do not propose to read it all, but I am going to read parts of it. I have read it all and so has the boy, who read it all when he was giving evidence yesterday.
	
	
	A conscious effort was made by the little girl’s parents “to sever all ties with all members” of the boy’s family. Beforehand “we were family friends and spent a lot of time together”. The attendance at hospital which I referred to “was frightening” for the little girl. She had to be examined by a paediatrician and was …“not allowed to shower, felt dirty as she usually showers twice a day and was worried about her school uniform, underwear and school shoes being put in the brown bag as school photos were the following day”. She was “scared, crying a lot in the first 24 - 48hrs, slept badly”. The little girl’s family live close to the boy’s family and the little girl “was constantly scared about running into the offender”. The family is aware that they might see the boy in town.
	
	
	The little girl “asked many hypothetical questions on a regular basis”, especially at night time. She “spent a lot of time thinking about the situation”. She asked a lot of questions and slept badly compared to her sleep pattern beforehand. She needed constant reassurance that she would be all right “and that the offender would not come near her again”. When she attends the local netball courts she is particularly nervous because that is not far from where the boy lives. She still worries and is thankfully in a very protected and supportive environment at her home.
	
	
	The boy’s sister “was our family baby-sitter and she spent a lot of time at our place and regularly stayed in our home”. One consequence of the crime is of course that the baby-sitting relationship ended. The little girl “adored her” and has often referred to the situation and asked many questions.
	
	
	The impact on the little girl spilt over into her schooling. Fortunately her work was not affected “but her need to discuss the incident with her close friends at inappropriate times became a concern”. Of course she had missed some school at the time that it occurred in order to go to the hospital. She had missed the class photograph. The teachers are monitoring the little girl’s behaviour and the parents have regular meetings with the staff at school.
	
	
	The little girl’s mother concluded that “this incident has had a dramatic effect on the way [the little girl] now lives”. They minimise the time they spend in the country town where her family and the boy’s family live. They have to change route when travelling. It is difficult to explain to the little girl and there is a “constant necessity in the need to avoid contact” with the boy in order to ensure that the little girl feels safe.
	
	
	This statement graphically illustrates the kind of impact which this sort of crime can have on its victim, particularly a victim as young as this one. It is important that a judge always bears in mind in sentencing an offender just how serious the crime was. That is why I have set out at the start all that I have said about the offence, and the impact which it has had on its victim.
	
	
	It is important to bear that in mind because a judge then also must take into account the personal circumstances of the offender himself or herself. That is an important aspect of sentencing. When offenders are represented in Court their lawyer will bring forth evidence about the offender’s circumstances and personal features so that they can make arguments which might affect or reduce the sentence. This is the purpose of legal representation and the purpose of Court proceedings in this country.
	
	
	The nature of Court proceedings in this country is adversarial. One party is the Director of Public Prosecutions and the other party is the offender in a case such as this. Each party is competently represented and the arguments on both sides are presented. That has happened competently and effectively in this case.
	
	
	Having said that, I should now turn to some of the material which has been put forward about the boy offender.
	
	
	One thing I say at the commencement is that he pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. The law in New South Wales is this. A person can plead not guilty and go to trial. A jury is summoned, as will happen with another case in these sittings, to determine whether or not the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused. That obviously takes many days and is a very costly process for the criminal justice system. If an accused person pleads guilty then the law recognises, as a practicality, the savings which the plea of guilty makes in the justice system. Other cases can be put in because the plea of guilty means that that particular case will be much shorter. It will take hours instead of days.
	
	
	That has happened in this case. The law in New South Wales is that the earlier a person pleads guilty the higher the discount. In this case the prosecution and the defence agree that the boy has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. The law provides that he will get 25% discount on any prison sentence which I impose. I will be imposing a prison sentence although I have announced that I will suspend it. And I will be discounting the prison sentence by 25% in due course because of his early plea of guilty.
	
	
	In this case there were two very helpful reports about the boy. When a child - that is, at law, a person under 18 - commits an offence, the New South Wales Juvenile Justice prepares a report. A very detailed report, dated 10 October 2014, has been prepared in this case. In addition in this case, Mr X and his instructing solicitor have obtained a report from a local clinical and forensic psychologist, dated 6 October 2014.
	
	
	Both of those documents have been very helpful in assisting me with this case. Not only that, Mr X called his client to give evidence.
	
	
	I said yesterday, and I repeat, I have heard evidence obviously in my professional capacity many times over the years. This boy’s evidence was impressive. He struck me as insightful and sincere in what he said. He realised the impact which his behaviour had had, and its seriousness. He extended what appeared to me to be a sincere apology to the victim of his crime, the little girl, and to her mother, who was in Court at the time that he gave evidence. He extended his apology to his own family. I accept his evidence.
	
	
	One more thing I need to decide, before giving detail about the personal circumstances of the boy, is to assess how serious an example of this crime this case is.
	
	
	As I said in argument, this crime covers a lot of conduct. One has to be graphic in describing such conduct. In a hypothetical example, a forty-five year old predatory man could have full penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with a seven year old girl to the extent of ejaculating inside her without a condom. That is just an example, but it would be the same offence. He would be charged with the same crime. The fact that the boy’s crime falls within the same law shows just how serious the crime is regarded by Parliament. But it is equally clear that, in the hypothetical example I gave, that is a far more serious instance of the offence than in this case.
	
	
	I do not isolate the fact that in the hypothetical example, I used penetration by the penis, whereas in this case it involves penetration with the finger. But all the circumstances of the hypothetical case are different to those of this case. The predatory nature of the man, the age of the man, the nature of the intercourse and unprotected ejaculation are all factors which are not present in this case.
	
	
	In addition, it is clear from the helpful psychological report and from the boy’s evidence, that the driving factor was more curiosity and inquisitiveness rather than a sexual drive and sexual satisfaction.
	
	
	That does not make the act committed any less serious, but motivation is part of assessing the seriousness of the crime.
	
	
	In this case, we have been told that the boy had inappropriate and unsupervised access to pornography on the internet. He had been viewing it for a couple of years, obviously as he matured into puberty and towards adulthood. He explained to the counsellor and to me in Court that part of the motivation was to see a vagina in real life. That is why he wanted to see, as he said, inside a vagina. He acknowledged in Court and to the counsellor “a degree of sexual arousal upon seeing the child’s vagina”.
	
	
	The psychologist concluded that the boy “was considered to have been out of his depth in managing psychologically the impact of the viewing of pornography on him. There also appears to have been inadequate supervision of his use of the Internet and his mobile phone.” This is important for me in assessing the seriousness of the case. As he said to the psychologist, he “had wanted to see a vagina in real life given his exposure to the pornography.”
	
	
	I also need to take into account that the victim of his crime was very young. It is obviously a more serious example of the crime if a victim is two or three years old than if a victim is eight or nine years old. So in this case the victim was six years old, well under the maximum age of ten for an offence to have been committed of this kind. Fortunately for the girl the penetration was “just inside her vagina” and the boy stopped as soon as she said that it hurt.
	
	
	Mr X submitted that the offence should be regarded as towards the lower end of the scale in degree of seriousness. I agree with that submission. It was acknowledged to be an appropriate submission by Mr Y as well.
	
	
	Given the age of the boy - just maturing through puberty into adulthood - and his motivation, but as well as taking into account the age of the girl, I regard it as quite low in the degree of seriousness, but not so low as to avoid a prison sentence.
	
	
	As I said, the boy had just turned fourteen when he committed this offence. His father had died the same year that he was born. He has a stable and firm relationship with his mother and his brother and sister at home. He has also developed a relationship with the school counsellor at the school that he attends. She has been very supportive and intervened at various stages, particularly when the boy was subjected to rumours and bullying. The boy is continuing to see the counsellor in a constructive and helpful way.
	
	
	The boy had some employment in the country town where he lived, but that employment was terminated. He was sacked. The boy’s mother explained to him that that was because of what the employer had learned about what he had done. Not only that, the boy had been a member of the local swimming club for nine years - a long time given his age. The local swimming club had a meeting and resolved that the boy be expelled from the club and that his membership be cancelled, based upon misconduct.
	
	
	I repeat, the boy has strong family support, especially from his mother. The Juvenile Justice report said that she “appears to be a very strong support and advocate” for the boy “whilst also being able to acknowledge the distress that the offence has caused to the victim and her family”. The report noted that the boy’s mother “has acted proactively in this matter” engaging the services of the psychologist to address the boy’s needs very quickly after the incident occurred. The Juvenile Justice report indicated that assessments show that the boy “accepts full responsibility for the offence and displays signs of remorse and guilt”. It noted his ongoing counselling with the counsellor and said that Juvenile Justice intervention “could include the development of an individualised case plan to address any other areas of need which are identified through ongoing supervision and assessment”. I should add that the Juvenile Justice report confirmed the boy’s expression of remorse and that he was prepared to accept full responsibility for what happened.
	
	
	A Judge needs to look at the prospects that an offender whom the Judge is sentencing will be able to rehabilitate themselves. In fact that is specifically one of the purposes of sentencing which the law in New South Wales acknowledges as important. Again, it has set it out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that one of the purposes of sentencing, apart from making an offender accountable for their actions and denouncing the conduct and recognising the harm to the victim is “to promote the rehabilitation of the offender”.
	
	
	In addition, in a case where a Court is sentencing a child - again, I mean a person who is under eighteen - the law provides for certain principles to be taken into account. They are set out in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The principles include that children committing offences bear responsibility for their actions “but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance”. It is desirable “to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption”. It acknowledges a child’s “rights and freedoms before the law” equal to those of adults. It acknowledges the importance of allowing a child to stay at home and acknowledges the desirability that “children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties.” It acknowledges as well the importance of consideration to the effect on the victim which I have acknowledged in this case.
	
	
	The boy’s prospects of rehabilitation are, in my opinion, very good. He is in a supportive family and is getting active assistance from the psychologist and from the school counsellor. I repeat, I was particularly impressed by the boy volunteering his insights about the effect which the pornography had on him. He had learned this through counselling. His schoolwork has in fact improved and he is managing to maintain some friendships, although others have obviously been affected.
	
	
	I think it is unlikely that he will re-offend in this way. I do not say that lightly, but I say it based upon the evidence before me. The Juvenile Justice report includes standard assessments, which indicate that the factors pointing towards rehabilitation are not elevated in the boy’s case. The psychologist’s report also said that based on “the information gained during the course of assessment and treatment, it is considered he is in the low range in relation to risk of re-offending”. The psychologist has set out a plan for dealing with ongoing treatment. He has already had five sessions with the counsellor.
	
	
	Mr X pointed to the significant degree of extra curial punishment. That means this. Sometimes an offender who is being punished by way of sentence by the Court comes to Court with a history of punishment already inflicted legally but outside the Court system. This case is a classic example. We know from the evidence that the boy has been excluded from his local swimming club. I do not comment on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of that exclusion. It is not my business. But it is the case that the boy who was a member for some nine years can no longer go there. He has lost his job and because knowledge of his crime is apparently known generally within the community of the town, his prospects of re-employment may be slim. He avoids the sport of basketball which he used to enjoy because of the fear that he would not be accepted back. As a result of his crime, an apprehended violence order has been taken out which limits his behaviour extensively. The effect of it is that he can no longer attend the Church he used to attend and needs to avoid any contact with the little girl. Once again, I do not comment on the appropriateness of this, but the impact is that he is suffering from an extensive social punishment as well as the punishment that I will impose. Mr X emphasised, and I accept, the impact which this kind of extra curial punishment has particularly in a small country town.
	
	
	There is also an impact on the boy’s own family which has to be acknowledged.
	
	
	Mr X argued that this may be a case where I could proceed without imposing a conviction under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Y argued on the other hand that this case was entirely inappropriate for such a course.
	
	
	I am inclined to agree with Mr Y. The statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales seem to support Mr Y. No-one else has received the benefit of an order under s 10, despite the small database of some thirty-one offenders. People are either sent to full time gaol or given prison sentences, which are suspended.
	
	
	I repeat, this was a serious offence. Just because it is at the lower end of the scale of seriousness compared to other hypothetical examples does not mean that it is not serious. A Judge has to bear in mind that Parliament has fixed the maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment and envisages that normally an offender may spend fifteen years in gaol before getting parole.
	
	
	The little girl in this case was only six. For that reason I think that the only appropriate sentence in this case is one of imprisonment. The question is how that should be served. I might add that I accept Mr Y’s submission that a good behaviour bond under s 9 would also fall short of an appropriate punishment.
	
	
	I should correct myself. A question to determine before how the prison sentence should be served is how long the prison sentence should be. Having regard to the seriousness of the offending behaviour I would regard an appropriate prison sentence as being one of two and a half years or thirty months in prison. However, the boy has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I therefore will discount that sentence by 25%, as the law provides. I will round that discount off to twenty-two months, or one year and ten months in prison.
	
	
	I now, in the correct sequence, turn to the question of how the prison sentence should be served. Mr Y acknowledged that it would be not inappropriate for the sentence to be suspended. Mr X said that his fallback position would be that a prison sentence should be suspended. I think, given the importance of rehabilitation in this case and the active measures which the boy is taking to rehabilitate himself and the importance of the factors which I have mentioned for me to take into account in sentencing children, that it is an appropriate course in this case to suspend the sentence.
	
	
	In due course when I make the formal orders I will impose a suspended sentence of one year and ten months.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Now Mr X and Mr Y, in suspending the sentence I need to impose some conditions on the bond. Obviously good behaviour. Now what did Juvenile Justice say about supervision?

X: Your Honour, can I just raise one thing?

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

X: I don’t think it was actually raised in the submissions from either my friend or myself. It’s been brought to my attention by Mr Z that one aspect, and I’m not sure if your Honour’s going to address this, but I’ll raise it. Concerning s 19(1) of the--

HIS HONOUR: I know, I am coming to that in a moment. I was alerted to it by something here, in fact the last paragraph in the Juvenile Justice report I want to come to that. Can I just look at the conditions first. They said somewhere they could help - I read it out, I quoted it.


	
	It is on p 7 of 8: “Due to [Angus Viridian]’s ongoing engagement in specific counselling with Dr [Name], casework intervention from Juvenile Justice could include development of an individualised case plan”.
	


HIS HONOUR:   So I just need your help Mr X and your help Mr Y as to how to formulate the conditions of the bond so far as Dr [Name] and Juvenile Justice are concerned.

Y: I guess the base provision would be to accept the supervision of Juvenile Justice as they deem fit.

HIS HONOUR: If they want to.

Y: If they want to, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

Y: So if he - I guess if he’s part of their programme for six months and they deem that he doesn’t need to be any more then--

HIS HONOUR: Well that is all right. Or indeed if they think well he can stay with Dr [Name] and we do not really need to step in--

Y: That’s fine.

HIS HONOUR: --then that is appropriate.

Y: But if you make a general order under the supervision of Juvenile Justice until they deem - something along those lines--

HIS HONOUR: What about Dr [Name]?

Y: Well I guess they could incorporate that themselves. If they see that Dr [Name]--

HIS HONOUR: Well I thought, yes.

Y: Mr Z’s just pointed out that to attend other counselling or like services as directed by Juvenile Justice. So that way essentially Juvenile Justice want to ensure he goes to see Dr [Name] so--

HIS HONOUR: So we put it with Juvenile Justice, okay.

Y: --means that they can say “You have to go see him, it’s part of the - our supervision”--

HIS HONOUR: So I do not make a direct order about Dr [Name], but I would make an order to accept supervision from Juvenile Justice and to take whatever their recommendations are for treatment.

Y: That way it gives more flexibility to Juvenile Justice and just in case - I mean Dr [Name], who knows, if they leave and you’ve made a specific order for that.

HIS HONOUR: So he’ll see somebody else.

Y: So there’s flexibility I think in that--

HIS HONOUR: All right, Mr X what about the school, have a think about the school counsellor as well. Yes?

X: I think if your Honour mentions the whole - the trio, the school counsellor, Ms [Name], Dr--

HIS HONOUR: [Name].

X: --and just under an umbrella of being directed by Juvenile Justice.

HIS HONOUR: What if I put him in supervision of Juvenile Justice and for him to attend such other psychologists, or counsellors as they direct.

X: Direct and approve.

HIS HONOUR: Direct and approve. And as Mr Y says, if you know somebody leaves a practice or changes schools or something, it means that they have the flexibility whereas if I limit it to Dr [Name] and Ms [Name], then that is less flexible.

X: I understand and I think it’s quite clearly a situation - particularly with the Juvenile Justice report, they understand where the benefits are coming from--

HIS HONOUR: Yes they do.

X: --from Dr [Name] and Ms [Name], so I wouldn’t expect there to be any change.

HIS HONOUR: I think you are right, so they can just coordinate and let it happen with Dr [Name] and Ms [Name], all right. Now what does s 19 say?

X: It goes to your Honour directing that a sentence of imprisonment, as is your Honour’s intention with this matter, be served by the offender as a juvenile offender.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you yes. And so it is a s 19(1) direction.

X: Right. So for example if the offender were to breach your Honour’s order would there be some assistance given at a later date as to how it should be served?

HIS HONOUR: Well the sentence is only twenty-two months, so he is not going to reach eighteen - sorry I am just reading, subs (3) which they referred to, so that is not relevant. And I do not think I fix a non-parole period for a suspended sentence.

X: No.

HIS HONOUR: All right good, let us formulate some orders. If you would stand up Angus Viridian.


	
	I sentence you to twenty-two months imprisonment. Under s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole period and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for twenty-two months. The conditions of the good behaviour bond - I will explain them to you in a moment, but I should state them formally - are these: That you be of good behaviour; that you accept supervision from Juvenile Justice and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions as to treatment by a psychologist or a counsellor as they make; and that you accept any individualised case plan that Juvenile Justice develops.
	
	
	Under s 19(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 I make an order directing that the whole of the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender.
	
	
	I note that under s 14 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act I have not exercised my power to proceed to or record a conviction.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Now Angus Viridian, you have heard everything that I said - and it took much longer than I thought, it always does - and I have had to sentence you for that very serious thing that you did to that little girl. I have given you a prison sentence. It is one year and ten months, but I have suspended it which means it is up there hanging over you. You have got to stay out of trouble for the next twenty-two months. You are not allowed to commit any of the things that sometimes teenage boys get up to, which might attract the attention of the police. You have got to stay out of trouble. You have got to allow Juvenile Justice to supervise you and help you, do you understand that? They will no doubt say good, keep up the good work with Dr [Name] and [Name], that is very good. And if there is any change in either of those they will help you. They might develop a plan with you to help you into the future. You have to let them do that.


	
	Another condition which I will now fix is, which I forgot, that you attend Court if called upon to do so and another condition is that you notify the registrar of this Court of any change in your residential address.
	


HIS HONOUR:   They are formal but important. If you change your address, if you mum moves and you have moved with her to another address, your mum or you have to ring up the Court here and tell them where you are, so that if they need to come and find you they know where to find you. And if you get a notice saying to come to Court you come up, you do not have the sheriff or the police chasing you. I am confident I will not see you again and nor will any other Judge or magistrate because of what I have said. I am also confident of the progress you are making to sort yourself out and deal with this very serious problem that has cropped up early in your life, but you have got many, many years of life ahead of you and I expect that it will probably make you a more mature person as you go through life with this experience, but we have got to deal with that now. I have not recorded any conviction, so you do not go into life with a criminal record. One important thing that Mr X and Mr Z will explain to you regarding a suspended sentence and the good behaviour bond, it is really important that you do not breach it because what happens if you breach it, you know if you pinch a car, or something like that, you come back before the Court because you have breached your bond, and I am doing cases like that in these sittings with adults, my hands are tied, I have pretty well got to send you to gaol, which you do not want to do. The law makes it very strict. So they will both explain that to you. They will take you to the Court Registry this morning where you will have to sign a bond, probably with your mother as a witness I imagine, and they will explain to you, or one of them will, the bond. So do you understand all that? Do you want to ask me any questions, feel free to ask questions? Okay, all right.

HIS HONOUR:   Now I have done my job of sentencing you. It has taken a long time because it was a very serious crime, but you are a quite young offender, very young offender, and so you have heard me give all the reasons and things that I have to give in dealing with it. But it is now finished and it is over to you. I repeat, I am confident that with your mum’s support, and your family support and that counselling that you will move on in life and do everything that is expected - that you hope to do. So good luck, all right.

		12 February 2015",2014-10-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764999,R v Sumpton [2014] NSWSC 1432,"Judgment
1The accused is charged with murder.  He seeks the exclusion of a police interview conducted with him on 25 May 2012 (""the impugned interview"").  The interview was conducted in a cell adjacent to the charge room of the Grafton Police Station and was recorded by means of a hand held digital recorder.  The interview contains significant admissions.  The accused submits that the admissions were influenced by oppressive conduct on the part of the police and relies on the provisions of s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  He also submits that it is unfair to use the evidence given the circumstances in which the admissions were made: s 90 of the Evidence Act.  Finally, he submits that the admissions were obtained improperly or unlawfully and seeks exclusion of the interview pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act.
2I have found resolution of the objection extremely difficult.  It would be a significant step to exclude evidence of the accused's confession to murder.  On the other hand, the conduct of the police and the circumstances in which the admissions were made have been subject to very substantial and valid criticism. 
3Submissions on the voir dire concluded at around 3:00 pm on Friday 10 October 2014.  Two jury panels were summoned for the trial to commence today (Monday 13 October 2014).  I have deferred the attendance of those panels until tomorrow.  These reasons have been prepared in that context and are, by necessity, less extensive than the careful arguments of the parties deserve. 
THE CASE IN A NUTSHELL
4Early in the morning of 18 May 2012, police and firefighters attended a house fire at the home of Michelle Roberts in South Grafton.  The accused was present immediately outside of the house when the fire brigade arrived.  Inside the house, the emergency workers found the body of Michelle Roberts.  She was dead.  Post mortem examination showed that she died of multiple stab wounds and also had injuries consistent with blunt force trauma.  The forensic evidence relating to the fire supports an inference that the fire was deliberately set.  5It is the Crown case that the accused was attempting to have some form of sexual liaison with the victim and, for reasons that are unexplained, became violent and killed her by stabbing and bashing her.  He then attempted to cover up his deed by setting fire to the house.  The prosecution case appears to be a powerful one.  
6In the days following the murder, and up until the time of the impugned interview, the accused gave a series of exculpatory accounts to the police.  This included a signed statement and recorded interview on 18 May 2012 and an electronically recorded interview consisting of more than 2,500 questions on the evening of 24 May and into the early hours (12:50 am) of 25 May 2012 (""the ERISP"").  At some time around 1:00 pm on that day, detectives spoke to the accused in the cells at Grafton police station.  He confessed.  It is that confession that is subject to this ruling.
THE EVIDENCE ON THE VOIR DIRE
7The evidence on the voir dire was taken from Tuesday 7 to Thursday 9 October and I received comprehensive and helpful submissions from both counsel on Thursday 9 and Friday 10 October 2014. 
8Exhibit VD-1 is a bundle of documents tendered by the prosecution.  It included the statements of relevant police officers, the custody management records, the typed statement signed by the accused on 18 May 2012 and the transcripts of recordings of conversations between police and the accused on 18 May 2012, 19 May 2012, 24 May 2012 (2) and 25 May 2012. 
9Exhibit VD-2 is a CD containing an electronic copy of the audio recording of the impugned interview.  This recording was played in Court on the first day of the voir dire.  
10Exhibit VD-3 is a certificate of analysis relating to the DNA analysis.  
11Exhibit VD-4 is a transcription of the Duty Book of Detective Burke relating to events of 25 May 2012 and in particular arrangements to get the accused to Court on that day.
12Exhibits VD-5 and VD-6 are respectively a transfer note and a detention warrant extending the statutory investigation period.  
13Exhibit VD-7 is the Crown case statement and this is supplemented by exhibit VD-8, a statement of Andrew John Hayes dated 8 October 2014.  The latter document emerged upon material being produced on subpoena for the purpose of the voir dire. 
14Detectives Sippel and Burke (who conducted the ERISP and the impugned interview) gave evidence as did Officers Williams, Ruehe, Gibson and Osborne, each of whom played some role in the management of the accused while he was in police custody. The accused also gave evidence.  
15In addition to the documents and oral evidence, a view of relevant places at the Grafton Police Station was conducted in the presence of the accused.  Inspector Gillette played the role of ""pointer"" or ""shower"" and he gave short evidence on the voir dire.  
THE PROSECUTION CASE
16As I have said, the prosecution case against the accused appears to be a powerful one.  In point form, it is to the following effect:The accused was with the deceased shortly before she was killed.The accused was present at the scene after she was killed and when fire fighters arrived. Evidence of three separate seats of fire supports the conclusion that the fire was deliberately lit. The cause of death was multiple stab wounds and Ms Roberts also suffered a number of other injuries consistent with her having been severely beaten.The deceased had her underpants around her knees supporting the inference that there was some form of sexual encounter before she was killed.The accused had a number of scratch marks on his body.The accused had a burn to his hand.  The accused asked a neighbour (Darius Ohlsen) to support a false version to the police as to how he had obtained the scratch marks (that he had fallen from a chair). The accused told a number of deliberate and material lies, supporting a consciousness of guilt.  These included (but are not limited to):Lies as to what he was wearing.Lies as to his inability to have sex or his lack of interest in sex. The accused demonstrated a consciousness of guilt by:Washing his clothing and shoes shortly after the murder.Requesting his neighbour to perpetrate the false account as to how he obtained his injuries.The ERISP contains answers that are either demonstrably false or risible. On admission to the Grafton Correctional Centre, the accused made admissions to a Co-ordinator (Andrew Hayes) in which he said that he had been with the victim drinking all day, that he blacked out and ""woke up with blood all over himself and she was a mess"".  He told Mr Hayes that he set the place on fire because ""she was fucked and I had to get rid of the evidence"".  Mr Hayes made notes of this conversation shortly afterwards.While sharing a cell with a man (""ZS"") the accused made substantial admissions including that he had ""flipped out"" and used a ""serrated knife"" to stab the victim.  He said he had scratches on his lower back from the victim trying to fight him off.  He said that he had thought about trying to get rid of the body but had set the house on fire instead.  He went home and washed his clothes and then returned to the scene. There is DNA evidence supporting the inference that the victim's blood was on the accused's shoes.  The statistical improbability of the blood being that of another person is extremely high.There is DNA evidence supporting the inference that the accused's DNA was under the fingernails of the victim. The Crown intends (subject to objection) to rely on evidence of a number of witnesses said to establish a relevant tendency in the accused.  The victim was of ""Asian"" appearance.  There is evidence from a variety of sources that the accused watched ""Asian porn"" and visited Asian prostitutes.  This evidence goes to support the Crown case theory that there was ""sexualised contact"" between the accused and the victim during which the accused became angry. Apart from its admissibility as tendency evidence, the Crown also relies on that body of evidence to prove that the accused told lies to investigating police in relation to his interest in sex and capacity to have sex. 
THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF THE ACCUSED
17The accused was arrested at 5:07 pm on 24 May 2012 at his home in South Grafton.  He was taken before the Magistrate at Coffs Harbour at around 4:11 pm the following day: cf ss 99, 114 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities Act 2002 (NSW) (""LEPRA"").  18Upon his arrest, the accused was informed that he was under arrest for the murder of Ms Roberts and told that he did not have to say anything.  The police recorded the conversation that then occurred. That conversation concluded at 5:16 pm and the accused was taken to Grafton Police Station.
19The accused arrived at Grafton Police Station at 5:30 pm on 24 May 2012.  He was entered into custody. Sergeant Williams created (or commenced) a custody management record at 5:48 pm.  Sergeant Williams was the Custody Manager from that time until 2:41 am when Senior Constable Pipes took over. Sergeant Ruehe replaced SC Pipes at 6am.
20I accept, in spite of the accused's somewhat diffident evidence on the subject, that Sgt Williams read the document setting out the accused's rights pursuant to Part 9 LEPRA a few minutes before 6:00 pm.  From the records, that appears to have taken about 10 to 15 minutes.  It appears that the accused was in the dock at that time.  The dock is a small Perspex box in front of the charge desk.  
21The accused was moved to ""Cell 1"" at around 6:15 pm and provided with dinner at 6:35 pm.  Cell 1 is in the same room as the charge desk and dock.  It is a relatively small ""room"", the front of which appears to be constructed of transparent Perspex.  The bed ""only consists of a foam mattress, which would be covered in some sort of vinyl and there [is] a blanket or a number of blankets"" (T 166).  
22At 7:06 pm the accused was observed to be ""in good health"".  At 7:08 pm he was moved from the cell to ""ERISP room 1"".  That room is a very short walk (about 30 seconds) from the charging area.  It is around a corner and down a corridor.  Unlike the charging area, dock and cells it is not under video surveillance.  It is small, windowless, room with facilities capable of recording (video and audio) interviews between police and witnesses or suspects.  
23The ERISP was commenced at around 7:12 pm.  Present in the room were the accused and Detectives Sippel and Burke.  Based on the transcript, the accused was then asked 1,252 questions although that is not precisely accurate because a number of questions involved interchange between the participants in the conversation.  Mr Sippel conducted most of the interrogation although Mr Burke also asked questions.   
24At around 9:00 pm Detective Burke said ""We'll have a break"".  The accused was told that they would ""take a break for a couple of minutes"".  
25At 9:04 pm the accused was returned to Cell 1.  At 10:35 pm he was said to be ""in good health resting in cell awaiting detention warrant application"".  
26During this period, a detention warrant was obtained from Mr Piper, an authorised officer under Part 9 of LEPRA: see s 118 LEPRA.  The warrant extended the maximum investigation period by six hours commencing on 10:10 pm on 24 May 2012.  The six hour extension ""excluded times that are not to be taken into account under s 117 LEPRA"".  The accused spoke to the Magistrate who granted the detention warrant (Q 1270-1275).  
27The accused was returned to ERISP room 1 at 10:51 pm.  The ERISP recommenced at 10:51 pm.
28At around 12:30 am on 25 May 2014 the questioning started to become inappropriate and improper.  Shortly after 12:42 am the accused said ""we're gunna terminate the interview as effectively as of right now"".  Mr Sippel said ""the reason you're stopping the interview is that you have murdered this lady"" and continued for a short time to direct questions at the accused.
29Inspector Williams entered ERISP room 1 at around 12:46 am.  The accused made a complaint to him as to the conduct of the officers.  That complaint was to the effect that the officers had called him a liar.  On the other hand, he said that Inspector Williams had ""been brilliant actually"".  
30There is a conflict in the evidence as to whether or not, shortly after this, the accused told Mr Sippel that he wanted to see a lawyer, to which Mr Sippel responded ""I don't care what you want.""  
31The accused was returned to Cell 1 at 12:55 am.  Certain forensic procedures were undertaken at around 1:10 am in the ERISP room.  
32The custody management record shows that the charging process took place from 1:43 am and 4:00 am.  There is no evidence as to precisely what this involved or why it took in excess of 2 hours.  However, nothing turns on that matter except to note that the accused was observed to ""appear ok"" in the cell at 2:45 am and 3:20 am.  
33The accused was observed to be asleep in his cell at 4:42 am, 5:33 am, 6:32 am, 7:08 am, 7:35 am and 8:14 am.  He was given breakfast at 8:35 am and requested a cigarette (which he was given) at 9:24 am.
34I interpolate here that the accused was charged within the time required by the warrant extending the investigation period.  However, once he was charged at about 4:00 am, s 99 of LEPRA required him to be taken before an ""authorised officer"" to be dealt with according to law ""as soon as is reasonably practicable"".  The accused concedes that the earliest time that it was reasonably practicable to take him before an authorised officer was the opening of ordinary business hours.  The parties agree that this was 9:00 am on 25 May 2014.  The evidence is, and the prosecution concedes, that the Registrar of the Grafton Local Court was an authorised officer and was available at and from around that time.  
35In spite of the availability of an authorised officer at the Court House next door to the police station, the accused was still in the cell at Grafton Police Station at 2:00 pm and beyond.  In the meantime, he had made the impugned confession.  
36I turn to consider how that transpired and what happened between 9:24 am, when the accused was permitted to smoke a cigarette, and 4:03 pm when the records show that the accused was spoken to by a solicitor before going before the Magistrate in Coffs Harbour. 
37The custody management records suggest that at 10:12 am, 10:58 am and 12:17 am the accused was sleeping in his cell.  During that period of time, according to the evidence of Mr Ruehe, Mr Sippel and Mr Burke, the police were making enquiries and decisions about whether the accused would be taken before the Registrar in Grafton or the Magistrate in Coffs Harbour.   Initially it seems that the intention was to take the accused before the Registrar at Grafton Local Court.  There was no reason that this could not be done shortly after 9:00 am.  However, police were concerned that there was no Police Prosecutor in Grafton at the time and also that they may wish to seek a suppression order as to the victim's injuries.  Mr Burke says that he attempted to consult a lawyer about the suppression order.  There was also consultation with the Police Prosecutor in Coffs Harbour.  
38In any event, a decision was taken to transfer the accused to Coffs Harbour.  Precisely when and by whom that decision was made is unclear on the evidence.  There is no sound reason why that decision could not have been taken very shortly after 9:00 am.  39There is no evidence that the accused was made aware that he was to be taken before a Magistrate at Coffs Harbour at any time between the time he was charged (sometime before 4:00 am) and shortly before 1:00 pm.  There is some evidence, to which I will return, that he may have been told this at around 12:53 pm, that is shortly before the impugned interview.  
40In any event, once the decision was taken, arrangements had to be made to transfer the accused from Grafton to Coffs Harbour.  That proved to be problematic.  Sergeant Ruehe gave evidence of how busy he was (""I was all over the place"").  He said that there were insufficient police in Grafton to allow two of them to take the accused to Coffs Harbour.  He could not say when he became aware of the transport difficulty.  He was asked if it was 10:00 am, 11:00 am or 12:00 pm and replied ""I cannot give you an exact time"".  He tried to organise a ""half way run"" whereby police form Grafton would meet police from Coffs Harbour between the two towns.  This could not be arranged.  Eventually, detectives from Coffs Harbour came to collect the accused.  The evidence does not permit a precise finding as to when that occurred but it was after 1:48 pm (when the impugned interview concluded).   Mr Ruehe thought that the records suggested that the accused arrived at Coffs Harbour Police Station at around 2:38 pm.  
41Mr Burke and Mr Ruehe were asked whether police could have been recalled to duty to transport the accused.  Both officers agreed that this was possible but that each knew that their superiors would not allow it. Mr Burke said:""Without tarnishing the name or the good name of the Coffs/Clarence Local Area Command overtime is a very difficult subject to broach with anyone"".
42Mr Ruehe gave the following evidence:""Q. Is that because the transporting of a prisoner to court is not seen as a high priority issue?A.  No, that's because basically we - we depend, we're reactive police officers, we depend on - on servicing our community.  We prioritise any and every job and if we've got say a serious domestic or other work to do then that's going to be more important.  Obviously we'll prioritise, so where possible, I mean it's in our interests to go and transport a prisoner as soon as possible, because as soon as I would have gotten Mr Sumpton down at Coffs Harbour, he's no longer my responsibility so I'm going to do my darndest to get him down there, but obviously on the day, the resources just weren't available.  
Q. So you didn't ask for anyone to be recalled to duty because you expected based on your experience that the answer would be no?A. That's correct.""
And:""Q. The transport, would it be fair to say that the transporting of prisoners in the Coffs/Clarence Local Area Command is not a matter that is seen as warranting recall to duty of any additional officers?A.  That's pretty much right.
Q.  And that fact goes some way to explaining the delay in transporting Mr Sumpton?A. That's correct.""
43The Crown Prosecutor agreed that the way this evidence was given suggested that Sgt Ruehe thought that ""he'd almost be laughed at for asking"" for police to be recalled to transport the accused to Coffs Harbour.
44At around 12:53 pm Sgt Ruehe printed a document entitled ""receipt of records"".  This is page 12 of the custody management record.  This is, potentially, an important document. The document is to be completed just prior to a prisoner being transferred.  It is initialled by the accused in seven places and signed by him at the bottom.  Sergeant Ruehe said that his practice of many years was to print this document and immediately have the accused sign it.  However, he could not say whether he did or did not do this on this occasion.  If he followed his usual practice, Sgt Ruehe said that the accused would have signed the document before the impugned interview commenced.  The accused himself conceded that this was possible.  However, Sgt Ruehe could not exclude the possibility that the document was printed at around 12:53 pm but not signed until shortly before the appellant left Grafton police station, that is after the impugned interview.  Beneath the signature of the accused is a space for the date and time of signing to be recorded.  The date is recorded as 25/5/12.  The time space is blank.  
45At some time at around 1:00 pm on 25 May 2012 Detectives Sippel and Burke entered the cell where the accused had been since the early hours of that day.  They had a conversation that was not recorded electronically and not adopted in the course of the impugned interview.  The accused did not dispute the substance of this conversation although there is an issue as to whether, at the end of the conversation, the accused said ""give me five"", meaning ""give me five minutes to decide whether I want to be interviewed again"".  The detectives say that he did.  The accused denies this. The detectives gave evidence that they were not sure exactly what the accused meant by saying ""give me five"".  There is also a dispute as to whether the accused told the detectives to ""fuck off"".  The accused says that he did.  The detectives deny this.
46On the basis of what followed, it is more likely than not that the accused did say words to the effect of ""give me five"" and did not tell the officers to fuck off.  What followed is that the detectives returned to the cell at around 1:09 pm with a hand held digital recorder and conducted the impugned interview. 
47After the impugned interview was conducted the accused was transferred to Coffs Harbour Police Station.  He saw a solicitor at about 4:03pm.  He was then taken before the Magistrate. 
THE ACCUSED WAS DETAINED UNLAWFULLY
48I find that at the time of the impugned interview, the accused was subject of unlawful detention.
49He was not taken before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law ""as soon as [was] reasonably practicable"" after he was charged: cf s 99 LEPRA and compare the somewhat different circumstances in Regina v Dungay [2001] NSWCCA 443; 126 A Crim R 216.
50Once it became clear to the police that there was to be a significant delay in transporting the accused to Coffs Harbour, the question of taking him before the Registrar in Grafton should have been, and was not, revisited. 
51I do not accept that the resistance of the Local Area Command to pay police overtime for transporting prisoners justifies a failure to comply with the requirements of the law.  I do not accept that the difficulties in arranging transport, or the preference to take the accused before the Magistrate in Coffs Harbour, means that it was not reasonably practicable to take the accused before an authorised officer until after 4:00 pm on 25 May 2012.  
52Sergeant Ruehe, who was the custody manager from 6:00 am until the accused left Grafton, was not made aware that the accused had terminated the ERISP at around 1:00 am.  Although the evidence is silent on the issue, it seems that he was unaware of the complaint made to Sgt Williams.    Whether he would have conducted himself differently if he had been aware of this information is not known.  What is known is that he was, on his own account, extremely busy (""all over the place"").  
53On the basis of all of the evidence, I have concluded that compliance with the requirements of the law (and the possibility that the accused was unlawfully detained) was a matter of some indifference to the police charged with the responsibility of the investigation and the custody management of the accused. 
IMPROPER QUESTIONING OF THE ACCUSED
54The Crown Prosecutor does not dispute the fact that a number of the questions asked by the police in the ERISP were ""inappropriate"".  He said I would be justified in criticising the detectives and described their conduct as ""wrongheaded, undesirable, poor questioning technique and various other matters"". He conceded that some of the questioning was ""improper"" although he fell short of conceding that the questioning was improper for the purpose of s 138 of the Evidence Act.     55The prosecutor's concession is a fair one although, in light of the material, it would have been difficult to take any other stance.  By contrast, the detectives generally asserted in cross-examination that they could see nothing wrong with their questioning of the accused. 
56Mr Dennis who has ably represented the accused on the voir dire approached the matter by grouping the questions in what he describes as different themes.  The themes were these:(1)Questions assuming the guilt of the accused.
(2)Questions asking the accused to comment on the evidence of other witnesses and, in particular, asking him to comment on why those other witnesses might have said things they allegedly said.
(3)Questions reversing the onus of proof.
(4)Questions involving misrepresentations of the evidence.
(5)Questions belittling the accused or ridiculing his account.
(6)Questions tending to undermine the accused's right to silence. 57Mr Dennis submits that taken globally, the questioning was ""grossly"" improper and taken with the length of the accused's detention and other matters, amounted to oppressive conduct for the purpose of s 84 of the Evidence Act. 
58I propose, given the limited time available to prepare this judgment, to refer to some of the most flagrant examples of inappropriate questioning.    
59When the accused was arrested, the following conversation occurred:Q.Do you understand you're under arrest for the murder of Michelle Roberts?A.I just don't believe it.
Q.All right.  I want to know why you did it.""
60This question assumed the guilt of the accused.  It was asked before the appellant was taken to the police station and provided with his rights under LEPRA.  There was a caution administered but Mr Dennis is correct when he submits that the question should not have been asked.  Mr Sippel said that he could see nothing improper in this approach and claimed that he was simply ""putting the allegation to him which I would be required to do"" and advising him as to why he was under arrest.   He denied that he was focussed on obtaining an admission. I do not accept Mr Sippel's evidence on this subject.  
61In a series of questions from Q 2286 both detectives put the statement of a witness to the accused that contradicted the accused's account of what he was wearing at the time.  He was then asked a series of questions by both officers: ""So this is witness is wrong.  Is that what you are saying?"" (Sippel, Q 2292), ""is that witness wrong"" (Burke, Q 2296 and 2298), ""so that is not true"" (Sippel, Q 2306) and ""Why would a person tell us this? (Sippel, Q 2307).
62In reference to a ""second witness"" on the same subject the accused was asked ""Is that second witness wrong as well?"".  
63Detective Sippel then put to the accused, as a matter of fact ""Because you never changed, you never changed when you went up with Mandy and Vic with the lady and Vic did you?"" (Q 2359) and ""That's why these witness have seen you wearing shorts ... and this jumper"" (Q 2360-2361).
64At that point, Mr Burke chimed in ""The penny's dropping isn't it Andrew?"" (Q 2362) and when the accused asked what he meant he returned to the theme of asking whether the witnesses ""are wrong.  Is that right?"" (Q 2364-5).
65The detectives moved on (from around Q 2379) to confront the accused with the DNA evidence.  This included:""Q 2395 How can you explain that?A  I can't I can't.
Q 2396 It's because you murdered her.A  No I didn't no.
Q 2397  There's no other explanation you've given these versions ---A  ....
Q 2398 --- there's no other explanation ---A  No
Q 2399 --- other [than] that you murdered her that night in that house.  Is this correct?A  No.""  
66The accused was told ""Mate, it's time to tell the truth"" (Q 2418) and asked ""Well how do you explain that?"" (Q 2419) and then:""Q 2434 Because I'll tell you want happened Andrew.  You left her house after you murdered her and you went back to your house""
67When the accused offered an explanation for the fact (as it was put to him) that ""the victim's blood was on his shoes"" he was told by Detective Burke ""You know that's ridiculous Andrew --- that's a ridiculous suggestion"" (Q 2477-8).
68The accused then complained about being called a liar (A 2480) to which Mr Sippel replied ""No-one called you a liar"".  That was, with respect to the detective, somewhat disingenuous. 
69The accused then attempted to terminate the interview (Q 2485).  However the interrogation went on:
""Q2487 --- at the beginning of the interview you do not have to answer our questions.
A  well it's stopped.
Q2488  You don't want to go any further?
A it's stopped. I will not, will not when I know I have done fuckin' nothing wrong---
Q2489  The reason you're stopping---
A  --- but tried to help youse blokes.
Q 2490 [00:43:50] --- the reason you're stopping the interview is that you have murdered this lady.
A   Is that right?
Q2491  That's how you got the scratches.
A  Is that right?
Q2492 That's how her blood, she, she did those scratches that's how you got them.
A Do you know what, do you know what they call that mate?
Q2493  What?
A  That's called an assumption and you know when an ---
Q2494  What's ---
A  ---  do ---
Q2495  --- what's, what's that?
A  Hang on, hang on, hang on a minute, Hang on a minute.
Q2496  No, no. What, what's that?
A  Do you know ---
Q2497   What do you call that?
A Do you know what an assumption is when people go making assumptions and all too often they're making arses of themselves.
Q2498 All right. Now, now you've, okay you've just asked that the interview be stopped?
A  Finished.
Q2499 All right. Now what I want to do, there's other, there's more allegations. Do you wish to hear those allegations?
A  No, not really, let the ...deal with it mate.
Q2500 [00:44:36] all right. Is there anything further you wish to say that this matter?
A  No.
Q2501 Have the answers that you've given in this record of interview been made of your own free will?
A All you're gunna get from now on mate is no comment.
Q2502 Okay, all right. Has any threat, promise or offer of advantage been held out to you ---
A  No comment, no comment.
Q2503 Okay I will leave the room and I'll have a senior police officer come and speak with you okay?
A  Can I just use the toilet?
Q2504  In a minute---
A  Yep.
Q2505 --- I'll just have the, just finish this and you can use the toilet. SIPPEL leaves the room. Andrew, this is Inspector Williams he's currently in charge of the police station who you met earlier.
A  yep ...
Q2506 This isn't, this isn't any part of the interview the interview's been stopped at your request. What his role is here is to ask you some questions on how the interview was conducted okay?
A  Yep.
Q2507 And whilst he does that myself and Detective Sergeant Burke will leave the room.
A  So that's still being recorded?
Q2508  Still being recorded yes.""

70It is well established that police are not required to accept the first answer that a suspect provides them with and are entitled to press the suspect with persistence: R v Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 at 419-420.  A certain degree of ""cross-examination"" is permissible and police officers are not ""prevented from asking the suspect to answer what has been alleged against him by others"": R v Taylor (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW),18 April 1995, unrep); McDermott v The King [1948] HCA 23; (1948) 76 CLR 501 at 517 (Williams J).  However, as Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Taylor:""What is not permitted is questioning which is oppressive, overbearing or unfair; or questioning which is aggressive or overbearing or questioning in which the police officer repeatedly and scornfully expresses disbelief of the suspects denials."" (Authorities and citations omitted)
71I have not been invited to view the video recording of the ERISP and can assume that the tone of the interrogation is not the problem.  
72Nevertheless, my review of the latter part of the interview establishes questioning that was repetitive, scornful, ridiculing, overbearing and unfair.    The proposition (at Q 2489) that the accused was terminating the interview because ""you have murdered this lady"" was particularly egregious but it is the cumulative effect of the questioning which causes greater concern.
73Of course, the admissibility of the ERISP is not the question with which I am concerned.  The Crown accepts that much of the questioning was inappropriate (or worse) and I am told that the ERISP will be edited to exclude those parts that are objectionable.  The question is whether the conduct of the detectives in the ERISP, individually or in combination with other matters, should lead to the exclusion of the impugned interview around 12 hours later. 
74The accused makes specific complaint that the questioning relating to the DNA evidence contained false representations.  There was significant cross-examination on this subject.  The complaint is twofold.  The first is that it is misleading to put to the accused that ""the victim's blood was on your shoes.""  DNA evidence does not allow for such certainty.  Rather, all that can be said is that there was blood on the shoes and it was, to a greater or less degree of probability, consistent with the blood of the victim.   I did not find Mr Sippel's responses in relation to this evidence very convincing.  My impression was that he was deliberately avoiding the questions. 
75Be that as it may, I am not persuaded that the relevant questions were such as to mislead the accused in an unfair way.  The fact is that the evidence (if accepted) established that there was blood on the accused's shoes and that the likelihood of it being the blood of somebody other than that of the victim was extremely small.  The police were entitled to put that to him and to ask him for an explanation.  The way they did so was inappropriate but I do not find the interrogation to have been misleading or false in that respect.  
76There is more substance in the accused's complaint about what is generally known as ""secondary transfer"".  The suggestion that the only way that the ""victim's blood"" could have been on the accused's shoes was because he was there when she was dead (Q 2474-2476) is inaccurate.  When the accused posited a possible explanation for the evidence, he was told that it was a ""ridiculous"" suggestion.  The questioning was calculated to put to the accused that there was only one possible explanation for the evidence and that explanation was that he was guilty of murder.  That is a misleading statement.  The method and vigour with which it was pursued was inappropriate and unfair.  
77One further aspect of the submissions that I should touch upon is the suggestion that the questions about whether the witnesses were ""wrong"", their statements ""untrue"" and ""why"" they would make those statements inverted the onus of proof.  There is ample authority to support this argument as a matter of law:  see, for example, Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1 at [8] (Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ).  
78However, I accept the Crown Prosecutor's submission that it would not immediately or necessarily occur to a relatively uneducated man (such as the accused claims to be) that there was a reversal of the onus of proof.  I am not sure that this argument, while technically correct and rendering the relevant questioning inadmissible, is a matter that would have operated on the accused's mind over the ensuing 12 hours.
79I take a different view of the assertion by Mr Sippel that the accused terminated the interview because he was guilty of murder (Q 2489-2490). That was an egregious abuse of his position of power over the accused.  It could serve no purpose other than to harangue the accused and was apt to lead him to believe, as Mr Denis submitted, that his termination of the interview could lead to an inference of guilt.  It is true, as submitted by the Crown, that the accused maintained steadfast in terminating the interview. Just a few questions later he said ""finished"" (A 2498) and ""no comment"" (A 2501-2).  It is also true that there is no evidence from the accused as to what he took from that comment.    
80After the ERISP was concluded, the accused was subject to forensic procedures and was charged.  There is no evidence that he received any further advice as to his rights.  As I have found, he was unlawfully detained from some time shortly after 9:00 am until the time that the detectives visited him in his cell.  
81At sometime around 1:00 pm, Detective Sippel and Burke approached the accused in his cell.  As I have said, the conversation was not recorded and was not adopted in the course of the impugned interview.  However, with a couple of exceptions to which I have already referred, the accused does not contest the content of the conversation.  Mr Dennis relies on some aspects of that conversation in his submission that the pressure under which the accused was placed, taken with the other aspects of the accused's detention, are relevant to whether the admissions were influenced by oppressive conduct.  Mr Sippel gave the following account of that conversation in his statement:
""113. Detective Sergeant Burke and I attended the Custody Room and walked to the accused cell.
I said, ""Andrew, we just want to give you an opportunity to tell us anything more about what happened at the house in South Grafton before you go to Coffs Harbour. We're not recording our conversation on a recorder at this point but as I said to you before you don't have to answer our questions as anything you do say may be used in evidence at court. Do you understand that?
The accused said, ""Yes Matt I understand. I just don't know, I've already told you everything I can. I don't know what else I can tell you. I would tell you if I knew. I don't know what happened, everything was good, we were laughing. You said to me if I had any problems I could come and see you or call you and I did.""
I said, ""yeah and I helped you see a counsellor.""
The accused said, ""yeah you did and I appreciate. I can't tell you something that I can't remember. I know we had a good time and were drinking and laughing. If I could figure it out I would tell you.""
114. The accused continued to speak about the fire in South Australia that he had mentioned in the previous conversations and about a little girl across the road. The accused continued that he was a nice bloke and he hadn't appreciated being called a liar.Detective Burke said, ""Well I want to give you an opportunity to tell us what actually happened within the house. You are facing a charge that effectively carries life and to say you don't remember doesn't add up.""
I said, ""Think about the family Andrew. We have to tell them things and they want to know how their mother died. They want answers about how she died.
The accused said, ""If I could remember I would tell you, I told you everything I know."" The accused sighed and placed his head in his hands. He said, ""We were in the house and we were fooling around you know. But she was alive when I left her. I never hurt that woman.""Yeah we fooled around had a drink, everything was fine, we had a good night, a good night."" ""I left her in the house she was happy. Did something change, I don't know.""
I said, ""Andrew I can tell you that the deceased lady wasn't severely burnt and her body is telling us a lot of information. Now as I've said many times to you before you don't have to talk to us if you don't want to but we are waiting for more results and will probably have to speak to later about those.
115. Detective Burke and I went to leave the cell.
Detective Burke said, ""Andrew if you want to get in contact with us and have a talk you can call Matt or I from goal.""
I said, ""think things through and through and if you want to see me again you know where to find me.""
The accused said, ""Give me five.""""
116. Detective Sergeant Burke and I returned to the office and had a discussion. A short time later I obtained my handheld recorder and we returned to the custody room
82Mr Burke provided a very similar version of this conversation in his statement:""40. Detective senior Constable SIPPEL and I attended the charge room and walked into the cell occupied by the accused. The accused was sitting comfortably on the cell foam mattress with his back against the wall. There were remnants of a McDonald's meal in front of the accused.
Detective SIPPEL said, ""Andrew, we just want to give you an opportunity to tell us anything more about what happened at the house in South Grafton before you go to Coffs Harbour. We're not recording our conversation on a recorder at this point but as I said to you before you don't have to answer our questions as anything you do say may be used in evidence in court. Do you understand that?""
He said, ""yes Matt I understand. I just don't know, I've already told you everything I can. I don't know what else I can tell you. I would tell you if I knew. I don't know what happened, everything was good, we were laughing. You said to me if I had any problems I could come and see you or call you and I did.""
Detective SIPPEL said,""yeah and I helped you see a counsellor""
He said, 'Yeah you did and I appreciated it. I can't tell you something that I can't remember. I know we had a good time and were drinking and laughing. If I could figure it out I would tell you"".
41. The accused spoke about a fire in South Australia and a little girl who lived across the road from him in South Grafton that he had saved. The accused had mentioned these two subjects in previous conversations with Detective Senior Constable SIPPEL and I. The accused said that he was a ""nice bloke"" and didn't appreciate being called a ""liar"".
I Said, ""well I want to give you an opportunity to tell us what actually happened within the house. You are facing a charge that effectively carries life and to say you don't remember doesn't add up"".
Detective SIPPEL said,""Think about the family Andrew. We have to tell them things and they want to know how their mother died. They want answers about how she died"".
He said,""If I could remember I would tell you, I told you everything I know"".
The accused sighed and placed his head in his hands.
He said,""We were in the house and we were fooling around you know. But she was alive when I left. I never hurt that woman. Yeah we fooled around had a drink, everything was fine, we had a good night, a good night. I left her in the house, she was happy. Did something change, I don't know"".
Detective SIPPEL said, ""Andrew, I can tell you that the deceased lady wasn't severely burnt and her body is telling us a lot of information. Now as I've said many times to you before you don't have to talk to us if you don't want to but we are waiting for more results and will probably have to speak to you later about those"".
Detective senior Constable SIPPEL and I went to leave the cell.
I said, ""Andrew, if you want to get in contact with us and have a talk you can ring Matt or I from goal"".
Detective SIPPEL said,""Think things through Andrew and if you want to see me again you know where to find me"".
The accused said,""Give me five"".
83It will be seen that, for the first time, the accused (at least implicitly) admitted to some form of sexual contact with the victim. 
84Mr Dennis submits that this conversation continued to apply improper pressure on the accused and that this, in combination with the other circumstances surrounding the accused's detention and the improper questioning in the ERISP in the early hours of that day, meant that the admission was influenced by oppressive conduct.  He places emphasis on:The reference to what ""actually happened"" was (once again) based on an assumption, presented as fact, that the accused's earlier accounts were false.The reference to the offence as one ""that effectively carries life"" was improper and misleading.  The detectives failed to correct the misleading impression created at the end of the ERISP that the termination of the interview could be interpreted as evidence that the accused had committed the murder.  The reference to the feelings of the victim's family was a form of emotional pressure that was inappropriate in the circumstances prevailing at the time.  It was also implicit that the accused knew what had happened.
WAS THE ACCUSED DENIED A REQUEST FOR A LAWYER?
85The accused gave evidence (T 126) that after the conclusion of the ERISP and on the way from the ERISP room to the cells:""I said something to Detective Sippel about 'I want a lawyer' and his response was 'I don't care what you want'."" 
86Mr Sippel was cross-examined about this (T 56):""Q. And then after Inspector Williams spoke to the accused you came back, correct?A.  Yes.
Q.  And you escorted him to the cells didn't you?A.  Yes.
Q.  And I suggest to you sir that on the way to the cells the accused said words to this effect to you:  ""I want to speak to a solicitor""?A.  No I don't recall, to be quite honest I don't even recall if I took him to the cell.
Q.  Well I'm suggesting to you that you did?A.  Okay.
Q.  I'm suggesting to you that the accused said the words ""I want to speak to a solicitor""?A.  Okay.
Q.  What do you say to that?A.  I don't recall that no.
Q.  So are you saying you don't know one way or the other?A.  Yes.
Q.  And I suggest to you that you responded to him 'I don't care what you want'?A.  No that's not true.""
87Neither of the witnesses to this conversation was particularly creditworthy.  Both were somewhat evasive in answering questions.  I agree with the Crown Prosecutor that the accused at times failed to engage with the questions at all and avoided ""direct questions, simply put.""  Similarly there were occasions where my impression was that Mr Sippel was evasive.  
88As Mr Dennis submits, there are only two witnesses to this conversation.  One (the accused) positively asserts that he asked for a lawyer while the other (Mr Sippel) says that he cannot remember one way of another whether there was such a request.  
89The Crown places emphasis on the fact that the accused did not ask Sgt Williams, who the accused described as ""brilliant"" at the end of the ERISP, for a solicitor after Mr Sippel allegedly refused his request.  Nor did he complain about Sippel's behaviour to Sgt Williams.  Against that, there is no clear evidence of what, if any, interaction there was between Sgt Williams and the accused after the conclusion of the ERISP.  He was not involved in the charging process (1:43 to 4:00 am) or the forensic procedure (1:10 to 1:11 am) although the custody management record (pp 5 and 8) suggests that he was responsible for taking the accused to and from his cell for the forensic procedure and provided him with a drink at 1:48 am.  The accused's evidence as to why he did not complain to Sgt Williams was that he was ""another copper"" (T 155).  
90With admirable fairness, the Crown Prosecutor accepted that it was appropriate to take into account the conduct of Mr Sippel immediately prior to the conclusion of the interview in deciding whether this conversation occurred.  That is to say, the attitude disclosed after the accused attempted to terminate the interview - including the continued questioning and the suggestion that the accused was ending the interview because he was guilty.
91Having considered the evidence carefully, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was a request for a solicitor.  I am not certain precisely what form it took and I am unable to conclude that Mr Sippel said the words (""I don't care what you want"") attributed to him by the accused.  However, I am satisfied that whatever precise form it took, the accused made a request for lawyer and that no action was taken to comply with that request.  In coming to this conclusion, I am persuaded by the conduct of both the accused and Mr Sippel at the conclusion of the interview.  The accused had decided that he had had enough and for the first time exercised his right to decline to speak to the detectives.  In those circumstances, it makes sense that he would tell the detective that he wanted a to see a lawyer.  Similarly, the attitude displayed by Mr Sippel at the end of the interview is consistent with an attitude of indifference to the accused's rights. 
92The failure to comply with the request for a solicitor is a breach of s 123 LEPRA.   
THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONTENT OF THE IMPUGNED INTERVIEW
93The first thing to note about the impugned interview is where it was held. Rather than moving the accused out of the cell to the ERISP room, the Detectives conducted the interview in the small cell where the accused had been detained for most of the morning.  
94Mr Dennis confronted the detectives with the fact that this arrangement meant that the custody manager was not involved.  Mr Sippel gave the following evidence (T 62-65):""Q.  And sir, moving him out of the cell to the ERISP room might have engaged the custody manager, correct?
A.  Not necessarily, but I mean it's a different scenarios as to what would have happened at that point.
Q.  All right well when somebody is moved from a cell to an ERISP interview room, the custody manager has to make some log of it, don't they?
A.  True.  Well he should do, yes, as custody manager, yes.
Q.  And a diligent custody manager might as the accused whether they wished to exercise any of their rights?
A.  Up to the custody manager.""
95Mr Burke said (T 71):""Q. And are you able to tell us why it was that you chose to record the conversation with a handheld device rather than with taking him into an ERISP room?
A.  I've done interviews in that fashion previously without any adversity attached to that procedure.  Mr Sumpton was comfortable in that area, being the cell that he'd been in overnight.  Detective Sippel and I walked into that cell and after a very brief conversation activated the recorder and Mr Sumpton appeared very comfortable in his surroundings and I didn't want to take him out of those surroundings.""
96Both Detectives denied the sinister suggestion that they conducted themselves in this way in order deliberately to avoid the involvement of the custody manager.  Whatever the intention of the detectives, the impact was that there was no involvement of the custody manager and no notation in the custody management record relating to this interview.  Along with the absence of a time below the signature on the ""Receipt of Records"" document, it makes it very difficult to know the order of events between 12-53 (when the Receipt of Records was printed) and 1:09pm when the impugned interview commenced. 
97The accused made substantial admissions in the impugned interview.   Amongst other things he said:""I can't understand why I'd go and do something like that.  We were having a good time."" (Q6)""I must have set a fire ..."" (Q 8)""I think she was dead"" when he left her because ""there was blood everywhere."" (Q 14-15)""I think I stabbed her."" (Q 28)He wasn't sure what he used to stab her but it may have been ""glass"" or ""a knife"" ... ""just some object in the room"" (Q 44)""I was sure she was deceased."" (Q 63) ""because I'd stabbed her"" (Q 64).  He was ""not sure if I hit her"" (Q 85) but he may have hit her with something. (Q 88)
98Having listened to the interview in Court, I am of the view that it constitutes compelling evidence against the accused.  
99The Crown places emphasis on the tone of the interview and the fact that there is no submission that the questioning was unfair. He refers to the fact that the accused called Mr Sippel by his first name and that the accused twice (at Q 22 and 176) said he was ""happy"" to be interviewed.  There was also a caution administered at the beginning of the interview and questions at the end of the interview confirmed that the answers were given of the accused's free will.ADMISSIBILITY OF ADMISSIONS UNDER THE EVIDENCE ACT
100Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act provides for the admissibility of admissions.  The accused relies on ss 84 and 90 which provide:""84 Exclusion of admissions influenced by violence and certain other conduct(1) Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the court is satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by:(a) violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct, whether towards the person who made the admission or towards another person, or(b) a threat of conduct of that kind.(2) Subsection (1) only applies if the party against whom evidence of the admission is adduced has raised in the proceeding an issue about whether the admission or its making were so influenced.""
90 Discretion to exclude admissionsIn a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.""
101The accused also relies on s 138.  Section 138 is not concerned specifically with admissions but creates a ""discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence"".  If evidence is obtained improperly, or in contravention of an Australian law or as consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australia law such evidence:""is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained""
102Section 138(2)(b) makes specific provision in relation to admissions ""made during or in consequence of questioning"" where false statements are made ""in the course of the questioning"" and those statements are ""likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admissions"". 
103Section 138(3) provides a non-exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account in exercising the discretion.
104A fundamental difference of approach to these provisions arises on the submission of the parties.  
105Mr Dennis submits that material that might be caught by the discretion under s 138 can also be taken into account in determining whether the admission was influenced by (relevantly) oppressive conduct (s 84).  He says that, in determining whether the admission was influenced by oppressive conduct (s 84), I am required to take into account the whole of the circumstances including circumstances that would also constitute unlawful or improper conduct for the purpose of the discretion (s 138).    
106The learned Crown Prosecutor submits that evidence of illegality or impropriety can be taken into account either by reference to the discretion in s 138 or the exclusionary rule in s 84.  In other words it cannot be taken into account under both provisions.  He says that this approach is supported by the judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67 at [92]-[122] especially at [120]-[123].  
107The Crown Prosecutor gave an example of a police officer punching a suspect and submitted that if that conduct did not amount to oppressive conduct under s 84 it could not then be taken into account under the discretion in s 138.  To take an example from the present case, he submitted that if I took the view that the alleged misrepresentations made by police in the course of the ERISP were not excluded under s 138, those matters could not be taken into account in considering whether the whole of the circumstances amounted to oppressive conduct under s 84.  This submission was subject to a deal of discussion in the course of argument and the Crown maintained the submission that the judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ ""seems to require a drawing out of the threads"".  The Crown conceded that the Em v The Queen concerned s 90, not s 84, and that neither the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Heydon J nor the dissenting judgment of Kirby J touched upon the issue.  
108I accept the submission of the accused and reject the submission of the learned Crown Prosecutor.  I do so for the following reasons.
109Having read carefully the passages in Em v The Queen, I am unable to discern any support for the proposition that is being urged.  The interaction of s 90 (the unfairness discretion) and s 138 involves different considerations to the interaction between s 84 and s 138.   Em v The Queen concerned the failure to issue a caution.  It was conceded that s 138 was not engaged (see [118]).  Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [119] that a failure to issue a caution was:""to be considered under s 138.  It was not relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 90"".  
110By reference to what their Honours said at [109]-[113] it seems that the conclusion in [119] followed from what was meant by ""unfairness"" in s 90.  This reasoning does not inform the interaction between ss 84 and 138.  
111In R v Ul-Haque [2007] NSWSC 1251; 177 A Crim R 348 Adams J considered the admissibility of interviews between a terrorism suspect and officers of ASIO and the Australian Federal Police.  His Honour considered the operation of ss 84, 85 and 138.  There is nothing in his Honour's judgment (especially at [92]-[105]) that suggests that the impugned conduct could only be taken into account in respect of one or other of those sections. His Honour appeared to consider the same conduct in relation to both provisions. I note that R v Ul-Haque was decided only a few weeks after the decision in Em v The Queen and it seems that the prosecutor made no submission of the kind with which I am confronted. 
112On the other hand, in R v Ye Zhang [2000] NSWSC 1099 Simpson J appeared not to consider the oppressive conduct that she had found for the purpose of excluding the evidence under s 84 (offering an inducement and threatening to hit) when she turned to consider the operation of s 138.  However, her Honour did not consider the question here raised by the Crown and the decision was made long before the High Court's decision in Em v The Queen.
113In R v LL (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 1 April 1996, unrep), Smart J considered the application of ss 84 and 138 by reference to the same factual circumstances.  Again there is nothing to suggest that his Honour was called upon to consider a similar submission to the one made in this case.    
114See also R v Truong (1996) 86 A Crim R 188.   
115In R v Fulling [1987] 2 All ER 65 the English Court of Appeal was concerned with the operation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (UK) (""PACE"").  I treat with some caution comments made in relation to a differently structured statute.  However, their Honours said (at 69-70):""We find it hard to envisage any circumstances in which such oppression would not entail some impropriety on the part of the interrogator.""
116I agree with those comments.  While they were made in a different context and under a substantially different statutory regime, they support the proposition that material that supports a finding that evidence was unlawfully obtained might also be used to determine whether an admission was influenced by oppressive conduct.  
117For what it is worth, there is nothing in the Chart at the commencement of Chapter 3 of the Evidence Act that offers support for the Crown's submission.  That chart suggests that s 84 should first be considered and that discretionary exclusion should be considered thereafter.
118To give it some relevant content, the submission can be considered by reference to a clear and specific example in the present case.  As I have held, there was a breach of s 99 LEPRA and the accused was detained unlawfully.  That is a matter that might be considered under s 138.  It would be surprising, and contrary to the purposes of the legislation, if the unlawful detention is not also relevant to whether the admissions were influenced by oppressive conduct. 119For these reasons, I have concluded that the same material that might give rise to a discretion to exclude evidence because it is unlawfully and improperly obtained can (and should) also be considered in determining whether the cumulative impact of those matters constitutes oppressive conduct for the purpose of s 84.  
OPPRESSIVE CONDUCT
120Oppressive conduct is not defined in the Evidence Act.  It has been held that it should not be given an ""expansive interpretation"": R v Heffernan (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 16 June 1998, unrep).
121In Ye Zhang (supra) and Higgins v R [2007] NSWCCA 56 at [26] it was held that:""Section 84 does not require the isolation of single reason or a single incident of conduct provoking the confession.  There may be a number of factors working together"" 
122In Higgins v R Hoeben J (with whom Sully and Bell JJ agreed) went on to say at [26]:""I also accept that there is no definition of 'oppressive' in the Act and that the concept should not be limited to physical or threatened physical conduct and can encompass mental and psychological pressure.""
123The concept of ""oppressive conduct"" should be read ejusdem generis with the other proscribed conduct identified in s 84.  That is, the meaning of oppressive conduct should draw some meaning and content from the fact that s 84 also refers to ""violent, inhuman and degrading"" conduct: cf R v Ul-Haque (supra) at [94].  In R v Ul-Haque Adams J noted at [94] that ""the precise boundaries of 'oppressive ... conduct' are uncertain"" but was of the view that the conduct in that case was well within those boundaries. 
124In Habib v Nationwide News [2010] NSWCA 34; 76 NSWLR 299 the Court of Appeal (Hodgson, Tobias and McColl JJA) undertook an extensive consideration of s 84 in the context of a defamation case.  I have been greatly assisted by that consideration. 
125At [176]-[195] the Court of Appeal analysed the common law position in relation to requirement that voluntariness was a precondition to the admissibility of a confession and the common law discretions to exclude confessions.  The Court then at [196]-[207] examined of the ALRC reports and second reading speeches leading up to the introduction of the provision. It noted at [201] the observations in the Final Report on Evidence as to the deficiencies in the common law of voluntariness and the ""tendency to admit rather than to exclude"".   The Court at [232] again referred to that concern in considering the purpose of the section in the context of an argument concerning whether the appellant bore an onus.
126At [241] their Honours said:""In R v JF (at [37]), Refshauge J commented that because the effect of s 84 was '...automatic exclusion of the confession, with no discretion, and a relatively low threshold of causation, it does seem that the conduct involved should be of a relatively significant level of impropriety'. With respect, that imposes a gloss on the section which, in our view, is not warranted by its language. The only question s 84(1) poses is whether the 'admission and [its] making' were 'not influenced by' conduct of the nature identified. At best, as was said in Heffernan (at 22), the wide scope of the section in its application in both civil and criminal proceedings is a reason for not giving  'an expansive meaning to 'oppression' in s 84.""
127The Crown prosecutor submits that the criticism of Refshauge J was not justified. I disagree with that submission and am, in any event, bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal.
128The Court also referred to the case of R v Fulling (supra) and the differences between s 84 and the relevant provisions in s 76 of the PACE Act.  It noted that in R v Fulling (supra) the Court adopted the dictionary definition of  ""oppression"" namely ""... [the] exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, harsh or wrongful manner; unjust or cruel treatment of subjects, inferiors etc.; the imposition of unreasonable or unjust burdens ....""
129The Crown accepts that this is an appropriate basis upon which to consider the question of whether the impugned admissions were influenced by ""oppressive"" conduct. 
CONCLUSION AS TO ADMISSIBILITY
Section 84
130This is not a case like R v Ul-Haque or Habib v Nationwide News where oppressive conduct is clearly established.  Nor is it a case like R v Higgins where there was almost no evidence capable of amounting to oppressive conduct.  In that case, all that was relied on was the fact that the appellant was required to attend the ""bank interview"" as a condition of his employment and the bank investigators had expressed incredulity at some of his answers.  
131Unlike Ul-Haque, this is a case at the ""boundaries"" of oppressive conduct.
132In accordance with the provision in s 189(3) I have disregarded the issue of whether the admission was true.   Further, in spite of the policy underlying the common law of voluntariness and matters discussed ALCR reports (as to which see Habib v Nationwide News at [198]), the operation of s 84 does not require a consideration of whether ""the truth of the admission was adversely affected"": cf s 85 Evidence Act (reliability of admissions by defendants). As Simpson J said in R v Ye Zhang at [52] ""evidence of an admission will not be admitted because the admission can be shown, by other evidence, to be truthful.""  
133As Adams J said in R v Ul-Haque the relevant test is not whether the will of the accused was overborne. The Court of Appeal endorsed this proposition in Habib v Nationwide News at [237].
134Having considered the matter anxiously, I have concluded that the accused was subjected to conduct that can properly be described as ""oppressive"".  It involved the exercise of authority and power in a burdensome, harsh and wrongful manner and imposed on the accused unreasonable and unjust burdens.
135In summary, and without repeating the matters that I have set out above, I am drawn to that conclusion based on the following matters: The accused was unlawfully detained for a period of many hours.The accused was not informed that arrangements were being made to take him before a Court or that there was a delay in doing so.  He was simply left in his cell for some hours after he was charged.  Even though he may have known (because he had been arrested before) that he would be taken to court, I accept his evidence that all he knew was that this would happen ""eventually"" or ""sooner or later"".The accused was in police custody for a total period (lawful and unlawful) of around 23 hours before he was taken before a magistrate and around 20 hours before his confession.   Aspects of the questioning of the accused at the time of his arrest ('I want to know why you did it') and towards the end of the ERISP was unfair and improper in that it assumed his guilt and ridiculed and belittled his answers.When he terminated the interview after a period of many hours, the detectives continued to question him for a short period and put to him that he was doing so because he was guilty of murder. The implicit suggestion that his termination of the interview was capable of giving rise to an inference that he was guilty was never withdrawn.He was denied access to a lawyer after asking for one. While the custody records show that he was observed to be ""sleeping"" at various times between 4:42am and 8:14am and again between 10:12am and 12:17am, I accept his evidence that he would not ""have had that much sleep.  I know I'd lay under the blanket for hours, awake."" (T 238).  I also accept his evidence that his sleep patterns had been disturbed over the preceding days.He was approached in the cell by the same detectives about whom he had complained to the custody manager (Sgt Williams) at the conclusion of the ERISP in circumstances where the new custody manager (Sgt Ruehe) played no role. He was told that the offence with which he was charged ""effectively carried life"", that his account didn't add up and that the detectives were giving him an ""opportunity"" to talk before he was taken to Coffs Harbour.  Thereafter, he was told that he could ""ring [the detectives] from gaol"".He was approached to provide further information after he had clearly, and repeatedly, indicated that he sought to exercise his right to silence after more than 2,000 question in the ERISP.He was subject to psychological and emotional pressure to change his version of events.    He was subject to questioning in a small confined space in circumstances where the designated custody manager was not involved in any meaningful way before, during or after the interview.  136For the evidence to be admissible I must be satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by the oppressive conduct that I find took place: see, for example, R v Ye Zhang (supra) at [39]-[44].  l am not so satisfied.  137The Crown has attempted to persuade me that the true cause of the confession was that the accused wanted to get the matter ""off his chest"" (see Q 90) and was demonstrating a true consciousness of guilt and willingness to take responsibility for his actions (Q 170).  However, the Crown properly concedes the correctness of the approach of Simpson J in R v Ye Zhang at [44]: ""However, s 84 does not require the isolation of a single reason, or a single event or incident or instance of conduct provoking the confession; there may be a number of factors working together that, combined, cause the admission to be made.  If oppressive conduct on the part of the police is one of those factors (or more accurately, if the Crown has failed to negative such conduct as one of those factors) then the evidence is inadmissible.""
138I adopt that reasoning although it may be more accurate to speak in terms of the oppressive conduct ""influencing"" - rather than provoking or causing -the confession.  
139In view of the history of the legislation, as examined by the Court of Appeal in Habib v Nationwide News at [196]-[207], it is not necessary, and may be contrary to the purpose of the provision, to speak in terms of voluntariness or in terms of whether the accused's will was overborne: see Habib v Nationwide News at [237].    
140I am not satisfied, as a matter of fact, that the confession was not influenced by oppressive conduct which is to say conduct whereby the accused was subject to the exercise of police powers that was wrongful, burdensome, unjust and harsh.  
141Having reached that conclusion, there is no discretion.  The evidence must be excluded.
SECTION 90
142Having come to that conclusion it is unnecessary for me to consider s 90 any further.  Very few submissions were directed to s 90. The focus of the argument was on ss 84 and 138.  SECTION 138
143Although it is not strictly necessary to do so, I should record my conclusions in relation to the application to exclude the evidence under s 138.  144For the reason already articulated, I am satisfied that there was impropriety and contravention of Australian law.  This involved, at least, non-compliance with s 99 LEPRA and the consequent unlawful detention of the accused. It also involved the failure to comply with his request for a lawyer.  There was also improper questioning before the ERISP, towards the end of the ERISP and in advance of the impugned interview.
145Contrary to Mr Dennis' submission, I am not satisfied that the police made false statements to the accused in the course of the questioning for the purposes of s 138(2)(b).  I have concluded that the correct application of that provision to the circumstances of this case is that the reference in the sub-section to the ""course of the questioning"" is a reference to the questioning during the impugned interview.  The questioning during the ERISP is not part of the relevant ""course of questioning"".  It is a separate course of questioning. The use of the definite article is significant - the section refers to a false statement made ""in the course of questioning"".  I gain some comfort in that conclusion from the decision of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; (2004) 218 CLR 216 although I accept that the circumstances are not truly analogous.   
146If the final resolution of the question of admissibility involved the exercise of the discretion under s 138, I would be inclined to the view that the prosecution has discharged the onus and that ""the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way in which [this] evidence was obtained"".  However, I would not find that decision an easy one to make.    
147My conclusion is based on a consideration of a variety of factors including those referred to in s 138(3) of the Evidence Act.  In summary:
The probative value of the evidence is extremely high: s 138(3)(a).  I accept the Crown Prosecutor's submission that apart from the obvious probative value of a recorded confession, the evidence also has the capacity to provide corroboration for other admissions made by the accused (to Mr Hayes and ZS).  Those admissions, especially in the case of ZS, are likely to come under a significant attack at the trial. The evidence is ""important"" s 138(3)(b).  However, I do not find this to be a particularly compelling circumstance because the Crown case remains extremely powerful even in the absence of this evidence. The ""public interest in the conviction and punishment"" for a crime as serious as this one militates in favour of admission: s 138(3)(c), R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284 per Spigelman CJ at [5]-[7] with whom Blanch J agreed, contra Simpson J at [97]; R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 364 at [54].  Contrary to the submission of the Crown, the impropriety and contravention of Australian law was grave: s 138(3)(d).  Contrary to the submission of the Crown, I find the breaches to have been at least reckless: s 138(3)(e).  As I have said, there appeared to be a certain indifference to the accused's right to be taken before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law.The conduct amounted to a breach of some of the rights recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: s 138(3)(f).  It is at least a breach of Article 9 of the International Covenant.  
148I also consider that it is relevant to the exercise of the discretion that there appeared to a form of systemic failure exemplified in the resignation of Sgt Ruehe that any request for police to be recalled for the mere transport of a prisoner was destined to fail.  
149As Simpson J said in Dalley v R (at [93]):""Because of the importance of the protective provision of Part 10A it should not lightly be concluded that contraventions of those provisions will not result in the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of the contravention.""
150In R v Dungay (supra) the Court of Criminal Appeal was considering a case where an accused person was arrested for the purpose of questioning.  There was no evidence of an intention on the part of the police to take the accused before a Magistrate. The trial Judge allowed evidence of a confession to sexual assault.  It was the only evidence against the accused.  The Court of Criminal Appeal overturned the decision as to admissibility, allowed the appeal and entered a verdict of not guilty.  Ipp JA said at [41]:""The common law has always jealously guarded citizens against arbitrary arrest: Williams v R. The duty to bring an arrested person before a judicial officer as soon as is reasonably possible is one of the foundations of a democratic society. Our law recognises that no person should be arrested merely for the purposes of investigating whether he or she has committed a crime. Part 10A does not detract from this fundamental principle. In my opinion, the illegality involved in the appellant's arrest has to be regarded as being serious indeed.""
151These various factors pull in different directions.  However, due to the seriousness of the charge and the very high probative value of the evidence, I would be inclined to exercise the discretion in favour of admission of the evidence. However, in view of the decision I have reached under s 84, discretion under s 138 does not truly arise.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
152The evidence is rejected. 
153There will be a non-publication order over this judgment until the conclusion of the trial.

2765023,R v Lane [2014] NSWSC 1430,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (REVISED)

1Mr Lane is being tried for the murder of Mr Peter Morris which arises out of events occurring in Casino around midnight on 15th and 16th September 2012. 

2The learned Crown Prosecutor has applied for an advanced ruling or direction under the provisions of s 192A Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The direction or ruling relates to an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act. The relevant witness to whom the ruling relates is Mr Ryan Lane, the son of the accused. Ryan Lane had been with his father at The Commercial Hotel during the night of Saturday 15th September 2012. They met up around closing time and walked west along Barker Street, Casino together coming across Mr Morris and his friend Mr Schwager. Mr Ryan Lane was not involved in the altercation that then ensued amongst Mr Lane Senior, Mr Morris and Mr Schwager. However, I have received as evidence on the voir dire (exhibits VD B and C) two statements made by Ryan Lane to investigating police dated 18th September 2012 and 6th August 2013 respectively. 

3The Crown would not have wished to call Mr Lane as a witness, but accept an obligation to call him because his evidence is obviously relevant to the Crown case and the accused has requested that the Crown do so. The application made by the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to s 38 is made consistently, or in conformity, with the approach adopted by Hunt CJ at CL (as he then was) in R v Milat (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wale, Hunt CJ at CL, 23 April 1996). This obviously a very early decision in terms of the application of s 38 of the Evidence Act, but the approach has been followed since in R v Kingswell (Unreported New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 September 1998), Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 and through that latter case in Doyle v R [2014] NSWCCA 4.

4The basis of the Crown's application is that Ryan Lane's evidence is unfavourable to the Crown. I bear in mind that s 38 abrogated the Common Law Rules in relation to hostile witnesses and indeed introduced what at the time were considered to be radically different procedures in the analogist situation. 

5Unfavourable in s 38 means no more than not favourable. To lawyers imbued with the common law approach, that was a radical, or, at least surprising result. But it is one which is now very firmly established by a series of decisions not only in State courts, including the Court of Criminal Appeal but also the High Court of Australia. It is obviously an undemanding test. 

6Moreover the procedures made available under s 38 can be invoked even where it is expected that the witness will give 'not favourable' evidence in contradistinction to the common law position where an element of surprise in that regard was part and parcel of the application that was made during the course of an hostile witness's evidence.

7There are three respects in which the Crown argues that Mr Ryan Lane's evidence is unfavourable to the Crown. I will summarise them and not go into them in great detail. They are as follows: 

(1)Mr Ryan Lane's evidence suggests that Mr Morris started the altercation. This arises because in his statement he says he made an offensive comment to his father which Mr Morris mistook as being directed at him and when Mr Morris challenged Mr Ryan Lane about it his father intervened;

(2)Mr Ryan Lane says that he walked on when Mr Lane and Mr Morris were remonstrating with each other, but looking back saw them punching and kicking each other;

(3)when his father re-joined him, he says at the Caltex Service Station, a proposition, I interpolate, somewhat inconsistent with evidence I have seen from a CCTV camera located at the Commonwealth Bank in Barker Street, his father was bleeding from his eyes, nose and mouth, and in the case of one eye to the extent it was closed. Teeth were broken. 

8If accepted, that evidence particularly item three would be inconsistent with the Crown case that Mr Lane Senior did not act in self-defence in, I will use a neutral expression, engaging with Mr Morris and Mr Schwager. 

9To determine whether the evidence is unfavourable, even bearing firmly in mind what I have described as the undemanding statutory test, it seems to me appropriate to have regard to the Crown's opening address. At transcript page 11 lines 40 to 50 the learned Crown Prosecutor said this of the evidence he intended to lead, and has led, in exhibit C, a DVD of a recording made on a CCTV camera located further west on Barker Street from where the altercation took place:

The accused and his son then came into picture and they walked either side of the deceased person. The accused takes a few steps beyond where the [Mr Morris] is, and then wheels around and then quickly goes back towards the deceased.

The accused's son looks back briefly and continues on without stopping.

The accused and then the deceased appear to have words, they are close to each other.

The accused has his arms out and the Crown would indicate that the accused pushed, or appeared to push the deceased towards the shopfronts, which are near where they are and they appear on the film to be involved in some type of scuffle.

10And at transcript p 14, line 35 to 45, the following is said;

The Crown says it was a deliberate act of that punch. It was thrown in such a manner in all the circumstances and the state of mind that existed earlier that you would be able to infer from those circumstances, conclude from those circumstances, that his intention was to inflict grievous bodily harm and the Crown would say that after you have watched the film there is not any issue to be determined as to whether the accused was acting in self-defence.

11It seems to me from considering those passages that the Crown case does not in any way depend upon who started the altercation nor does it depend in any way upon the fact that Mr Morris, and for that matter Mr Schwager, might have involved themselves in a scuffle with Mr Lane Senior even to the extent of kicking at each other and perhaps trading punches. The Crown case rather seems to proceed on the basis that whoever started it, whatever the involvement of each in the scuffle was, if I may put it this way, Mr Lane Senior ended it definitively with a deliberate punch, struck with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Morris. That punch knocked him down causing him to hit his head on the pavement of Barker Street by reason of which he suffered a serious traumatic brain injury from the effects of which he died some days later.

12Viewed through that prism I would not have thought points 1 and 2, that is to say that Mr Morris started the verbal stoush and then engaged with Mr Lane Senior in some physical exchanges, are, even on the undemanding test, ""unfavourable"" to the Crown position. The Crown position can easily accommodate those facts. In saying this, I have borne in mind what the Chief Justice said in applying Kanaan in Doyle v R at [292] with the agreement of Price J (as he then was) and me:

However, it may be accepted that evidence is not unfavourable simply because it does not fit a particular case theory of the prosecution: R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 450 at 461-462.
13In my judgment points 1 and 2 fit into that category, that is to say, they may not fit a particular case theory of the prosecution but nor are they inconsistent with it for the reasons I have given. However it does seem to me that point 3 is directly ""not favourable"" to the Crown case and indeed is entirely inconsistent with the Crown case. During the course of his opening, the Crown prosecutor referred to evidence, particularly that coming from the Commonwealth Bank CCTV footage, which he said would show that the accused was uninjured in the exchange with Mr Morris. Moreover as I have already pointed out, the Crown case, as it must be, is that any deliberate act by way of a punch of the accused was not struck in self-defence. The description by Ryan Lane of injuries on his father, it must be said, of some severity, immediately following the exchange with Mr Morris and Mr Schwager is, I will content myself with applying the statutory test, not favourable to the case that no act of self-defence is responsible for Mr Morris's death. Therefore, to that extent I am satisfied that the evidence likely to be given by Mr Ryan, for the purpose of this advance ruling, is unfavourable to the Crown.

14Given that finding and having regard to the provisions of s 192 of the Act, I am satisfied that the Crown ought to be given leave to question Mr Ryan Lane as though it were cross-examining him about that unfavourable evidence. Whether the cross-examination ought to be allowed to go further than that is a matter which can perhaps be dealt with by application during the course of Mr Lane's evidence. The section seems to contemplate that there might be more than one relevant application made during the course of the evidence. 

15The procedure that should be adopted in relation to this matter, given that the Crown is calling Mr Ryan Lane at the request of the accused, is the approach adopted by Hunt CJ at CL in Milat. I will quote from his Honour's judgment at p 7, his Honour said,

In its final report(the ALRC) said that (there) should not be an inflexible requirement and that provision should be made to enable the other party of parties to question the witness further after cross-examination by the party who called the witness. Although perhaps not readily apparent from their terms, this appears to have been the intention behind subs (4) and (5) of s 38.

In order to reflect the intention (or to comply with the spirit) of the section; therefore, I held that, in the event that these witnesses called at the request of the accused gave the unfavourable evidence as expected, it would be appropriate to grant leave to the Crown pursuant to subs (1) to cross-examine them in relation to that evidence, and to do so after they had been cross-examined by the accused. I also said that the accused would then be permitted to cross-examine the witness further after the Crown had conducted its cross-examination, such cross-examination to be unlimited in nature and not restricted as if it were a re-examination, with the Crown having the right finally to re-examine the witnesses.

16Adapting this approach my ruling envisages the following procedure;

(1)The Crown will call Mr Ryan Lane at the appropriate time, identify him and turn him over to Mr Young SC for the purpose of cross-examination; 

(2)After the completion of that cross-examination, the Crown may examine Mr Ryan Lane including by way of cross-examination as to what he said about his father's injuries in the immediate aftermath of the exchange with Mr Morris. Obviously I reserve liberty to the Crown to make application during the course of the evidence to extend the scope of that cross-examination;

(3)The accused will then be permitted to cross-examine the witness further;

(4)And the Crown will finally have the right to re-examine the witness.

17When Mr Lane is called I simply propose to tell the jury that for technical legal reasons, the procedure to be adopted in eliciting evidence from Mr Lane will vary from that they have seen with other witnesses but they should think nothing of it. Rather they should treat his evidence the same as all other evidence led in the case that is to say evaluate it, consider it and give it such weight as they think it is due in the course of their deliberations.

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offence and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the day fixed for his trial for the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez. The Crown accepted the plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period.

2On 8 November 2013 Price J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 6 December 2011 and to expire on 5 December 2016 with an additional term of 2 years to expire on 5 December 2018.

3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in fixing the commencement date of the sentence on 6 December 2011.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence which gives the appearance of double punishment.

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in inadequately reducing the non-parole period given the basis of his Honour's finding of special circumstance.

Factual Background

4On 12 October 2010 the applicant was present with four co-offenders at premises in Marlborough Street, Smithfield. The applicant agreed to be the driver of a motor vehicle to convey himself and the four other offenders to Russell Street, Mount Pritchard for the purpose of collecting prohibited drugs. During the journey the vehicle stopped in premises in Welwyn Place, Canley Vale where a firearm was collected.

5After arriving at the house of the sister of a co-offender, the applicant became aware that another co-offender intended to confront the deceased who lived next door in Russell Street, Mount Pritchard to discuss money owed to him. The applicant, who did not know the deceased, was aware that the co-offender and the deceased ""did not get along"".

6The five co-offenders, including the applicant, left the house together. The applicant knew that the firearm was taken by the group and that a fight with the deceased was a possibility. The applicant saw the firearm change hands between the other co-offenders as they approached the deceased's premises.

7The applicant stood in the front yard of the deceased's premises and saw a fight commence with the deceased. He saw one of the co-offenders punch the deceased in the face and place him in a headlock. He then observed another of the co-offenders attack the deceased. Finally, he saw a third co-offender hit the deceased over the head with the firearm and saw it discharge.

8The applicant admitted that he was a party to the joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and that he participated to the extent of remaining present throughout the attack upon the deceased, ready and willing to assist the others if need be. The applicant did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as a possible consequence or that another party to the agreement would employ a weapon to achieve that result.

9His Honour made the following additional findings of fact. The applicant's conduct did not involve him physically assaulting the deceased. However, he had agreed with the four others to assault the deceased and it was for this reason that he entered the front yard of the deceased's premises. The applicant did not desist from participating in the agreement even though he was aware that a firearm was in the possession of the co-offenders. He was present during the cowardly attack upon the deceased and remained ready and willing to assist even though the deceased was outnumbered by his attackers.

10His Honour found that the objective seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the following matters. The agreement to assault the deceased was not entered into until shortly before he was attacked and the offender did not physically assault him. Furthermore, he did not foresee that any of his co-offenders would employ the degree of violence which in fact occurred, or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise.

11His Honour took into account the following personal characteristics of the applicant. He was born in June 1983 and was aged 27 years at the time of the offence. At the time of sentence, he was aged 30. On 20 March 2007 he was sentenced in the Newcastle District Court to imprisonment for 4 years, commencing 11 May 2006 and expiring 10 May 2010, with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring 10 May 2008 for an offence of aggravated break and enter while armed with a dangerous weapon. He was further sentenced for robbery while armed with an offensive weapon to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months, commencing 11 May 2007 and concluding 10 November 2011, with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring 10 May 2009.

12His Honour noted that at the time of the manslaughter, the applicant was on parole for the offence of armed robbery and his Honour treated that as a matter of aggravation. Because of his criminal history, his Honour gave more weight to considerations of deterrence and the protection of the community than would otherwise be the case. His Honour also took into account the need for general deterrence.

13His Honour allowed a discount of 12.5 percent for the applicant's plea of guilty.

14His Honour found that by his plea of guilty the applicant had accepted responsibility for the part that he had played in the death of the deceased and that his plea indicated contrition for the offence. His Honour took into account this level of remorse as a mitigating factor. Despite the applicant's expression of remorse and intention to return to labouring work upon his release, his Honour was not prepared to make a positive finding that he was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

15I now set out the following paragraphs from his Honour's sentence judgment, which are relevant to the Grounds of Appeal.

""23 The offender's sentence for armed robbery was not to expire until 10 November 2011 and at the time of his arrest on 17 November 2010, he was on parole for this offence. It appears from the offender's custodial history (ex A TB 8 p 1) that the offender completed this sentence on 6 December 2011 following his return to custody and not on 10 November 2011 as submitted by Mr Brewer. It is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offence for which the offender was sentenced in the District Court and the offence of manslaughter are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This fact does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. 


24 The offender's custody until 6 December 2011 was as a consequence of his breach of parole for armed robbery. I do not think that partial concurrency with that sentence would adequately reflect the criminality of the armed robbery or the offence of manslaughter. Accordingly, I consider it appropriate that the commencement date of the present sentence is 6 December 2011.


25 Although Mr Brewer did not submit that a finding should be made of special circumstances, I find special circumstances as the present sentence has been made cumulative upon the existing sentence: R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; Close v R (1992) 31 NSWLR 743. I have determined that a non-parole period of 5 years is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].


26 Taking into account all matters that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence is 8 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 12.5 per cent to 7 years.""

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in fixing the commencement date of the sentence on 6 December 2011.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence which gives the appearance of double punishment.

16The applicant dealt with these two Grounds of Appeal together and I see no reason to depart from that approach. In order to understand the basis for these Grounds of Appeal, it is necessary to set out some additional factual matters.

17In the review of the factual background, the sentence imposed on the applicant for the armed robbery offence has already been set out. The applicant was released to parole on 10 May 2010, which was 1 year after eligibility. On 5 November 2010 the parole authority revoked the applicant's parole effective from 22 October 2010 (the revocation date). The applicant was taken into custody in relation to the offence, the subject of these proceedings, on 17 November 2010 - 26 days after the revocation date. Because the applicant had been at liberty for 26 days beyond the revocation date, a new expiry date was fixed for his armed robbery sentence - 6 December 2011 (i.e., 26 days after the original expiry date of 10 November 2011). The applicant was entitled to have his revocation of parole reviewed on 16 November 2011.

18The applicant submitted that the 26 day period of incarceration from 17 November to 6 December 2011 had been solely referable to the manslaughter offence for which he was being sentenced. In those circumstances, he submitted that at the very least, the commencement date of the sentence should have been 17 November 2011.

19The applicant submitted that looking at the matter from a broad perspective, there was also a question of whether the sentence should have been commenced at a date earlier than 17 November 2011. This was because his requirement to serve the additional sentence was directly related to the manslaughter offence for which he was being sentenced.

20The applicant noted that the reasons given for the revocation of parole were as follows:

(i)Unable to adapt to normal community life.

(ii)Failure to report to the parole officer as directed from 22 October 2010.

(iii)Failure to reside at an address approved by the parole officer.

The applicant submitted that considerations (ii) and (iii) were indirectly related to the commission of the manslaughter offence and that consideration (i) was directly related to it.

21In support of this submission, the applicant relied upon the following statements of principle in Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58. In particular, the applicant relied upon the following paragraphs:

""12 On behalf of the applicant reliance was placed upon a number of previous decisions of this Court, to some of which I was a party. Two separate strands of authority have emerged. One is represented in R v Eric John Andrews, NSWCCA, unreported, 28 April 1993. There Hunt CJ at CL (as he then was) said: 

""It is quite fallacious to assert (as it is so often asserted) that the prisoner is being punished twice for the same thing in those circumstances. The parole is revoked because, by reason of the further offence committed, it has been demonstrated that the applicant was unable to adapt to normal lawful community life and therefore is no longer entitled to parole in relation to the earlier offence; the sentence is imposed as punishment for the further offence itself committed whilst on parole: R v Ian Jeffrey Gale (CCA, 20 April 1993, unreported) at 3.

That does not mean that there will not be some situations in which it would be just to date the new sentence back to a date prior to its imposition. In my view, however, this is not the case in which to lay down guidelines in relation to when that should be done.""

That statement was adopted by Meagher JA, with whom Hidden J agreed, in R v Brett John Kelly [2000] NSWCCA 557.

13 The other line of authority is exemplified by the decision in R v Kaiva, NSWCCA, unreported, 9 November 1998. There Kirby J, with whom I agreed, said: 

""Secondly, his Honour expressly took into account, as a circumstance of aggravation, the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. That was entirely appropriate. The sentence which he then passed reflected that circumstance. Having taken that matter into account, to then not backdate the sentence gives the appearance of penalising the prisoner for a second time, in respect of the same matter. That, it seems to me, is also undesirable."" (emphasis added)

14 It is apposite to emphasise here that Kirby J did not hold that double punishment actually occurred; merely that the process gave that appearance. On the same day, the same bench took an identical approach in R v David Webb, NSWCCA, unreported, 9 November 1998. 
15 However, in Regina v Shane John Ravet [2001] NSWCCA 535, Stein JA expressly declined to accept that Kaiva and Webb established any principle. His Honour regarded them, rather, as examples demonstrating that backdating to the date of revocation of parole may be within a judge's sentencing discretion in appropriate circumstances. 

16 In R v Kitchener [2003] NSWCCA 134 the court was constituted by Wood CJ at CL (as he then was) and myself. 

17 There, an offender whose parole had been revoked was sentenced in respect of subsequent offences in such a fashion as to allow credit for only six days of a thirteen month balance of term. The reasons for the parole revocation were not confined to the subsequent offending, but included other specified breaches of parole conditions. 

18 I considered, and Wood CJ at CL agreed, that, in some circumstances, a court sentencing in respect of subsequent offences would find it necessary to attempt the hypothetical exercise of assessing what the offender's parole position would or might have been had parole been revoked not as a result (solely) of the subsequent offending, but solely or partly as a result of his other breaches of parole conditions. 

19 The Crown drew attention to the decision of this Court in R v SAE NSWCCA, unreported, 3 April 1997, per Gleeson CJ, with whom Mason P and Dowd J agreed. Gleeson CJ said: 

""The usual principle is that allowance is made for pre-sentence custody but only in circumstances where such pre-sentence custody is exclusively referable to the crime for which the offender has been sentenced.""

20 I do not accept that his Honour intended to lay down as an absolute rule that, where pre-sentence custody is referable partly to the crime for which an offender is being sentenced, and partly to some other circumstance, such as revocation of parole, that pre-sentence custody may never be taken into account. The judgment was delivered ex-tempore and the passage cited was not essential to this decision. 

21 That the matter is discretionary appears to be the prevailing view of members of this Court. Even in Andrews and Kelly, the court accepted that a judge might backdate a sentence where parole had been revoked by reason of the offence for which the offender is then to be sentenced. 

22 I maintain the view that a discretion exists. There is no clear rule which will govern all cases. The circumstances that bring an offender before a court for sentence after parole has been revoked are far too varied to permit a single absolute rule.

23 It would, in my opinion, in some cases be unfair not to backdate to some point (not necessarily the date of revocation of parole) before the expiration of the earlier parole period. It is always open to an offender to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation; to sentence in such a way as to commence the subsequent sentence only on the date of expiration of the whole of the previously imposed head sentence is to assume that, absent the subsequent offences, the offender would not have been granted a second chance at parole. 

24 However, I am also of the view that, particularly where, as here, the re-offending has occurred within a very short time of release on parole, and the balance of term to which the offender is exposed is quite short, it may be appropriate to proceed on the hypothesis that the whole of the period spent in custody up to the expiration of the parole period is, as Hunt CJ at CL said, referable to the earlier offences and not to the subsequent offences. 

25 Thus, I am of the view that the sentencing judge did have a discretion to make the sentences wholly or partly cumulative upon the sentence to which the applicant was, as a consequence of the revocation of parole, serving. That allowed her a period of six months. She could have specified the current sentences to commence at any time during that period. 

26 The second question which arises is whether is has been shown that the exercise of her discretion miscarried. I am unable to see that that has been established. I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.""

22The applicant also relied upon the observations of Basten JA at [34] - [36] and RS Hulme J at [79] in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66:

""34 In due course the respondent's parole was revoked, with effect from 30 July 2009, when he was arrested, leaving him with a period of six months and nine days to be served, expiring on 7 February 2010. The penalty imposed for the conspiracy did not in fact commence until 30 March 2010. However, the nine month non-parole period imposed in respect of count 3 was back-dated to the date of arrest and thus was concurrent with (and exceeded) the whole of the balance of parole. The sentence on count 2 (the fixed term of 18 months) commenced on 30 December 2009, thus overlapping with the balance of parole, but only for a period of a little over one month. The 2.5 years non-parole period in respect of the conspiracy was concurrent with 15 months of the fixed term imposed for count 2 (and concurrent with one month of the non-parole period imposed for count 3).


35 Although it was submitted that the commencement date for the sentences for the new offences should not properly have been backdated, the primary submission was that the extent of the backdating, to the commencement of custody relating to the new offences, was excessive. In circumstances where the offences constitute the reason for the revocation of parole, it is important not to double count the fact that the offences were committed whilst serving an incomplete sentence for an earlier offence, and whilst on parole for that offence. It is also necessary to consider whether there should be a degree of concurrency, to allow for the possibility that the respondent could have been re-paroled during the course of the balance of term on the earlier offence: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 at [21]-[23] (Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing). A further factor to be taken into account on the appeal is that the prosecutor's submissions on sentence accepted the backdating to the commencement of the new period of custody. That factor is not conclusive against intervention, but is a consideration which may persuade the Court not to intervene in the exercise of its residual discretion. 


36 As a degree of accumulation in respect of the new offences was permissible, the only issue in terms of concurrency was the failure to commence the first of the new sentences at some point after the date of arrest. Given the length of the balance of the term of the offence for which parole was revoked, the sentencing judge was not required to allow more than four months, attributable purely to the balance of the earlier term. That this would have been a relatively short increase in the overall sentence period is a factor which tends to weigh against intervention in the exercise of the Court's discretion, even if satisfied that such an additional period should have been imposed."" (Basten JA)

""79 There is no doubt that the decision as when, within a period of revoked parole, another sentence should commence is a matter of discretion - see Callaghan v R [2006[ NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145. It may be at the beginning; it may be at the end; it may be somewhere in between. A number of matters are liable to inform the exercise of that discretion. Without attempting to be exhaustive, one is the fact that imprisonment for the period of revoked parole is, in its origins, due to the sentence pursuant to which the period when the offender was eligible for parole was granted. Revocation may have occurred because it has been demonstrated that an offender has been unable to adapt to normal community life. A second, although there will commonly be overlapping with the first, may be as in this case, that the revocation arises in consequence of a new offence for which a fresh sentence is being imposed, rather than for some unconnected cause. A third and fourth are likely to be the period served with apparent adherence to the terms of parole and the periods of revocation and for which the revocation is liable to continue."" (RS Hulme J)

23The applicant submitted that there should have been a period of partial concurrency between the manslaughter sentence and the period of revoked parole because there was an appearance of double punishment. This was because there was a finding that the offence was aggravated by having been committed while on parole. In making that submission, the applicant acknowledged that a finding of aggravation of this kind, pursuant to s21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 did not prevent a sentence being cumulative. Nevertheless, by reference to the decision of R v Kaiva (referred to at [13] of Callaghan) the applicant submitted that a failure to backdate a sentence in such circumstances gave an appearance of penalising the prisoner for a second time in respect of the same matter.

24The applicant relied upon expressions of opinion to similar effect in R v David Webb (NSWCCA, unreported 9 November 1998).

25The applicant relied upon the observation in R v Callaghan that potential unfairness might arise in circumstances where a sentence was totally cumulative in that such a sentence would make no allowance for an offender having a second chance to have parole granted. On that issue the applicant noted that he was entitled to apply for a review of his revocation of parole on 16 November 2011. He submitted that his Honour should have backdated the commencement date of the manslaughter sentence to that date so as to have due regard to the possibility that he might have been granted parole at that time.

26The applicant submitted that by reference to what was said in R v Callaghan at [24] his re-offending did not occur within a very short time of release to parole, and that the balance of term following the revocation of parole was lengthy. He submitted that in Callaghan and DW these were considerations which pointed towards some level of concurrency between the new sentence and the period of parole that had been revoked.

Consideration

27These Grounds of Appeal are misconceived. To the extent that reliance is placed on R v DW, it should be noted that this was a Crown appeal and the issue before the court was not whether the sentence should have been backdated to the period during which parole had been revoked, but the extent of such backdating. The resolution of that appeal turned upon an exercise of the residual discretion, a consideration which does not arise in this case.

28Callaghan v R is a useful decision because of its review of previous decisions of this Court and the statements of principle therein. What should not be lost sight of is that the effect of that review is that the decision of a sentencing judge as to whether or not to make a new sentence partially concurrent or wholly cumulative upon a revoked period of parole involves the exercise of a discretion by that judge. The exercise of discretion has to be carried out in a principled way but it remains the exercise of a discretion. 

29For the applicant to succeed on these grounds, he needed to show that it was not open to Price J to exercise the discretion in the way in which he did. Unless the applicant could point to a specific error (which he could not) it was necessary for him to establish that the discretion was wrongly exercised on House v King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 49 grounds. This he has not done.

30It is important to note that the applicant had only been on parole for the completely separate armed robbery offence for 5 months at the time of the commission of the manslaughter. When his parole was revoked, he still had approximately 1 year and 20 days of his parole period to serve. By the time the applicant was sentenced for the manslaughter offence, he had already served the balance of his term of parole as a consequence of the revocation.

31There can be no suggestion that his Honour failed to turn his mind to this issue. His Honour specifically referred to it and gave compelling reasons for why, the manslaughter sentence should be fully cumulative on the armed robbery sentence. His Honour's reasons are set out at [15] hereof.

32His Honour's reasons related primarily, but not solely, to the question of totality. His Honour noted that the armed robbery offence and the manslaughter offence were discrete and independent acts of criminality. In that regard, his Honour took into account the oft quoted observations of Howie J in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]:

""27 In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. ...""

33His Honour having turned his mind to the question of totality concluded (as was clearly open to him) that partial concurrency of the manslaughter sentence with the revoked period of parole would not adequately reflect the criminality of the armed robbery nor the offence of manslaughter.

34A similar situation to that confronting his Honour came before this Court in Ith v R [2013] NSWCCA 280. There the Court, for reasons similar to those expressed by his Honour, upheld the second sentence being fully cumulative upon a revoked period of parole of 1 year and 7 months. In reaching that conclusion, the Court acknowledged the undoubted discretion of the sentencing judge to cumulate in that way.

35There are other considerations which support this exercise of discretion by his Honour. Of the three reasons put forward for the revocation of parole, only one directly related to the commission of the manslaughter offence. The other two arose from attempts by the applicant to avoid apprehension after the commission of the manslaughter. It is also not without significance that experienced counsel who appeared for the applicant before his Honour conceded that it was open to his Honour to totally cumulate the manslaughter sentence on the revoked parole period (27.9.2013, T.12).

36In the course of the appeal, a subsidiary issue arose. This was the question of whether the applicant should be able to rely upon an affidavit which produced additional material from the State Parole Authority concerning the circumstances surrounding the applicant's revocation of parole. Some, but not all, of that material was before his Honour in the sentence proceedings. 

37The purpose of the affidavit was to ground a submission that if his Honour had been aware of that material, he would have commenced the manslaughter sentence on 10 November 2011, not 6 December 2011. The reasoning appears to be that had his Honour been in possession of this information, he would have appreciated that because the applicant had been ""on the run"" between 22 October and 17 November 2011 when he was apprehended, the parole authority had added that 26 days to the original expiry date of the sentence which was 10 November 2011. Another reason for seeking to read the affidavit seems to have been to establish that on 16 November 2011 the applicant would have been entitled to apply to the parole authority to review his revocation of parole.

38I would reject the affidavit on two bases. The first is that it is neither new nor fresh evidence. The material was available at the time when his Honour sentenced the applicant and could have been easily obtained (as it was for the hearing of the appeal). Another and perhaps more important reason for rejecting the affidavit is that to read it in these proceedings would serve no useful purpose. Given his Honour's approach to the criminality of both the armed robbery and the manslaughter offences, it is most unlikely that he would have backdated the commencement date of the manslaughter sentence to 10 November. This is because the additional 26 days was added to the revoked parole period pursuant to s171 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 to take into account the period during which the applicant was seeking to avoid apprehension. Similarly, the possibility of the applicant successfully persuading the parole authority to reconsider its revocation of his parole on 16 November 2011, only 20 days before the balance of parole period expired, could only be regarded as remote.

39These Grounds of Appeal have not been made out.

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in inadequately reducing the non-parole period given the basis of his Honour's finding of special circumstance.

40The applicant submitted that while his Honour found special circumstances because of the manslaughter sentence being cumulative upon the revocation of parole period, the reduction of the statutory ratio from 75 percent to 71.42 percent was inadequate.

41In support of that proposition the applicant relied upon Fitzpatrick, Sharon Lee v R [2010] NSWCCA 26 where the Court was asked to consider an adjustment of the overall non-parole period after a finding of special circumstances. The applicant relied upon the following extract from that decision.

""32 A finding of special circumstances is purposive, in that it is a warrant for reducing the non-parole period below the statutory ratio. Consideration of factors giving rise to a finding of special circumstances is not always limited to the rehabilitation of the offender but will often be the purpose for such a finding: R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25; (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [105].

33 Can it be said in the present case that his Honour's finding of special circumstances was not carried through in the sentence that he imposed? In the particular circumstances of this case, does a reduction of the non-parole period by only 2 months constitute a failure by his Honour properly or adequately to reflect the finding?""

42The applicant submitted that because the finding of special circumstances in this case was based solely upon the cumulation of the two sentences, the amount of the adjusted ratio should have been greater so as to reflect the extent of the cumulation which was built into the manslaughter judgment.

43This Ground of Appeal should be rejected. The ground and submissions in support fail to understand what his Honour was seeking to achieve by his finding of special circumstances and his adjustment of the statutory ratio.

44His Honour was clearly aware that he was fully cumulating the sentence for manslaughter upon the revoked parole period. Not only was this expressly indicated in the judgment, there was no other reason for the finding. There was no suggestion that the applicant was in need of an extended period of supervision or counselling. 

45His Honour had already made a finding in relation to the criminality of the manslaughter offence that ""a non-parole period of 5 years is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence."" This was in line with the observation of Spigelman CJ at [63] in Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 where he said:

""63 ... there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.""

46Having determined that 5 years was the appropriate non-parole period, it was necessary for his Honour to make some adjustment to the parole/non-parole ratio for the manslaughter offence, otherwise the combined effect of the non-parole period for the manslaughter offence and the revoked parole period would have given rise to a total sentence which did not reflect the statutory ratio. This can be demonstrated in two ways. The non-parole period for the manslaughter represented 71.4 percent of the total term and when the balance of parole to be served by the applicant (1 year 20 days) is added to the non-parole period for the manslaughter (5 years), it represented approximately 75 percent of the total period imposed for the manslaughter and balance of term (i.e. 8 years 20 days).

47This can also be demonstrated by the diagram attached to these reasons. 

48The effect of what his Honour did in his finding of special circumstances and his adjustment of the non-parole period in the manslaughter sentence was to maintain the statutory ratio when the balance of parole and the manslaughter sentence were combined.

49The orders which I propose are:

(2)Leave to appeal is granted.

(3)The appeal is dismissed.

2765039,Hamzy v R [2014] NSWCCA 223,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceOn 22 November 2010 the applicant was committed for sentence from the Burwood Local Court on the following counts:
Count 1 - That he did between 17 and 18 May 2008 in Sydney supply an amount of prohibited drug, to wit 372 grams of methylamphetamine, being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
Count 2 - That he did between 8 and 9 June 2008 at Auburn in the State of New South Wales supply an amount of prohibited drug, to wit methylamphetamine 995 grams being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
2Each offence was contrary to s25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMT Act) and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 3500 penalty units, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
3In relation to Count 2, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account a number of Form 1 matters:
(1)Between 17 and 18 May 2008 deal with the proceeds of crime knowing that it was the proceeds of crime in the sum of $21,000 (contrary to s193B(2) Crimes Act 1900).
(2)On 5 June 2008 supply prohibited drug (182 grams methylamphetamine) (contrary to s25(1) DMT Act).
(3)On 9 June 2008 deal with the proceeds of crime knowing that it was the proceeds of crime in the sum of $31,400 (contrary to s193B(2) Crimes Act 1900).
(4)On 14 June 2008 deal with the proceeds of crime knowing that it was the proceeds of crime in the sum of $117,000 (contrary to s193B(2) Crimes Act 1900).
(5)Between 1 May 2008 and 14 June 2008 participate in a criminal group, that participation contributing to the occurrence of criminal activities (contrary to s93T(1) Crimes Act 1900).
4Matters (1), (3) and (4) on the Form 1 carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.  Matter (2) on the Form 1 carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.  Matter (5) carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.
5The applicant was sentenced as follows:
Count 1 - Imprisonment for 6 years to commence 4 December 2008 and to expire 3 December 2014 with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 3 December 2012.
Count 2 (and Form 1 matters) - Imprisonment for 8 years and 6 months to commence on 4 December 2009 and to expire 3 June 2018 with a non-parole period of 6 years to expire 3 December 2015.
6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - In granting the applicant a combined discount of 30 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and the value of the assistance he provided, his Honour entertained a false presumption that the applicant had previously received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
Ground 2 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed on the co-offender referred to as OS1.
Factual Background
7The applicant was born in 1952 and is the father of Bassam Hamzy and Ghassan Amoun and the uncle of Mohammed Hamze.
8Between 21 April 2007 and 7 July 2008 Bassam Hamzy was a sentenced prisoner at Lithgow Gaol.  He was in possession of an unauthorised mobile telephone.
9Between 1 May 2008 and 11 June 2008 that telephone service was lawfully intercepted.  During this time, a high level of organised criminal activity was identified.  The mobile phone was used on average 460 times a day and the majority of the calls recorded were associated with the activities of the criminal group.  
10The calls revealed that Bassam Hamzy was the principal of a criminal group which operated a drug supply network between Sydney and Melbourne between May and June 2008.
11The criminal group comprised family members of Bassam Hamzy, including the applicant and associates.  Bassam Hamzy led and directed the activities of the group by sourcing and distributing prohibited drugs and managing the profits from the sales and otherwise managing the group including seeking out new members.
12In total the syndicate was involved in nine discrete instances of supplying a prohibited drug.  The applicant was involved in three of those supplies.
Count 1 - Supply of commercial quantity methylamphetamine (372 grams)
13On Monday 5 May 2008 Bassam Hamzy was contacted by Mohammed Hamze, who was a relative.  Those conversations discussed transporting drugs from Melbourne and finding a courier to transport drugs to Melbourne.  Subsequently, OS1, who owned a small transport company, was recruited as the courier for the syndicate using his legitimate company to conceal the illegal operations of the syndicate.
14On 17 and 18 May Bassam Hamzy, OS1, Mohammed Hamze and Ghassan Amoun agreed to supply Imran Allouche with 372 grams of methylamphetamine.
15The methylamphetamine to be supplied to Allouche was obtained by the applicant.  The applicant in turn provided the drugs to Amoun who delivered them to OS1.  OS1 took this package to Melbourne and with Mohammed Hamze arranged to supply the methylamphetamine to Imran Allouche.
16Telephone discussions took place in the course of which money owed to the syndicate by a Con Bodiotis was discussed.  OS1 confirmed that he had $21,000 that was part payment from Bodiotis for drugs previously supplied.  Arrangements were made for OS1 to go to the home of the applicant and give him the $21,000.  This occurred.  (The collection of the $21,000 from Bodiotis is the foundation of the offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime being charge number 1 on the Form 1.)
17On 17 May discussions took place as to the purity of the drug being supplied.  One of those conversations involved Bassam Hamzy and the applicant.  The applicant who had called the supplier said that the drugs were of better purity than those supplied to them previously.
18Subsequently, a new price for the drugs was negotiated because of the purity.  OS1 confirmed that he took the drugs directly from Amoun and then passed them onto Allouche.  On 20 May 2008 OS1 contacted Bassam Hamzy and during this conversation they spoke of Allouche owing the syndicate $85,000.
Count 2 - Supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 8 - 14 June 2008 (995 grams)
19On 8 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy and the applicant agreed that the applicant would obtain a significant quantity of methylamphetamine from an unknown supplier.  The applicant told Bassam Hamzy that the price for the drug was $185,000.  The drug had a high level of purity.  By 9 June 2008 the applicant had successfully obtained 995 grams of methylamphetamine from the supplier.
20In due course OS1 attended upon the applicant and collected the methylamphetamine.  Those drugs were taken to Melbourne for on-supply.  In discussions between OS1 and Bassam Hamzy, the drugs were described as of high quality.  OS1 was given directions to supply 164 grams to Con Bodiotis and the remaining quantity to other persons who were named.  Payment of $110,000 for 500 grams of methylamphetamine was eventually negotiated.
21On the evening of 10 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy and OS1 spoke about the proceeds of the supply (and intended supply) of the methylamphetamine.  Bassam Hamzy told OS1 to tell the applicant that he missed his flight and would return to Sydney with the money the following day.  Later that night, OS1 told Bassam Hamzy that he had so far collected $33,500 from Bodiotis.  Subsequently, most of the methylamphetamine was supplied to Bodiotis.  By the evening of 12 June 2008 OS1 advised that he had collected $65,000 from Con Bodiotis and that Bodiotis owed a further $125,000.
22On 13 June the applicant complained to Bassam Hamzy about how long it was taking for the money to be collected and that his supplier would not trust him any more.  The applicant told Mohammed Hamze that he had to get $185,000 to pay his supplier for the methylamphetamine before anything else.
23At 10.20pm on 13 June 2008, the applicant travelled from Sydney to Melbourne and received $117,000 collected by OS1 and Mohammed Hamze (the collection of the $117,000 is the offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime being Charge (4) on the Form 1).
24The applicant then returned to Sydney from Melbourne driving the same car OS1 had used to transport the kilogram of methylamphetamine on 9 June 2008.
25In a conversation on the afternoon of 14 June 2008, OS1 told Mohammed Hamze that the applicant was ""dirty"" because he thought there was money missing.  OS1 told Mohammed Hamze that the applicant thought there should be $240,000 but only collected $117,000 from OS1.  At 7pm on 14 June 2008 Con Bodiotis told Mohammed Hamze that he was still owed $56,000 and was arranging that amount of money for tomorrow.  Mohammed Hamze said his uncle (the applicant) was ""fuming"".  OS1 flew to Sydney from Melbourne, arriving in Sydney at 10.35pm.
26On 23 August 2008 a conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the applicant was lawfully recorded.  During this conversation both the applicant and his son discussed various amounts of money owed to them, including from Mohammed Hamze.  Bassam Hamzy was recorded as saying that Mohammed had ripped them off for $90,000.
Additional Form 1 facts
Charge 2 and 3 on the Form 1:  Supply prohibited drug (182 grams of  methylamphetamine) and knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime ($31,400)
27Between 5 and 6 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy agreed to supply a quantity of methylamphetamine to Con Bodiotis.  The applicant obtained 182 grams of methylamphetamine which was delivered to Khaled Taleb who took the drug to Melbourne and delivered it to Con Bodiotis.
28On 6 June 2008 a conversation took place between Bassam Hamzy and Con Bodiotis.  A price for the methylamphetamine to be supplied was negotiated.  Due to the poor quality of the drug, Bodiotis would only have to pay $33,500 for 6 ounces.
29At 6pm on 7 June 2008 a conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the applicant was intercepted.  In this conversation Bassam Hamzy and the applicant discussed how much they should collect for the drug.  The applicant told Bassam Hamzy that he paid $5,180 per ounce for the drug.  In subsequent conversations, Bassam Hamzy discussed the collection of money from Con Bodiotis, being payment for the supply of 182 grams of methylamphetamine.  Eventually, Con Bodiotis arranged for $31,400 in total to be delivered to the applicant and this took place.
Charge No 5 on the Form 1
Participating in a criminal group from 1 May 2008 to 5 July 2008
30In May 2008 OS1 was the sole director of Parcdel Pty Ltd.  That company operated three refrigerated trucks in the Sydney area.  OS1 advised Bassam Hamzy that the business was heavily in debt and that he was close to having his fleet of trucks repossessed.  Bassam Hamzy and OS1 came to an arrangement whereby Bassam Hamzy was to support the business with his own money and from the proceeds of subsequent supplies of prohibited drugs.  In return for the injection of money, OS1 agreed that the company would act as a front for other activities involving Bassam Hamzy's family and associates.  A number of Bassam Hamzy's family members, including the applicant, were to be directors of the company.
31BPay accounts were set up to allow the depositing of monies directly into the company accounts.  Parcdel's trucks were to be used for the supply of drugs to interstate purchasers under the guise of carrying on a legitimate freight business.
Proceedings in the District Court and the findings of the sentencing judge
32In reviewing the facts, his Honour found that the drug supply network operated by Bassam Hamzy depended for its success upon persons such as the applicant who were willing to become involved in facilitating negotiations and other arrangements for the supply of the prohibited drugs.
33In relation to assistance provided to the authorities, his Honour noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant approached the authorities and provided a line of communication between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy with a view to the Crime Commission furthering legitimate investigative operational objectives.  The importance of that communication was that Bassam Hamzy had told the Crime Commission officers that he was able to return certain items which the Crime Commission was looking for.  His Honour found that there was a real issue as to whether Bassam Hamzy ever had the knowledge and capacity to retrieve the particular items.  His Honour accepted that the applicant genuinely thought that his son did have such a capacity.
34It was the applicant's submission that the only way these items could be obtained was if sufficient money was available to purchase them.  Since the Crime Commission was not prepared to pay that money, it was necessary for him and his son to deal in drugs in order to obtain money to pay for these items.  The applicant believed that the acquisition of these items would improve his position and that of Bassam Hamzy with the Crime Commission.  The Crown disputed that this was the applicant's motivation.  The Crown submitted that profit was the prime motivation.
35His Honour found (ROS 35.5) as follows:
""The matter must proceed on the basis that the offender was involved in the supply of drugs for a limited period between 17 May and 24 June, a period a little over one month.  However the material before me, including the conduct of the offender beyond this period and inferences that can be drawn from what the offender said in the intercepted calls, provide colour and context to the true role of the offender in the particular supplies for which he is to be sentenced.   It would be artificial to look only at the conduct of the offender in the steps towards effecting the particular supplies when there is a body of other evidence to place his conduct in some context and which would assist in understanding his role in the overall enterprise compared to other participants and in particular in understanding his position in relation to Bassam Hamzy and OS1.""
His Honour decided that it would be best to proceed on the basis of what the applicant actually did (ROS 35.9).
36His Honour described the participation of the applicant as follows (ROS 36.1):
""In relation to the three occasions the offender played a role in the supply of prohibited drug, the offender was involved in the procurement of the drug for on supply. The evidence suggests that he sourced the drug from one particular supplier.
The offender was engaged in the processes towards the delivery of the drug and it's transportation to Melbourne. The offender also played a significant role in the recouping of monies that were collected by others in Melbourne.
The offender was at all times acting on the direction of his son though he was able to bring some enterprise into the procuring of the drug.  Contributions he made in discussions with Bassam Hamzy about procurement of the drug would suggest that he was able to bring some knowledge of the illicit drug trade into the negotiating process. As can be seen in the extracts of the intercepted calls I have referred to the offender speaks with Bassam Hamzy about aspects of the negotiation for the procurement of the drug including references to the quality and quantity of the drug procured from the supplier.
The offender at times organised others in effecting steps in the supply of the drug in Melbourne. On one occasion he provided a vehicle to OS1 to transport a quantity of drug. He also adopted a role in overseeing the collection of monies and acted as the repository of the monies realised in the supplies in which he was involved.  The offender provided a crucial role in putting into effect the supplies promoted by his son who was otherwise constrained by his incarceration.  In that regard the offender provided an effective conduit for Bassam Hamzy.
The involvement of the accused at the level of procurement, the nature of the discussions with his son at the time of procurement, the involvement of the offender in the collection of monies, his overseeing role at times and the provision of assistance to those effecting the transactions support the conclusion that, in those supplies that he was involved in, he was at the nucleus of the organisation of the supply. He provided essential support and assistance to his son Bassam Hamzy and was involved in a number of steps in the planning of the supplies.
I am of the view, having considered the content of the intercepted calls that the offender would have been aware of the scale of the operation that Bassam Hamzy was controlling from custody. With regard to the matter on the form one relating to the offender's participation in a criminal group, I am of the view that the offender intended a continuing role in the criminal enterprise controlled by Bassam Hamzy. The conduct of the offender in assisting Bassam Hamzy referred to in the statement of facts extends past the period in which the offender was involved in the supply offences for which he faces sentence.""
37At ROS 38.8 his Honour said:
""It is conceded by counsel for the offender that the offender's role was pivotal in the supply of substantial quantities of prohibited drug in the three supply transactions in which he was involved.  ...
I am not of the view that the offender's role was the equivalent of Bassam Hamzy in the drug supplies in which he was involved. I am of the view also that the role of OS1 was ultimately greater than the role of the offender. I will further refer to the role of OS1 when considering the issue of parity of sentence.""
38In relation to the quantity of drugs involved, his Honour said:
""Quantity is not the sole determinative factor. The offender was however trafficking in prohibited drugs to a substantial degree. In relation to count one, the quantity involved, 372 grams, is towards the bottom half of the range of quantities within the commercial quantity for methylamphetamine.  The amount of 995g is at the top of the range of commercial quantities of methylamphetamine.  The quantity of drug the subject of the third supply on the form one, 182 grams, is less than the commercial quantity.""
His Honour found that the applicant ""knew that the purpose of the supplies was to realise a substantial profit"".  (ROS 39.4)
39In relation to motivation, his Honour found:
""Whilst there was a benefit to the community in the retrieval of the [items], I cannot be satisfied that this was a motivation for his offending.  I am of the view that the offender's motives were not altruistic.  He was keen for a significant benefit to flow to his son from the retrieval of them [items] and he was prepared to engage in substantial criminal conduct to achieve that purpose. In his attempts to achieve that purpose he was prepared to be involved in the dissemination of large quantities of prohibited drug, which would have had as a consequence substantial harm to the community.  The content and nature of the intercepted conversations in which the offender was involved, which I have referred to at length, and his conduct in effecting the supplies do not suggest any impaired or flawed thinking.
The offending is objectively serious and calls for a strong element of deterrence.""
40His Honour reviewed the applicant's personal factors.  He was born in Lebanon.  He had a happy childhood, except for the Lebanese civil war which affected his village.  He migrated to Australia in 1973 at the age of 20 but returned to Lebanon at the end of 1974.  He married in Lebanon in 1975.  Due to further civil unrest in Lebanon in 1975, he returned to Australia with his wife.  Together the applicant and his wife had five children.  On return to Australia, the applicant maintained regular employment until he injured his back and neck in a car accident in 1982.  He ceased work and received a substantial compensation payout in 1986.
41In 1988 the applicant gained part-time employment as a leather cutter and in 1989, he and a friend created a company to export powdered milk to Lebanon.  This company was used to facilitate the importation of heroin.  The company was wound up when the applicant was arrested in 1991.  The applicant received a lengthy sentence for the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin and was not released to parole until 2005.  Upon his release, he worked part-time until May 2008.  The applicant was receiving unemployment benefits at the time of his arrest for these offences.
42The applicant's marriage was dissolved in 1996.  He said that he maintained a close relationship with all of his children.  
43As already indicated, the most significant matter insofar as the applicant's criminal record was concerned is his conviction of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin, for which he received a sentence of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.  The applicant was on parole for that matter when he committed the offences, the subject of this appeal.  
44His Honour accepted that his plea of guilty indicated a degree of remorse.  In relation to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, his Honour said:
""I am satisfied that the plea of guilty was entered on 22 November, 2011.  The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court following committal proceedings where the issue was the quantity of drug involved.  The crown subsequently accepted a plea to a lesser count of supply the commercial quantity of prohibited drug.  The offender was committed for sentence from the local court.  The pleas could be said to have been entered at an early opportunity.
The offender is entitled, having regard to the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, to a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea. 
I will return to set out the discount for the offender's plea together with the discount on sentence for the offender's assistance to the authorities.""  (ROS 45.8)
45His Honour found it difficult to assess the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and was unable to make any meaningful prediction.  His Honour noted that the applicant was involved again in criminal conduct of a most serious kind and faced a further lengthy period of imprisonment.  His Honour also noted that the applicant had spent a considerable period of his adult life in custody, i.e. 16 of the last 19 ½ years.
46Nevertheless, given his age on release, his Honour considered that the applicant would require some continuing assistance through supervision.  His Honour thought that the parole period which he intended to impose would allow sufficient opportunity for supervision and accordingly, he declined to find special circumstances.
47His Honour took into account parity, with particular reference to OS1.  His Honour said:
""Ensuring parity in sentencing with the sentences imposed upon the offender OS1 is not without difficulty.  There are limitations in comparing the sentences imposed.  Prosecutorial decisions as to the groupings of particular amounts of drug make it difficult to determine the sentence imposed on those amounts supplied which are common to both the offender and OS1.  Counts involving the large commercial quantity were proffered which grouped what are supplies within a course of conduct.
The counts to which the offender OS1 pleaded guilty involved the supply of large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs together with other unrelated criminal activity.
OS1 was sentenced for his involvement in additional supply offences identified in the intercepted calls for which the offender does not face sentence here.
On the material before me the offender OS1, over time, became significantly involved in the overall management of the movement of the drugs and in significant aspects of the negotiation of the supplies.  The offender OS1 was substantially involved in the collection of monies the subject of the sales on behalf of the syndicate.  The offender OS1 played a critical role in the preparation and transport of substantial quantities of drug.  These findings are consistent with the findings of the sentencing judge. OS1 ultimately became a significant member in the syndicate operated by Bassam Hamzy.
OS1 was involved in a number of supply transactions over a greater period. The offences for which he was sentenced involved greater quantities of drugs. 
OS1 was also sentenced on an objectively serious offence of aggravated break enter and steal. He received a separate sentence for that offence of two years with a non-parole of 18 months.
I am of the view that in all of the circumstances here issues concerning parity of sentence with OS1, whilst relevant, have only limited application.""  (ROS 50.1)
48His Honour then reviewed the applicant's assistance to authorities.  His Honour noted that the applicant had provided information to authorities which had led to an Islamic cleric being banned from entering gaol because this cleric was responsible for radical Islamic teachings amongst prisoners.
49He provided information about some murder suspects, but these suspects were already known to the police.  He did not make a statement.  The information provided was not particularly valuable.  He acted as conduit between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy, but ultimately that communication led to nothing and no reliable information was provided.  In relation to that contact, his Honour said:
""In relation to the offender's assistance generally, it would appear at the time of providing information to the Crime Commission he sought benefits from that assistance from the authorities including the transfer of one of his son's within the prison system and the restoration of visiting rights.""
50The only real assistance provided by the applicant to authorities was that he arranged for one of his sons to deliver 9 firearms and a quantity of ammunition and explosives to the police.  In relation to that, his Honour said:
""The letter of assistance notes that the nature and extent of assistance was limited. No information was given as to the source of the items.""
51Nevertheless, the surrender of the firearms and explosives was of some benefit to the community in that they were capable of causing substantial harm and had the potential to be used in unlawful activities.
52His Honour's conclusions in relation to s23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should be set out:
""I have taken into account the matters to be considered in s 23(2).   The significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance has not been assessed as high. 
The offender has placed himself at some personal risk however, unless the nature of his assistance is disseminated, he is not, on the material before me, likely to suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of his assistance.
Section 23(3) provides that any lesser penalty that is imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
It is relevant, as the Crown has submitted, that the offender has already received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
In SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19, Buddin J considered at length the authorities concerning the appropriate range of the composite discount for assistance and the plea of guilty and concluded that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case.
I am of the view that in the circumstances of the present case that a combined discount for assistance and the guilty plea should be in the order of 30%.""  (ROS 53.6)
53By way of additional information, it should be noted that OS1 successfully appealed to this Court against the sentence imposed on him (OS1 v R [2012] NSWCCA 102 (Allsop P; Davies and Schmidt JJ).  OS1 pleaded guilty to four offences as follows:
Count 1 - Aggravated (in company) break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely the larceny of a quantity of frozen food (maximum penalty - 20 years  with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.
Count 2 - Supply a prohibited drug, being more than the indictable quantity, namely 140.7g cocaine (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment). Count 3 - Supply large quantity prohibited drug, namely MDMA 600g (maximum penalty - imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment).
Count 4 - Supply large commercial quantity prohibited drug, namely 2.154 kg methylamphetamine (maximum penalty - imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment).
54The following offences were taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of Count 4:
(a)Knowingly dealing in the proceeds of crime (four offences);
(b)Supply prohibited drug being more than the indictable quantity, namely 6.68 kg cannabis;
(c)Participating in a criminal group;
(d)Knowingly take part in the supply of prohibited drug more than the indictable quantity, namely 56g cocaine;
(e)Possess prohibited drug, namely 2.6g cocaine
(f)Drive while under the influence of drugs (cocaine).
55OS1 was sentenced by Judge King SC on 29 October 2010 as follows:
Count 1 - Imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year six months commencing 30 November 2008 and expiring on 29 May 2010. Count 2 - Fixed   term   of  imprisonment  of  eighteen   months commencing on 30 May 2009.
Count 3 - Imprisonment for six years consisting of a non parole period of four years commencing 30 November 2009 and expiring on 29 November 2013.
Count 4 - Taking into account the matters on a Form One, imprisonment for eight years consisting of a non-parole period of five years commencing 30 November 2010 and expiring on 29 November 2015.
The effective sentence was a period of imprisonment for ten years with a non-parole period of seven years commencing 30 November 2008 and expiring 29 November 2015.
56That sentence had incorporated in it a combined discount of 50 percent for both the plea of guilty and assistance.  That discount was further broken down so that 25 percent was apportioned to the plea of guilty, 5 percent for past assistance and 20 percent for future assistance.  This Court had before it in the appeal a confidential document.  That document made it clear that OS1 had already provided considerable assistance in relation to the past and had undertaken to give evidence against a large number of persons in the future.  It was accepted by Judge King SC that OS1 had a justified fear for himself and his family.  The Court considered that the level of assistance provided by OS1 was exceptional and that a combined discount of 60 percent should have been applied, which would be apportioned as to 25 percent for the early plea, 15 percent for past assistance and 20 percent for future assistance.
57Following that adjustment, the sentences for Counts 3 and 4 were quashed and replaced with the following:
""(a) In respect of the offence charged in Count Three a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 30 November 2009 and expiring 29 November 2012 with an additional term of 1 year;
(b) In respect of the offence charged in Count Four and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing 30 November 2010 and expiring 29 May 2014 with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months.""
58Allowing for the effect of the 60 percent discount, the undiscounted total sentence for Count 4 was one of 15 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months.  By way of contrast, the undiscounted sentence for the applicant in respect of Count 2, was a head sentence of 12 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.  The total undiscounted sentence imposed on the applicant for both counts was 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years.
Ground 1 - In granting the applicant a combined discount of 30 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and the value of the assistance he provided, his Honour entertained a false presumption that the applicant had previously received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
59Despite the terms in which this ground has been expressed, the effect of oral submissions was that the extent of the discount for assistance was inadequate and that a discount which was substantially greater should have been allowed.
60In relation to the specific terms of Ground 1, his Honour noted at ROS 52.8 that:
"" ... at the time of providing information to the Crime Commission he sought benefits from that assistance from the authorities including the transfer of one of his sons within the prison system and the restoration of visiting rights.""
61In the course of applying s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and assessing the level of the applicant's assistance, his Honour said at ROS 53.9:
""It is relevant, as the Crown has submitted, that the offender has already received some benefit from his offer of assistance.""
62It is clear from the overall context of the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour took into account the receipt of ""some benefit from his offer of assistance""  to a very small extent, if at all.  In any event, it is clear from the material before his Honour that the applicant did receive some benefit from his assistance.
63The applicant gave evidence that he had not seen his son, Bassam Hamzy, since 2001 and that upon his release to parole in March 2005, he was extremely upset to learn that on public interest grounds he was not allowed to visit his son.  He took steps to change that situation and was advised by the Ombudsman that he could visit his son at the Lithgow Correctional Centre.  Subsequently, by offering himself as a conduit between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy his visitation rights with his son were significantly enhanced, even though Bassam Hamzy was at that time an inmate of the ""Super Max"" detention centre at Goulburn.  To that extent, as his Honour appreciated, the applicant had received a benefit from his offer of assistance.
64The oral submissions in the appeal were predicated upon the proposition that in allowing a composite discount for an early plea of guilty and for assistance, his Honour must have allowed 25 percent as the discount for the early plea of guilty.  That assumption is not made out.
65It is clear from his Honour's description of the circumstances surrounding the entry of the plea of guilty, that there was some element of negotiation involved (see [44] hereof).  It is also significant that his Honour's finding in relation to a discount for the plea of guilty, was somewhat qualified.  
""The pleas could be said to have been entered at an early opportunity."" (ROS 45.9)
His Honour did not find that the plea were entered at the earliest opportunity.  
66In such circumstances a sentencing judge has a broad discretion as to the amount of the discount to be awarded.  In Regina v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 Hodgson JA (with whom Dowd and Barr JJ agreed) said:
""4  However, the utilitarian discount is a recognition of advantages to the administration of justice that actually flow from a plea of guilty. By reason of statutory provisions applying in New South Wales, in this State it is not given merely on the basis that the offender's culpability is mitigated by demonstration of willingness to facilitate the course of justice: R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300, distinguishing Cameron v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382.
5  If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge, the advantages to the administration of justice are less, even though the plea may have been made at the earliest opportunity. There is in any event no entitlement to a 25% discount; and the fact that in this situation there are less advantages to the administration of justice can justify a smaller discount."" 
67In Regina v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 Howie J said:
""11  Frankly I do not understand how on the established principles it could be determined that the pleas of guilty for the offences for which the respondent was sentenced were early pleas and that they justified a discount of 25 per cent. There is no utility in a plea of guilty that has not been forthcoming. If the accused is not prepared to plead guilty until the Crown takes some course, then so be it. But if by withholding the plea the offender achieved the result he wanted, I do not understand why he should receive further favourable treatment on the basis that the plea of guilty had utilitarian value when it did not.  Rarely, if ever, will the reason why the accused has withheld the plea of guilty be a relevant matter in determining the utilitarian discount. Where it has been used as a bargaining tool in order to achieve a favourable outcome from the Crown in respect of some other charge, I do not understand that this circumstance can excuse the delay or provides a basis for asserting that the plea was made at the first reasonable opportunity.
...
13  In the present case there was no attention paid by the Judge to the real utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty or to the established authority of R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 and numerous other cases holding that there is no entitlement to any particular discount even if the plea of guilty is at the first reasonable opportunity. ...""
68In Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296 Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed) said:
""13  The applicant Sullivan relies upon two grounds of appeal. The first is that her Honour gave insufficient weight to the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. The Judge gave him a discount of 15 percent. She acknowledged that the pleas involved ""significant utilitarian value"" but noted that the ""late negotiation and entry of pleas meant that the Crown had to prepare for the trial or series of separate trials, therefore the utilitarian value of the pleas was diminished by their being made at that late stage"".
14  In effect the submission is that, having regard to the complexities of the matters and the delay by the Crown in determining the precise charges to bring against the applicants in the District Court, the discount should have been ""at least 20 per cent"". The short answer is that this Court would not generally find that there was an error in the exercise of discretion in choosing a discount of 15 per cent rather than one of 20 per cent, in particular where the Judge gives reasons for determining the discount chosen.""
69In R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) said:
""31  As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case. The amount of the discount cannot depend upon the practice of the particular court based upon its administrative arrangements. It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent. There was nothing in the present case that justified a discount above that range.
32  It should not be necessary to do so, but, because there appears to be discrepancies in the application of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, it is apposite to set out in point form the principles laid down by this Court and to be applied by sentencing courts. Of course these are principles of general application and are subject to the scheme set out in Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 and regulations made under that Act: 
1.  The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount: Thomson at [154]; Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [116].
...
8.  Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Giac [2008] NSWCCA 280. 
9.  The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain: Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Ahmad [2006] NSWCCA 177; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown: Sullivan and Skillin [2009] NSWCCA 296; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Saad [2007] NSWCCA 98, such as having matters put on a Form 1: Chiekh and Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448.
...""
70Being mindful of that qualification, it is necessary to turn to the extent of the assistance.  This was carefully analysed by his Honour (see [48] - [52] hereof).  The effect of his Honour's analysis was that the assistance was of a low level.  Insofar as the murder investigation and retrieval of some stolen items was concerned, the assistance was of no practical value.  The identification of the radical Islamic cleric was not rated highly.  The only assistance of any practical value was the delivery of the 9 firearms and a quantity of ammunition and explosives.  Even then no information was provided as to their source.  Nevertheless, their surrender of those items was a benefit to the community given their potential to cause harm and to be used in unlawful activity.
71On the basis of that level of assistance, and the early pleas of guilty, it was well open to his Honour to allow a total discount of 30 percent where the individual components were not identified.  This is particularly so when his Honour took into account the matters in s23(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and had specific regard to s23(3) which is to the effect that any lesser penalty that is imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
72It should be noted that s23(4) does not prescribe a method or manner in which the discounting is to be achieved.  In  R v Gallagher [1991] 23 NSWLR 220 Gleeson CJ (with whom Meagher JA and Hunt J agreed) said: ""It is essential to bear in mind that what is involved is not a rigid or mathematical exercise, to be governed by ""tariffs"" derived from other and different cases but, rather, one of a number of matters to be taken into account in a discretionary exercise that must display due sensitivity towards all the considerations of policy which govern sentencing as an aspect of the administration of justice.""
Those remarks of Gleeson CJ are, of course, qualified by s23(4).  Nevertheless, as Basten JA observed in R v Ehrlich v R [2012] NSWCCA 38 at [7] their ""tenor is not diminished"".
73As was further explained by Basten JA in Ehrlich at [11], such an approach is not erroneous because s23(4) ""says nothing as to the manner in which the discounting is to be achieved.  Indeed, on one view, the manner in which it is achieved is irrelevant:  the selected reduction can be expressed in a number of different ways, none of which is prohibited.""  The real issue with respect to the allowance of a discount on two bases is to avoid double counting of a particular element.
74In most cases it is also not helpful to speak of a level of discount as being generally available.  Such an approach makes assumptions about the matters to which the court must have regard in s23(2) and runs the risk of selective reliance on some authorities to the exclusion of others.  In R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342 Beazley JA said at [88]:
""88 ...  the focus should not be so much upon the precise numerical value of the discount but rather upon the question whether after all relevant matters have been taken into account, the sentence imposed is appropriate.""
75This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed on the co-offender referred to as OS1.
76The applicant submitted that he had a justifiable sense of grievance by reference to the limited difference between the undiscounted head sentence imposed on OS1 for Count 4 and on himself for Counts 1 and 2.  In making that submission, the applicant relied upon the finding by the sentencing judge that ""I am of the view also that the role of OS1 was ultimately greater than the role of the offender.""  (ROS 39.2)  The applicant also relied upon the difference in the quantity of prohibited drug which was supplied.  In his case (including the Form 1 offence) it was 1.549 kilograms and in the case of OS1, it was 2.156 kilograms.  In that regard, the applicant noted that the two amounts supplied by him, which were the subject of the charges to which he pleaded guilty, formed part of the large commercial quantity which OS1 supplied.
77The applicant submitted that by virtue of the different charges preferred against him (two charges of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) and OS1 (one charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) OS1 was arguably exposed to a more punitive sentencing regime.  In making that submission, the applicant accepted that the quantity of drugs supplied was not the predominant factor when seeking to ascertain the appropriate sentence.  He accepted that the role of the particular offender was of primary importance (Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584).  In that regard, he noted that his Honour found that the role of OS1 was greater than his.  He submitted that not only did OS1 supply a greater quantity of drugs over a longer period, but his role in the syndicate was greater.
78The applicant submitted that even if the Court were to conclude that no justifiable sense of grievance could arise as a result of the undiscounted head sentences, it should arise in relation to the non-parole periods imposed.  The applicant noted that as adjusted by this Court, as a result of his appeal, the non-parole period imposed on OS1 of 8 years and 9 months was significantly less than that imposed on him.
79The applicant submitted that his submissions as to the lack of parity between the sentence imposed on OS1 and that imposed on him, was buttressed by the reduction in the sentence imposed on OS1 by this Court.  As a result of that decision, not only was the head sentence significantly reduced but also the non-parole period.  The applicant emphasised the findings of this Court (at [59]) as to the importance of the role played by OS1 in the syndicate.
Consideration
80The issue of parity was carefully considered by the primary judge.  His reasons for concluding that ""in all of the circumstances here issues concerning parity of sentence with OS1 whilst relevant, have only limited application"" (ROS 51.1) were pertinent and fully supported that conclusion.
81When analysing the roles of OS1 and the applicant, his Honour ""ultimately"" concluded that the role of OS1 was greater than that of the applicant.  It is clear from his Honour's analysis that despite that conclusion the difference in their respective criminality was not great.  The distinguishing features seem to be that OS1 was sentenced for his involvement in additional supply offences and that his involvement in the supply transactions occurred over a longer period.  This should not obscure the findings as to serious criminality made against the applicant: he was involved in the facilitation of the negotiations and other arrangements for the supply of the prohibited drug.  His involvement in the syndicate went well beyond the period of actual supply, he was involved in the procurement of the drug for supply, he was involved in the delivery processes for the drug and its transportation to Melbourne, he played a significant role in the recouping of monies that were collected by others in Melbourne and he was able to bring some knowledge of the illicit drug trade into the negotiating process.  At times he organised others in effecting steps in the supply of the drug in Melbourne.
82His Honour's conclusion was:
""The involvement of the accused at the level of procurement, the nature of the discussions with his son at the time of procurement, the involvement of the offender in the collection of monies, his overseeing role at times and the provision of assistance to those effecting the transactions support the conclusion that, in those supplies that he was involved in, he was at the nucleus of the organisation of the supply.""  (ROS 36.9)
83The primary judge found that there were limitations when comparing the sentences imposed on OS1 and the applicant.  His Honour referred to prosecutorial decisions as to the groupings of particular amounts of drug.  In the case of OS1, the effect of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion was to group a number of supplies together so that they amounted to a charge of supplying ""a large commercial quantity"" of the drug.  In the case of the applicant, the effect of the prosecutorial decision was to treat the two supplies as separate offences so that neither ever amounted to a ""large commercial quantity"".
84His Honour took into account as significant that included in the charges brought against OS1 was a completely separate but objectively serious offence of aggravated break enter and steal.  The importance of that consideration was that it must have played a part in the application of the principle of totality when OS1 was sentenced.  When applying the principle of totality, not only would the sentence for the aggravated break and enter have been adjusted downwards, but also the sentence for the ""supply a large commercial quantity of drug"" in Count 4.
85When considering the effect of the re-sentencing of OS1 by this Court, one needs to take into account the Court's reasons.  Before any consideration of an increase in the discount arose, this Court decided that the start point for the sentences imposed was excessive in that insufficient weight had been given to the subjective circumstances of OS1 and because excessive weight had been given to the standard non-parole periods contrary to Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  The applicant did not have the benefit of such considerations, in particular, the applicant's subjective case was significantly weaker.
86The difference between the subjective cases of OS1 and the applicant is stark.  The applicant committed his offences while on parole for a serious offence of an almost identical kind, i.e. supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin).  Not only was the breach of parole a separate aggravating feature but the previous conviction for such a serious offence while still on parole gave rise to the considerations identified in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477 where the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey JJ) said:
""14 ... The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed...  The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.  It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.""
87This was an important difference between OS1 and the applicant and ""constituted part of the qualitative and discretionary judgment required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders"" referred to by the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen  [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [32].
88It follows that there is no proper basis for the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance by reference to the sentence imposed on OS1 when contrasted with the sentence imposed on him.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
89The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
