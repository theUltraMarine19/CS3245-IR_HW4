2760444,R v Leung [2012] NSWSC 1451,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: I propose to give my reasons for rejecting the Crown's application to adduce in evidence a conversation between the accused and Amanda Salmon at Redfern Police Station.

2The accused is charged with the manslaughter of Mario Guzzetti on 7 April 2007. They had been in a relationship for some years. He was arrested on the morning of the deceased's death and taken to the police station.

3The accused had been hysterical at the crime scene and continued to cry uncontrollably both in the police vehicle and at the police station. He was described by police as being ""hysterical"" when they rang the accused's former partner, Raymond Carter and asked him to attend.

4Police called Amanda Salmon, a clinical nurse specialist with the Mental Health Crisis team attached to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital requesting that she assess the accused as to whether he was exhibiting mental illness or a psychotic episode and to assess if he was at risk of harming himself in custody or was a suicide risk. 

5At about 1.30pm, Nurse Salmon examined the accused as to his mental state in the police station's examination room. In the course of the examination, the accused was unable to recount to Nurse Salmon exactly what had happened, but said that he and the deceased had been ""arguing alot, the last few weeks""; ""they argued last night"" and ""they argued this morning."" Nurse Salmon also recorded that the accused reported ""bad arguments"" last night and ""this am."" 

6The Crown case against the accused is founded upon circumstantial evidence, one of the circumstances being that the accused and the deceased had been arguing. The conversation between the accused and Nurse Salmon was said by the Crown to be highly probative as it showed not only that there had been arguments for some weeks, but also that the arguments the night before and on the morning of the deceased's murder were ""bad"". 

7This is the third trial that the accused faces for the death of the deceased. During the first trial before Rothman J, the Crown submitted that Nurse Salmon's evidence was admissible, but Rothman J declined to admit it. It appears that there had been some debate before his Honour as to whether the accused's statements about the arguments were ""protected confidences"" within s 126A Evidence Act 1995 and should be excluded under s 126B. In his ex tempore judgment, his Honour did not consider it necessary to finally determine this issue but said at [14]: 

""that the unfair prejudice to the accused of the admission of a statement, induced by a representation to him that anything he said would be confidential, far outweighs the probative value of the statement in itself."" 

8His Honour excluded the evidence under s 137 Evidence Act which provides: 
""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 

9The Crown did not appeal against the interlocutory ruling under s 5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 nor did the Crown seek to adduce the evidence in the second trial before Adams J. A question that arises is whether Rothman J's decision was a pre-trial order so that it is binding upon me, unless I am of the opinion that ""it would not be in the interests of justice for that order to be binding"": s 130A(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Crown argued that an evidentiary ruling does not fall within the scope of a ""pre-trial order"" and s 130A did not apply. 

10I do not think it is necessary for present purposes to consider whether Rothman J's decision to reject the evidence was a ""pre-trial order"" as I am also of the opinion that it should be excluded. My conclusion, however, is not founded on s 137 Evidence Act but on s 90 Evidence Act which is as follows: 

""90 Discretion to exclude admissions 
In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.""

11Before discussing this provision, the basal facts are as follows: The information that the accused gave to Nurse Salmon was provided during an assessment by her of his mental state. He was not cautioned, but was told that she would like to speak to him in order to help him with any issues that he might have with self-harm. The accused had been informed of Nurse Salmon's professional qualifications. She considered that the examination was confidential. It was her practice to advise the patient that the information provided was confidential and only information relevant to the risk of self-harm would be disclosed to police. Nurse Salmon was acting in a professional capacity as a Mental Health Nurse at the time the disclosures were made and the accused was her patient. 

12Mr Crown submitted that there was no unfairness to the accused as he had not made an admission to the offence but rather an ""unguarded incriminating statement.""

13I do not think that submission should be upheld as it places too narrow a construction of the word ""admission"" in the Evidence Act, which in the Dictionary to the Act is defined to mean: 

""...a previous representation that is: 

(a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and 

(b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding.""

14The disclosures made by the accused to Nurse Salmon are previous representations that are plainly adverse to his interest in the outcome of the trial. They bolster the Crown's circumstantial case and are admissions. 

15In Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67, Gummow and Hayne JJ described at [109] the discretion given by s 90 as a ""final"" or ""safety net provision"". Their Honours at [112] noted that ""s 90 of the Act expressly directs attention only to the fairness of using the evidence at the trial of the accused"" and that questions of reliability may have no part to play in the operation of s 90. Their Honours had earlier stated at [109]: 

""When it is ""unfair"" to use evidence of an out-of-court admission at the trial of an accused person cannot be described exhaustively. ""Unfairness"", whether for the purposes of the common law discretion or for the purposes of s 90, may arise in different ways."" 

16Gleeson CJ and Heydon J considered at [72] that ""the reliability of evidence was a factor affecting the fairness of its use."" 

17In R v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374, Howie J (with whom Ipp JA and Hulme J agreed) observed at [110] that, apart from the question of reliability, the ""probative value"" of the admission was not a matter of significance in the exercise of the discretion under s 90. 

18Howie J said at [104]: 

""Section 90 in effect confers on the trial judge a discretion to reject evidence of admissions where to admit them would result in an unfair trial for the accused. It is unfairness arising from the use of the admissions by the prosecution that is central to the discretion under the section and not whether the police unfairly treated the accused. The purpose of the discretion is the protection of the rights and privileges of the accused. It is concerned with the right of an accused to a fair trial and includes a consideration of whether any forensic advantage has been obtained unfairly by the Crown from the way the accused was treated...There may be an overlap between issues of voluntariness, reliability, fairness to the accused and the public policy discretion..."" (citations omitted),

19In JB v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 12, Whealy JA quoted with favour what was said by Howie J in Sophear Em. The Court in JB considered whether an admission made by the appellant, a juvenile, to a support person should have been rejected under s 90 by the trial judge. In dismissing this ground of appeal, Whealy JA (with whom Hislop J and Grove AJ agreed) said at [29]-[31]:

""29 With respect, I am unable to accept this argument. I shall briefly state my reasons. First, Mr Clayton's relationship with the appellant did not fall within any of the restricted categories of relationship (as outlined by Parliament) that protect unique relationships. There is, for example, no protection equivalent to s 118 Evidence Act for the relationship between a support person and a juvenile. There is no protection for the relationship between a support person and a juvenile as a ""special relationship"" such as may arise under s 126A, or in the case of religious confessions (s 127) and other privileged communications. 
30 Secondly, it may be seen that there is a fundamental difference between each of those ""protected"" relationships and the relationship, on the other hand, of a support person and young person. Certain specific relationships have been given special legislative protection because it is central to the function of those relationships that free and frank disclosure exist between the two persons involved. For example, a lawyer needs to obtain confidential information from his client to do his job adequately. It is part of the legal requirement of the solicitor/client relationship that confidences exchanged between them are to be strictly treated as confidential by the practitioner. No such legal or ethical relationship applies to a person playing a support role for a juvenile at a police station. The fundamental role of the support person is to assist the juvenile in his or her dealings with the police. It is to protect children from the disadvantaged position they are in as a consequence of their age. It is to protect them from police impropriety or from the disadvantages that arise simply because they are in a custodial situation and at the mercy of mature and experienced police officers ( R v Honan; DPP v Toomalatai; and R v Huynh and Phung ). 
31 In a given situation, the role undertaken by a support person may require that advice be given to a juvenile that he or she may or should remain silent during a police interview; it may require the tendering of advice or the giving of practical assistance during the actual interview itself. Such a role, though important, does not demand per se confidentiality in relation to admissions made freely by the juvenile to the support person outside the interview room, and in the absence of the police."" 

20Section 126A Evidence Act defines a protected confidence to mean:

""a communication made by a person in confidence to another person (in this Division called the confidant):

(a) in the course of a relationship in which the confidant was acting in a professional capacity; and 

(b) when the confidant was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the obligation arises under law or can be inferred from the nature of the relationship between the person and the confidant."" 

21In the present case, Nurse Salmon, the confidant, was acting in a professional capacity and was under an express obligation not to disclose the contents of the interview, save for her assessment of the accused's risk of self-harm. 

22Unlike that of a support person, the relationship between a clinical nurse specialist who is called to a police station to make a mental health assessment and an accused person is a protected relationship under s 126A Evidence Act. Ensuring that a person in custody is not a risk of self-harm is a matter of importance not only to the police force but to our society as a whole. It is fundamental to the reliability of the assessment that accused persons be able to speak freely to the health professional without fear that their conversation might be used in evidence against them. To be balanced against that consideration is the public interest in solving serious crimes such as manslaughter. However, it is unlikely that accused persons in custody would co-operate in a mental health assessment if they understood that the interview was not to be confidential. 

23Another matter favouring rejection of the admissions is the issue of their reliability. Nurse Salmon described the accused as being distressed, anxious and in shock during the interview. She said that he was not ""feigning"" or ""faking it"": T76 10-25 21/04/09. She had been called in by police, who had described the accused as being ""hysterical"". 

24It is not possible to reconcile the Crown's proposition that the accused would not suffer harm if the admissions went into evidence with the Crown's submission that the probative value of the evidence is high. At the very least, the accused would be placed in the position of having to give some explanation about what was said in the interview and would be unfairly forensically disadvantaged. 

25For these reasons, I conclude that having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence. In my view, the introduction into evidence of the admissions would result in an unfair trial. Accordingly, the evidence is rejected.

		07 December 2012",2012-11-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760465,ME v R [2012] NSWCCA 237,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.
2ROTHMAN J: I agree with Adamson J. Having examined the evidence, I, too, have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.
3ADAMSON J: The applicant (ME) was indicted with one count of robbery in company occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 as follows:
""On 12 May 2010, at Chester Hill, in the State of New South Wales, being in company with another person, robbed Terrence Gofton of a mobile telephone and a wallet containing personal documents, bank cards and a sum of money and at the time of the robbery inflicted grievous bodily harm on the said Terence Gofton.""
4He was convicted following a trial before the District Court (Ashford DCJ and a jury of 12).
5The only issue was whether ME was the person who attacked the victim.
6ME seeks leave to appeal against his conviction on a single basis: that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported. Leave is required because the ground involves a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(b).
7The ground of appeal requires this Court to assess the whole of the evidence, both as to sufficiency and quality, and determine whether it has a reasonable doubt.
8The High Court, by majority, emphasised the nature of the task to be performed in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14]:
""In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'. In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""
9In answering that question, this Court is to pay proper regard to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and to the benefits the jury has had in having heard and seen the witnesses. The High Court said, in M at [9]:
""If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.""
The evidence
The victim's evidence
10The victim gave evidence that on 21 May 2010 he had been drinking beer at Newtown, which amounted to three or four full-strength schooners over the course of three to four hours. He caught the train back to Chester Hill and arrived at about 6.30 pm. When he got off the train he decided to sit on a bench near the platform and roll a few cigarettes. Shortly after he sat down two men approached him: one in a red jumper and the other in a hooded white jumper. They asked him for cigarettes and also for some ""pot"". It was common ground that these two men were the applicant and his friend, ES.
11The victim then walked up the steps and left the station, as did the two other men. The victim turned left at street level. All of a sudden he was struck from behind. He turned around and was punched in the face. He recognised his assailants as the same two men who had earlier asked him for cigarettes and had left the station at the same time as he did. After two punches he fell to the ground and they kicked him a couple of times. He fell heavily and grazed his right arm. They took his mobile phone and his wallet which contained $30 or $40 in cash.
12The victim was assisted by a bystander who called an ambulance, which took him to Bankstown Hospital. He had a fractured eye socket that required surgery to put a metal plate in his face. He is still suffering from a loss of sensation around the whole left cheek area including his teeth.
13The victim was shown CCTV footage and identified himself sitting on the bench rolling his cigarette. He also identified the males who had asked him for cigarettes.
14In cross-examination it was put to the victim that he was drunk; he said that he was relatively sober. He agreed that he was interacting with the two other males for about three minutes. He confirmed that he had told the males to ""piss off"" at the top of the stairs.
15The victim agreed in cross-examination that he realised that his assailants were the two males who had asked him for cigarettes because he recalled the red jumper and the white hooded jumper. The victim distinctly remembered the drawstrings on the white hooded jumper.
16The victim agreed in cross-examination that he had gone to the police station on 25 May 2010 and had selected three males from a series of photographs as the most likely to have assaulted him. None of the males selected was the applicant. The victim said that he specifically remembered the applicant's long hair.
17The victim was extensively cross-examined about matters of detail, including about what he had told the bystander, police and the doctor about the exchange on the night of his admission to hospital.
The bystander's evidence
18Evidence was also given by a bystander who was walking to the taxi rank at Chester Hill station when she noticed the victim sitting in the gutter and another man next to him on the telephone. She assisted him to speak to Triple 0. The victim told her that there were two assailants and that one had been wearing a white jumper. She noticed that he was bleeding from his mouth and nose, had injured his left eye and had a graze on his forehead.
The paramedic's evidence
19The paramedic who came in the ambulance to treat the victim gave evidence of the location where she had found him. He had told her that he had been mugged and his wallet and mobile phone had been taken. She said that he was apparently able to recall all events and there was no loss of consciousness. The victim gave a history of having been out drinking. He was able to give his name, address and so on. In cross-examination, the paramedic described the victim as ""alert and oriented"".
Police evidence
20Senior Constable Shane Phillips attended the victim at Bankstown Hospital on 21 May 2010. His notebook included the following:
""About 5.30 pm on Friday 21 May 2010 on platform on Chester Hill Railway Station when befriended by two males about 25 years of age, Middle Eastern appearance, one had white hooded jumper, the other had a distinctive haircut, shaves at sides, back bit long. Caught train from St Peters Station about 5 pm. Had only just got off train when they started talking asking victim if he wanted some weed. About ten minutes later they started punching victim...""
21In cross-examination Constable Phillips agreed that at the time of making the statement the victim had made no mention of another male wearing a red jumper.
CCTV footage
22The Crown tendered CCTV footage which was taken at Chester Hill Railway Station from a number of points along the platform as well as from the stairs leading up to street level from the platform. The salient events shown in that footage are set out below.
23The footage showed the applicant alighting from a train at 5.48 pm and walking towards the exit of the platform followed by ES. The pair continued along the platform, and left via the stairs. At around the same time, a person wearing a light jacket with drawstrings climbed the same set of stairs while a person wearing a grey sweatshirt with drawstrings accompanied by a person with a white hooded jacket walked along the platform. At 6:27 pm, the footage showed the applicant and ES walking back down the stairs onto the platform.
24At about the same time, the victim alighted from a train, as did a man wearing a light hooded sweater. As the victim walked away from the carriage towards the platform exit, he appeared relaxed. The man in the light hooded sweater walked in the same direction. At 6:28 pm, the victim appeared to catch ES's attention before sitting on a nearby bench and rolling a cigarette. A few seconds later, the applicant sat down on a bench while ES paced nearby and at some point waved at someone in the carriage of the departing train. The two appeared to talk for a few seconds, before ES sat opposite the victim.
25The footage showed all three standing up to leave at 6.31 pm. ES was in front, followed by the victim and then the applicant. As the three men walked towards the stairs that led away from the platform, ES and the victim appeared to talk to one another. The footage showed all three men leaving the station at 6.32 pm. At around the same time, a person wearing a light jacket with a hood walked up the stairs from the platform.
Other evidence
26On 25 May 2010, four days after the assault, a search warrant was executed at the residence where the applicant lived with his parents. A white hooded jumper was located. The jumper and tracksuit pants that the applicant was wearing were sent for testing. There were no drawstrings on the jumper. No blood was found on the jumper or the tracksuit pants.
27On the same day a search warrant was executed at ES's residence. A red Adidas sweater was located and tested. No blood was found on the sweater.
The applicant's evidence
28The applicant gave evidence at the trial. He admitted that he and ES had spoken with the victim on the platform at Chester Hill Railway Station but denied the assault. His evidence was that he, ES and the victim had left the railway station at about the same time and that they went up the steps together. He said that the victim had been behaving in a strange fashion and that he and ES had left the railway station to get away from the victim.
29The verdict indicates that the jury did not believe the applicant in so far as he denied the assault.
The application for leave to appeal
30The applicant submitted that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence because it was a case based on identification. He relied on four aspects of the evidence which he contended meant that the jury ought not to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the person who had assaulted the victim. The four matters relied upon were:
(1)The white jumper that the applicant was wearing that day had no drawstrings;
(2)The white jumper did not test positive for blood when it was located and tested four days after the assault;
(3)The proceeds of the crime (mobile phone and cash) were not recovered and were not located in the applicant's residence at the time of the execution of the search warrant four days after the assault; and
(4)The victim did not select the applicant from the photographs shown to him four days after the assault.
31The applicant also submitted that the victim had so little opportunity to view his assailants because of the speed and dynamics of the assault, that any attempt by him to recognise them as being the men he had seen earlier could have been the effect of transposition, rather than true recollection.
32The applicant also relied on the presence of other men with light tops with drawstrings who could be seen on the CCTV footage. He contended that the Crown had not excluded the hypothesis that one of those men was the assailant.
33In summary, the applicant submitted that the verdict rested on evidence, both as to recognition and identification, which had been shown to be flawed and that, accordingly, the verdict was unsound.
34The Crown submitted that the Crown case, properly analysed, was only an identification case in a limited sense. The victim's evidence was that his assailants were aged between mid-teens and early twenties and of Lebanese or Middle Eastern appearance; one was wearing a white hooded jumper which had a drawstring around the hood and the other wore a red jumper and his hair was shaved around the sides of his head. The victim and these two males had conversed and walked up the stairs together prior to the assault. The exchange between them had lasted for a few minutes.
35The victim's evidence was that he was attacked about 15 paces from where he left the applicant and his associate at the top of the stairs. He said that the two young men who attacked him were the same two young men whom he had, seconds earlier, left at the top of the stairs.
36The Crown submitted that the other men wearing white hooded tops with drawstrings were not in company with another man of Middle Eastern appearance with shaved hair and wearing a red top.
37Since it was common ground that the applicant and his associate were the two men who had spoken with the victim on the platform and who had walked up the stairs with him when he was leaving the station, this aspect of the victim's evidence was the key to the Crown case. The victim did not ""identify"" the applicant in any other relevant sense; rather he recognised his two assailants as being the man in the white top and the man in the red top whom he had seen earlier.
38I consider that the contemporaneous recognition by the victim that the men who attacked him were the same men from whom he thought he had parted at the top of the stairs seconds earlier to be distinguishable from the so-called identification evidence which the applicant sought to impugn. 
39The evidence of contemporaneous recognition did not require the victim to describe the two assailants in any detail at all; all it required was that he register at the time that they were the same people as those with whom he had been speaking and walking seconds earlier. Although the victim's opportunity to see these two men after he had been struck from behind and before he fell to the ground was relatively short-lived, it was open, in my view, to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were the same men on the basis of the victim's evidence that they were.
40I do not consider any of the four matters raised by the applicant to impugn the victim's evidence of recognition.
41That the victim ""recalled"" drawstrings when there was none and that he selected photographs some four days later that were of men other than the applicant do not undermine the reliability of the recognition evidence. These matters are consistent with the victim's having suffered trauma, the passage of time, and the difficulties of identification evidence. All that this evidence tends to establish is that the victim does not have perfect recollection. As McClellan CJ at CL said, extra-curially:
""Research has shown that when a person witnesses a traumatic event, they focus on the central features of the event rather than peripheral details. For instance, when a weapon is used to commit a crime, eyewitness identification is less accurate because the witness tends to focus on the weapon."" [footnotes excluded]
Hon Justice Peter McClellan, ""Who is telling the truth? Psychology, common sense and the law"" (2006) 80 Australian Law Journal 655 at 663-664
42Furthermore that the accused's mobile phone was not located at the applicant's residence and that blood was not found on the jumper four days after the assault are, in my view, neutral rather than exculpatory. Importantly, these matters do not impugn the reliability of the victim's recognition evidence.
43I consider that the Crown case excluded the other persons depicted on the CCTV footage who were wearing light coloured hooded jumpers both because of the timing of their presence and also because, unlike the applicant, none was in the company of another man in a red jumper.
44I do not have any doubt that ME was guilty of the offences charged.
Orders 
45I would make the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted. 
(2)Appeal dismissed.

		15 November 2012",2012-11-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760468,R (Commonwealth) v Nelson-Olds [2012] NSWDC 253,"Judgment

1Tammy Dianne Nelson-Olds stands for sentence as a consequence of adhering to a plea of guilty to a charge that on 23 December 2010 at Sydney in this State she did import a substance being reckless that the substance was a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity being imported being a marketable quantity. That is an offence contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth of Australia. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for twentyfive years and/or a fine of 5,000 penalty units.

2The terms of s 307.2(1), (2) and(3) are these:
""(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person imports or exports a substance; and
(b) the substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and
(c) the quantity imported or exported is a marketable quantity.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both.

(2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(b) is recklessness.

(3) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(c).""

3By her plea of guilty the offender acknowledges that she was reckless, that being the averment in the indictment presented on 1 November 2012.

4The agreed facts tell me that Marlon Lancaster DiCaprio, an Australian citizen who was assisted by his wife, Isabelle Mary Borg and an American citizen, Micoy Neal Hamilton were organisers and recruiters of couriers for the importation of the illicit drugs. The method used by these drug ""lords"" involved the recruitment in the United States of America of its citizens as drug couriers, who would then convey approximately between one and three kilograms of cocaine inside false compartments of suitcases and transport it between Jamaica and Australia. 

5On 23 December 2010 in Miami in the State of Florida, American authorities arrested Sabrina Nelson, then aged twentythree, and Rodney Nelson, then aged twentyone. These are children of the current offender. Sabrina Nelson was found to have approximately 2.5 kilograms of cocaine concealed within her luggage. The inference I draw from the agreed facts is that the 2.5 kilograms was of cocaine in its impure state. Both Sabrina Nelson and Rodney Nelson had arrived in Miami from Jamaica and were due to fly from Miami to Sydney via Los Angeles. Sabrina Nelson cooperated with the American authorities. She admitted attempting to import cocaine into this country. She also advised the American authorities that her mother, the present offender, had departed for Australia on an earlier flight and was carrying a concealed amount of cocaine in an attempt to import that drug into this country. 

6At approximately 8.40am on Thursday 23 December 2010 the present offender arrived at Sydney International Airport on a United Airlines flight from Miami, travelling via San Francisco. The offender was travelling with two of her other children, a daughter, Salina, who was then sixteen, and her son James, who was then fifteen. The offender went through the immigration barrier and then attended the luggage carousel where she told her son, James, to pick out a tan coloured suitcase and place it on a trolley. He did so. At about 9.37am the offender went from the luggage carousel with her two children to the Customs barrier. She and her children were selected for examination by a Customs officer. The offender presented an incoming passenger card in which she declared that she was not bringing into Australia, inter alia, any illicit drugs. When she was questioned as to the contents of the tan coloured suitcase the offender informed the Customs officers that it contained the clothing that belonged to the two children who were travelling with her. When examined by Customs officers the tan coloured suitcase was found to contain concealed in its lining 1.492 kilograms of impure cocaine. 

7The extent of the purity of the cocaine was 55.6 percent. Federal police forensic officers calculated that the pure weight of the cocaine was 830 grams. Any more than two grams of cocaine renders it a marketable border controlled drug. More than two kilograms of the pure drug makes it a commercial quantity. The penalty for importing a commercial quantity of cocaine is imprisonment for life. It has been estimated that the street value of the cocaine was between $592,536 and $663,640. Street level cocaine is normally sold at a purity of between thirtyfive and fifty percent. The police estimate the wholesale value of the cocaine was about $243,658. 

8In her interview with the American authorities, Sabrina Nelson admitted intending to travel to Sydney, admitted that a man known to her as ""Troy"" recruited her to carry cocaine from America to Australia and that upon her arrival in Australia ""Troy"" would be waiting either at Sydney Airport or a hotel to collect Sabrina and the suitcase containing the cocaine. Sabrina Nelson admitted that she communicated with ""Troy"" by sending emails to him at a certain email address. She also admitted that she previously imported cocaine from Australia into this country in July 2010 for ""Troy"". ""Troy"" appears to be an alias for Marlon Lancaster DiCaprio. 

9The police lawfully obtained information from the email account maintained by DiCaprio using the alias of Troy Dyer. On 12 October 2010 at 1.30pm Sabrina Nelson expressed some concern to DiCaprio about making a further importation. However, she told DiCaprio that she could identify somebody else to assist DiCaprio, namely her mother, the current offender. The email continues thus:

""But I [don't] have the money for her pass and the vgas""

I assume the matter in the email referred to a passport and visas. 

10I will shortly allude to other facts but suffice it to say at this stage that the offender believed that ""Troy"" was her daughter's intended fiancé and that he was paying for the offender's trip with her other family members to Sydney in order that they could witness the betrothal of ""Troy"" and Sabrina Nelson. 

11On 14 December 2010 at 9.19pm the offender sent an email to DiCaprio. It was merely so that he would be aware of her email address. The offender ""signed"" the email ""Mama T"". There is nothing inherently suspicious about that email nor anything inherently inconsistent with the facts that the offender asks me to accept. DiCaprio sent an email in reply merely thanking the offender for passing on that piece of intelligence. At about 2.18am on 18 December 2010 the offender sent an email to DiCaprio, whom she still thought to be Troy Dyer. The substance of the email without abbreviations is this:

""Hey baby boy. Will arrive flight 16. Long black skirt, black blazer, green shirt, black boots.""

12The offender was so attired when she arrived at Sydney Airport on 23 December 2010. Again, there is nothing inherently suspicious about that email transmission nor anything inconsistent with the position that the offender asks me to accept she was in. One can see it as merely a description of how she appeared, such that ""Troy"" could identify her when she had passed through Immigration and Customs at Sydney Airport.

13The offender's position as to her criminality has been consistently reported. She was examined on 20 May 2011 by Dr Adam Martin, a forensic psychiatrist, at the Dillwynia Correctional Centre. Dr Martin took a history of the offender's crime. The offender was interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service on or shortly before 20 October 2011. The section of the report relating to the offender's conduct is this:

""The offender had denied all prior knowledge that the drugs were in her luggage when she travelled to Australia in December 2010. Ms Nelson-Olds reported that her daughter lent her the suitcase to pack for a holiday in Australia. The offender reported she believed that the entire family were travelling to Australia for a holiday paid by her daughter's boyfriend so they could meet and he could allegedly propose in their presence. Ms Nelson-Olds claimed that the first she learnt of the drugs in her luggage was when she was searched at Sydney Airport.

Despite this, Ms Nelson-Olds has accepted responsibility stating that even though the bag was given to her by her daughter she still should have checked it prior to packing her belongings in it and leaving the United States of America for Australia. The offender appeared to understand the seriousness of her current legal situation and the likely consequence of her actions.""

14The offender was interviewed on 1 March 2012 by a clinical psychologist, Ms Danielle Hopkins, again at Dillwynia Correctional Centre. The only reference to the offender's conduct in that report is a statement in [12] that the offender told the psychologist that she came to Australia with her daughter for a ""holiday"". 

15The offender prepared two documents, which became exhibit 15. Each is addressed to me. The first document is typewritten and bears the date 14 November 2012. The second is handwritten and bears the date 15 November 2012. The first paragraph of the typewritten document is this:

""I really needed to tell you how sorry I am about this whole matter, not because I am in prison, but because if those drugs were to hit the streets, kids and/or citizens would partake in it. I have five children of my own and I would be heartbroken if they were to use cocaine. I see now how reckless I was for not checking the suitcase better. It was loaned to me by my daughter Sabrina Nelson and her friend Rashawn. I knew they smoked marihuana and Sabrina would most likely bring a stash to smoke. At no time did I think it would be 800 grams of marihuana and definitely not cocaine. She doesn't use cocaine to my knowledge. I thought nothing of it because she is my daughter; I had no reason not to trust her. Your Honour I truly and sincerely apologise from the bottom of my heart.""

16In the following paragraph, which is lengthy, the offender tells me about the history of current proceedings and in essence repeats her averment as to how she became involved in this attempted importation of cocaine. In the manuscript document of 15 November the offender said, inter alia:

""Your Honour, I know now that I was stupid and very reckless. At that time 2009-2010 I had four major surgeries and almost died with a fourth one due to massive infections. I did not know Sabrina had imported drugs six months prior to my arrest, probably because at that time my brother died, my husband left me and my aunt died, all in a matter of weeks. I was so depressed for months. I love my daughter. She offered a family vacation and I accepted because I knew she was trying to help me through my pain. Her fiancé, from Australia, paid for everything. I was so out of it, that I didn't question her a lot. I knew she and her friends smoked marihuana, so I could have guessed she would have some put away. God, I was so stupid, and I am so sorry.""

17In essence, the offender says that she was an unwitting courier of drugs into this country, that her criminality was mere recklessness; she knew her daughter was a smoker of cannabis, she realised her daughter might try to import cannabis for her own use, she accepted the lending of a bag and did not check it out and that bag contained the cocaine which the offender attempted to bring into this country.

18The only ""benefit"" that the offender was to receive for committing this offence was a free holiday in this country, but she did not know that it was in payment of her being a courier. One can be very cynical of such ""facts"". Persons of prior good character are often recruited to act as drug couriers because they excite no one's suspicion.

19At the time of the offence the offender was forty-four years old. She is currently forty-five years old and will shortly attain her fortysixth anniversary. She is a mature woman and not someone who might be expected to be importing illicit drugs. She had with her her two teenage children, and the use by drug couriers of children as ""cover"" is well known. 

20However, the offender entered the witness box and swore on oath that the two communications she gave to me, that of 14 November and that of 15 November 2012, were true and swore on oath that the history she gave to the psychologist, Ms Hopkins, was also true. She was asked not one question in crossexamination. In those circumstances, I accept what she averred on her oath and I accept that she told me the truth in the two communications, which are exhibit 15. 

21In passing sentence I must consider the objective criminality of the offender. The only objective criminality is the recklessness of accepting the loan of a suitcase from her daughter, whom she knew to be a user of cannabis. That recklessness could equally be categorised as stupidity, because she trusted her daughter albeit that she knew her daughter to be a smoker of cannabis. The criminal law punishes people for their criminality not for stupidity.

22The parties have placed before me a large number of authorities relevant to the question of sentencing. Exhibit 1, the Crown bundle, contains a précis of thirty cases for the offence of importing a marketable quantity of cocaine. In addition, the Crown put before me four full judgments on the same topic and the defence put before me one full judgment on the same topic. Suffice to say that, as far as I can glean, all the cases indicate that the drug courier was aware, consciously aware, that he or she was importing an illicit drug and in most of the cases the drug courier admitted obtaining a benefit, either the promise of a reward in money, the forgiveness of a debt, or the obtaining of money for an ulterior purpose, even a charitable purpose.

23In many of the cases it is obvious that the importer of the drug must have been aware of what he or she was doing. Many drug couriers ingest drugs in balloons which are eventually passed through the gastro intestinal system. Swallowing a drug is something of which one must be unaware. Many secrete illicit drugs on their person, such as in their underwear or sewn into their bras, and in one case having the drug braided into the courier's hair. There are a number of cases in which drugs were secreted in articles being imported, such as bags, but in each of the cases drawn to my attention the offender was aware of what he or she was importing prior to getting on a plane to travel to this country.

24As I said, all of the authorities that I have looked at indicate the doing of this for an advantage such as a large monetary reward or to obtain the forgiveness of a debt or, for example, to obtain money in order to fund surgery for a child. Some of the cases suggest that the persons bring the drugs into this country with the intention of selling them, thereby intending to make a profit. Here there is no such element. Objectively speaking, this case must be at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. The only complicating factor is the quantity of the drug that the offender was seeking to import; 830 grams of cocaine with an estimated street value of around $600,000, and one could see that DiCaprio, if the drugs were given to him, might make a profit of almost $400,000. 

25However, there is no suggestion that the current offender would get any advantage other than a free trip to Australia, which she thought was arranged by her daughter to give her a break from her life, which had become complicated, and in order that she could witness her daughter's betrothal to ""Troy"". Had the current offender knowingly imported the 830 grams of cocaine with the intention or knowledge that she would see a monetary advantage, I would have had to consider imposing upon a head sentence of some seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. That is consistent with the authorities and judicial statistics. However, this case is otherwise.

26I turn now to the offender's personal circumstances. The offender was born on 14 December 1966. She is currently forty-five years old and will soon achieve her forty-sixth anniversary. She was born in Washington in the District of Colombia and appears to have been living for a large amount of time in Utica in the State of New York. She is the mother of five children. The Crown bundle tells me that the children are aged twentyfive, twenty-three, twentyone, sixteen and fifteen. Those, clearly, were their ages at the time of the importation of the cocaine on 23 December 2010. Each would now be approximately two years older.

27The offender is, essentially, a lady of prior good character. The Crown puts before me no criminal record either from the District of Colombia or the State of New York or from any other American jurisdiction. The only thing that can be said about the offender's apparent forensic history is what is contained in the report of Dr Martin of 25 May 2011. It is this:

""This is apparently her first time in custody and she denied serious criminal issues in the States. She said there had been one 'trespass violation', but denied misdemeanours or felonies.""

28At common law all crimes are divided into one of three classes: treasons, felonies and misdemeanours. I do not know what a ""trespass violation"" is, but it might be some form of statutory offence. Of course, the tri-partite division of offences at common law has been abolished in this State to be replaced by a distinction between summary offences, indictable offences and serious indictable offences, with the complication that some indictable offences can be tried summarily. Whether this was any positive law reform is a moot question. 

29However, all I can infer is that the offender admits to one minor offence in her native country and which did not earn her any time in custody. An offence of ""trespass"" is very different to the current form of offence. I therefore accept that the offender comes before this Court as a lady of prior good character, although as the authorities make clear such is of less moment in cases of this nature because, as I have already said, drug couriers need to be ""clean skins"" otherwise they draw unnecessary attention to themselves.

30The offender's life has been hard, but the evidence establishes that she has been a good mother and provider to her five children. I do not need to go into any great detail about the offender's background other than to quote a summary made by Ms Hopkins in her report of 8 March 2012. It is this:

""Ms NelsonOlds is a forty-five year old woman has pleaded guilty to the current charges and is awaiting sentencing. She reported a difficult childhood, marked by instability and separation from her mother and multiple child protection risks. She noted that she had little contact with her biological father and that she had a poor relationship with her stepfather given that she was the product of an extra marital affair. It seems her mother's family rejected her due to racial bias and the high prevalence of major mental illness and anti social behaviour in her family further compromised her development. By the age thirteen, Ms NelsonOlds was living a pseudoadult lifestyle and was not provided with boundaries or guidance from her mother. During this period her psychosocial functioning reduced and she endorsed alcohol use and detrimental activities such as attending clubs under age. Her relationship with her mother was turbulent and she reported that her mother had an affair with her boyfriend when she was fourteen years of age. Despite relocation to her sister's residence, she returned home to her mother shortly after departing. To her credit, she was able to progress through school and complete her year twelve, despite her difficult family environment and this suggests that she has some resilient traits.

Ms NelsonOlds has been involved in three relationships and has five children and seems to have been dependant on them throughout her life for support. As such, she described her family as her only source of social support. She noted that she has experienced chronic mental health problems and was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was thirty-seven years of age. Her chronic pain continues to impact on her experience of low mood and depression. Ms Nelson-Olds stated that she had used alcohol and substances as a means of coping with her pain and mental health issues prior to, and after her diagnosis and has longterm substance use problems. Her description of more recent stressful life events and her battles with crack cocaine addiction have marked her poor adjustment in the past few years. Indeed, she reported to me that her mother died in 2008, followed by her brother and auntie in 2010. She noted a brief period of residential rehabilitation (possibly only for detox) followed by a relapse into alcohol and crack cocaine use. Given these issues and her poor functioning around the time of the offences she was unemployed when she decided to travel with her daughter to Australia. She is not only at risk of decompensating in her mental state, which is precarious, but also suffers severe pain for which it appears she has been unable to obtain appropriate recognition...whilst in gaol.""

31There is before me medical evidence from both the United States and Corrective Services New South Wales about the offender's general health. According to Justice Health the offender currently is on seventeen prescribed medications. Since being arrested on 23 December 2010 she has had two one-week admissions to hospital. The records of Justice Health also tell me that the offender has mental health issues, ""multiple medical issues"", chronic pain from arthritis, asthma, and is on the methadone program. 

32Records from a practice in New York indicate that the offender has problems with anaemia, anxiety, asthma, back pain, depression, high blood pressure, gastric reflux, spinal canal stenosis, osteoarthritis, a problem in her right hip, chronic constipation as well as bipolar disorder. The evidence tells me that in the past the offender has fractured her right hip, leading it to being pinned and plated. She has undergone a hysterectomy, gastric banding surgery, and she requires the removal of her gall bladder, a cholecystectomy. She also has problems in both her cervical and lumbar spines and there is reference to discal lesions in both the cervical and the lumbar spines. The offender's health problems have, it would appear, been chronic since about 2008, leading to the offender's unemployment. 

33I accept that there were multiple psychosocial stressors affecting the offender during 2010 and stressors affecting her physical health. I accept that she was ""down"", to put it bluntly, and that led to her accepting her daughter's suggestion of going to Australia for a holiday, thereby rendering her an unwitting drug mule. 

34In the circumstances, the offender's criminality is even further attenuated because being ""down"", being the subject of the bereavements to which I have referred, and the mental and physical health problems to which I have referred, made her less suspicious of her daughter, made her accept what her daughter was doing, inhibited her about checking the bag, and therefore contributed to the offender's recklessness.

35I also accept that the offender's physical and mental health have made her experience of custody much more onerous than it normally would be. In her letter to me of 14 November 2012 the offender remarked that the Corrective Services officers were complaining to her that her medications were costing Corrective Services ""a ton of money."" I can accept that.

36The final paragraph of her letter of 14 November 2012 is this:

""Your Honour, I am scared most of the time, I've been beaten up three times in the last two years. Sometimes I feel as if I'm going to die here and never have a chance to see my kids again. I've been without them for two years. I humbly beg you to show me compassion and allow me to go home soon. I will never leave my country again and I'll never be stupid enough to borrow anyone's suitcase.""

37In her handwritten communication of yesterday the offender pleads to me that it was ""killing"" her not to be able to see her five children. From what I have quoted from Ms Collins's report, it is clear that the offender's purpose in life is centred around her nuclear family, her five children, which give her her only social support.

38Since being in custody the offender has been incarcerated at Dillwynia, at Wellington and at Silverwater. Although Dillwynia is the most attractive of those three centres, the offender finds it more congenial at Silverwater because she can obtain both psychiatric and medical treatment at that institution rather than at the other institutions. I would have thought that being sent to Wellington would be a form of exile for a person of the offender's background, a now fortyfive year old AfricanAmerican woman. Clearly the onerous nature of her incarceration is a circumstance to allow a longer than usual period on parole, to reduce the nonparole period. The High Court of Australia has made it clear that the likelihood of deportation if a convicted person is subsequently released on parole should not of itself compel a sentencing judge to conclude that it is inappropriate that the person should be eligible to be considered for release on parole at some future time: R v Shrestha (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71.

39It has been submitted that the offender's family is suffering from hardship because of her incarceration. The two children with whom she travelled to Australia would now be seventeen and eighteen years old, doing their final school classes and perhaps trying to obtain sufficient academic status to go to, as we would call it, university or, as the Americans would call it, college. However, it is well established that the probable effect of any sentence on an offender's family or dependents can only be taken into consideration ""in an exceptional case."" I cannot take that into account, but I do take into account the fact that the hardship is really on the offender by being separated from her only sources of social support, her children.

40In sentencing for a federal offence I am required to take into account all the matters referred to in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth of Australia. Paragraph (a) requires me to take into account the nature and circumstances of the offence. I have sought to do so.

41Paragraphs (b) and (c) of the subsection are not presently relevant. I am required to take into account the personal circumstances of any victim but here there was no victim as such, although if the drugs had found their way into the illicit drug market there could have been dire consequences for many citizens, as the offender herself acknowledged in her typewritten letter to me of 14 November 2012.

42Under paragraph (e) I am required to take into account any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence. Fortunately there has been none. I am required under paragraph (f) to take into account the degree to which the offender has shown contrition for the offence by taking action or making reparation for any injury or in any other matter. Clearly there could be no reparation for this attempted importation. I accept that the offender does realise that what she did was wrong; that she was foolish in not checking what her daughter had given to her when she rightly suspected that her daughter may have been using the bag to cache illicit drugs. The contrition is shown in the communications to me which I have already quoted. There is nothing to require me to consider the provisions at paragraph (fa) of the subsection. 

43I am required to take into account if the person had pleaded guilty to the charge. I shall now do so. The history of the current proceedings is complicated. In her typewritten letter to me of 14 November 2012 the offender tells me this:

""After my arrest, I was very confused. I was advised to plead guilty in [the] Local Court, by my second solicitor Ms Thelma Gray, in order to receive 25% discount off my time. So I did so with the understanding I would get no more than two years for my charge. I was given a sentencing date for [the] District Court. My first appearance, my barrister did not show [up]. It was adjourned. Then two days prior to the second sentencing date, my second barrister...met me. I was advised that I needed to plead in the District Court before I could be sentenced. He also advised me that I was given misinformation regarding the amount of time I would receive. I was now being told that I was looking at double the time Ms Gray had given me. So we adjourned so that [the second barrister] could familiarise himself with my case and he advised that I may want to go to trial. I was so confused. I told [my second barrister] to proceed for trial, but in the meantime, [my second barrister] and my third barrister, Mr Peter Little, came to meet with me. Twentytwo months into being on remand, they explained much more clearly to me that because I thought my daughter, Sabrina Nelson, would most likely bring recreational drug of marihuana with her, and that she and Rashawn was loaning my teenagers a suitcase for their clothing, that I was reckless in not checking the suitcase out much more thoroughly. So now I understand my charge, therefore I did not want to waste the Court's time with the trial. So when my date came to put my first plea into District Court, I pleaded guilty. I am so sorry, because my mental illness it takes me a lot longer to absorb information.""

44It would appear that the offender was given conflicting legal advice and that led to her giving instructions to change her plea from guilty to not guilty, but when formally arraigned she did plead guilty and maintains her guilt. Clearly I cannot accept that this is a plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity because of the subsequent change of plea.

45However, the plea shows great cooperation with the federal law enforcement authorities because it may have been very difficult for the Crown to prove the case against the present offender, especially if she raised a defence under s 307.2(4). The onus of proving that defence would have been upon her. I have presided over enough jury trials over the last nine years to know that the offender may well have been found not guilty by a sympathetic jury. Therefore the offender's plea of guilty should be given great weight because it does show assistance with the law enforcement authorities. However, I cannot give 'the full discount' for the plea of guilty, but I will allow a twenty percent discount because of the significance of the plea, not so much its timing. What I have just said also covers the grounds set out in s 16A(2)(h). 

46Under paragraph (j) I am required to consider the deterrent effect of any sentence or order that may be passed might have on the offender. I am confident that, chastened by her present experience, the offender will not ever leave her native land again, as she has set out in her typewritten letter of 14 November 2012. I am confident that her prospects of rehabilitation are excellent and that there will be no recidivism.

47Under paragraph (k) I am required to take into account the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence. I have attempted to do so. Paragraph (m) requires me to take into account the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender. I have sought to do so. Paragraph (n) requires me to take into account the prospects of rehabilitation. I have already mentioned that. As I said, I accept that the offender will not reoffend. I have already adverted to the contents of paragraph (p) of the subsection.

48To be extremely blunt about it, this case is far less serious than all the other cases to which I have been referred. Here I have a case of criminality that could be categorised as being next to stupidity. Of course, the offence is a major offence punishable by imprisonment for up to twentyfive years. As I said, if the offender had knowingly imported the cocaine with the prospect of obtaining for herself some form of financial or pecuniary reward, I would have had to consider a head sentence of some seven years and a nonparole period of four years.

49This case is far from that. I have come to the view that, in this sentencing exercise, the theoretical starting point should be a head sentence of five years. I discount that by twenty percent to reduce the head sentence to four years. I believe the appropriate non-parole period is a period of two years. The end result is that the offender will be released from custody on 22 December next. 

50It is highly likely that she will be deported from the Commonwealth of Australia on her release from custody. I heartily suspect that the offender wants that to occur. This might offer the offender the chance to spend Christmas with her children. However, I would not hold my breath about that because that would require the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to be prompt in arranging transport from Sydney to New York on 22 December, which might be problematic owing to the Christmas season. The offender, however, could probably expect to be home at least for New Year's Eve.

51I have enquired of the solicitors for the parties if any further reasons for sentence are required and am told that none are so required. 

52Tammy Dianne Nelson-Olds, on the charge that on 23 December 2010 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales you did import a substance being reckless that the substance was a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity imported was a marketable quantity, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of four years. The sentence commences on 23 December 2010. I set a nonparole period of two years, which expires on 22 December 2012. I have found special circumstances. You are to be released to parole at the expiration of the nonparole period.

		18 February 2013",2012-11-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760470,R v Burgess [2012] NSWDC 260,"SENTENCE
1Drugs are terrible things.  Those addicted to them often act in a way which is atrocious and which causes significant harm to the community.
2The offence before the Court today is a good illustration of that.  Drug addicts lie, cheat, steal and rob with depressing regularity with little thought at all to the consequences of the victims.  They do this precisely because they are addicted to drugs.  
3Of course that does not mean that in every case the moral culpability of an offender who commits an offence whilst addicted to drugs is reduced.  The decision as to whether an adult person uses drugs is a matter of personal choice.  Everyone knows that those who commence to use drugs risk becoming addicted to them.  Some people have a reduced moral culpability because they have a reduced ability to reason appropriately about whether they will take drugs or not.  But when Ms Burgess, as she put it ""lost the plot"" after having lost her job and began using alcohol and drugs to excess and then simply to get money for more drugs and more alcohol committed the terrible offence I am about to describe, she made her own decision and she must be punished for what she did.
4The victim in this matter was a kind and friendly 77 year old man, Les Challoner.  He and the offender became friends.  Mr Challoner's wife passed away in September 2011 but the relationship between the offender and Mr Challoner continued.  Mr Challoner is of course elderly and, like many people in the community of that age, is hearing impaired and wears hearing aids.  Ms Burgess towards the end of 2011 needed more money for drugs than she had.  Rather than recognise that and recognise that she could not continue to use drugs if she could not pay for them, she decided that Mr Challoner was a source of money.  She lied to him.  She said she had outstanding debts.  Mr Challoner generously lent her $1,000.  On other occasions after that, further requests for loans were made by Ms Burgess and Mr Challoner agreed.  He handed over his money to Ms Burgess.
5Ms Burgess recognises today the kindness that Mr Challoner demonstrated to her.  She repaid that kindness by spending almost all the money that he had lent to her on drugs and then, on the one occasion that he refused, she bashed him and stole his wallet containing the princely sum of $70.  
6That occurred on 9 March 2011.  Ms Burgess went to Mr Challoner's home.  She was invited in and they began chatting and drinking.  I am not sure if Ms Burgess' intention was always to ask for money but at some part of the afternoon she did ask Mr Challoner if she could borrow more money.  It appears that Mr Challoner said that he would not and he asked Ms Burgess to leave.  Ms Burgess did not leave, she got angry; angry at this man who had lent her money in the past and who was a vulnerable 77 year old.  When Mr Challoner started to walk towards his front door with his back to her, Ms Burgess punched him three times at least, which caused him to fall to the ground.  Ms Burgess was not finished with him either.  She continued to kick Mr Challoner twice, not surprisingly that caused him pain.  Mr Challoner managed to get up but once more Ms Burgess was not finished with him.  She pushed him to the chest forcing him into a wall.  He bounced off that wall and fell to the ground again.  He was lying on the ground, face down when Ms Burgess reached into his back pocket and took his wallet.  She took the money out, $70, and threw the wallet to the floor and left.
7Mr Challoner managed to get up.  He walked to his neighbour's premises.  He was in pain and very distressed at what had happened to him.  Police and ambulance were called.  He was taken to hospital.  He had a laceration to his right hand which was bleeding and significant bruising to both arms with pain to his lower rib and hip area.  
8Police caught up with Ms Burgess soon afterwards.  They arrested her. To add insult to the injuries that she had occasioned to Mr Challoner, Ms Burgess described him to police as a ""dirty old man"".  She told police, completely falsely, that he had made sexual advances towards her in trying to grab her.  She said that that was what caused any problems between her and Mr Challoner.  She denied taking money from Mr Challoner's wallet.  
9All right thinking people would think that the events that I have just described would have to be one of the lowest criminal acts that it is possible to contemplate.  That is the sort of problem that comes about when drug users get addicted to drugs.  As I mentioned earlier, drug users, drug addicts, act with little thought to the consequences for anyone else apart from themselves.  This is not really meant to be a criticism of Ms Burgess' underlying character but it is meant to demonstrate just how serious the use of drugs is in our community.  
10It is a rare sentence matter in this court where there is not some element of addiction to drugs involved, but the events I have just described would have to be one of the worst offences that have come before this court, at least of recent times.  
11Ms Burgess, to make matters worse, was on two bonds to be of good behaviour at the time of this offending and a perusal of her criminal history indicates she has had trouble with the law before, including offences of violence.  To her credit, she appears to be completely remorseful for the way she acted towards Mr Challoner and, because of her completely false allegation that he had tried to sexually assault her.  Ms Burgess recognises that she hit rock bottom when she did what she did to Mr Challoner.  I accept that she is significantly remorseful for what she did to that kind and elderly gentleman. 
12Ms Burgess is now 41 years of age.  She grew up in Bankstown, was exposed to domestic violence where her father was frequently intoxicated and would assault her mother.  As a child she apparently had problems controlling her emotions and anger.  She went to school but left when she was about 14, left home when she was 16 and had her first child at 17.  She has a work history and, indeed, of recent times it is a good work history.  She lost her job as a process worker at Steggles apparently because she was chewing gum in breach of a regulation that everyone knew about and it was that, that she describes as being the catalyst for her downfall.
13It is to be noted too that, in speaking of Ms Burgess' work history, she got those jobs off her own steam, although she was being supervised by the Probation and Parole Service on some occasions but at the time she got those jobs she managed to get those jobs all by herself and she felt proud of herself when she was working.  There is thus considerable hope for the offender's future, the one qualification to that of course being her problems with drugs.
14She has a significant history of substance abuse.  Like most, she began with cannabis at the age of 14 or 15 and then she drank from about 16 or 17, drinking quite large quantities.  She was abstinent after she went to a rehabilitation facility in 2006 and 2007.  She also began using amphetamines from the age of 28 and has used that drug regularly since then, at least until her arrest.  She has been in custody from 9 March 2012 and that has been her longest period off amphetamines since she commenced using them.  She has tried drug rehabilitation in the past but, as the events I have described have just demonstrated, those efforts have not been successful. 
15The report of Dr First tendered on her behalf indicates a history of some mental illness but, having read the report carefully, I can see no connection between her offending and her mental illness.  Her moral culpability is not reduced in any way because of her mental illness, nor is there any need to place less emphasis on general deterrence than would otherwise be the case.  Her mental illness does not appear to involve her time in custody being harder than would otherwise be the case either.  She is doing well in custody as I have mentioned before, not using drugs and has a position of some responsibility.
16Although it may well be the case that Ms Burgess' visit to Mr Challoner that afternoon was so that she could get money for drugs from him, it does not appear that she planned this offence.  It appears to have been a spur of the moment decision that came about when Mr Challoner, quite justifiably of course, refused to lend her any more money.  
17It could not be said that Ms Burgess was immediately remorseful for what she did.  She may not have known the extent of the injuries that were occasioned to Mr Challoner until she saw photographs of him some time later, but from the moment she left his home she knew what she had done to him.  In those circumstances, her decision to falsely accuse him of having tried to sexually assault her is a very good indication of the lack of remorse that Ms Burgess felt at the time.  Her remorse may have thus been belated but I am satisfied it is now genuine.
18This is Ms Burgess' first time in custody.  Her prospects of rehabilitation are largely tied to the prospects of her putting her drug addiction behind her.  She will need an extended period of supervision on parole to assist her to give up the drugs.  Much depends on what happens when she is released from custody as regards her drug use.
19She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon her will be 25 percent less than would otherwise be the case.  I will make a finding of special circumstances for the reasons I have just identified.
20It remains the case, however, that this was a terrible crime.  Ms Burgess recognises this.  She recognises that no sentence other than one of full time custody is appropriate.  The sentence I impose is as follows.  
21I impose a sentence of imprisonment.  I set a non parole period of two years to date from 9 March 2012.  It will expire on 8 March 2014.  The head sentence will be one of four years, this Ms Burgess is eligible to be released to parole on 8 March 2014.
22I dismiss the appeal the matter on the section 166 certificate

2760473,Robert Anthony Mark Aslett v R [2012] NSWCCA 235,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.
2BELLEW J: On 7 February 2011 in the District Court of New South Wales at Penrith the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging the following offences:
(1)on 23 July 2010 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, he did break and enter the dwelling house of Annette Martin at 33 Illawong Avenue and did commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely intentionally damaging property in circumstances of aggravation, namely he knew persons were in the dwelling, and in circumstances of special aggravation, namely that he was armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a taser (""count 1"");
(2)on 23 July 2010 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, he did assault Annette Martin (""count 2"").
3Count 1 was an offence pursuant to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act, for which there was a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.  Count 2 was an offence pursuant to s 61 of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment.
4On 7 February 2011 the following sentences were imposed:
(i)in respect of Count 1, a non-parole period of 3 years, 4 months and 14 days commencing 23 July 2010 and expiring on 6 December 2013, and a total term of 5 years 7 months and 14 days imprisonment, expiring on 7 March 2016.
(ii)in respect of Count 2, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 23 July 2010 and expiring 22 July 2011.
THE FACTS5A statement of agreed facts was before her Honour, and established the following.
6At about 6pm on 23 July 2010, Annette Martin was at her home in Penrith.  Also present were Kayla Martin (Ms Martin's daughter) and her friend Toni Sloan, each of whom was 16 years of age.  Also at the premises was Ricky McNamara, the boyfriend of Ms Martin's eldest daughter.  
7Ms Martin, Kayla and Ms Sloan were all in the lounge room of the premises when the applicant firstly opened the fly screen door, and then the front door, neither of which were locked.  Upon entering the premises the applicant discharged a taser before withdrawing a knife from the front of his pants.  He then proceeded into the lounge room of the premises and said (apparently in reference to Mr McNamara):
""I want Ricky now"".
8Ms Martin asked the applicant to leave.  He responded by holding the taser towards Ms Martin's throat and discharging it.  Ms Martin managed to push away the hand in which the applicant was holding the taser, but he moved it back towards her before lowering it and raising his right hand which was holding the knife.  He then held the knife towards Ms Martin's throat, that being the conduct constituted count 2.  As he did so the applicant continued to ask for ""Ricky"".  At one point he walked towards Ms Sloan (whom he knew from a previous association with Ms Sloan's brother) and said:
""You know who I am Toni, tell them to back off my cousin"".
9Ms Sloan replied with words to the effect:
""Robbie what are you doing?""
10The applicant then punched the wall in the lounge room of the premises with sufficient force to break a hole the size of his fist in the gyprock.  He then walked through the lounge room, kicking the television before punching a second hole in the gyprock wall near the front door.  
11Shortly after that, the applicant left the premises.  As he did so, a white Holden Commodore and a gold Mitsubishi were waiting outside.  The applicant entered the front passenger seat of the Holden Commodore which then drove away.  
12Police were called to Ms Martin's premises.  Whilst they were there, the Mitsubishi vehicle drove past and Ms Martin identified it to police as a vehicle which had been outside the premises at the time of the applicant's departure.  Police recorded the registration number and traced it to a nearby address which they attended a short time later.  Upon their arrival, the applicant approached police and was placed under arrest.  He later told police that he was aware that he would be charged, and that this was why he had approached them upon their arrival at the premises.  Whilst the applicant declined to be interviewed, he admitted to being in possession of a taser at Ms Martin's premises.  Police observed that the applicant's left hand exhibited an injury to the skin accompanied by dried blood on his knuckles, accompanied by swollen joints.  Small spots of blood were located on the gyprock near the front door of Ms Martin's premises.   
13The taser and the knife which had been identified as being in the possession of the applicant at the time of his commission of the offences were not recovered.
The sentencing proceedings14At the outset of the sentence proceedings, the applicant's representative indicated that although she had requested the provision of a pre-sentence report on a previous occasion, no such report had been prepared.  She informed the court that having spoken to the applicant, he had confirmed that he had not been interviewed for the purposes of the preparation of such report, following which she said:
""I'm instructed to proceed to sentence in any event your Honour"".
15The matter was then stood down in the list for a short period, following which the applicant's solicitor said:
""Mr Aslett will not be called in relation to the proceedings. As your Honour heard earlier, a pre-sentence report was ordered but it has not been produced and Mr Aslett informs me he hasn't been met (sic) with a Probation and Parole Officer. My instructions are to proceed to sentence today. Mr Aslett is seeking to have himself classified so he can enter into the system and attend programs and things of that nature"". 

16As a consequence of the position taken by the applicant, no subjective material was tendered to the sentencing judge.  
17Having heard submissions from the parties, the sentencing judge delivered sentence on the afternoon of the same day.  Having recounted the facts, her Honour described the offence of count 1 as ""one of the most serious in the criminal calendar"" a fact which, she said, could be inferred from the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  Her Honour also made reference, at that point, to the fact that the offence attracted a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment ""for offences said to fall within the mid-range of objective seriousness following upon a guilty verdict after trial"".
18Her Honour then considered the circumstances of the applicant's offending.  In doing so, she made reference to the fact that:
(i)there was no forced entry, and thus no damage occasioned to the fly screen or the front door;
(ii)no person was injured; 
(iii)there were three females present in the premises, two of whom were only 16 years of age;
(iv)the applicant had gone to the premises in circumstances where he was easily identifiable; 
(v)the two motor vehicles were distinctive, and the owner of one of them was known to the victims;
(vi)the applicant's blood was present on a wall where he punched the hole through the gyprock;
(vii)the taser, unlike a firearm, was not a weapon which was capable of inflicting really serious bodily injury;
(viii)the knife, although capable of inflicting really serious bodily injury, related only to the charge of common assault; and
(ix)the incident took place in the early evening, as opposed to the early hours of the morning when it might have been expected the occupants would have been asleep.
19Her Honour then considered the applicant's criminal history which contained previous entries for offences of violence.  She concluded that although those previous offences were not aggravating factors, they disentitled the applicant to leniency.  
20Her Honour then made reference to the applicant's plea of guilty and allowed a reduction of 25 percent on that basis.  
21Her Honour concluded that in circumstances where the applicant had not given evidence, and in the absence of any pre-sentence report, she was unable to reach any conclusions about his remorse or contrition, beyond the fact that his immediate admissions to police and his pleas of guilty demonstrated ""some contrition"".  She reached the conclusion that applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were guarded in light of his antecedents and that this rendered it necessary for specific deterrence to be given greater consideration than might otherwise have been the case.  Her Honour also observed the necessity to pay heed to general deterrence.
22Her Honour then, ""with some reservation"" found special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Although not precisely articulated, it would appear that this finding was based upon the possibility that a longer than usual period of parole would enhance the applicant's prosects of rehabilitation, and would assist in preventing him from re-offending.
23Her Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences to which I have referred.
THE GROUNDS OF APPEALGround 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which she had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offence.24At the commencement of her reasons, her Honour made reference to the fact that the offence in count 1 attracted a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of seven years.  At that time, the decision in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168;  [2004] NSWCCA 131 set out the approach to sentencing for offences for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed.  That approach involved determining whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, a determination which required consideration, firstly of the objective seriousness of the offence, and secondly of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.    
25The High Court, in Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120;  [2011] HCA 39  concluded that it was erroneous, in sentencing an offender for an offence for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed, to give primary, much less determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period.  The High Court also concluded that the relevant legislation (in particular ss 55B(2), 54B(3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) did not permit a sentencing judge to engage in a two step process of sentencing, whereby an assessment was made as to where, within the range of objective seriousness, a matter fell, and was followed by a determination of whether such aggravating or mitigating factors found to exist might justify a longer or shorter period.  It was concluded in Muldrock (at [26]) that the required approach to sentencing was one in which all of the relevant factors were identified, and a judgment reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors.  
26Her Honour's determination in the present matter was made prior to the decision in Muldrock.  After setting out the facts, and making a number of observations regarding the circumstances of the applicant's offending, her Honour said:  
""The fact that he has pleaded guilty to the s 112(3) offence is relevant on (sic) assessing where on the range it falls and whether it can be categorised as a mid-range offence in accordance with the dictates of the legislature. An offence said to fall within that mid-range of objective seriousness attracts a head sentence in the order of 9 to 10 years but just because a plea of guilty has been entered it does not mean, of course, that the standard non-parole period no longer remains applicable. It always remains relevant as a guide post or bench mark. This offence, as I have said, I find falls just below the mid-range.""

27The submissions of counsel for the applicant focussed, in particular, upon that passage.  In summary, counsel submitted that:
(a) her Honour's language reflected the adoption of a fixed or rigid approach to the standard non-parole period, an approach which the High Court in Muldrock found to be erroneous;
(b) in referring to its use as a ""guidepost"", her Honour had ascribed too much weight to the standard non-parole period; and
(c) her Honour had engaged in an impermissible approach by considering the consequences, in terms of the calculation of a head sentence, of the application of the standard non-parole period.  
28Before considering these submissions, and in circumstances where her Honour's decision predated the decision in Muldrock, it is appropriate to make two preliminary observations.  
29Firstly, merely demonstrating that a sentencing judge followed the decision in Way, at a time before the decision in Muldrock will not, of itself, be sufficient to demonstrate error.  In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 Davies J at [26] (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) said:
""Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick"".
30I interpolate that the present case was indeed one where sentence was imposed following a plea of guilty.  It was also one in which the sentencing judge made specific reference to the standard non-parole being ""relevant as a guide post or bench mark"".
31Similar observations to those of Davies J in Butler were made by Allsop P in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [2]:
""The decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 made clear that the decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 was wrongly decided. That does not mean that all sentences passed before Muldrock relying on Way are necessarily vitiated by operative error.""

32Secondly, in determining whether an error has been established, it is necessary to consider the reasons of a sentencing judge as a whole (see Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [2] per Allsop P; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43] per Johnson J.
33Bearing in mind these observations, and having regard to her Honour's reasons, I do not accept the submissions made on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground.  In my view, on a fair reading of the whole of those reasons, her Honour:
(i)set out the facts;
(ii)made observations as to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period as they applied to the first count;
(iii)set out, in some detail, the circumstances of the applicant's offending;
(iv)cited the fact that in mitigation of penalty the applicant was entitled to a reduction on account of his plea of guilty;
(v)made reference to the standard non-parole period as a ""guidepost"" or ""benchmark"";
(vi)made an assessment of where the applicant's offending fell within the range of objective seriousness; and 
(vii)made a number of other observations regarding rehabilitation, before proceeding to impose sentence.
34Read as a whole, her Honour's reasons do not, in my view, support a conclusion that she used the standard non-parole period in some impermissible way, whether it be by using it as a starting point, giving it determinative significance, ascribing to it undue weight, or by otherwise engaging in a two step process of sentencing.  On the contrary, the reasons, in my view, clearly indicate that her Honour took into account all relevant factors before determining the appropriate sentence.  35The fact that there was no impermissible tethering of her Honour's sentencing discretion to the standard non-parole period is also evident from her observation that the standard non-parole period was ""relevant"" as a guide post or bench mark.  In my view, her Honour's adoption of such terminology runs contrary to the proposition that she used the standard non-parole period in some fixed, rigid or otherwise impermissible way.  
36I am also not persuaded that her Honour erred in giving consideration to the head sentence which might be imposed following the adoption of the standard non-parole period.  There was nothing to prevent her Honour from considering, as part of the sentencing process, the consequence (in terms of a head sentence) of the application of the standard non-parole period.  The more important question is whether or not the approach which was taken to the standard non-parole period operated so as to mandate the outcome.  t is evident, both from her Honour's reasons and the sentence she ultimately imposed, that it did not.      
37In Zreika (supra) Johnson J at [46] observed that the process of instinctive synthesis to be undertaken by a sentencing court involves the sentencing judge identifying all the factors that are relevant to the sentence and then making a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence in all of the circumstances of the case (see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at 377-378; [51]; Muldrock at [26]).  In my view, and on a fair reading of the whole of her Honour's reasons, that describes the process that her Honour undertook.
38Even had I reached the view that her Honour's reasons were reflective of one or more of the errors for which the applicant contends, I am not persuaded, for the reasons more fully discussed in respect of ground 2, that some lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
39It follows that in my view this ground is not made out.  Ground 2 - To the extent that the sentencing judge was obliged to assess, in a general way, the objective seriousness of the offending as part of the task of properly sentencing the applicant (as opposed to fixing that objective seriousness relative to a notional mid-range) her Honour erred in her approach assessing the objective seriousness of the Count 1 offence by failing to give sufficient weight to matters that ought to have given rise to a finding that the offence was at the lower end of the range.
40In support of this ground counsel for the applicant cited a number of the circumstances which arose from the offending to which, it was submitted,  her Honour failed to give sufficient weight.  It was further submitted that when proper weight was ascribed to each of these matters, the appropriate finding was that the offence fell towards the lower end of the range.  Such matters included the following:  
(i)the serious indictable offence was at the lowest end of the range of the types of offences that could give rise to aggravation;
(ii)the dangerous weapon, being a taser, was  less inherently dangerous than a shortened firearm;
(iii)the offence was committed in daylight and alone;
(iv)there was an absence of forced entry and no damage was occasioned;
(v)the offence was committed over a short period of time;
(vi)the applicant was undisguised, and was known to at least one of the occupants of the dwelling house; and
(vii)the offence was not committed in breach of conditional liberty.
41At least some of the matters relied upon by counsel for the applicant in support of this submission do not appear to have been the subject of any submission to her Honour.  It has been observed on a number of occasions that in an appeal such as this, the court does not engage in a process of rehearing a plea in mitigation.  There is an expectation that whomever appears before a sentencing judge at first instance will make such submissions as might be open by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence.  As a consequence, this court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been, but were not, advanced before a sentencing judge (see Zreika (supra) at [79] - [81] per Johnson J;  Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [35] - [36] per Johnson J.  
42This court will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made in the lower court, or are a contradiction of submissions previously made (see Zreika at [81]).  In the present case, the applicant's representative on sentence submitted to her Honour that the objective seriousness of the offence in count 1 fell ""probably at the mid-range of objective seriousness"".  The Crown took no issue with that submission.  The position taken on behalf of the applicant on this appeal, namely that the offence fell at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness, was not consistent with what was put at first instance.  
43In any event, and balanced against the matters relied upon by the applicant in support of this ground, there were a number of other circumstances in relation to the offending in count 1.  Those matters included the following:
(i) the applicant burst into the premises, unannounced;(ii) although the occupants of the house might have been expected to be awake, it was dark at the time;(iii) there were two 16 year old girls within the premises;(iv) the applicant was in possession of a taser and a knife;(v) whilst in the premises, the applicant acted in what might be described as a generally aggressive and violent way, as evidenced not only by what he said to the occupants, but by the fact that he punched the wall on two occasions with sufficient force to leave holes in the gyprock; and(vi) the applicant escaped in a vehicle which was waiting outside, a circumstance which evidenced some degree of planning.
44These circumstances reflect, on any view, a matter of some seriousness.  It might also be noted that her Honour's finding that the applicant's offending in respect of count 1 was just below the mid range of objective seriousness was one which was more favourable to the applicant than that which was urged upon her Honour by the applicant's then representative.  
45Taking the entirety of these circumstances into account, it is my view that this ground is not made out.    
CONCLUSION46I propose the following orders:
(1)grant leave to appeal;
(2)dismiss the appeal.
47BUTTON J:  I agree with Bellew J.

		15 November 2012",2012-11-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760477,R v MY; R v SP [2012] NSWLC 12,"Judgment
Reasons for Decision

1MY and SP are charged that on 14 January 2012 they robbed the alleged victim whilst in company and being armed. At the time, MY was aged 12 and SP had turned 11 four days prior. Their matters are on for hearing on 12 December 2012. A brief of evidence has been served on the defence, and thus they have the witness statements. No doubt if this application is successful, then further evidence may be served. The hearings have been delayed due to the unavailability of the alleged victim to give evidence until that date. 

2The police have made an application for a forensic procedure, the taking of a photograph of MY and SP for the purposes of having a witness attempt a photo-identification. This matter has now become urgent given the pending hearing date. 

3The legal representatives of each young person opposed the application. Accordingly, the matter was set down for hearing at Maclean Local Court on 31 October 2012. 

4The applicant is Senior Constable Jeffcoat, who is also the informant in the criminal charge matters. He was called to the stand and the police prosecutor sought to tender his affidavit. Both of the defence lawyers objected to paragraphs eight and nine of the affidavit on the basis that it contains hearsay material. On the voir dire I read the affidavit. It is necessary to repeat paragraphs eight and nine. 

8. Approximately 15.47 on Saturday the 14th January 2012, the victim and the witness were both sun baking on Pippie Beach at Yamba. At this time both the victim and witnesses were approximately 300 metres from the lifeguard who was on duty at the time. They were both on the sand however were closest to the edge where the dunes meet the sand. At a point during their leisure activity, the victim was struck in the back of the head with a piece of wood impacting with the victims. A female co-accused has since been charged and pleaded guilty to this offence in the District Court. It is alleged that it was at this time that the two accused young persons SP and MY came over and all three began ransacking the victim's Hessian beach bag. 
9. All three young accused persons were seen to run south along the beach. A short time later whilst Police were patrolling the accused young person MY was seen by police walking towards Robinson Street Yamba. At this time Police could not confirm a description of clothing therefore left the area to attend to the victims. Upon speaking with the victim and witness a short time later, a description of the three accused persons was gathered. One such description described the accused young person MY leaving no doubt that the offenders had run into the Ngaru Aboriginal Reserve. Police approached an address in Robinson Street Yamba and saw two of the accused young persons run from the premises. Both were still wearing the clothing described by the victim and witnesses. Both ran from the premises and were arrested a short time later. The accused young person SP was arrested inside a premises in Robinson Street Yamba after being named by the co accused young persons. The three accused young persons were conveyed to Yamba Police Station and entered into Police Custody and later charged with said offence. 

5The defence submissions were based on the following passage from the case of LK v Commissioner of Police and Anor [2011] NSWSC 458 where the issue of the application of the Evidence Act to Forensic Procedure Applications was raised. Fullerton J at 26 made the following comment: 

In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this appeal I do not regard it as appropriate that I deal at any length with the submission that some aspect of the evidence upon which the Magistrate relied was inadmissible or express a final view about the matter. I do, however, observe that the Bail Act 1978 specifically provides that a court is not bound by the rules of evidence, which under s8 of the Evidence Act displaces s4(1)(b) of the Evidence Act which provides that the Act does apply to proceedings relating to bail. In addition, although the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act makes no express provision that the rules of evidence apply to proceedings under the Act (or for the rules of evidence to be dispensed with) s33 which deals with applications for interim orders, refers expressly to the need for an application made in person to be supported by evidence on oath or affirmation, and s26 provides that an application for a final order must also be supported by evidence in relation to the matters in s24 to which the Magistrate needs to be satisfied before a final order is made. I also note that s4 of the Evidence Act provides that the Act applies to proceedings in a New South Wales court including interlocutory proceedings or proceedings of a similar kind. Assuming that the proceedings are civil proceeding (as defined in the Evidence Act) the applicant did not apply for waiver of the rules of evidence under s190(3) of the Evidence Act. On this analysis it would appear that proceedings under the Act (or at least the proceedings the subject of the appeal) are governed by the rules of evidence and that the challenged evidence ought to have been disregarded by the Magistrate.

6The defence adopts this highly persuasive passage, and the prosecution does not challenge the view that the Evidence Act applies to the application, and that much of the material contained in the affidavit is hearsay. The prosecution submits that most of the evidence relating to police observations is actually the observations of Senior Constable Jeffcoat, and that this will become clear once the admissibility of the affidavit is determined. 

7I have some issue with the concession that the evidence is hearsay, in the sense that it is not tendered for a hearsay purpose. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this judgment I will assume that it is hearsay. 

8The prosecution applies for the hearsay provisions of the Evidence Act to be waived pursuant to s 190(3), and thus for the affidavit to be admitted into evidence notwithstanding the hearsay contained. The defence objects to that waiver. The defence objected firstly on the issue of notice, but this objection was not maintained in further submissions. In any event, given the urgency of the application, I would have waived notice. 

9Section 190(3) of the Evidence Act is as follows: 
In a civil proceeding, the court may order that any one or more of the provisions mentioned in subsection (1) do not apply in relation to evidence if:
(a)the matter to which the evidence relates is not genuinely in dispute, or
(b) the application of those provisions would cause or involve unnecessary expense or delay.

10There is precious little reported authority on s 190(3). However it is abundantly clear that it is for the court to consider what is genuinely in dispute, and that that determination may be contrary to the stated views of the party objecting to the waiver - Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited [2000] NSWSC 367.

11The defence submissions are that the hearsay is inadmissible, and that if evidence is sought to be relied upon which goes to issues beyond the direct knowledge of the applicant, then those witness's statements must be served on the application, and they must be available to be cross-examined on the application. Thus, in this case, the alleged victim and any eyewitnesses to the actual assault, would need to give evidence. Further, evidence by any police officer, unless merely corroborative of the applicant, would also need to be subject to cross-examination. When I pointed out to the defence that this would mean that the hearing of the application would involve calling the same evidence as to be heard at the trial itself, the response was that either the Evidence Act applied or it did not. If it does, then no hearsay is admissible. 

12The application by the prosecution that s 190(3) be applied was objected to. Firstly, it was said that it was too late for such an application in the middle of the forensic application. Secondly, it was stated that this was merely an attempt to remedy a ""law that the prosecution or the court does not like"" with a device. Thirdly, there was reference to the second reading speech relating to forensic procedures. Finally, reference was made by Mr G Kumarasinhe to Smits v Roach [2006] HCA 36, CL v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2011] NSWSC 943 and W v Bugden and Another [2005] NSWSC 898. 

13At no time did either defence counsel seek an adjournment. There has been no application by the defence to call or cross-examine any other witnesses pursuant to s 30(6)(b) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000. A full brief of evidence has been served on the defence for the pending hearing. 

14I stood the matter down in the list so that the defence lawyers could get instructions as to whether any of the matters in paragraph eight or nine were genuinely in dispute. The defence position was that all the evidence except for the last sentence of paragraph nine was in dispute. 

15With respect, the defence position on that issue is nonsensical. How can it possibly be genuinely in contention, for example, that at approximately 15.47 on Saturday 14 January 2012, the victim and the witness were both sun baking on Pippie Beach at Yamba? How can it possibly be genuinely in dispute that a female co-accused has since been charged and pleaded guilty to this offence? Nevertheless, I can understand that some of the material contained is going to be in dispute in the eventual hearing, where I glean that identification is a key issue. However, for the reasons given below, I am of the view that none of the material in paragraphs eight and nine is genuinely in dispute for the purposes of this application. 

16In my view the error in the approach of the defence is a misunderstanding of the nature of these proceedings. Where an application is made to the court for a forensic procedure, the court must make a decision under s 24 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000. The applicant bears the burden to satisfy the court that there are reasonable grounds to believe a suspect has committed an offence, and that the procedure might produce evidence tending to prove or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence.

17The procedure for hearing such an application is set out in s 30(6). 
The suspect or his or her representative:
(a)may cross-examine the applicant for the order, and
(b)may, with the leave of the Magistrate, call or cross-examine any other witnesses
(c)may address the Magistrate. 

18The limits on s 30(6)(b) are established in s 30(7): 
A Magistrate must not give leave under subsection (6)(b) unless the Magistrate is of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witnesses should be called or cross-examined

19The court does not have to be satisfied that, for example, the alleged victim is telling the truth to the police officer that makes the application. The procedure specifically excludes the testing of other witnesses, unless there are substantial reasons why they should be called. As stated above, no such application has been made. 

20In my view, Parliament never intended that application proceedings such as this ought be some sort of 'pre-trial trial'. This is a classic case where the hearsay provisions of the Evidence Act ought be waived because it is not seriously in dispute that the police officer has been informed of all, or any of these matters, and that he has faithfully repeated what he has been told by the victims in his affidavit. 

21The test for this application is for the court to ask, inter alia, this question - based upon what the applicant police officer has been told, and based upon what the applicant police officer saw and heard, are there reasonable grounds to believe that the suspects have committed an offence? The test is not whether the witnesses who told the police certain things are telling the truth. 

22There is nothing in the second reading speech by then Attorney General Wheelan, or in the cases referred to by the defence that suggest otherwise. 

23In coming to that conclusion I am mindful, in accordance with s 190(4) of the Evidence Act, that the information given to the applicant is crucial in determining this application, that the allegations in relation to the offence are extremely serious and that an adjournment would necessarily delay the hearing of the substantive allegations. 

24Even if I was wrong as to the issue of 'genuinely in dispute', the exclusion of the evidence would be a monumental waste of time pursuant to s 190(3)(b). 

25I am waiving the hearsay rules for the purposes of the affidavit, and it will be exhibit one on the application. 

26The defence may now cross-examine the applicant. Following that, I will hear from the representatives of the prosecution and the defence, and make a determination as to whether the photographs may be taken. If so, I will set a timetable for the procedure to take place and for the service of any additional evidence for the hearing of the substantive matters. 

27It is necessary for completeness to deal with some of the submissions by Mr G Kumarasinhe which were of concern, particularly as he submitted that I should refer this matter to the Supreme Court. Apparently, he is of the view that I have this power, although that is news to me. 

28Firstly, the cases handed up by Mr G Kumarasinhe referred to at [12] above were irrelevant to the issue currently under determination. 

29Secondly, on page seven Mr G Kumarasinhe made the following submission: 

Your Honour the submission I was going to make only briefly is that that decision of her Honour at the point your Honour raised at law has never been referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal so it's a judgment so its not challenged. 

30I fail to comprehend what the Court of Criminal Appeal has to do with this matter. I am perturbed that Mr G Kumarasinhe appears to be making a submission regarding hierarchy of the courts in New South Wales, the concept of obiter dicta and the doctrine of precedent. However, as I am unable to comprehend the actual submission, it is difficult to deal with the issues apparently raised. 

31Thirdly, Mr G Kumarasinhe made submissions on the onus of proof on page 13 of the transcript at 32. 

But what is concerning and I haven't heard what your Honour said, is it clearly appears by trying to get instructions is reversing the onus of proof.

32This submission was repeated at page 14 at 12. This fundamentally misunderstands the nature of an application under s 190(3). For the court to hear submissions from the respondent to an application to waive the rules of evidence is not reversing the onus of proof. It is providing natural justice. There is no onus on the respondent to the application to waive the rules of evidence. 

33Fourthly, Mr G Kumarasinhe sought to make submissions about the issue of 'suspicion' at 14.27. As I pointed out at the time, that submission fundamentally mistakes the issue at hand, which is the admissibility of the affidavit, not the test to be applied in considering the entire application. 

34Fifthly, Mr G Kumarasinhe made the following submission at 18.12:

Yes and your Honour that's what we said your Honour is that if you don't raise that objection regarding waiving the rules then we are to be criticised. So we embrace it your Honour and the submission I make with all due respect is that should have been raised much earlier in the proceedings. We have it on the track and then that's been raised.

35I did not understand that submission at the time, and try as I might, I do not understand that submission now. It is not for the court to raise objections, just as the court does not have the power to refer the matter to the Supreme Court. It is unclear what should have been raised earlier in the proceedings. I am mystified as to what, if anything, is 'on track'. 

36Sixthly, Mr G Kumarasinhe made the following submission at 19.25: 

Your Honour can I just say this your Honour and I put a caveat your Honour, it's not like an expert statement and your Honour can look at it your Honour's got a copy of it, it's not like a expert witness statement that the prosecution says we serve it pursuant to Section - your Honour where it says if it's not challenged or contested quite properly it will be tendered. But it doesn't say that what this application says, certainly it applies to my client here, notice the respondent failure to appear may result in a warrant being sought for your arrest, here she is.
I'm just saying your Honour my friend is saying that we should have put him on notice but this is not the case. It's not like an expert witness statement that tells you or to serve quite properly and says otherwise we tender this. And that's good law but it's not the case here. So I'd ask your Honour to perhaps note that for the record.

37To the extent that this is a submission relating to expert evidence, warrants of arrest, good law and tendering, then that submission is duly noted. For what purpose I am noting that submission, I remain utterly ignorant. 

38In respect of each of the six matters raised above, I am not confident that Mr G Kumarasinhe understands the nature of the application, or the evidential issues I am determining. I am not confident, even with the benefit of reading the transcript repeatedly, that I understand the submissions he put. 

39I thank Mr Spagnolo and Mr Costin-Neilsen for their helpful submissions.

2760478,RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236,"Judgment
1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.
2Johnson J: I agree with Bellew J.
3Bellew J: Before the court are applications for extensions of time in which to seek leave to appeal, and applications for leave to appeal, against sentences imposed in the District Court of New South Wales on 27 November 2008 and 23 October 2009 respectively.
BACKGROUND4On 4 August 2000, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years, following pleas of guilty to offences of buggery and indecent assault (""the previous offences"").  The previous offences involved acts perpetrated on two young persons, ST (who was then 13 years of age) and JD (who was then 14 years of age).  
5The applicant was released on parole in respect of the previous offences on 7 May 2003.
6On 22 February 2006, whilst still on parole, the applicant was arrested and charged with:
(i)a number of offences which might be generally described as offences of child sexual assault (""the child sexual assault offences""); and
(ii)a single offence of possessing child pornography (""the child pornography offence"").
7On 20 November 2008 the applicant pleaded guilty to the child sexual assault offences as follows:
(i)indecently assaulting CT between 31 December 1979 and 1 January 1981 (count 1);
(ii)indecently assaulting CT between 31 December 1979 and 1 January 1981 (count 2);
(iii)having homosexual intercourse with NT on or about 25 April 1987 (count 3);
(iv)having homosexual intercourse with NT between 30 June 1987 and 1 August 1987 (count 4);
(v)having homosexual intercourse with NT between 30 June 1987 and 1 August 1987 (count 5);
(vi)having homosexual intercourse with NT between 30 June 1987 and 1 August 1987 (count 6);
(vii)committing an act of gross indecency upon JK between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1989 (count 7); and
(viii)committing an act of gross indecency upon JK between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1989 (count 8).
8The victims CT (in respect of counts 1 and 2) and NT (in respect of counts 3, 4, 5 and 6) were the brothers of ST who was one of the victims of the previous offences.  
9On 27 November 2008 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court in respect of the child sexual assault offences as follows: 
(a)in respect of count 1, a non-parole period of 1 year with the balance of term of 4 months, to date from 2 August 2007; 
(b)in respect of count 2, a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months, with a balance of term of 6 months, to date from 2 August 2007;
(c)in respect of count 3, a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 9 months, to date from 2 August 2010;
(d)in respect of count 4, a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 9 months, to date from 2 August 2010;
(e)in respect of count 5, a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 9 months, to date from 2 August 2011; 
(f)in respect of count 6, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months, being part of an overall sentence of 5 years and 6 months commencing on 2 August 2012, rendering the applicant eligible for parole on 1 May 2015, and with the sentence expiring in its entirety on 1 February 2018; 
(g)in respect of count 7, a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month with a balance of term of 5 months, to date from 2 August 2008; and
(h)in respect of count 8, a non-parole period of 1 year with a balance of term of 4 months, to date from 2 August 2008.  

10The overall sentence imposed was one of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a minimum of 7 years and 9 months imprisonment. The applicant is eligible for release on parole in respect of the child sexual assault offences on 1 May 2015, with the sentences expiring in their entirety on 1 February 2018.  
11On 28 July 2009 the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the child pornography offence.
12On 23 October 2009 the applicant was sentenced in respect of the child pornography offence to a fixed term of 20 months imprisonment, commencing on 1 December 2014 and concluding on 31 July 2016.  That sentence was partially cumulative upon the sentences imposed in respect of the child sexual assault offences, commencing some 5 months earlier than the date on which the applicant was eligible for release on parole in respect of the sentences imposed for those other offences, namely 1 May 2015.
13It should be noted that the applicant had originally pleaded not guilty to the child pornography offence.  His trial commenced, but on the afternoon of the first day of the trial, following evidence given by his daughter, the applicant was re-arraigned and entered a plea of guilty.
14The applicant now seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal, and if the extension is granted, leave to appeal in respect of the sentences imposed in respect of both the child sexual assault offences and the child pornography offence.
THE APPLICATION TO EXTEND TIME15The sentences for the child sexual assault offences were imposed on 27 November 2008.  The notice of intention to seek leave to appeal was not filed until 19 October 2011, almost 2 years and 11 months after the sentences were imposed. The sentence for the child pornography offence was imposed on 23 October 2009.  It was not until 24 March 2011, 17 months later, that the applicant filed a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal.
16Pursuant to s. 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) any appeal against sentence by a person convicted on indictment can only be brought with the leave of the court.  Section 10(1)(a) of the same Act prescribes a period of 28 days after sentence within which a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal must be given.  Section 10(1)(b) gives the court power to extend the time within which the notice under s. 10(1)(a) is required to be filed.
17In support of the application for an extension of time, the applicant filed an affidavit sworn on 19 October 2011.  In paragraph (2) of that affidavit, he  deposed to having had a short conversation with his solicitor following the imposition of the sentences for the child sexual assault offences, in the course of which the possibility of an appeal was briefly canvassed.  The applicant was thereafter sent to the Parklea Correctional Centre, in circumstances where he was, according to his affidavit, ""surprised by the length of the sentence and (was) depressed for some time.""  The applicant also deposed (at paragraph (4) of his affidavit) to the fact that after arriving at Parklea he found it ""impossible to get any information about the possibility of an appeal"".
18According to paragraph (5) of the applicant's affidavit, he was moved to the Junee Correctional Centre on 4 November 2010.  Whilst there, he had discussions with a fellow inmate, following which he wrote to the Legal Aid Commission raising the question of an appeal against the sentences imposed for the child sexual assault offences.  He then forwarded a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal together with an application for an extension of time in which to lodge that notice.  According to his affidavit, he was advised by the Registrar on 13 March 2011 that his notice and application ""had not been registered because of the delay in filing it"".  A further notice was filed on 19 October 2011.
19The applicant's affidavit makes no reference to the fact that on 28 September 2009, i.e. between the date on which he was sentenced for the child sexual assault offences and the date on which he was moved to Junee Correctional Centre, he was sentenced for the child pornography offence.  Clearly, at that time, he had the benefit of legal representation.  His affidavit completely fails to address the question of whether he discussed with his then representative the question of an appeal against the sentences imposed for the child sexual assault offences.  If he did discuss that issue, he has proffered no explanation for the delay in the filing of the relevant application.  If he did not discuss that issue, he has proffered no explanation for his failure to do so.  Either way, the affidavit is deficient.  Moreover, the affidavit is completely bereft of any explanation for the delay in filing the notice relating to the sentence imposed for the child pornography offence.
20Unsurprisingly in these circumstances, and whilst recognising that the court has a discretion to extend time, the Crown opposed any grant of an extension.  The Crown submitted that the explanation advanced by the applicant for the delay was without merit, and that exceptional circumstances warranting an extension of time had not been established.  
21This Court has consistently emphasised the need to pay proper regard to the time limits imposed by the Criminal Appeal Act.  For example, in R v Lawrence and ors [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J made reference to previous observations (by Begg and Cross JJ) in R v Burke (CCA (NSW) 30 November 1978 unreported) where their Honours expressed their concern at, and disapproval of, what they saw as ""the increasing practice of ignoring the time stipulation of the Criminal Appeal Act, apparently on the assumption that this court will, in all cases, extend the time for filing a proper notice of appeal..."".  Having observed that ""too much laxity should not be tolerated by the court, unless solid grounds are shown for an extension of time"", their Honours said (at 148): 
""On many occasions it has been observed by Courts of Criminal Appeal that intending appellants should not assume that delays in filing notices of appeal or applications for leave to appeal, and especially considerable delays, will be automatically excused...This court takes the opportunity to emphasise again that it should not be assumed that a failure to give notice of appeal, or notice of intention to appeal, or to furnish proper grounds of appeal, within time, will be excused. Certainly, where any considerable delay has occurred, exceptional circumstances will be required before the appeal is permitted to proceed"".
22These principles were more recently affirmed by Johnson J (with whom Allsop P and Kirby J agreed) in Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8] and following.  His Honour observed that the court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable (as to which see R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA201 at [17]).  Amongst the principles referred to by his Honour was that of finality of litigation (at [13]):
""The principle of finality of litigation is relevant on an application such as this. Although it may be, as here, that the Crown cannot point to any actual prejudice because of the delay in bringing the application, there is public interest in avoidance of delay, and the finality of litigation, in the area of sentencing, as with litigation generally. In many cases, the prospect of sentence being re opened long after the event may impact adversely upon victims of crime.""  
23In view of the nature of the applicant's offending in the present case, his Honour's observations as to the potential adverse impact upon the victims of that offending, brought about by the prospect of sentence being re-opened, are particularly relevant.  
24In Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262;  (2010) 205 A Crim R 138 Campbell JA (at [24]; 144) confirmed that the principles of finality applied to applications to extend the time for appeal against sentence.  His Honour went on to say:
""As well, when a time limit has been laid down through legislation, it would be subverting the intention of the legislation for this Court to consider the matter as though it were an application for leave to appeal against sentence brought within time, and if such an application would succeed, regard that as a sufficient reason for extending the time.  I recognise that 'exceptional circumstances' are not, in so many words, expressly made part of the statutory scheme for granting an extension of time to appeal (Arja v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 190 at [4] - [5], cf McCall v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [5] - [7]).  Even so, it seems to me that the need to give weight to the factors I have just mentioned in operating the statutory scheme must call for something beyond the presence of factors that would be sufficient to result in a sentence being varied if an application for leave to appeal against sentence were brought within time"".  
25However, it obviously remains the case that an individual application for an extension of time must be determined on its own facts.  Johnson J in Edwards (supra), having identified the various factors which impact upon the making of that determination,  observed (at [18]):
""None of these factors constitute a barrier to this court intervening where the justice of the case warrants that course. However, in determining whether an extension of time ought be granted, this court should be alive to factors such as these, as well as the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal.""
26For the reasons I have already expressed, the affidavit filed by the applicant in support of his application for an extension of time poses more questions than it answers.  In my view, it falls substantially short of what might reasonably have been expected to be provided in circumstances when the period of delay is so substantial.  The fact that there are such shortcomings in the evidence, in circumstances where there has been such a substantial delay, is a matter which tends against the Court exercising its discretion in favour of granting an extension of time.
27That said, the issues arising from the sentences imposed upon the applicant are of some complexity.  For the reasons more fully set out below, I have concluded that errors on the part of each of the sentencing judges have been made out.  It is in these particular circumstances that I consider that there should be an extension of time granted in each case.  
28However, I should make it clear that I have reached that conclusion having regard to the circumstances of the present case, and to the particular issues which have arisen consequent upon the sentences which were imposed upon the applicant.  My conclusion that an extension of time should be granted should not be regarded as diluting, to any degree whatsoever, the established principles which govern the grant of an extension of time to which I have previously referred.
THE CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT OFFENCESThe facts29It is relevant to note that in or about 1970 the parents of two of the victims of the child sexual assault offences, became members of the Jehovah's Witnesses Church, of which the applicant was also a member.  As a consequence, there was social interaction between the family of those two victims, and the applicant.  This constitutes part of the background against which the child sexual assault offences were committed.
 Count 130In or about 1980, the complainant CT, who was 14 years old at the time, undertook work experience with the applicant, who was a carpenter.  Whilst doing so CT and the applicant began talking about relationships.  In the course of those discussions, CT expressed some affection for a girl who was a member of the church congregation.  The applicant asked CT various matters of a personal nature relating to this girl, and engaged in other conversation of a sexual nature.  During the period of one week when CT was with the applicant undertaking work experience, the applicant instructed CT to climb a ladder.  As CT did so, the applicant followed him up the ladder and, upon reaching CT, slid his hand up CT's shorts and commenced to rub his penis over the top of his underpants.
Count 231In about 1981 CT was assisting the applicant at a work site.  The applicant, who appeared to CT to have an erection, began talking about sex and then made CT lie on his back, before squatting in front of him.  The applicant then had simulated sex with CT, following which he took CT into the bedroom of the premises at which they were working.  The applicant took a pair of stockings from the bedroom and instructed CT to put them on.  CT did so, following which the applicant told him to lie on the bed.  The applicant then masturbated CT through the stockings until CT ejaculated.  Count 332On or about 25 April 1987 NT, who was then about 14 years of age, attended a building site at which the applicant was working and assisted the applicant with various jobs.  Following the incident which forms the basis of item 2 in the Form 1 the applicant told NT to suck his penis.  When NT said that he did not want to the applicant said to him:
""This is how you become a man"".
33The applicant then took the back of NT's head, pushed it down onto his penis, and forced NT's mouth up and down his penis for about 1 minute.
Count 434On a Saturday in or about July 1987, when at the home of NT, the applicant said to him:
""Come into the laundry with me"".
35NT followed the applicant into the laundry where the applicant unzipped his pants, took NT by the head, and pushed NT's mouth onto his penis.  He then pushed NT's head up and down on his penis for approximately 1 minute until he ejaculated into NT's mouth.  As NT pulled away, semen fell from his mouth onto the floor, and the applicant wiped it with his boots.  NT then ran straight into his bedroom.  
Count 536Approximately one week after the events which form the basis of count 4, the applicant was again at NT's home and said to NT:
""Come into the laundry"".
37Once the applicant and NT were in the laundry the applicant said:
""Can I suck your dick?""
38NT then unzipped his pants and took his penis out.  The applicant fellated  NT, until NT ejaculated.
Count 639Following the events which form the basis of count 5, the applicant and NT left the laundry, at which time the applicant suggested that they go for a bicycle ride.  NT then rode his bike and met the applicant near Corrimal Beach.  As they were riding towards the beach the applicant said to NT:
""Do you like masturbating? Have you ever put a sock over your penis and come into it? Lets go over the sand hills, I can show you how to make babies"".
40Upon stopping at the beach, the applicant removed a towel from a back pack, and having laid it on the sand said to NT:
""Take your clothes off"".
41NT took his clothes off, following which the applicant pushed him onto the towel and then removed his shorts and shirt.  The applicant lay on top of NT with an erect penis before lubricating his penis with saliva and placing it into NT's anus.  The applicant placed his hands over NT's mouth to stop him from screaming.  NT later said the pain was excruciating.
42After approximately 20 to 30 seconds the offender removed his penis from NT's anus.  After NT had got dressed the applicant said to NT:
""What we have just done is very wrong"".
43NT took his bike and hid in the bushes until the applicant left, before riding home in pain.
Count 744Approximately three weeks following the events which form the basis of item 7 on the Form 1 JK and the applicant were having lunch at the building site where they were working.  The applicant approached JK, put his right hand on JK's chest, and unzipped JK's shorts with his left hand.  He then commenced to masturbate JK until he ejaculated.
Count 845Two weeks following the events which form the basis of count 7, the applicant was driving JK home from work.  During the trip home, JK fell asleep and woke with the offender masturbating him.  Although JK pretended to remain asleep, the applicant continued masturbating JK until he ejaculated.
Additional items on Form 146In addition to the child sexual assault offences summarised above, there were an additional 7 matters which the applicant asked to be taken into account on a Form 1.  The facts of these matters were also detailed by the sentencing judge and may be summarised as follows.
Item 147Following the events which form the basis of count 1, CT got down from the ladder. He went looking for the applicant and found him in an adjoining doorway with his penis in his hand, and masturbating.  The applicant continued to masturbate in front of CT until he ejaculated.  On another occasion CT was up the ladder and when he came down the applicant came up behind him and gave him a bear hug.  He put his arms around the front of CT and then put his hand onto CT's penis and masturbated it on the outside of his shorts.
Item 248NT attended a building site at which the applicant was present, following which NT went with the applicant to collect some equipment from a hire company.  On the way to the hire company, the applicant stopped his vehicle by the side of the road and said to NT:
""Show me your penis so I can check to see if you have got pubic hair"".  
49NT did as he was told and opened his shorts to reveal his penis.  The applicant then said:
""Do you want me to show you how to become a man?""

50The applicant then removed his penis from his pants and said to NT:
""Play with it, rub it"".
51NT did as he was told to do.  
Item 352Following the events which form the basis count 3, NT removed his head from the applicant's penis.  The applicant then said to him:
""Can I do it to you?""
53The applicant then fellated NT.  
Item 454Following the events which form the basis of item 3, the applicant said to NT:
""Pull me off then"".
55NT proceeded to masturbate the applicant until the applicant ejaculated.  At the same time the applicant said:
""Play with yourself"".
56NT did so, obtained an erection, and ejaculated.  The applicant obtained a handkerchief and wiped himself and NT with it, before returning NT home to his parents.Item 557Following the events which form the basis of count 5, NT fellated the applicant.  The applicant did not ejaculate on that occasion.
Item 658In about 1989 JK commenced working for the applicant.  During their lunch breaks, the conversation between JK and the applicant would always turn to sex.  The applicant asked JK:
""Do you have wet dreams? Do you wank yourself? Do you look at porno mags and do you watch porno movies?""
59On one afternoon when JK and the applicant were at work, the applicant said to JK:  
""Stay at my place Sunday night, we have an early start, 6:30.""
60The applicant told JK that his wife and children would be present at home and that his wife would make dinner.  However, when JK arrived at the premises on the Sunday evening the applicant was present on his own.  The applicant told JK on that occasion that his wife had gone to Wollongong to see her father.  The applicant arranged for JK to sleep in his (i.e. the applicant's) bed and told him that he himself would sleep on the lounge.  JK went to sleep in the bed and during the night woke to find the applicant beside him fondling his penis.
Item 761On the morning following the events which form the basis of item 6, the applicant told JK to get up a ladder.  JK climbed the ladder whilst the applicant held it at the bottom.  As JK climbed further up the ladder the applicant followed him and once he got closer to JK the applicant placed his hand up JK's shorts inside his underpants and touched him on the penis.

The sentence proceedings62At the outset of the sentence proceedings, his Honour made reference to the fact that although the applicant had pleaded guilty to each of the child sexual assault offences, he had not done so at the first available opportunity.  He noted that not only had the pleas of guilty been entered after prolonged negotiations with the Crown, the applicant had made an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw them after they had been entered.  His Honour concluded that such a course of conduct did ""not betoken a significant attempt to assist in the processes of justice"".  He identified the utilitarian value of the pleas as being between 5 and 10 percent.  Having regard to the sentences ultimately imposed by his Honour, the discount which was applied was slightly in excess of 8 percent.  
63Having recounted the facts, his Honour made reference to the applicant's criminal history which included the previous offences for which he was sentenced in 2000.  He observed, correctly, that those matters were ""distressingly similar"" to the child sexual assault offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced.  He also observed that in both instances of offending the applicant had engaged in a process of grooming the victims through the church of which he was a member, before gradually engaging in, and escalating, the sexual abuse of those victims, all of whom were young teenagers.  He concluded that the applicant's commission of the child sexual assault offences displayed a high degree of criminality.
64His Honour then turned to the subject of delay, and concluded that the applicant should not receive any consideration for the delay which had been occasioned in the course of the offences being revealed, and then prosecuted.  Having made reference to the harm occasioned to each of the victims, his Honour concluded that significant punishment was required in order to meet the needs of the community, and the law.
65His Honour then turned to the applicant's subjective case.  In circumstances where the applicant had not given evidence on sentence, his Honour reached a number of conclusions based upon a pre-sentence report which was before him, culminating in a finding that various aspects of the applicant's background had contributed to the applicant being ""a damaged human being who will require considerable treatment, supervision and support, both within the prison system and after his release"".  His Honour then made reference to the principle of totality, before concluding that although the applicant was no doubt trusted by his victims and their families, he did not regard the applicant to have been placed in a formal position of trust.  He then proceeded to impose the sentences which I have previously outlined.  
THE GROUNDS OF APPEALGround 1 - The learned sentencing judge did not properly apply the principle of totality. 66In the course of his reasons, and having turned to the subject of delay, the sentencing judge said:
""The offender should not receive any consideration for the delay in these matters being revealed and prosecuted.  He had the option, of course, of bringing these matters to a conclusion back in 2000 at least, when charged with offences against other boys, including the brother of two of these victims...In this case, the fact that the offender has debauched all three sons of the one family has added an extra dimension of damage.""
67His Honour went on to say:
""I have endeavoured, as is required by R v Pearce and R v Hamoud, to identify the criminality of each offence and to fix a sentence appropriate to that assessment. It is in my view important that each victim sees that some of the time to be spent in prison is referrable to the harm done to him personally by the offences of the prisoner. However, when looking at the matter overall, there is necessarily a very considerable telescoping of the individual sentences to accord with the principle of totality.""
68The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to have regard to the totality of the applicant's offending behaviour.  Such error was said to have arisen from his Honour's approach and, in particular, from his failure to consider an appropriate sentence having regard to the applicant's overall criminality, arising from both the child sexual assault offences which were before him, as well as from the previous offences for which he was sentenced in 2000.    
69In support of these submissions, the applicant relied, in part, upon the judgment of this Court in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, a case in which an offender had been sentenced in New South Wales some years after the commission of an offence, and where, in the intervening period, he had been serving a sentence in another state in respect of an offence of the same nature, and committed at about the same time.  Street CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, observed (at 519-520):
""It would be wrong, in my opinion, to disregard the practical situation that the appellant has already served a substantial period of imprisonment in Queensland for offences so closely related in time and character to the Sydney offences. Within a space of some eight days the appellant committed the Sydney crimes and the Queensland crimes.... It would be both relevant and material to pay regard to the totality of the imprisonment being visited upon the appellant in consequence of the totality of his criminality over this period of 8 days of committing offences of similar character...Where there has been lengthy postponement whether due to an interstate sentence of otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence,"" (emphasis added).

70Subsequently in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 the High Court (Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) concluded (at 65-66) that the reasoning in Todd was correct.  The court concluded that such reasoning reflected a principled approach to sentencing where an offender came to be sentenced many years after the commission of an offence due to the fact that in the intervening period, he had been serving a sentence imposed for other offending which was closely related in time.     
71In Wu v R [2011] NSWCCA 102 Giles JA, having referred Todd, said (at [18]):
""A number of different considerations are found in R v Todd. One is regard to totality notwithstanding that the offender is sentenced for one of a number of similar offences committed at about the same time separately from, and later than, his sentencing for the other offences. Others are regard to the offender's state of uncertainty while the sentencing is delayed, and regard to the progress of the offender's rehabilitation during the period of delay,"" (emphasis added).
72In the present case, the previous offences were not closely related in time to the commission of the majority of the child sexual assault offences.  A chronology provided for the purposes of this appeal shows that the previous offences were committed between about 1978 and 1980.  Although counts 1 and 2 of the child sexual assault offences were said to have occurred in about 1980 and 1981 respectively, the balance (counts 3 to count 8) occurred between about April 1987 and December 1989, some considerable time later.  Accordingly, and unlike the situation to which the observations in Todd, Mill and Wu were directed, this was not a case where the child sexual assault offences were committed at or about the same time as the previous offences.  
73In respect of the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant had the option of bringing the matters to a conclusion in 2000 but did not do so, counsel for the applicant referred to the decision in Wu (supra) where Giles JA observed:
""[52] Application of totality principles is not a matter of leniency. While failure to volunteer commission of the offence may mean that the offender is not entitled to some favourable or fully favourable considerations in the sentencing, it does not deprive the offender of the recognised sentencing principle that, after arriving at appropriate individual sentences, the court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences. If it did, there could be conflict with the fundamental right to remain silent.
[53] The cases have well recognised that totality principles are applicable where there is separate and later sentencing for one of a number of offences of a similar character committed in the same episode of criminality, beyond where the delay was due to an interstate element or otherwise because of the operation of the criminal justice system...Consistently with the cases, and correctly as a matter of principle, in my opinion totality principles are applicable although the separate and later sentencing is because the offender remains silent, and was charged and then came to be sentenced when the police subsequently were in a position to bring the charge (emphasis added).""
74As I have already pointed out, the previous offences had been committed some 7 years before the majority of the child sexual assault offences.  Accordingly, they could not be regarded as part of the same episode of criminality.  
75His Honour was required to consider the totality of the criminal behaviour arising from the child sexual assault offences which were before him.  In my view, it is evident that he did so.  In particular, he made specific reference to totality principles, and to the relevant authorities, in the course of his reasons.  
76In these circumstances, the error asserted by the applicant in ground 1 is not made out.  
Ground 2 - The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account the record of prior convictions as an aggravating factor.77This ground was abandoned at the hearing.
Ground 3 - The learned sentencing judge erred in refusing to find special circumstances.78It was put to his Honour by the applicant's representative on sentence that a finding of special circumstances should be made, in accordance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, on the basis of:
(i)the nature of the offences and the fact of accumulation; and 
(ii)a need for extended supervision to assist the applicant in reintegrating into the community upon his release.  
79It should be noted, particularly in light of some of the matters raised in support of ground 4, that no submission was made by the applicant's representative on sentence that a finding of special circumstances should be made on the basis of the sentencing practice which operated at the time of the offending.
80In respect of the issue of special circumstances his Honour said:
""I note that the offender himself has not given evidence but from the history provided to the officer preparing the pre-sentence report and to the psychologists who assessed him (supported by an affidavit by his mother) I accept that the offender was himself abused as a child. I accept the analysis contained in the psychologist's report that the offender had a 'disrupted and very dysfunctional upbringing permeated by violence, abandonment and sexual assault'. This may at least in part explain his actions but it does not excuse them. That background has contributed to a damaged human being who will require considerable treatment, supervision and support both within the prison system and after his release. I have not, however, made any adjustment to the proportions of his sentence other than that made necessary by virtue of accumulation because the period of his parole is itself long enough to allow for adequate supervision and support without lengthening it further by reducing the time to be spent in custody.""
81In Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Adams JJ agreed) observed (at [13]):
""...The extent of any adjustment to the statutory requirement is essentially a matter within the sentencing judge's discretion. In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] Spigelman CJ said that an adjustment for special circumstances 'raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene'. Only if the non-parole period provided is manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive should this Court intervene: Cramp at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19].""
82It is evident from his reasons that his Honour recognised the need for the applicant to undertake treatment, and to be afforded supervision and support.  His Honour did not restrict this need to a time after the applicant's release, but observed that such treatment, supervision and support would be required within the prison system as well.  83It is also evident that the principal reason for his Honour declining to make any adjustment between the non-parole period and the parole period was because he had formed the view that the parole period was, of itself, long enough to allow for adequate supervision and support.  Although he did so, his Honour was not required to give reasons in that regard (see Ha v R [2010] NSWCCA 83 at [69] per Beazley JA (with whom Howie and Hislop JJ agreed).
84In my view, there is nothing within his Honour's reasons which would suggest that his discretion miscarried.  Moreover, and for the reasons more fully set out in association with my consideration of ground 4, this is not, in my view, a case where the non-parole period which was imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive.  
85I therefore reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 4 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive having regard to the sentencing practice at the time of the offending.86The child sexual assault offences were committed against CT between about 1979 and 1981, against NT between about April 1987 and August 1987, and against JK between about January 1989 and December 1989.  It was not until February 2006 that the applicant was arrested in respect of these matters and it was not until 27 November 2008 that he was sentenced.  A significant period therefore elapsed between the time of the offending, and the date on which the applicant was sentenced.
87At the time of the commission of the child sexual assault offences the question of parole was governed by statutory regimes contained within the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 and the Probation and Parole Act 1983.   Subsequently, the Sentencing Act 1989 was passed which prescribed a statutory ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period.
88In the present case, it may be arguable that counts 7 and 8 of the child sexual assault offences (which were said to have occurred between 1 January 1989 and 31 January 1989) would, had the applicant been sentenced closer to the time of the offending, have attracted the provisions of the Sentencing Act 1989.  It is evident from the terms in which the charges were pleaded that the Crown could not be precise as to the dates on which those offences occurred.  However, there is no issue that counts 1 to 6 were committed prior to the introduction of the Sentencing Act, and therefore at a time when a non-parole period was fixed at somewhere between one third and one half of the term of the sentence.
89In these circumstances, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge erred in failing to sentence the applicant according to the sentencing practices which existed at the time of his offending.  It was submitted by the applicant that his Honour erred, in particular, by failing to apply the ratio as between the head sentence and non-parole period which existed at the time of the offending.  These errors, it was submitted, resulted in a sentence which is manifestly excessive.
90The approach to be taken by a sentencing judge when sentencing an offender in respect of conduct which occurred a considerable period of time before has been the subject of much authority in this Court.  The principle was succinctly stated by Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) in Mottram v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 210 at [41]-[42]:
""[41] It has now been accepted by this Court in a number of cases that in relation to offences which occurred during the 1970's and 1980's, with the absence of any statutory restriction on the length of a non-parole period, a sentencing practice had arisen of sentencing the non-parole periods at somewhere between one third and one half of the term of the sentence: MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261; Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; CPW v R [2009] NSWCCA 105; GRD v R [2009] NSWCCA 149; PH v R [2009] NSWCCA 161). All these cases have referred with approval to the passages in AJB v R relied upon the applicant.
[42] It is clear that a matter which his Honour should have taken into account when sentencing the applicant for these offences which occurred between 1972 and 1985 was this practice.""
91One of the passages in AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51 to which his Honour referred was that of Howie J (at [37]):
""It seems to me that this Court should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant. It can do so on the basis that special circumstances under s 44 are to be found in the fact that there was a different sentencing practice in relation to fixing a non-parole in 1982 which did not require a finding of special circumstances in order to avoid a statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term.""
92In the present case, the issue of the sentencing practice which existed at the time of the offending was not raised by either party before the sentencing judge.  As a result, the sentencing judge was not taken to any of the authorities referred to by Hoeben J.  On the hearing of the appeal there was no dispute as to the range of the length of non-parole period which was generally imposed prior to the introduction of the Sentencing Act.  
93The sentencing judge should have taken into account the fact that at the time of the offending, and in the absence of any statutory restriction being placed upon the length of a non-parole period, the practice was to set a non-parole period between one third and one half of the term.  In my view, his Honour's failure in this respect amounts to error, although I must emphasise again that he was not assisted by any submission made to him at the time as to the correct approach, and was not taken to any of the authorities which are now relied upon by the applicant.  
94However, even where such error has been established, the question of whether or not the court should intervene is an entirely separate one.  As Hoeben J pointed out in Mottram (supra) at [43] once an error of this type is identified, it is not simply a process of proceeding to adjust the sentences which were passed at first instance in order to reflect the practice which existed at the time.  
95There have been instances (the decision in Mottram being one) in which this Court has declined to intervene, notwithstanding the identification of an error of the kind made by the sentencing judge in this case.  There have been other instances in which this Court has found error and has intervened by imposing, in accordance with the sentencing practice at the time of the offending, a non-parole period which is less than half of the full term (see Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25).  On other occasions, the Court has found error and has intervened but in doing so has not adjusted the non-parole period to the extent of fully reflecting the sentencing practice which applied at the time of the relevant offending (see for example CPW v R (2009) 159 A Crim R 149; GG v R (2010) 204 A Crim R 125).  
96Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is in the following terms:
""(3) On an appeal under section 5 (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. ""
97The opinion to which the section refers, namely an opinion ""that some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed"" is an essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power for which the section provides.  Unless such an opinion is reached, then that essential pre-condition is not satisfied (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704).  
98In Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 Spigelman CJ considered the meaning of the words ""warranted in law"" as they appear in the section and said:
""[18] In these circumstances the phrase 'warranted in law"" should be understood as a reference to the entire body of legal rules that inform the exercise of a sentencing discretion, i.e. both statutory requirements and sentencing principles developed at common law.
[19] The import of paragraph [79] of Simpson was to ensure that submissions in the Court of Criminal Appeal did not proceed as if the identification of error created an entitlement on the part of the applicant to a new sentence, for example, by merely adjusting the sentence actually passed to allow for the error identified. That would be to proceed on the assumption that the sentencing judge was presumptively correct, when the court has determined that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not proceed in that manner, but re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides.""
99In the present case, the child sexual assault offences committed by the applicant constituted, on any view, serious criminal conduct.  As his Honour observed, the applicant engaged in a pattern of behaviour which involved initially grooming the various victims, before engaging in a broad range of offending conduct which escalated, in one instance, to an act of anal intercourse.  There were multiple victims, all in their mid teens.  
100In my view, all of these factors mandated the imposition of a significant term of imprisonment.  Considerations of both general and personal deterrence were paramount considerations in the sentencing process.    
101In Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 it was made clear that a non-parole period which is imposed in any given case represents the minimum period of imprisonment which is required to be served by an offender having regard to all of the purposes of punishment, including deterrence.  As I have already observed, questions of both general and personal deterrence were matters of obvious significance in the circumstances of the present case.
102Having regard to all of these matters, and notwithstanding the error which has been established, I am not of the opinion that some other sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed upon the applicant.  I do not regard the sentence imposed by his Honour as one which was manifestly excessive.
103I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal.
THE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY OFFENCEThe facts104The applicant was arrested and charged with the child pornography offence at the same time as being charged with the child sexual assault offences.  At that time, he was operating a service station just outside the township of Cooma, at the rear of which was a small house in which he resided.  When police attended the premises they executed a Search Warrant and seized three computers, one from the lounge/kitchen area of the premises.  During his trial, and immediately before his re-arraignment and plea of guilty, the applicant's daughter had given evidence before the jury that the applicant was the only person within the household who used that particular computer.
105An analysis of the computer's hard drive revealed a total of 31 images of young males engaging in varying degrees of sexual behaviour, ranging from posing and kissing, to engaging in sexual intercourse.  In relation to those images which depicted kissing, the estimated age of the males was between 9 and 10 years, whilst those who were depicted in engaging in sexual intercourse were estimated to be between 14 and 15 years of age.  
106In addition to the images was a video of a male, estimated to be about 14 years of age, who was masturbating.  
The sentence proceedings107The sentencing judge concluded that the limited number of images, their nature, and the ages of the children who were depicted in them, placed the offence (in comparison with others of a similar nature) below the mid range of objective seriousness.  He also noted that there was no evidence that the applicant had the images in his possession for sale or distribution, or that he sought to profit from his commission of the offence.
108His Honour then turned to the subjective factors which were largely set out in a pre-sentence report which had been tendered.  He had regard to the applicant's history of sexual offending, including the child sexual assault offences (for which he had, by that time, been sentenced).  His Honour also took into account the fact that the applicant had ultimately entered a plea of guilty.  Having regard to the time at which that plea had been entered, allowed a reduction of 5 percent.
109His Honour noted that when previously incarcerated for sexual offences, the applicant had not availed himself of any therapeutic programs whilst in custody.  This, he said, was to be contrasted with the evidence before him that the applicant had now expressed a willingness to engage in such programs.  His Honour regarded this as evidence of a willingness to address, albeit belatedly, what he described as the applicant's ""underlying problems"".  His Honour also made reference to what he identified as a need for specific deterrence because the applicant had been a ""serial offender"" in the past.
110His Honour concluded that the principle of totality was relevant, and that there was no utilitarian benefit in the applicant serving another lengthy period of incarceration cumulative upon the sentences previously imposed.  He observed that because any period of parole he might otherwise impose ""would be subsumed"" in the parole period imposed for the child sexual assault offences, he did not propose to impose such a period.  He proceeded to sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 20 months to commence on 1 December 2014, some 5 months prior to the earliest date for his release in respect of the sentences for the child sexual assault offences.
The grounds of appealGround 1 - The learned sentencing judge was mistaken as to the maximum penalty for the offence111At the commencement of his reasons, the sentencing judge said:
""The offender is before me today having pleaded guilty on 28 July 2009 to one offence of possessing child pornography contrary to s. 91H of the Crimes Act 1900.  The offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.  It does not attract a standard non-parole period"".
112It is common ground between the parties that having regard to the legislative history of s 91H of the Crimes Act under which the applicant was charged, the maximum penalty was in fact 5 years imprisonment.  It follows that error has been established.  In my view, that error justifies a grant of leave to appeal (as to which see R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247 at [24] per Wood CJ at CL).  However, whether the error justifies intervention by this Court is, once again, a separate question.
113In Baxter Latham J observed (at [83]):
""An error is a 'material error' if it has the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion, regardless of whether it can be demonstrated that the error has in fact influenced the sentencing outcome.  It is an error in the House v The King sense because the sentencing judge has taken into account an erroneous or irrelevant consideration.  However, the error must be more than 'trivial' or 'immaterial':  R v Jeremy Paul Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 at [56];  see also Phillip Edward Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 138 at [30] to [34]"".

114Her Honour went on to say (at [85] -[86]):
""It is only where the error can be seen to be material that s. 6(3) is enlivened and the evidence of post - sentence conduct, if any, falls to be considered by this Court in determining whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law.
Of course, the materiality of the error says nothing about whether the error has in fact operated upon the sentencing discretion.  Ultimately, this Court may determine that the error did not have that effect and that the additional material placed before the Court does not warrant a lesser sentence than was imposed below.  Simpson J (with whom Johnson J and Rothman J agreed) in R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 said as much at [55]:-
It may be that in order to form an opinion that 'some other sentence ... should be passed' the Court must form the opinion that the identified error was, or the identified errors were, such as to lead to the conclusion that they in fact infected or affected the end result, that is, the sentence selected "".
115More recently, in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; (2010) 201 A Crim R 243 (a case in which the error of the sentencing judge was of the same nature as that in the present case) RA Hulme J observed (at [70]):
""It is not necessarily the case that an error by a sentencing judge as to the applicable maximum penalty for an offence will result in an appeal being upheld ... The question is whether the court is 'of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed':  s. 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912"".
116It is also important to bear in mind that it is not necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence is manifestly excessive in order to succeed on this ground (see Baxter (supra) at [11] - [14] per Spigelman CJ; see also Minehan (supra) at [71] per RA Hulme J).
117Having found error, I have considered the question of whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed in my consideration of ground 3.
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in not fixing a non-parole period118In the course of reaching his conclusions, his Honour said:
""When previously incarcerated for sex-related offences the offender did not avail himself of any therapeutic programs available in custody.  This time the Probation and Parole Service Report records that the offender has been placed on the wait list for a sex offender preparatory program which is offered at the Junee Correctional Centre.  The offender indicated to the Probation and Parole Service that he is willing to engage in the CUBIT sex offender program and the Probation and Parole Service Report stated that a referral to that end would be made to the offender's program unit upon completion of the preparatory program.  I consider this willingness, if belatedly, to address his underlying problems to be a special circumstances (sic) and to his credit"".  

119His Honour then proceeded to impose the fixed term of imprisonment to which I previously referred.    
120It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour's reference to ""special circumstances"", coming as it did immediately after reaching a conclusion favourable to the applicant regarding his efforts at rehabilitation, amounted to a finding in terms of s. 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  Accepting that to be the case, it was submitted that the sentence imposed upon the applicant by his Honour was inconsistent with such finding.  In my view, those submissions should be accepted.  The construction of his Honour's reasons which has been advanced by the applicant is, in my view, the only reasonable construction which is open.  His Honour's imposition of a fixed term of imprisonment, and the absence of any variation to the statutory ratio when the sentences are considered as a whole, are inconsistent with his finding of special circumstances.     
121For these reasons, the error asserted in this ground is made out.  Once again however, I have dealt with the question of whether some lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed in my consideration of ground 3.
Ground 3 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive122On behalf of the offender, the court was taken to relevant sentencing statistics for offences of this nature which, it was submitted, established that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was greater than the non-parole period imposed upon the majority of offenders.  Whilst this may be so, the same statistics also demonstrate that in the case of those offenders sentenced to full time custody for matters of this nature, total terms of up to four years imprisonment were imposed.   These matters again highlight the fact that statistics presented in such a form are of limited use (see R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153 at [117] per Kirby J (with whom Beazley JA and Johnson J agreed).  
123Counsel for the applicant also relied upon two previous decisions of this Court.  It was submitted that a comparison of the sentences imposed in those instances with that imposed upon the present applicant demonstrated that the applicant's sentence was manifestly excessive.  
124The first decision was R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29;  [2005] NSWCCA 370 in which a term of 18 months imprisonment, with an non-parole period of 12 months, was imposed in respect of an offence of the importation of child pornography.  That case involved the importation of two CDs, one of which contained 16 video files, and the other 601 images, of young boys and girls engaged in sexual activity.  In dismissing the appeal Johnson J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, concluded that the applicant in that case had not demonstrated that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  
125It was submitted in the present case that the objective seriousness of the offending in Gent was greater than that of the applicant.
126The second decision was that of R v Saddler (2009) 194 A Crim R 452;  [2009] NSWCCA 83 in which the applicant was charged with three counts of possessing child pornography.   The first count related to the possession of 19,030 images of child pornography, the second to the possession of 15,400 images, and the third to 1,690 images.  At first instance, the applicant in that case was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months in respect of count 1, and a head sentence of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years on each of counts 2 and 3.  The overall sentence was one of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  On appeal, this Court reduced the head sentence in respect of count 1 to one of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months.  The total sentence was reduced to one of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months.  
127Counsel for the present applicant emphasised the fact that the number of images of which the applicant in Saddler was found to be in possession was substantially greater than the number found in the possession of the present applicant.
128In Gent the applicant had no prior convictions whatsoever and had pleaded guilty at an early stage which entitled him to a significant reduction in his sentence.  In Saddler, whilst the applicant did have a criminal history, it was not of a kind which bore any similarly to the offences for which he was sentenced.  Moreover, he had entered a plea of guilty before the Local Court and was therefore afforded the benefit of a reduction of 25 percent from what would otherwise have been the appropriate sentence.  
129Similar observations are not open to be made, in respect of either the criminal history or the plea, in the case of the present applicant.  
130Firstly, the applicant's commission of the child pornography offence came against a background of offending in a manner which exhibited an illegal sexual interest in teenage boys.  The fact that the applicant had committed that offence, whilst on parole for the previous offences indicated that such illegal interest, far from having abated, had assumed a new dimension.  Those circumstances pointed, amongst other things, to a need for specific deterrence.  
131Secondly, the applicant's plea of guilty, far from being entered at an early stage, came after the commencement of his trial and immediately following evidence being given by his daughter as to his exclusive operation of the computer on which the images were found.  He was therefore not entitled to any significant reduction in sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea.  
132In attempting to draw comparisons between cases in this fashion, it is necessary to bear in mind the importance of considering the entirety of the circumstances which resulted in a particular sentence being imposed in a particular case.  The two matters to which I have referred, and which differentiate the present case from those upon which the applicant relied, serve to demonstrate that care must be taken when engaging in comparative exercises of this kind (see for example Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 per Campbell JA at [2] and Rothman J at [34];  R v Hili;  R v Jones [2010] HCA 45;  242 CLR 520 at [53] - [56]).     
133It is correct, as counsel submitted, that the applicant's commission of the child pornography offence did not involve (as all of his previous offending did) actual sexual interference with children.  However, that does not lead to a conclusion that an offence of possessing child pornography is not serious.  Persons such as the applicant, by choosing to possess such material, necessarily instigate its production and distribution.  Both the production and distribution of child pornography can involve direct child abuse in one form or another (see R v Stroempl (1995) 105 CCC (3d) 187, cited in R v Gent (supra)).  
134Viewed in this way, the possession of such material is an important contributing element to the general problem which exists in the community arising from the creation and distribution of child pornography.  Those who possess such material necessarily play a pivotal role in creating a market for it.  For this reason, as well as a number of others, it has been recognised that general deterrence is a significant consideration in matters of this nature (see Gent (supra) at [68] per Johnson J; see also Minehan (supra) at [97] per R A Hulme J).  
135The applicant's commission of the child pornography offence is the most recent in a pattern of offending which commenced some years ago.  As I have expressly acknowledged, unlike his previous offending, it did not involve the physical sexual interference with children.  However its commission, particularly at a time when the offender was still on parole for the previous offences, reflects a degree of recidivism as far as his criminal sexual interest in children is concerned.  Persons who yield to such an interest, particularly if they have a history of doing so in one form or another, should expect significant punishment.
136For these reasons, and notwithstanding the identified errors on the part of the sentencing judge, I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed.  
137For the same reasons, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed upon the applicant in respect of the child pornography offence is manifestly excessive.  
138Accordingly, this ground is not made out.    
CONCLUSION139I propose the following orders in each case:
(i) extend the time in which to file a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal;
(ii) grant leave to appeal;
(iii) dismiss the appeal.

		15 November 2012",2012-11-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760485,"R v MEYN, John Michael (No 1) [2012] NSWSC 1441","EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Prior to the empanelment of the jury, senior counsel for the accused, Mr Chapple SC, advised the Court of an objection to the tender of a recording of an electronically recorded interview with his client (referred to as the ""ERISP"", i.e. an electronically recorded interview with a suspected person). 

2I heard evidence and submissions concerning that objection on Tuesday 20 November 2012 and this morning, Wednesday 21 November 2012. It is proposed to empanel the jury on Thursday 22 November 2012. 

3The accused has already been arraigned on a charge that on 8 April 2011, he did murder Yvette Rathbone. Ms Rathbone is his former de facto and mother of his children. He has pleaded not guilty to that charge, and it is anticipated he will maintain that plea when he is arraigned before a jury. 

4The Crown case is that the accused bashed and strangled Ms Rathbone sometime between 9.30am and 12.50pm on 8 April 2011. He was arrested at a ""lookout"" at Glenbrook National Park with his children at approximately 4.45pm on 8 April 2011. He was transported to Penrith Police Station. He was interviewed by the police in a number of sessions commencing at 7.36pm on 8 April 2011 and concluding at 3.23am on 9 April 2011. The total time he was interviewed by the police was said to be two hours nineteen minutes, and the total time of the breaks between the interview sections was said to be five hours and twenty-nine minutes.

Section 138 of the Evidence Act and the proposed basis for rejection

5Mr Chapple SC seeks the rejection of the entirety of the ERISP under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. It provides: 
""Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence

(1)   Evidence that was obtained:

   (a)   improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

   (b)   in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2)   Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:

   (a)   did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

   (b)   made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3)   Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

   (a)   the probative value of the evidence, and

   (b)   the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

   (c)   the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

   (d)   the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

   (e)   whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

   (f)   whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

   (g)   whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

   (h)   the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.""

6The onus of establishing impropriety under s 138(1) rests upon the party seeking the exclusion, which in this case is the accused. If impropriety is established, the burden of persuasion then falls upon the party seeking the admission of the evidence, which in this case is the Crown (see Robinson v Woolworths Ltd [2005] NSWCCA 426; 64 NSWLR 612 at [33] per Basten JA; and Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; 83 ALJR 494 at [28] per French CJ). 

7In discussing the concept of impropriety in Robinson, Basten JA at [28] stated three propositions, the first two of which were:
""It follows that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following propositions. First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as the 'minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement'. Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene those standards in some minor respects; it must be 'quite inconsistent with' or 'clearly inconsistent' with those standards.""

8Later, at [36] his Honour stated:
""In circumstances where there is no unlawfulness on the part of any law enforcement officer, mere doubts about the desirability or appropriateness of particular conduct would not be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety.""

Then his Honour continued at [37]:
""Where no relevant pre-existing standard has been breached, it should be a rare case in which impropriety would lead to exclusion.""

9In announcing the basis for the challenge of the admission to the ERISP, Mr Chapple SC contended that the ERISP was obtained in consequence of impropriety for the purposes of s 138(1). He submitted that:
""[T]he police did not establish at the outset of the recorded interview and/or continued to do so during the course of the interview whether the accused was competent to be interviewed and to continue to be interviewed and that the accused was consenting and continued to consent voluntarily to be interviewed.""

10He submitted further that:
""[T]he accused was not competent or consenting to be interviewed voluntarily because of intoxication and/or fatigue.""

11As I will explain, in his final submissions, Mr Chapple SC's submissions were principally focussed on the final part of the ERISP that was conducted from 2.21am to 3.23am on 9 April 2011. 

The accused's arrest until 8.56pm

12On the voir dire the Crown tendered the video recording of the interview. I was invited by both counsel to view it and they were content for me to do so in chambers. The Crown also led evidence from the two interviewing police, Detective Sergeant Bradley Element and Senior Constable Chang, the relevant custody manager responsible for the accused, Sergeant Davis, and two officers who attended the scene of the accused's arrest, Detective Senior Constable Lothian and Detective Sergeant John William Fokes. I note that Senior Constable Chang also attended at that scene. The accused also gave evidence on the voir dire. 

13In light of the test posed by s 138 and the manner in which the allegation of impropriety was framed, it is important to note the evidence as to the accused's physical and mental state as it was known or ought to have been known by the interviewing officers. 

14Around 4.45-4.50pm on 8 April 2011, Detective Senior Constable Lothian arrested the accused at the lookout in Glenbrook National Park. He spoke with him and handcuffed him at the scene. In his evidence in chief, Detective Senior Constable Lothian was asked about any opinion he had formed about whether the accused had been drinking. He stated that he believed the accused was ""mildly intoxicated"". He added that what made him form that view was that the accused was ""quiet, a bit withdrawn, distant"". He added that the accused asked him questions and that they had a ""fairly normal conversation"". 

15In cross examination, Detective Senior Constable Lothian was asked whether there was any necessity for him to convey his opinion about the state of the accused's intoxication to the officers responsible for his custody at Penrith Police Station. His answer was that the accused was ""mildly intoxicated"" and that ""if he was intoxicated to the point where his health was in question or something like that I would have communicated that"". 

16There was also evidence that at the lookout the accused was in possession of some beer. There were a few empty bottles at the scene but Detective Senior Constable Lothian also noticed a number of bottles were missing from six-packs that were found there. This was confirmed by photographs taken by Detective Sergeant Fokes at the scene. 

17At around 6.02pm, a constable from Penrith Police Station recorded entries in a document entitled ""Custody Management Record"". Under the heading ""Brief Assessment"" and against the question whether the person complained of, or whether he observed any sign of, intoxication are the words ""moderately effected [sic]"". In answer to the question ""[i]s the person's behaviour suggestive of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol"", there is recorded the comment ""alcohol 8 beers first about 10.30am"".

18Sergeant Davis was the custody manager at the Penrith Police Station. Around this time, i.e. 6pm, he read to the accused a pro forma statement setting out his rights under Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (""LEPRA Act""). He asked the accused if he understood what was read to him. He recorded the accused as having said ""yes"". He also asked the accused whether there was anyone he would like the police to contact. He recorded the accused as having said ""no"". He asked the accused if he had any questions in relation to his rights and the accused said ""no"". The accused signed the form acknowledging his receipt of the pro forma statement.

19Sergeant Davis was an officer of 22 years experience. He was asked whether he was able to form a view as to whether at this point the accused was intoxicated. He stated that he ""formed the opinion he was moderately affected by alcohol"". Sergeant Davis explained this as meaning that:
""He still had all his functions, he was able to stand unassisted, not leaning against the custody counter. When I asked him questions he appeared to be able to process that information and his answers were considered. His speech wasn't affected. He made a statement at the time that he had been drinking beer during the day in answer to the questions asked as a standard part of dealing with him.""

20In cross examination, Sergeant Davis stated that the factors that suggested the moderate affectation by alcohol were first that he could smell alcohol and, second, the answers that had been given by the accused concerning his alcohol consumption as recorded in the custody record. 

21At around 7.20pm there was a conversation between Detective Sergeant Element and the accused at which Senior Constable Chang was present. Detective Sergeant Element had noticed that the accused appeared to be upset and to have been crying. He described his eyes as red and watery and his voice as seeming slightly shaky. Detective Sergeant Element recalled the conversation that ensued as follows:
I said: ""John, my name is Detective Sergeant Brad Element and this is Detective Stuart Chang. We are going to speak to you further about your relationship with Yvette and the circumstances surrounding her death today.""

He said, ""Yep. Where are my kids?""

I said, ""I believe they are at the police station.""

He said, ""Ok.""

I said, ""I understand you have had a couple of beers before the police located you. Do you feel intoxicated now?""

He said, ""No, I just feel like shit.""

22Detective Sergeant Element noted that ""[a]s he said this tears began to well in his eyes"". Detective Sergeant Element said that he added:
""I can't understand what you are going through now. We do intend to speak to you formally about this and that will be recorded on CDs. I will make those arrangements shortly.""

Also at this time the accused was offered a meal but declined it.

23In his evidence on the voir dire Detective Sergeant Element stated that at this point his opinion was that the accused was ""not suffering from intoxication or if at all to a very small degree"". At that time Detective Sergeant Element had fourteen years of experience in the Police Force. Senior Constable Chang's observation was ""that there wasn't any signs of intoxication"". Senior Constable Chang was also an experienced police officer. 

24The ERISP commenced at 7.36pm. After taking his initial details, Detective Sergeant Element asked questions of the accused as to whether any threat or promise had been held out to him. The accused stated that he was unsure what was going on. At one point he states that he has not obtained any legal advice. Detective Sergeant Element then asked the accused whether he wished to obtain legal advice. The accused stated, ""Maybe I should, yeah."" Detective Sergeant Element then stated that the interview is being suspended, that he will be returned to the charge room and that the custody manager, Sergeant Davis, will assist him in making contact with a legal representative. The interview was then suspended.

25The custody record contains an entry that at around 7.50pm the accused requested to contact a solicitor and was given the use of a telephone and telephone book. The entry records that he declined the use of either and that he stated, ""Who will I call, do you have a solicitor?"" and then said, ""I'll do the interview, won't make any difference anyway"". 

26In his evidence, the accused said that Sergeant Davies had given him one contact which he had rung but he only obtained an answering machine. He said that he thought to himself that it was late and that was why no one was answering. He said that he thought to himself, ""I was just over the day so I basically said, 'I'll do your interview'"". 

27The ERISP resumed at 7.54pm. It recorded the accused's agreement to continue without him contacting a solicitor. The accused was reminded of his right not to say anything and how his answers could be used in evidence against him. The accused stated that he understood that. From that point until 8.56pm the accused was questioned about various matters concerning his relationship with the deceased and the events surrounding her death. 

28In their statements Detective Sergeant Element and Senior Constable Chang say that there was a conversation with the accused shortly after the interview was suspended. They stated Detective Sergeant Element told him:
""We are going to apply for a warrant which will authorise us to keep you in custody longer than four hours. You can talk to the Magistrate about that if you like.""

29They stated the accused said ""no"". Detective Sergeant Element then said, ""Take this opportunity to have a break. Do you want to have that dinner now?"" And the accused said ""no"". 

30It is appropriate at this point to note my observations about the accused's presentation during the ERISP from 7.36pm to 8.56pm. Generally, the accused was passive and quiet. His speech was low in volume but not slurred. He was attentive and his answers were responsive. At particular points he was emotional and placed his head in his hands. However, the topic of the questioning was the death of his ex-girlfriend and mother of his children and the suggestion that he was somehow involved. His emotional responses were, in that sense, appropriate and were not suggestive of him being in some way incompetent, fatigued or intoxicated. Instead, they were entirely consistent with what would be expected to be the emotional impact of those events upon him.

31At this point I note the accused's evidence as to his physical state at this time. The accused's evidence was that he did not eat anything on 7 April 2011. He said that from 7.45pm on 7 April 2011 until when he went to sleep at around 3am on 8 April 2011, he drank between ""11 and 13 beers"". He said he woke up at 6.30am on 8 April 2011, commenced consuming alcohol from 8am and continued to do so until 10am. He said he drank a further ""five to seven"" beers. He said he ate a chicken roll around 9.30am but did not eat anything else that day. He said sometime between midday and 1pm he purchased alcohol at a hotel in Lapstone. He said from that time until the time he was arrested at the lookout in the National Park, he consumed another ""six to seven"" beers. 

32This account was strongly challenged in cross examination by the Crown Prosecutor. It was suggested that the accused had exaggerated his level of alcohol consumption. The Crown Prosecutor pointed to a number of aspects of his conduct between 11am and 1.30pm which were said to be inconsistent with his being well affected by alcohol. It was also suggested his account was inconsistent with what he stated in his ERISP. 

33I accept that the accused consumed a substantial amount of alcohol between the evening of 7 April 2011 and the afternoon of 8 April 2011, although I am not persuaded that it was as much as he stated. Moreover, as at the start of the ERISP I am not satisfied that he was displaying any obvious signs of alcohol intoxication. In fact, to the contrary, to any reasonable observer during that part of the ERISP, the accused appeared to understand what was occurring and appeared to be in a position to make an informed decision to agree to be interviewed. This is exemplified by the passage in which he stated he did not understand what was going on and that he wanted to seek legal advice, which then led to the suspension of the interview. 

34I note that the accused was asked in chief why he wanted to continue, even though he could not contact a solicitor. He stated:
""A. The main reason why I entered into this interview was because I thought it would help me later on trying to be cooperative as much as I could and supply what I could remember at that stage.

...

Q. You are not suggesting a police officer said -
A. No.

Q - this will help you or anything like that?
A. No.""

35This evidence is completely consistent with the accused having made his own assessment about whether he would continue with the interview and his assessment being a rational one.

36In the end result, at the time of his arrest, Detective Senior Constable Lothian formed the view that the accused was mildly intoxicated. Sergeant Davis formed the same view at 6pm. As at 7.20pm, Detective Sergeant Element had specifically discussed with the accused his ability to participate in the interview and he had confirmed that he could. I accept Detective Sergeant Element's evidence and that of Senior Constable Chang that nothing in the accused's presentation during this period of the interview from 7.36pm to 8.56pm suggested to the contrary. Their evidence is strongly supported by viewing the ERISP. It reveals the accused unsure of what was going on at first and then, having had matters explained to him, taking the opportunity to consider whether he wanted to seek legal advice. He then decided he wanted to continue in the absence of legal advice and responded appropriately to the questions posed. 

8.56pm to 12.43am

37At some point prior to the break at 8.56pm, Sergeant Davis entered the interview room and advised those present, ""20 minutes on investigation time"". This conveyed to the investigating officers that if they wished to continue questioning the accused they would need to obtain a warrant under Part 9 of the LEPRA Act. After the accused was returned to the holding cell, they sought to obtain that warrant. There were various logistical difficulties in doing so. It was not obtained until 12.10am. The warrant authorised the accused's detention for four hours, although Detective Sergeant Element and Senior Constable Chang were of the belief that time did not run if the accused was resting. 

38The custody records contain four entries between 8.56pm and 11.50pm recording observations of the accused in his cell. He is recorded as sleeping at 9.54pm and 10.34pm. At 10.58pm he is recorded as ""woke and rolled over"". At 11.50pm, he is recorded as ""woken and went back to sleep"".

39In their statements, both Detective Sergeant Element and Senior Constable Chang said that at about 12.31am they went to the custody area and saw the accused asleep in the dock area. Senior Constable Chang said the accused was woken but not by whom. The accused's evidence about this event was as follows:
""Q. In the holding cell, did you sleep?
A. No, I probably lay down for the whole time from what I can recall, but I didn't sleep the whole - from start when I was put in there to when I was called again. I may have had a slight nod off for a few minutes, I can't say exactly.

Q. When you say you lay down, there is facility to lie on, like a bed?
A. It is not a cushioned bed, but it is like a slab or something, a bench.

Q. Did you say you were laying down most of the time or all of the time?
A. Pretty much all the time, just about all the time, yeah.

Q. Now what happened, in your memory, to cause you to go from the holding cell to the interview again? Could you just cast your mind back to that. This is the second break we are speaking about here at page 30. Do you remember anyone coming for you?
A. This whole interview thing was pretty blurry, but I do recall the door opening and I think it was Mr Element saying that he would like to ask - continue with the interview, to get my consent. I am not sure exactly what he said.

Q. Did you say anything to that?
A. No, I just thought that - yeah I thought he was, you know, basically telling me, I thought I was obliged to do it.

Q. Can you remember being told in the interview the opposite, that you didn't have to say anything?
A. During the interview? 

Q. Yes?
A. Yes, I do recall him saying throughout the interview, yeah.

Q. You kept being interviewed?
A. Yes, I did.

Q. Why did you do that?
A. I had already entered into the interview so I thought I would continue through it."" (emphasis added)

40This evidence suggests that the accused did obtain some sleep during the break between 8.56pm and being roused again at 12.30am, although the amount is difficult to gauge. The observations in the custody record suggest that he obtained more sleep than he indicated in these answers. Sometimes people's ability to estimate how long they have been asleep for can be unreliable. These answers also suggest that, in fact, Detective Sergeant Element, or perhaps Senior Constable Chang, asked the accused for his consent to be interviewed again before he was returned to the interview room. 

41The ERISP resumes again at 12.31am. Detective Sergeant Element is recorded as reciting that the accused had a ""bit of a snooze"", and the accused had been shown ""a document"", which I infer was a reference to the detention warrant. The accused is again cautioned and indicates that he understands by nodding his head. I note at this point the accused has his head in his hands. The accused then mentions he is ""cold"" and utters the word ""sleep"". Detective Sergeant Element does not appear to respond to the word ""sleep"". It appears he did not hear that word uttered. Efforts were then undertaken to obtain a blanket for the accused. 

42The questioning proceeds for about ten minutes or so before the accused is asked whether he can recall speaking to the custody manager when he arrived at the station. In response to that question, he says he was ""probably a bit drunk"" and then says ""I feel drunk"". He is asked if he knows how many beers he had and he says ""no"".

43The questioning then continues as follows:
""Q376. All right. Do you feel competent to be able to continue the interview?
A. Not really.

Q377. Not really, all right. Well, in that case we'll, we'll stop the interview again there and make some arrangements for you to have a - have some time out to have a bit of a sleep. Then we might come back and speak to you again later on. Ok. The time's 12.42. All right. I'm going to suspend the interview now, John, just, on the basis that you said you're not really feeling up to the interview at this stage. Ok. And I understand you, you were having a bit of a sleep when we woke you up to come back in here. So, mate, we'll put you back in the charge room, let you have a bit more of a break and we'll come back and see you a bit later on. Ok.""

The interview was then suspended. 

44Both Detective Sergeant Element and Senior Constable Chang stated that they did not believe the accused's answer to the extent he stated that at this point in time he was drunk. I accept that evidence as recounting a genuine belief based on proper and reasonable grounds. That is so because the accused did not appear to be drunk at any time earlier when he was interviewed, and he had not consumed alcohol since. Nevertheless, it is obvious from the ERISP that the accused was in this portion of the interview fatigued, and it seems most likely that he was hung over. He appeared tired, and he had his head in his hands. I should add that the tone of Detective Sergeant Element's voice when he suspended the interview was not reluctant or begrudging. 

45I will return to the question of whether the police should have left the accused to sleep in his cell for the balance of the night. At this point I note that, prior to the resumption of the interview, the accused appeared to indicate a willingness to continue and certainly his response to the cautions indicated a willingness as well. 

46Contrary to the premise of the submission in support of the rejection of the ERISP, the interviewing police did monitor his state and when the accused indicated he was drunk they suspended the interview. As I stated, the accused was displaying signs of fatigue at this point. Had this section of the interview continued much longer with him in that state then it might have warranted rejection, but it did not. It was obvious the police wanted to pursue their investigations as quickly as possible, but they did apply limits to themselves in doing so.

12.43am to 3.22am

47There is no specific entry in the custody record containing any observation of the accused between 12.43am and when the interview resumed again at 2.21am. Sergeant Davis stated that he observed the accused in his holding cell and he appeared to be asleep. The accused stated:
""A. ... [m]y whole recollection of being in the holding cell I was just laying down, I think, on my back. At the time I had a blanket, I had it covered over my head.

...

Q. Did you sleep at all?
A. Might have, might have dozed off once or twice I can't remember, but I don't recall sleeping throughout the whole duration of any of the breaks.""

48At some point prior to 2.21am, Detective Sergeant Element decided that the accused would be woken and an attempt would be made to recommence the interview. Senior Constable Chang said that he woke him from his sleep. He said that he said something to the effect, ""Are you right to come back into the interview room now?"" but does not believe that he told the accused that he did not have to come back. The accused denied this conversation. Senior Constable Chang's recollection of that conversation did not strike me as particularly strong, and it was not referred to in that part of the ERISP that followed. I am not prepared to find that a conversation in those terms occurred. 

49The recorded interview resumes again at 2.21am. Shortly after it commences Detective Sergeant Element stated:
""Q384. Ok. All right, do you agree that a couple of hours ago we were in this room and you indicated that you, you needed to have a break and we suspended the interview again and took you out, and I think you've had a bit of a sleep since then?

A. When, it's been a couple of hours, has it? 

Q385. Yeah, nearly two hours.""

50These answers suggest to me that the accused had had some sleep since the suspension of the interview at 12.43am and that is why he had lost track of time. This is confirmed by my observations of his physical state during this part of the ERISP, which I will outline shortly. 

51After these questions, the accused is then cautioned and nods to confirm his understanding of what is conveyed by the caution. The questioning then continues until the interview is complete at around 3.22am. Just prior to its completion, Sergeant Davis returns. Sergeant Davis asks a series of questions about the conduct of the interview. In question 619 he asked: ""Have you made this recording of your own free will?"", and the accused responded, ""Yes"". Q621 records Sergeant Davis asking, ""Do you have any complaints to make about the manner in which you were interviewed here?"" The accused answered, ""No.""

52In his evidence, the accused stated that during this portion of the interview he was ""so tired"" and he ""basically wanted the interview to stop"". He was asked as follows:
""Q. Was there any reason why you didn't raise this with Mr Davis?
A. Yes, because it seemed like if I answered no to any of these questions, Mr Element would come back in and I would have to start all over again. Like I said, I was - I just wanted to be left alone, yeah.

Q. What made you think it would start all over again?
A. Well, I was just confused about what was going on. I know I voluntarily did enter into the interview. It was kind of a bit over me head. I'm not sure how long it was going to go for, it was just getting a bit too much for me.""

53The submissions of counsel about the accused's presentation during this part of the ERISP differed sharply. Mr Chapple SC submitted that the accused was obviously fatigued, and it should have been apparent to the interviewing officers that a further inquiry was required of him as to whether he was still in the state he claimed to have been in at 12.40am. 

54The Crown Prosecutor contended the accused was alert and responsive. He submitted that what is most telling was the accused's ability to recount details during this portion of the ERISP which were reliable, in that they were established by other evidence or that they were otherwise quite detailed. An example of the former was said to be the accused's recall of how the deceased was dressed when he left her at the scene of her death, and an example of the latter was said to be his ability to recount an earlier incident in which the deceased damaged his car and he provided the address of a witness. 

55I have reviewed this portion of the ERISP a number of times. Generally, I accept the Crown's characterisation of the accused's demeanour during this portion of the ERISP. In my view, he presents in a very similar fashion to that part which occurred between 7.36pm and 8.56pm on the previous evening. He is passive but responsive. He appears to follow the questioning. His answers are quiet in volume but appropriate. He maintains a recall of most of the details. On a few occasions he is emotional but that is completely explicable by reference to the subject matter. At one point he inquires about his children. To a reasonable observer he appears to have improved from his presentation at around 12.40am. That would appear to have been the effect of additional sleep and the passage of time. In short, his demeanour and behaviour during this part of the ERISP did not suggest any lack of competence or proper consent to the interview on his part.

Consideration

56In light of the above, it is appropriate to return to the suggested impropriety on the part of the interviewing officers, bearing in mind the statements of Basten JA in Robinson referred to above (at [7] to [8]). 

57In submissions Mr Chapple SC pointed to the accused's underlying physical state throughout the evening of 8 April 2011 and into the early hours of 9 April 2011. He contended the accused had, prior to then, consumed a significant amount of alcohol, had barely eaten for two days, was fatigued and had been through an emotionally traumatic set of circumstances involving the death of Ms Rathbone and his taking of the children to a lookout. 

58I have already made findings on those matters. To confirm, I accept that the accused had consumed a significant amount of alcohol but not the amount he claimed and not so much that he presented any obvious signs of intoxication from around 7.30pm on 8 April 2011. I accept the accused was fatigued and probably emotionally drained but not to such a significant degree that it affected his competency for that part of the ERISP that went from 7.36pm to 8.56pm on 8 April 2011 and, with the benefit of additional rest, went from 2.21am to 3.32am on 9 April 2011. 

59Mr Chapple SC identified the relevant impropriety as being the conduct of the interviewing officers in being reckless as to the accused's true physical state throughout the course of the interview and especially from 2.21am. He pointed to the failure of Detective Sergeant Element, prior to the first stage of the interview, to inquire of the custody records and custody officers. This would have revealed his level of alcohol consumption of around ""seven to eight beers"". I do not regard Detective Sergeant Element's omission to take that step as any relevant failure, much less a reckless one. He had spoken to the accused about his ability to participate at 7.20pm. Detective Sergeant Element had made his own observations as to the accused's physical state. Those observations were completely consistent with the accused's presentation during that part of the ERISP which occurred from 7.31 to 8.56pm, especially the accused's request to obtain legal advice. 

60In relation to the period after 2.21am, Mr Chapple SC submitted that Detective Sergeant Element's failure to enquire of the accused as to his physical state was improper, bearing in mind what the accused stated at around 12.40am, namely, that he was drunk.

61Again, I do not regard Detective Sergeant Element's omission to take that step as a relevant failure, much less a reckless one. As at 2.21am Detective Sergeant Element was aware the accused had not consumed alcohol for some hours and had been offered food but refused it. Detective Sergeant Element had a reasonable belief that the accused had the opportunity to sleep and had taken advantage of that opportunity. He cautioned the accused for at least a third time at the commencement of this part of the ERISP. The accused's presentation during this part of the ERISP indicated something of a revival since the session that had commenced at 12.31am. Detective Sergeant Element was aware that on two previous occasions the accused had indicated some impediment to his proceeding, namely, the need to obtain legal advice and the claim that he was drunk. On both occasions the interview was suspended without difficulty. Provided that the accused's presentation did not suggest he could not speak up for himself about such an impediment, Detective Sergeant Element was entitled to proceed on the basis that there was no such impediment. It follows from my earlier findings that there was nothing in his presentation that suggested that. 

62The remaining aspect of Mr Chapple SC's contention concerns the decision by Detective Sergeant Element to recommence the interview firstly at 12.31am and then again at 2.21am. He correctly submitted that the decision to wake or rouse the accused was made by Detective Sergeant Element around those times. He submits that there was no difficulty with Detective Sergeant Element waiting until the morning or when the accused had woken up, given the understanding that he had that the time provided by the detention warrant would be suspended while the accused was sleeping. 

63When he was asked about this, Detective Sergeant Element stated as follows:
""Q. There was no earthly reason, I suggest, why you couldn't have left him in a cell and resumed speaking with him during the daylight hours, for example?
A.Other than the fact, as I mentioned before trying to minimise the time people are in police custody rather than having him sleeping all night and then waiting at some stage during the morning for the police to return to interview him.""

64This answer amounts to no more than a statement that the exigencies of the investigation warranted completing the interview as soon as possible. While this is not much of a justification for waking or rousing the accused, it also does not by itself warrant a characterisation that what occurred was improper. 

65The approach stated by Basten JA in Robinson is not satisfied by merely pointing out, with the benefit of hindsight, that some steps that were not taken would have been more fair to the accused than the course that was adopted. In this case, the other aspects of the police conduct that night do not justify a conclusion that overall there was any impropriety. The accused was repeatedly cautioned, and bona fide assessments of his physical and mental competence to undertake the interview were made. The accused was given and took the opportunity to sleep. Whenever a doubt was raised by him as to his ability or willingness to continue with the interview, the interview was suspended. The questioning did not proceed in the face of any manifest deficiency in the accused affecting his ability to participate. 

66In deciding that the accused was to be woken, Detective Sergeant Element was not determining to pursue the interview at all costs. Instead, he was only determining to pursue it if the accused was competent and able to do so. Those decisions, considered in that context, would not meet the test of impropriety for the purpose of s 138(1). 

67Accordingly, I do not accept that the threshold of s 138(1) has been established. It follows that I reject the challenge to the tender of the ERISP.

2760487,R v Mitchell [2012] NSWSC 1404,"Judgment

1HER HONOUR: At about 10am on Tuesday, 3 January 2012, the deceased, John Foss, was riding his motorised bicycle south on Coolamon Scenic Drive, Mullumbimby, when he was deliberately hit from behind by the accused, James Mitchell, who was driving a white Toyota Hiace van. 

2The deceased was riding to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting which was scheduled to commence at 10.30am having left his home at Ocean Shores approximately four kilometres from the site of the collision. The deceased and Mr Mitchell were both members of Alcoholics Anonymous and regularly attended meetings in the area.

3The deceased was aged 60 at the time of his death. At autopsy an external examination revealed an extensive pattern of abrasions typical of ground impact abrasions from a rough road surface. A distinctive mark extending over an area of 70mm x 60mm on his left cheek and consisting of a series of distinctive straight lines joining to form obtuse angles and rectangles was also noted. A crime scene officer who examined the van and the body of the deceased following autopsy determined that the tyre on the front nearside of the van corresponded in pattern and in size with the mark on the deceased's face.

4An internal examination exposed severe blunt force trauma to the chest with multiple rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, pulmonary lacerations and an accumulation of blood and air in the chest cavity. In Professor Lyons' opinion, this pattern of injuries would have rapidly and inevitably led to death. The toxicology results were negative for alcohol and prohibited drugs. 

5On 4 January 2012 Mr Mitchell was charged with the murder of the deceased and, in the alternative, with one count of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900.

6With the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and with leave granted under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the trial was listed to proceed without a jury. 

7On 19 November 2012 Mr Mitchell was arraigned before me on the charge of murder only. He pleaded not guilty to that charge on the ground of mental illness as provided for in s 22(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""). 

8The sole issue at trial was whether Mr Mitchell had discharged the onus of establishing that he should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Act. This is sometimes referred to as a special verdict. The Crown did not seek to persuade me that a special verdict ought not be entered in this case.

9The defence of mental ilness is made out if I am satisfied that, more probably than not, at the time of the killing Mr Mitchell was suffering from a mental illness such that he did not know that it was wrong to deliberately drive his van at or into the deceased. This is the act that caused the death of the deceased, an issue about which there was no disagreement and which, on the evidence, I am satisfied is established beyond reasonable doubt. In deciding whether a special verdict ought be entered I am obliged to have regard to the legal and practical consequences of a finding that he is not guilty of murder on the grounds of mental illness. I am not, however, required to decide whether the requisite intent for the offence of murder, that is, either an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, is proved (R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 62 NSWLR 490). That question only arises if I do not find that the defence of mental illness is established. For the reasons that follow, that issue does not arise in this case. 

10By consent, and without objection, the Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts; a number of witness statements from people who had observed changes in Mr Mitchell's behaviour in the weeks and months before the deceased's death; the results of the police investigation including scientific testing of the van and the bicycle; the post mortem report of Professor Lyons; transcripts of recorded conversations between police and Mr Mitchell; and a report from Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, dated 9 June 2012. Included in the materials tendered by the Crown was a report obtained by Mr Mitchell's solicitor from Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, dated 12 March 2012 and a supplementary report from him dated 19 November 2012.

11The reports from both consultant psychiatrists reflect their shared opinion that at the time of the collision Mr Mitchell was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral consequences of his behaviour. 

12No oral evidence was called in the proceedings.

The collision

13Coolamon Scenic Drive is a rural road in Mullumbimby with no lane marking, oriented generally in a north-south direction. The roadway on approach to the collision site for vehicles travelling south was flat and straight, opening into a tight right-hand bend. Synott's Lane intersects with Coolamon Scenic Drive, 100 metres north of the collision site.

14Gary Scrimshaw was stationary at that intersection intending to turn left to travel south into Coolamon Scenic Drive when he saw a cyclist (who later proved to be the deceased) cross through the intersection heading south. Mr Scrimshaw's son, Jason, was a passenger in the car. They both said that the cyclist was pedalling as well as using the engine on the bicycle. As their car commenced to turn left a vehicle, which I am satisfied was being driven by Mr Mitchell, also passed through the intersection in the same direction as the deceased. They both remarked at the time that the van was travelling at a fairly high speed, in the sense that it was travelling faster than cars usually travel along that piece of roadway. After they completed the left-hand turn both the bicycle and the van were out of sight. As they ascended a slight rise, Jason could see Mr Mitchell's van about 100 metres in the distance accelerating around the right-hand bend under speed. As the van cleared the bend Jason saw the deceased's body on the left-hand side of the road.

15Mr Scrimshaw stopped his car and notified 000. His son administered CPR. As Jason approached the deceased he saw the white van through the trees in the distance still travelling at a high speed. 

16The deceased was unconscious and was bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth. Jason noticed what appeared to him to be a tyre mark across the deceased's face. He also noticed that he had a large laceration to his upper left arm. The deceased was gasping for air and stopped breathing five times before the ambulance arrived. On each occasion Jason was able to revive him. CPR was maintained by ambulance officers upon their arrival twenty minutes later until a second ambulance arrived. The deceased was thereafter transferred to hospital. He died shortly after arrival. 

17A crash investigation officer attended the collision site shortly after midday at which time the following observations were made:

The weather was fine and sunny and the bitumen road surface was dry and appeared to be in a good state of repair; 
A posted speed limit of 100 km per hour applied; 
A single tyre scuff mark (consistent with a bicycle tyre) was noted in the south bound lane, about 1.25 metres in length. It was accompanied by a series of scrape marks between 0.3 and 2 metres in length, also within the single southbound lane; 
A parallel set of tyre braking skid marks were noted within the southbound lane between 6.35 and 8.55 metres in length. A spoke from a bicycle wheel was located a short distance south of the end of those skid marks; and 
A bicycle was located 1.75 metres down an embankment on the eastern side of the roadway, 33 metres from the scuff mark. It had sustained major damage to the rear wheel and the rear section of the frame.

Sighting of the white van

18Just before midday on 3 January 2012 Mr Mitchell purchased a new windscreen from Southside Auto Wreckers at Quarry Road, South Murwillumbah. Later that morning he was observed by an off duty policeman and a civilian driving his van in Murwillumbah without a windscreen. This information was conveyed to police the following day after police issued a press release calling for information which might assist in identifying the driver of the van involved in the fatality. 

19On 4 January 2012 Marcus Peace attended Lismore police station and provided police with information supporting his belief that Mr Mitchell was responsible for the deceased's death, consistent with what Mr Peace described as the abusive and threatening behaviour Mr Mitchell had directed at the deceased over preceding months.

The arrest of Mr Mitchell and examination of his van

20On 4 January 2012 police attended Mr Mitchell's home where he was observed to be repairing the front of the van. When police approached he ran away and was arrested in nearby bush. 

21On examining the van, police identified an area of damage on the front panel which was partially filled with a pink putty-like substance with some larger drops of putty on the bull bar and on the front of the van. The front of the van and the replacement front windscreen were covered in white dust, consistent with having recently been sanded. Police were unable to find the original windscreen. Areas of brown staining on the offside of the front panel, the front nearside headlight casing and front nearside door of the vehicle were noted with an obvious bloodstain on the offside corner of the front panel above the headlight. Subsequent testing confirmed the deceased's blood in a number of discrete areas on the front bumper bar and bull bar towards the underneath nearside headlight and front guard. When police examined the undercarriage of the van, paint impact damage was noted in a number of places in the front section of the van. There was no evidence of any mechanical defect that might have contributed to the collision.

22On examination the deceased's bicycle had sustained impact damage on the rear tyre with the inner tube separating from the rim. The rim and spokes were bent and broken in places and the rear fender was bent. There was paint damage and scrape marks to the mounting plate as well as to the rear fender. The mounting plate for the rear reflector was damaged and the reflector was missing. 

Interviews with Mr Mitchell

23Mr Mitchell was interviewed by police following his arrest on 4 January 2012. In the first interview he gave a superficially coherent account of his movements the previous day. Although he admitted driving his van in the area of the collision site, he denied hitting the deceased. He said that his windscreen was shattered and the front panel of his van damaged when he hit a wallaby. He said that he had obtained parts to repair his van. He said he knew the deceased and regarded himself as on reasonably friendly terms with him. He said he had never had an argument with him or spoken to any other members of Alcoholics Anonymous about him. He agreed that he knew where the deceased lived. 

24The interview concluded at 3.58pm. Police then informed Mr Mitchell that they had received information identifying what they described as ""trace evidence"" on his vehicle and that he would be charged with murder. In a conversation with the police immediately after the interview Mr Mitchell alleged that the deceased had raped his mother. He then agreed to participate in a second record of interview. 

25In the second interview Mr Mitchell made a number of allegations about the deceased and other members of Alcoholics Anonymous, including that the organisation was a refuge for members of the criminal underworld who preyed on vulnerable people and who committed serious criminal offences, including murder. He went on to allege that the deceased was a high ranking official in the organisation who had tried to have Mr Mitchell removed and that the deceased had intimidated him by placing a bullet in front of him at meetings which Mr Mitchell interpreted as a threat. 

26Mr Mitchell also repeated the allegation that the deceased had sexually assaulted his mother (since deceased) in company with others and that they had forced him to have sex with his mother while being videotaped. He said his mother had refrained from telling him that she had been assaulted (by the deceased), ""possibly because of the outcome that's just arrived"". Police asked what that outcome was and he replied, ""Mr Foss' passing"".

27When he was asked if he had killed the deceased he said, ""Not that I know of"". When he was asked whether he was involved in a collision with the deceased's bicycle he said, ""No"". When asked whether he took matters into his own hands he said:
At this point I feel as though a lawyer would come in handy. I've had my piece. I'm not sure whether the blood on the front of my truck's anything to do with Mr Foss or any other injuries on the vehicle. What we do know, [is] that he was going to kill me and quite a few other people involved with the raping [of] my mother. 

Observations of Mr Mitchell's behaviour prior to the collision

28In the course of the police investigation, members of Alcoholics Anonymous were spoken to by police. With differing emphasis they each said that they had noticed a change in Mr Mitchell's behaviour in the six to nine months prior to the deceased's death.

29At the end of October and beginning of November 2011, Katherine Knight received a number of incoherent and incomprehensible text messages from Mr Mitchell, replete with overt sexual references and signed ""Ecquine"". (He told Dr Westmore in March 2012 that he intended to sign the text message ""Equine"" because he believed he was Napoleon's horse - a belief which he claimed had come to light in 2011. Four months later, he told Dr Nielssen that he was the reincarnation of Napoleon's horse. While he acknowledged that if another person had made that assertion he would consider it to be an absurd belief he was unable to recognise that his belief in equine reincarnation was bizarre.) 

30On 22 November 2011, Thierry Fossemalle received a number of text messages from Mr Mitchell issuing veiled threats of violence and alleging that the deceased had ""murdered"" him. He went on to claim, ""But as you can see I can't die"". 

31On 13 December 2011, after an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Mr Mitchell told Marcus Peace that he was waiting for ""Ian"" to come past on his bike so he could run him off the road because he and the deceased were running a prostitution ring at Monday night Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and they had guns. 

32In mid to late December, Mitchell Chambers rode his motorcycle to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at Bangalow. After the meeting, Mr Mitchell's business card was in his helmet. On the back of the card was written, ""It's funny watching your mother being raped when you're eight years old"".

33In late 2011 Mr Mitchell started telling Christopher Meyers that he had been sexually assaulted by his father and other men. He also said that he was psychic and had provided Queensland police with information about the location of a then missing person (Daniel Morecombe).

34On 30 December 2011, Mr Mitchell approached John Gough at a local hotel. Mr Mitchell and Mr Gough were acquaintances and all previous contact between them had been friendly. Mr Gough held out his hand to Mr Mitchell intending to shake it and wish him a happy New Year. Mr Mitchell punched Mr Gough in the right eye and repeatedly said, ""You raped my mother"".

35There is nothing in the evidence to give any credence at all to any of the allegations levelled at the deceased or at the organisation of which he was a member. I am satisfied that these thoughts are symptomatic of what was at that time an undiagnosed mental illness.

Mr Mitchell 's mental health prior to his arrest

36Various medical records pertaining to Mr Mitchell's physical and mental health prior to his arrest were made available to the consultant psychiatrists. They were not the subject of a separate tender, The records from Lismore and Tweed Heads hospitals record that Mr Mitchell had been admitted by police because of irrational behaviour on several occasions whilst affected by alcohol without any accompanying diagnosis of any psychotic illness. The date of the admissions are not noted although it would seem that the last contact with either of those hospitals was in 2007 after he was referred to Alcoholics Anonymous by community-based services. 

37Mr Mitchell informed Dr Nielssen that it was through his participation in the Alcoholics Anonymous program that he realised he had been treating depression and anxiety throughout his adult life with alcohol and cannabis, and that he used Panadeine to reduce the symptoms of pain associated with the abuse of alcohol. He denied ever taking amphetamines, heroin or cocaine or abusing other types of medication.

38Mr Mitchell informed the reporting psychiatrists that he began drinking alcohol at around the age of 14 and was drinking daily from about age 19 until joining Alcoholics Anonymous in 2005. He is currently aged 54. He told Dr Nielssen that he started using cannabis and alcohol a few weeks before the offence because he was distressed by his beliefs about the people around him.

39He reported a number of failed suicide attempts in his adult life but said he was afraid to seek hospitalisation because of the history of mental illness in his family. He reported that his sister suffers from a bipolar condition and he understood his brother has schizophrenia and two members of his extended family had committed suicide whilst suffering from mental illness. This information has not been independently verified. Although he has taken antidepressant medications on occasions, he has never been prescribed any psychotropic medication. He claimed that he had not experienced any of the typical auditory symptoms of a schizophrenia-type psychosis. He said, however, that he believed he had been hypnotised over the telephone. 

Mr Mitchell's mental health after his arrest

40Since being in custody, Mr Mitchell has been provisionally diagnosed with ""a schizoaffective disorder with concurrent episode mania with persecutory and grandiose delusions"". He is currently being treated with the anti-psychotic drug olanzapine with which he is apparently compliant. 

41Although there is no report from Justice Health as to his current functioning, the provisional diagnosis delivered after admission would appear to be consistent with the florid and delusional beliefs recorded within a week or so of his arrest, including that the blood splatter on his van was because he said police drugged him with sodium pentothal and tied him in the passenger seat while they murdered two people by running them down. He also said that he had a stent inserted on the right side of his head at the age of 21 by the police officer who arrested him in January 2012. He said the stent was to explode on New Year's Day but he prevented that happening by putting his head in a microwave. He said he was raped by the arresting police officer and made to give him oral sex. He said the police car was then driven at him. 

42I also received in evidence, without objection, statements from Mr Mitchell's niece and sister-in-law. They visited him in prison in January and February this year and detailed at length their conversations with him in which he expressed many of the delusional and outlandish beliefs recorded by the consultant psychiatrists in the course of their examinations in March and May. He also made other claims about the reasons for his remand which exemplified his disordered thinking. They both remarked that his behaviour was contrary to anything they had experienced in their past dealings with him. 

Psychiatric evidence
Dr Westmore 

43In March 2012 Dr Westmore examined Mr Mitchell in custody. He summarised his presentation as follows: 
Mr Mitchell presented as a man with long hair which was quite well kept. He was neat and tidy and pleasant and cooperative. He maintained good eye contact and he spoke spontaneously and expansively. His affect was flat and unresponsive, although I felt there was underlying anxiety. His mood state was subdued. His thought content reveals extensive delusional beliefs. He denies auditory hallucinations or ideas of reference, but he does believe that he has been hypnotised in the past when using the phone. He was generally alert and attentive.

44When asked about the offence Mr Mitchell said that he was convinced that he hit a kangaroo only to find later that he had run over and killed the deceased. When asked whether he had thoughts of harming the deceased he said:
Years ago I did, three years earlier as I was attempting suicide by poisoning myself in a caravan. [The deceased] advised me that would be a good idea. I survived my own suicide attempt and thought that his actions were deplorable.

45When asked to recount the history leading up to the incident he reported the resurgence of horrendous memories from childhood including sexual abuse, drug abuse, rape and hypnotism. He also detailed various attempts upon his life in 2006 and 2007 which included extreme physical brutality of various kinds including torture, sexual degradation and murder by drowning. He identified the deceased as one of a number of people who had attempted to kill him. He said one of these events had been filmed. He said that he managed to survive these attempts upon his life because he had the ability to leave his body. He also claimed that he was able to channel information relating to missing people and had spoken to the Prime Minister of Japan and warned him in advance of the tsunami. 

46In the course of recounting his personal history (some of which was relatively commonplace in the sense of his nomination of schools he had attended and places his family had lived) Mr Mitchell also claimed that he was a child prostitute for the Freemasons in Sydney; that he had been hypnotised to forget the experience; that the abuse had been filmed and documented; and the former premier of Queensland would have the records. He also claimed he was married at age 6 and that he had a daughter who he met on the same night that he made the predictions about the floods in Toowoomba, the tsunami in Japan and the earthquake in Turkey.

47Dr Westmore offered a differential diagnosis which included a delusional disorder and chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness or perhaps a schizoaffective disorder as suggested by the Justice Health psychiatrist. In so far as the defence of mental illness was concerned he said: 
On the balance of probabilities, [at the time of the incident] Mr Mitchell was suffering from a disease of the mind, specifically a psychotic illness, which is an abnormality of mind, which would have totally deprived him of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act. It seems likely, certainly on the balance of probability, that he was delusionally driven, ie acting on delusional beliefs in relation to the deceased at the time of the incident.

Mr Mitchell could therefore raise the defence of mental illness to the charge of murder. If the defence is successful, he will require long term and probably lifelong psychiatric support and supervision.

Dr Nielssen

48Dr Nielssen examined Mr Mitchell in custody on 31 May 2012. He summarised his presentation at that time as follows:
Mr Mitchell presented as a trim man of fifty-four years of age with shoulder length grey hair tied into a neat ponytail. There were no obvious signs of neurological disorder, for example, abnormalities of movement, gait or articulation. He did not seem especially agitated or distressed at any stage in the interview, or to be depressed, and if anything, his emotional responses were rather bland considering the topics being discussed. He was calm and softly spoken, and his speech was superficially fluent. However, there was subtle disorganisation of his speech as he wandered from the point, missed the intention of some questions and gave some bizarre responses that referred to the names of people as though they were familiar to the interviewer. He denied experiencing auditory hallucinations or other typical symptoms of schizophrenia, and did not appear distracted as though by hallucinations. However, he expressed a number of bizarre delusional beliefs and did not seem to recognise the apparent absurdity of many of his statements.

He was correctly orientated and had some knowledge of recent events, although he was unable to describe current events in great detail. A formal screen of intellectual function was not performed, as his memory and concentration appeared to be intact. He was literate and his pre-morbid intelligence was estimated to be within the normal range, from his vocabulary and his occupational attainment. His intellectual function was thought to be largely unimpaired, apart from his inability to critically evaluate the basis for his beliefs arising from late onset mental illness.

49Mr Mitchell recounted the same or very similar delusional beliefs to Dr Nielssen as those recorded by Dr Westmore, and asserted the same range of supernatural powers which do not warrant repetition in this judgment. 

50In response to questions directed to his relationship with the deceased, he said that he had known Mr Foss as a member of Alcoholics Anonymous since 2005. He said they had not had any dispute until the months before the offence when the deceased had, according to him, taken to placing a shotgun pellet on the table in front of him before each meeting which he understood was to let him know that people were trying to kill him. He said it was at that time that he realised that the deceased was party to a conspiracy to kill him. 

51When taken to the offence itself Mr Mitchell told Dr Nielssen that he had planned to wait beside the road until the deceased drove by and run him off the road. He said he had formed that plan on the day of the killing. He said he parked his van beside the road as he expected the deceased to come by on his bicycle on the way to the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He said that when he saw the deceased ride past him he drove after him and hit him. He went on to say that he did not stop after hitting the deceased and did not check whether he was moving or whether he needed medical assistance. He said, ""They had already tried to kill me twice before...I was in fear"".

52Dr Neilssen diagnosed chronic paranoid schizophrenia on the basis of what appeared to him to be bizarre delusional beliefs arising as primary delusions, rather than secondary to symptoms such as auditory hallucination. He went on to say:
... The onset of the illness is relatively late, as Mr Mitchell was not reported to have symptoms of psychosis at the time of assessments performed in 2002, 2003 and 2005. However, there is evidence of a decline in social and occupational function in recent years, including being granted the Disability Support Pension two years ago. Mr Mitchell reported the emergence of his beliefs regarding having been hypnotised about eighteen months ago, and the witness statements confirm that bizarre beliefs had been evident for some months prior to the offence.

...[The] comparatively late onset of illness and the unusual pattern of symptoms suggests some kind of neurological basis for the development of psychosis. There has to be a marked loss of self-awareness to be able to uncritically entertain such bizarre beliefs, similar to the loss of self-awareness associated with some stroke syndromes.

Notwithstanding the aetiology of his condition, it is clear from the findings from the recent interview and the corroborative information provided that Mr Mitchell was mentally ill at the time of the offence and that he committed the offence in response to bizarre delusional beliefs regarding Mr Foss. Hence I believe he has the defence of mental illness open to him for the charge of murder. He has a disease of the mind, in the form of a chronic schizophrenic illness that produced a defect of reason in the form of a bizarre delusional belief and the loss of any capacity to critically evaluate his own thinking. He was clearly aware of the nature and quality of his act in deliberately driving his car into Mr Foss with the likelihood that he would cause his death. He also recognised that his actions were likely to result in criminal charges, from his attempt to conceal the offence from the police. However, I believe he was unable to recognise that his actions were morally wrong, as he believed that Mr Foss was part of a conspiracy to harm him, and his mental illness deprived him of the capacity to logically consider whether his beliefs might be unfounded or consider the other courses of action available to him.

Mental state at the time of the offence

53As I have noted above, the consultant psychiatrists are of the unanimous view that at the time of the incident Mr Mitchell was suffering from a disease of the mind that prevented him from recognising the moral wrongfulness of his actions and which operated to compromise his capacity to understand the true nature and quality of his actions. Having regard to their expert opinion and the other evidence tendered in the proceedings I am satisfied that the defence of mental illness has been established and that a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness should be returned. 

54Before turning to decide what orders should be made under s 39 of the Act, in these circumstances I pause to extend my deepest sympathies to Mr Foss' family. I well understand that these proceedings, and my findings, will not ameliorate their grief but I trust that they appreciate and accept that in our system of justice only the mentally competent are punished as criminal offenders. 

55Both Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen were of the opinion that Mr Mitchell requires long-term psychiatric care and supervision. There is no evidence before me as to his current functioning or any treatment he is receiving as a remand prisoner. I do note that he does not appear to be detained as a forensic patient in the sense that he informed Dr Nielssen in May 2012 that he was housed at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre and had a job working in the prison laundry. On the other hand, his counsel does not submit that I would order his release into the community, either unconditionally or on conditions under s 39(2) of the Act there being no evidential basis to support a finding that neither his safety nor the safety of other members of the community would not be put seriously at risk were he released. The alternative is to order that he be detained in custody as a forensic patient under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal until a decision is made to release him under s 39(1) of the Act.

56The Tribunal's functions include a review of the case of a forensic patient as soon as practicable after an order is made under s 39 of the Act. The Tribunal may make orders thereafter concerning a person's continued detention, care or treatment on review at six monthly intervals and make appropriate orders as to their continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place, or order their release either conditionally or unconditionally. I also note that the Tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the forensic patient unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered and that it must notify the Minister of Health and the Attorney General in advance of the release of a forensic patient in order that the Executive may make submissions to the Tribunal in relation to that question.

57Having regard to the prevailing diagnoses of chronic schizophrenia (albeit, in Dr Westmore's view, a range of differential diagnoses were available), and with no apparent abatement of symptoms at least up to and including 31 May 2012 when Dr Neilssen examined him, and no information from Justice Health addressing his current functioning such as to enable me to make an informed risk assessment, I am not satisfied that Mr Mitchell should be released into the community at this time. 

58Accordingly, I make the following orders:

1. James Andrew Mitchell is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

2. I direct that the Registrar notify the Minister of Health of these orders. 

3. I direct that the Registrar notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my verdict and of these orders. I also direct that he provide the Tribunal with a copy of these reasons and my orders and a copy of the exhibits tendered during the special hearing.

2760491,"HENNESSY, Michael John v R [2012] NSWCCA 241","Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: Michael John Hennessy seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court on 21 April 2011. Mr Hennessy pleaded guilty to 3 counts of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), each relating to a particular and different time period, and to 4 counts of obtain financial advantage by deception contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). He also pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement contrary to s 10(1)(a) of the Australian Passports Act 1938 (Cth).

3Mr Hennessy was sentenced as follows: in relation to each of the three offences under s 29D of the Crimes Act to 3 years' imprisonment in respect of each offence, to be served concurrently and to commence on 21 April 2011 and expire on 20 April 2014; in relation to each of the four offences under s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code to 3 years' imprisonment in respect of each offence, to be served concurrently and to commence on 21 April 2012 and expire on 20 April 2015; and in relation to the offence under s 10(1)(a) of the Australian Passports Act to 12 months' imprisonment to commence on 21 April 2015 and expire on 20 April 2016. Mr Hennessy was ordered to be released on and from 20 October 2013, after serving imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, upon the giving of security of $50, without surety, by recognisance, to be of good behaviour for the balance of the sentence.

4Further, Mr Hennessy was ordered to pay reparation to the Commonwealth in the amount of $73,830.03.

5Mr Hennessy seeks leave to appeal the sentence and raises 3 grounds:

(i)The sentencing judge erred in imposing the same penalty for all offences in counts 1 to 7;

(ii)The sentencing judge erred in failing to consider that the offences could have been dealt with summarily; and

(iii)The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

Facts

6Mr Hennessy received Centrelink payments in two names, Michael John Hennessy and Michael James Hanson. He was not entitled to the payments received in the name of Michael James Hanson. To obtain the payments in that name, Mr Hennessy organised a number of false documents.

7In relation to count 1, Mr Hennessy applied for Job Search Allowance in the name of Michael Hanson. He was paid this allowance from 14 September 1991 to 28 August 1992.

8In relation to count 2, Mr Hennessy applied for Newstart Allowance in the name of Michael Hanson. He was paid this allowance from 28 September 1992 to 18 June 1993.

9In relation to count 3, Mr Hennessy applied for Newstart Allowance in the name of Michael Hanson. He was paid this allowance from 17 July 1993 until 22 April 1994.

10In relation to count 4, Mr Hennessy lodged a claim for Newstart Allowance in the name of Michael Hanson in January 2003. To support his application the appellant provided a letter, which was signed in the name of Michael Hanson, indicating he had ceased work, a false Australian Passport, a false New South Wales Birth Certificate, a letter purporting to be signed by Michael Hanson's employer and financial information from various entities. He was paid Newstart Allowance from 24 December 2002 until 14 April 2004.

11In relation to count 5, Mr Hennessy lodged a claim for Newstart Mature Age Allowance in the name of Michael Hanson. After the claim was rejected, Mr Hennessy provided a number of false documents. As a result, he received payments from 16 September 2003 until 14 April 2004.

12Count 6 relates to further Newstart Allowance payments received by Mr Hennessy in the name of Michael Hanson from 6 April 2005 until 14 July 2005. False documentation was provided in order to obtain these payments.

13In relation to count 7, Mr Hennessy lodged a claim for the Age Pension in the name of Michael Hanson. He received the Pension as a result of this claim from 15 July 2005 until 21 February 2008. Once more, false documentation was provided to support the claim.

14In relation to count 8, Mr Hennessy obtained a false passport in the name of Michael James Hanson in October 2002.

15In relation to counts 1 - 3, Centrelink payments were made to a Commonwealth Bank account in the name of Michael James Hanson. In relation to counts 4 - 7, payments were made to a St George Bank account in the name of Michael James Hanson. Other amounts were received in the appellant's real name. 

16During the same period, Mr Hennessy, in his own name lodged a number of other claims, including claims for the Sole Parent Pension and the Disability Support Pension. During the relevant time, Mr Hennessy also had a National Australia Bank account in his name.

17During the execution of a search warrant, the police located a number of diaries, which record when Centrelink payments, in both names, were to be received, the bank balances of the accounts in both names, and a large number of other documents.

18The appellant, as a consequence of his fraudulent activity was overpaid an amount of $74,970.03 by Centrelink.

Ground 1: Fixing of the same penalty for all or most offences

19The submissions on behalf of Mr Hennessy are that there was error in the fixing of the penalty for each of the offences in counts 1 - 7 because his Honour imposed the same penalty (3 years' imprisonment) for each of the counts. Each count, as previously stated, involves a different sum of money and different time periods.

20As a consequence, the appellant submits that the objective gravity of each offence was not comparable and some differentiation in penalty was required.

21A sentencing judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence together with questions of totality: Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624, per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process of mathematical precision: Pearce v R and Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.

22In fixing the sentence of 3 years for each of the offences to which counts 1 - 7 refer, his Honour expressly applied s 16A of the Crimes Act and looked at the nature of each offence. It cannot be said of any one of the sentences imposed for counts 1 - 7 that it is an inappropriate, manifestly excessive or an otherwise inappropriate sentence.

23Ultimately, Mr Hennessy must establish that there is a different level of criminality associated with each of the offences or some of the offences as against others. The matter to which Mr Hennessy points is confined to the fact that each involved a different sum of money and occurred over different periods of time. Usually, such matters will affect the seriousness of the criminal conduct. However, in this case, the offences are almost identical, involve the same degree of planning and are manifestations of the same criminal intent. While it may have been better for his Honour to have fixed different sentences for each offence, there is a point at which the criticism is one of form rather than substance.

24As long as each sentence is within the range applicable for the criminal conduct and the level of accumulation and concurrency is such that there is no error in totality, it is imposing too strict a regime on sentencing judges to require them to fix a different sentence for each offence charged. Ultimately, as the High Court has made clear in Pearce, the task is one of fixing an appropriate sentence duration for each offence and thereafter considering the degree of concurrence or accumulation that reflects the totality of criminal conduct.

25This ground of appeal fails.

Ground 2: Failure to consider the capacity to deal with the issues summarily

26The parties before the Court agree that the offences could have been dealt with summarily pursuant to s 4H of the Crimes Act. The potential for summary disposal was not raised as a consideration in the sentencing proceedings and not expressly referred to by the sentencing judge. Nevertheless, the sentencing judge has dealt with such offences on numerous occasions.

27The Crown submits that the fact that the issue was not raised by counsel before the sentencing judge supports an inference that the principle relied upon by Mr Hennessy has no application to the appeal: see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [76], [80] and [83], per Johnson J with whom McClellan CJ at CL and I agreed.

28In this case, the theoretical availability of summary disposal must be qualified by the seriousness and extent of the fraud and dishonest activity. The offences for contravening s 29D of the Crimes Act and for obtaining a financial advantage contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. Given the extent and nature of the fraud perpetrated, it cannot be said that the election of the Commonwealth DPP to prosecute the matters on indictment in the District Court was in any way inappropriate or could be subject to criticism. Nor did the applicant suggest such criticism. Indeed, on one view a decision, in this case, to prosecute at the Local Court may have been inappropriate, because a sentence appropriate to the level of criminality could not have been imposed.

29Unless it can be said that the mere fact that an offence may be dealt with summarily necessarily requires the imposition of a less severe sentence, no criticism can be made of his Honour in fixing the sentences at the level that he did.

30None of these sentences are out of the range or unavailable for the criminality of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.

31I reiterate my comments, recited in Zreika at [140], to the following effect:

""The general approach was reiterated by me in Stanford v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 73 (McClellan CJ at CL and Hulme J agreeing) at [50] in which I said:

'A court may have regard on sentence, in a matter dealt with by the court on indictment, to the fact that the matter could have been dealt with by way of summary disposal: R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195. The obverse is also true; a court may choose, for good reason, not to have regard to that fact. In this instance the prosecuting authority chose to have the matter dealt with in the District Court. The exercise of that power was correct and cannot be the subject of criticism. So much is conceded by the applicant. The criminality of the offence in question was too serious to be dealt with by the Local Court. In those circumstances, the sentencing judge is required to deal with the matter in accordance with ordinary principle. The sentencing judge is required to have regard to ... the maximum sentence that may be imposed and the general principles applicable either under the common law or statute to the fixing of the sentence. The jurisdictional limit for a sentence, if the matter were to have been processed in the Local Court, is not a constraining element (or any element) in those circumstances: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [14]-[16]; R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29], [30]. This ground of appeal fails'.""

32I also refer, without repeating, to the comments of Johnson J, with which comments McClellan CJ at CL and I agreed at [102] - [107] in Zreika.

33The principles are clear. No error of the kind necessary has been established that would warrant an interference with the sentences imposed on the basis that appropriate regard was not had to the availability of summary disposal. This ground of appeal also fails.

Ground 3: Manifest excess and totality

34As has been made clear on a number of occasions, to establish manifest excess as a ground of appeal, an applicant for leave to appeal must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v R at [26] - [28]; R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33].

35As has also been made clear on a number of occasions, there is no single correct sentence that can be imposed. Judges on appeal are not able to set aside or to overturn a sentence simply on the basis that they would have imposed a different sentence. Such a view is an insufficient basis for appellate intervention. In order to justify intervention, there must be error of the requisite kind: House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle: Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26]; Markarian v R at [25], [27].

36The learned sentencing judge grouped the offences, as is obvious from the description of the sentences earlier in these reasons, and made each of the contraventions of s 29D wholly concurrent and each of the contraventions of s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code wholly concurrent. Further, the obtain-financial-advantage-by-deception sentences were accumulated by 12 months on top of the sentence imposed for defrauding the Commonwealth. The sentence for count 8 (false passport) was further accumulated by another 12 months.

37It was entirely appropriate to require that each of the sentences for contravention of s 29D of the Crimes Act, the defrauding the Commonwealth offences, be served concurrently. While each is a separate offence, occurring at a separate time and over different periods of time, the result of which was obtaining different amounts of money, the criminal culpability for all of them was essentially identical.

38Further, taken as a group, the offences were, as his Honour indicated, well organised, well planned and sophisticated. In this assessment his Honour was correct. The appellant kept meticulous records and effected a complicated series of acts in order to carry out the criminal conduct.

39Further, in relation to the four offences of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code, likewise, it was entirely appropriate for his Honour to impose sentences that were to be served wholly concurrently. Again, while each of the offences is separate, involving different periods of time, different amounts of money and different physical acts, each offence was the implementation of a well-planned, well-organised and meticulous scheme for obtaining money from the Commonwealth by utilising a false identity. 

40The obtaining of that false identity required planning and a number of criminal acts each of which are relevant to each of the offences. Further, it is appropriate that there be an accumulation of the sentences over that which was imposed for the offences of defrauding the Commonwealth.

41Lastly, the obtaining of a false passport involves a number of acts, which are similar in intent to those for which sentences were imposed for defrauding the Commonwealth and for dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception. Nevertheless, the offence is a quite separate offence and requires a degree of accumulation beyond the sentences imposed for the other two groups of offences.

42His Honour had regard to each of the matters in s 16A of the Crimes Act relevant to the exercise being undertaken. In particular, his Honour had regard to the provisions of s 16A(2)(c) in that a number of the offences formed part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character.

43Mr Hennessy submits that, if, as can be expected, a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty has been effected, the starting point for the sentence in the passport offence would have been 16 months' imprisonment. It is said that, in the objective and subjective circumstances of the case for Mr Hennessy, this starting point was too high, particularly when it is being wholly accumulated on the other sentences.

44Firstly, the sentencing judge did not specify the actual quantum of the discount to be allowed. Nevertheless, the discount was said to have been one for a willingness to facilitate the course of justice (Remarks on Sentence, [45]).

45The passport offence was an essential ingredient in Mr Hennessy's continued deception of Centrelink. Moreover, the passport offence is, as his Honour the sentencing judge makes clear, a serious matter striking at Australian sovereignty and the power of the Australian Government to control the country's affairs.

46I agree with his Honour's assessment of the seriousness of the offence and I do not consider that a starting point of 16 months is outside the range of sentences available to his Honour. As a consequence, even assuming a 25 per cent discount, and assuming a starting point of 16 months, this criticism of his Honour's sentence for the passport offence is unfounded.

47Mr Hennessy further submits that his Honour misused the sentences imposed in the judgments of R v Grenfell [2009] NSWCCA 162 and R v Leighton [2010] NSWCCA 280 when fixing the sentences in relation to the fraud and dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception.

48One of the matters of distinction to which Mr Hennessy points is the amount of money obtained by the offenders in each of the cases. The amount of money is a relevant factor in determining the seriousness of criminal conduct, but it is not the determinant of appropriate sentence to be imposed.

49Consistency in sentencing is an appropriate goal to be obtained by a consistent application of the appropriate principles established by the legislature or otherwise applicable under the general law: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [77] - [78]. 

50As has been made clear on a number of occasions, equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect: Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608, cited with approval in Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28]. Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is a fundamental element in a rational and fair system of criminal justice: Green & Quinn. In relation to co-offenders it finds expression in the parity principle. In relation to offenders who are not co-offenders, it finds expression in the principle of consistency in sentencing: see Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at 588 - 589, cited with approval in Green v R; Quinn v R at [30], per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ and at [119] - [123], per Bell J with whom Heydon J agreed.

51The fact, if it be the fact, that there are distinct differences that are relevant to the sentencing exercise between the facts and circumstances of the offences for which a sentence was imposed in Grenfell and Leighton is not to the point, unless it can be said that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge on Mr Hennessy was inconsistent in the sense used in the principle of consistency in sentencing. That is, that the sentence gave rise to a legitimate sense of grievance because the sentence imposed was outside the range defined by Grenfell and Leighton and other cases of like offences. In my view, the sentences imposed by his Honour on Mr Hennessy are not outside the range and are not, in the relevant sense, sentences that are inconsistent with the sentences imposed by the Court in Grenfell and Leighton.

Conclusion 

52Overall, the sentences imposed by his Honour for each offence, and as an aggregate, are not unreasonable or plainly unjust and do not warrant interference by this Court.

53Given the seriousness of the offences and the period over which they occurred, no different sentence is warranted and the sentences, as an aggregate, represent a sentence of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the offence and of the offender.

54As a consequence of the foregoing, I propose that the Court grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.

55ADAMSON J: I agree with Rothman J.

		22 November 2012",2012-11-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760492,R v Tannous; R v Fahda; R v Dib [2012] NSWCCA 243,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: Each of the respondents entered pleas of guilty in respect of offences of facilitating organised car rebirthing, contrary to s 154G(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for such offences was 14 years imprisonment. The offence carried a standard non-parole period of four years imprisonment.

2On 27 January 2012 Syme DCJ sentenced Mr Fahda and Mr Tannous to imprisonment for 20 months and 19 months respectively, in each case to be served by way of intensive correction in the community, pursuant to an intensive correction order: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 7(1). On 23 February 2012 the respondent Dib was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 months, also to be served by way of intensive correction in the community.

3In each case, the sentences were directed to commence on the date on which they were imposed. On 5 March 2012 the Director of Public Prosecutions gave notice of his intention to appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of each sentence on the ground that the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate. On 29 July 2012 further grounds were identified. Ground 1 asserted that in each case the sentencing judge had erred in her assessment of the seriousness of the car rebirthing offence. Ground 2 asserted that in each case the sentence was manifestly inadequate ""as to the term and the manner in which [it was to be] served"".

4Mr Tannous had been separately sentenced for an offence of participating in a criminal group, contrary to s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act, an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. For that offence he had been sentenced to five months imprisonment to be served by way of intensive correction in the community, and wholly concurrently with the car rebirthing sentence. In respect of that offence, the sentence was said to be manifestly inadequate (ground 3) and the ""overall sentence"" was said to be manifestly inadequate, apparently due to the failure to provide any degree of accumulation in respect of the sentences (ground 4).

5In detailed reasons, the sentencing judge gave careful attention to the nature of the car rebirthing activities as a whole, the role of each offender and the personal circumstances of each offender. In each case, her Honour expressed the view that ""an alternative to a full time custodial sentence"" ought be considered or explored. She then made express reference to the ""often competing considerations"" to be taken into account in sentencing an offender, as identified in s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Next, and perhaps curiously, her Honour acknowledged the requirement in s 5 of the Sentencing Procedure Act that imprisonment should only be imposed if no other penalty was considered appropriate and said ""it is for that reason that I adjourned all of these matters for an intensive correction order assessment"": Judgment, p 20. The phraseology is curious because an intensive correction order can only be made in respect of an offender sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years: s 7(1). Thus, before seeking an assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community (pursuant to s 69 of the Sentencing Procedure Act) the judge must have been satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate. 

6In ordinary English usage it might be thought oxymoronic to speak of imprisonment being served ""in the community"", rather than in a prison. Nevertheless, the intention underlying the comments of the sentencing judge should be respected. Although for the purposes of s 5 satisfaction that a sentence of imprisonment is required may suffice, the underlying principle requires attention to the possibility of an alternative to a full-time custodial sentence, if such an alternative is available within the statutory provisions for imprisonment.

Availability of intensive correction orders
7In considering whether to make an intensive correction order in respect of each offender, the sentencing judge focused her reasoning upon the decision of this Court in Regina v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 (Beazley JA, Kirby and Johnson JJ). In Hamieh, the Court upheld an appeal by the Director in respect of an offence under s 154G(1), where the offender had been sentenced to 24 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. The Court quashed the sentence and imposed a period of full-time custody of three years, consisting of a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of 12 months.

8The sentencing judge sought to distinguish Hamieh on two bases. First, it was said that the respondent had a ""poor prior record"" showing ""a history of disrespect for lawful authority which indicated a need for personal deterrence"". Secondly it was said that Mr Hamieh's offence had involved 30 vehicles, although only two had parts from stolen vehicles. 

9The sentencing judge also noted the statements in Hamieh that periodic detention had ""a strong element of leniency built into it"" and accepted that the same could be said of an intensive correction order although she also noted, correctly, that it involved ""a substantial element of coercion and serious consequences for failure to comply"": Judgment, p 21.

10It will be necessary to consider the soundness of the bases on which the sentencing judge sought to distinguish Hamieh. It will also be necessary to consider further the factors relevant to rehabilitation, to which her Honour had made reference in respect of each offender and the agreements by each to pay compensation. Finally, it will be necessary to take into account the submissions in relation to parity with co-offenders who had already been dealt with in respect of the same organised car rebirthing activity. Before considering those factors, it is convenient to identify the general principles applicable with respect to the serving of a sentence in the community, pursuant to an intensive correction order.

Intensive correction orders - general principles
11In its original form, s 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act provided that a sentence of imprisonment of not more than 18 months might be served by way of home detention. From 1 October 2010, the provision was varied so as to provide for imprisonment to be served by way of intensive correction in the community. That is to occur by the making of ""an intensive correction order"". Where such an order is made, the Court is not to set a non-parole period: s 7(2). Section 7 is described as being ""subject to"" the provisions of Pt 5 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Further, in common with all sentences of imprisonment, it is also subject to the operation of Pt 4, which makes general provision for procedures in setting terms of imprisonment: see ss 44-63.

12Part 5, by contrast, is specific to procedures for intensive correction orders: s 64-73A. An intensive correction order is not available in respect of certain sexual offences: s 66. Further, it may not be made unless the court is satisfied with respect to the conditions of eligibility in s 67. These include satisfaction that the offender is ""a suitable person"" to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community: s 67(1)(b).

13Section 69 states that before imposing a sentence of imprisonment ""the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community"": s 69(1). Whilst that provision confers a power, it appears that the obtaining of such a report is a necessary pre-condition to making such an order because there is a requirement for the court, in taking that step, to have regard to the contents of the assessment report on the offender: s 67(2)(a). Further, the power to make such an order is conditioned upon an affirmative assessment that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence in the community: s 67(4). A finding of suitability does not, however, mandate such an order: s 67(3).

14The exercise of the power to make an intensive correction order is not solely contained within the Sentencing Procedure Act. There is a further requirement that the sentencing court impose conditions, prescribed as mandatory conditions by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (NSW), the obligation being imposed by s 81(2) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (""the Administration Act"").

15Perhaps because a sentencing judge does not usually expect to find mandatory conditions upon which a sentence may be imposed in the Administration Act, that obligation appears to have been overlooked in the present case. There was some discussion in the course of argument as to the effect of that omission, which it is unnecessary to determine.

16Simpson J has expressed the view that an offender should not be subject to an intensive correction order unless there is a real need for rehabilitation in the community: R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 at [111] (Simpson J, Hislop and Latham JJ agreeing). Thus, where there was little if any prospect of the person convicted re-offending, the case was held not to lend itself to such an order: Boughen, at [110]. Simpson J articulated the reasoning underlying that conclusion in more detail in R v Agius; R v Zerafa [2012] NSWSC 978 at [92]-[116]. In particular, she held that the restrictions and constraints contained in the mandatory conditions gave rise to an implication that, absent a real risk of re-offending, the order would serve no purpose: at [107]. These views have recently been rejected by a five-judge bench: R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225 at [96]-[100] (McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J; Price, RA Hulme and Button JJ agreeing).

17That the service of a sentence by way of intensive correction in the community is a more lenient penalty than full-time imprisonment was acknowledged by all parties in the present case, although there were differing views as to the degree of leniency involved. This court has accepted that such a sentence involves ""a high degree of leniency"": Boughen at [111]. In Whelan v R [2012] NSWCCA 147, Schmidt J (Allsop P and Davies J agreeing) accepted a submission by the Director that ""an intensive correction order reflects a significant degree of leniency"", while noting that it also involves a substantial punishment: at [120]. Those conclusions were clearly accepted by the offenders in the present case, each of whom filed an affidavit deposing to the harsh consequences which would follow were the intensive correction orders to be revoked, in favour of sentences involving full-time custody. The fact that there are significant restraints and the possibility of future incarceration for breach of conditions does not gainsay these views, but puts them in context: R v Pogson at [68], [100]-[101], [108]-[111].

18Simpson J also expressed doubt in Agius as to whether, under the Sentencing Procedure Act, the imposition of such conditions could be seen as a ""significantly punitive disposition"", as had been held with respect to similar legislation in Victoria: see Director of Public Prosecutions v Nikolic [2008] VSCA 226 (Warren CJ, Vincent JA agreeing); Director of Public Prosecutions v Karazisis [2010] VSCA 350; 206 A Crim R 14 at [184] (Ashley, Redlich and Weinberg JJA, Warren CJ and Maxwell P agreeing), both of which were referred to by Buddin J in R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643. 

19The Victorian cases there referred to were concerned with ss 19 and 20 of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic), as then in force. Those provisions were replaced by more comprehensive provisions, now found in Pt 3A of the Victorian Act, as inserted by the Sentencing Amendment (Community Correction Reform) Act 2011, which commenced on 16 January 2012.

20Similar legislation also exists in Queensland: Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Qld), ss 112-115. In Western Australia there is power to make ""intensive supervision orders"" which are seen, not as a form of imprisonment, but as an intermediate step between other non-custodial options and imprisonment: Sentencing Act 1995 (WA), ss 69-71. New Zealand has adopted a similar approach: Sentencing Act 2002 (NZ), ss 54B-54K. (For a summary of such laws, now slightly out of date, see Sentencing Advisory Council (Vic), Suspended Sentences and Intermediate Sentencing Orders - Suspended Sentences Final Report - Part 2 (2008), Ch 6.)

21At least in jurisdictions where such orders are treated as a form of imprisonment, they must have a significant punitive effect and therefore reflect, in all likelihood, a range of purposes identified in s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It is unlikely that their incidents or objectives would differ greatly if they were described as ""intensive supervision orders"". The use of the descriptor ""correction"" in the title probably reflects the same philosophy as does the use of the term ""correctional centre"" to include what were formerly known as prisons in the Administration Act.

22Although, as a general rule, a statute cannot be construed by reference to regulations made under it, there are circumstances where the statute itself establishes the structure of a scheme which is incomplete, absent relevant regulations. In such a case, it may be appropriate to have regard to the regulations in order to understand the scheme. That principle has been applied in relation to the sales tax legislation in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (SA) v Ellis & Clark Ltd [1934] HCA 54; 52 CLR 85 at 91-92 (Dixon J); Brayson Motors Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1985] HCA 20; 156 CLR 651 at 657 (Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ). This principle has not been restricted to tax cases, but was accepted in respect of the regulation of franchising under Pt IVB of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which was read with the Trade Practices (Industry Codes - Franchising) Regulations 1998 (Cth): Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA 38; 236 CLR 101 at [19] and [26] (Gummow ACJ, Kirby, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).

23In the present case, s 81 of the Administration Act was premised on the assumption that there would be regulations prescribing mandatory conditions of an intensive correction order and obliging the court to impose such conditions when making an order. In such circumstances, it may not be inappropriate to look to the regulations to understand the legislative scheme. 

24The present case gave rise to two further issues. The first, which was not in dispute, was whether it was permissible, desirable or even necessary, to look to the terms of the regulation to understand the degree of leniency of such a sentence as compared with full-time imprisonment. At least implicitly, both the Director and the respondents accepted that it was. The next question was whether, and if so how, the court could take into account the actual operation of such an order. In most cases, the sentencing court will not have such information before it, except, perhaps, at a very general level. In the present case, the offenders read affidavits in which they set out the manner in which the orders were currently operating in respect of their own circumstances, as being at least relevant with respect to any re-sentencing exercise and possibly as to the appropriateness of the orders themselves. Thus, it might be possible to consider the actual degree of leniency resulting from an order under s 7 or, being the obverse of the same coin, the relative harshness of the conditions, as they operated in the particular cases. 

25Generally speaking, it is not open to an offender to demonstrate that a sentence was unduly severe (or in the case of an appeal by the Director, not unduly lenient) by evidence of the manner in which it operated prior to the hearing of the appeal. The general approach is that, assuming that error is otherwise demonstrated, such material may be taken into account upon re-sentencing. The only basis for adopting a different approach in the present case is that, while sentencing judges are reasonably familiar with the general circumstances of a custodial sentence and its impact upon an individual offender, the operation of intensive correction orders is less well understood. In part that is because their operation will depend as much upon the resources available to the State in administering the scheme as upon the abstract nature of the conditions imposed. However, to accept such an argument would be to leave the door open to continuing evidential disputes about the operation of particular orders in circumstances where it may be said that the available resources have been augmented or withdrawn over time. The preferable course is to approach the matter on the basis of the statutory scheme and the material available to the trial judge at the date of sentencing.

Circumstances of offending
26The basic structure for rebirthing activities undertaken by the offenders and certain others was as follows. The first step was to arrange the purchase from interstate auction yards of what were broadly described as ""repairable write-offs"" of base model vehicles. The use of interstate vehicles was adopted to limit the circumstances in which they could be traced, for example by search of the Register of Encumbered Vehicles (REVs) in New South Wales.

27The second step was to repair the vehicles so that they passed inspection by the Roads and Traffic Authority in this State. The third step, after inspection, was to have the vehicles registered in the names of friends, relatives and associates.

28The repaired vehicles were not sold in their registered condition. Rather, they were ""upgraded"" by use of stolen parts from more expensive models. By upgrading after registration, the need to produce receipts for the stolen parts was avoided.

29Following those steps, the vehicles were advertised for sale and sold to members of the public, without disclosing that the vehicles had been involved in accidents and had been re-birthed. Each of the respondents knew that the vehicles were to be sold with false histories.

30The activities in which each offender was involved differed as between them, but the conduct generally took place between October 2006 and September 2008. None of the offenders in the present matter were said to have been involved in the theft of vehicles, nor in their ultimate sale.

31The respondents had four co-offenders. One, Mr Hussain, was responsible for advertising and selling the vehicles. He had not been sentenced at the time the respondents were sentenced, but later came before Woodburne DCJ on 9 March 2012, on multiple offences. Neither the offences themselves, nor the personal circumstances of the offender were closely paralleled by the present cases. It is sufficient to note that Woodburne DCJ imposed a sentence of three years with a non-parole period of one year five months. In the circumstances, no question of an intensive correction order arose.

32There were three other co-offenders who had been dealt with prior to the sentencing of the respondents. One, Mr Rustom, was charged with knowingly participating in a criminal group through the registration of a single vehicle and facilitating the sale of the vehicle. A term of nine months imprisonment was imposed, fully suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. His offending was clearly less serious than that of the respondents. A further co-offender, Mr Shiel, was sentenced in the District Court in September 2011 in relation to one offence of knowingly participating in a criminal group, contrary to s 93T of the Crimes Act. He had had 10 motor vehicles registered in his name, in co-operation with the respondent Tannous. The sentencing judge noted that he acted for minimal financial gain, had significant mental health issues and had been ""very much used by people running this operation"". He was placed on a bond, sentence being deferred for three years.

33The other co-offender was a Mr Minkara who was charged with two offences of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime, by depositing into an account in his name money received from the sale of two vehicles. He too received a s 9 bond.

Nature of offences
34The gravity of the activities constituting car rebirthing are reflected in the available penalties, being a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of four years. Nevertheless, because the section encompasses a wide range of criminal activity, it is necessary to focus on the particular offending conduct in identifying an appropriate punishment: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 451-452; Hamieh at [50]. On the other hand, the section envisages that rebirthing activities may be carried out on an organised basis by a network of individuals carrying out specific functions for profit or gain, without there being a hierarchical organisation: s 154G(5)(b). In Hamieh a person who had entered a plea of guilty to an offence under s 154G had been sentenced, after receiving a discount of 20% for the plea, to a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment, with a balance of term of 12 months, to be served by way of periodic detention. There were two cars into which stolen parts were incorporated and the activities took place between 12 February and 20 July 2007. This Court (Beazley JA, Kirby and Johnson JJ) intervened on the application of the Director, resentencing the offender to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of 12 months.

35Much of what was said in Hamieh with respect to the significance of the standard non-parole period should no longer be relied on: see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. However, relevantly for present purposes, the Court outlined the history to the legislation:

""[43] The Crown placed particular emphasis on the objects of the legislative scheme enacted by the Crimes Amendment (Organised Car and Boat Theft) Act 2006, which introduced s 154G into the Crimes Act on 23 May 2006. The new provision is specifically directed to the criminal industry of car rebirthing.

[44] The background to the 2006 legislative amendments included the Report of the Independent Commission Against Corruption entitled 'Rebirthing Motor Vehicles: Investigation Into the Conduct of Staff of the Roads and Traffic Authority and Others' (November 2000), in which Assistant Commissioner Cripps QC considered the vice of car rebirthing, including the theft of cars for this purpose, producing a valuable item for criminals to resell to unsuspecting buyers (p 1). The scope for corruption of public officials in areas of vehicle inspection and registration was also emphasised (pp 1-2, 42). 

[45] Decisions of this Court for offences committed before the 2006 amendments concerning sentence for receiving offences had emphasised the seriousness of crimes associated with car rebirthing: Mason v R [2007] NSWCCA 32 at [19]; Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296; 51 MVR 572 at [29] 578. The 2006 amendments involve a specific legislative response to this problem with particular emphasis upon the need for deterrence and the imposition of appropriately severe penalties.

...

[47] The significance of these matters was highlighted in the Minister's second reading speech to Parliament, where the Minister noted that car and boat rebirthing activities cost the New South Wales community $100 million annually and identified some of the 'social' costs of rebirthing. He said:

'Firstly, rebirthing means that the stolen vehicle will not be recovered, in contrast to 'joyriding'-style car theft, where the vehicle is usually recovered. This results in true owners being deprived of their cars permanently, and higher insurance premiums for us all. In addition, if a rebirthed car that has been on-sold is subsequently identified, seized and taken back to its true owner, the honest buyer who paid market price for the car may be left with nothing.

Secondly, rebirthing is dangerous. It may involve serious physical alterations to the car, such as grafting the front end of one car to the back end of another. This creates a structural flaw which in an accident could mean that the car disintegrates with its innocent new owners inside.

Thirdly, because rebirthing is potentially lucrative, it entices young people into becoming involved with organised criminal gangs. It can corrupt legitimate tradespeople who work with vehicles, because rebirthing gangs actively seek to 'recruit' professionals working in the industries of motor vehicle repair, wrecking, sale and registration. These people can provide the paperwork to give the rebirthers' illegal activities the veneer of legitimacy.'

[48] Importantly, in terms of the intended deterrent effect of the legislation, the Minister said:

'These new offences provide deterrence against being involved in rebirthing, and send a clear message to those thinking of being involved in rebirthing activity that the punishment will far outweigh any illegal benefits.'

The Minister also referred to the 'strict penalties for rebirthing' that the Bill proposed and the closing of loopholes in the criminal law that rebirthers might try to exploit.""

36What was noted as to the facts of the objective seriousness of the offending in Hamieh at [52] is apposite with respect to the present respondents:

""The respondent's conduct involved a demonstrated knowledge of how to source repairable write-off vehicles, how to register those vehicles and then how to substantially rebuild those vehicles with parts from other vehicles. That knowledge and skill had all been legitimately acquired and previously utilised by using vehicle parts that had been legally sourced. However, in rebuilding the two vehicles subject of the offence, the respondent chose to use stolen parts. The evidence is silent as to how he sourced those parts or what he paid for them. All that is known is that the parts came from three stolen vehicles. Although the respondent is not alleged to have been involved in the theft of the vehicles from which the stolen parts came, nonetheless, as the second reading speech makes clear, every step in the rebirthing industry is necessary and interrelated. It is for that reason that the offence has been treated by the legislature with the seriousness to which we have already referred.""

37Putting to one side the actual sentence imposed in Hamieh, which reflected both the subjective circumstances of the particular offender and an appreciation of the significance of the standard non-parole period which is no longer to be applied, it is nevertheless likely that significant activities with respect to two or more cars, in contravention of s 154G, will, in the absence of significant mitigating circumstances, give rise to a full-time custodial sentence: Mason v R [2007] NSWCCA 32 at [19] (McClellan CJ at CL, Simpson and Howie JJ agreeing); Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296; 51 MVR 572. (These cases involved similar conduct, although arising before the amendments in 2006 and thus being determined under s 188 of the Crimes Act, which carried a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment.)

38The activities involved in the present case involved a significant degree of organisation and planning. The base model vehicles were obtained cheaply from interstate sales of vehicles involved in collisions. The purpose in going interstate was to obtain vehicles which would be registered for the first time in New South Wales, thus allowing their history to be concealed from the ultimate purchaser. Once the vehicle was registered, as a base model vehicle, parts from luxury models were added, to increase its value. That step involved obtaining parts from existing vehicles, which were, almost invariably, stolen. The rebirthing activities thus provided a ready market for stolen parts, as well as a degree of co-operation between the thieves and the organisation, assuming that the thieves were not part of the organisation. The final step in the process involved sale of the vehicle to purchasers from whom the original history of the vehicle and the upgrading with stolen parts was concealed.

39Although defects in the vehicles after repair arguably should have been uncovered by inspection in the course of the registration process, and in some circumstances were uncovered, there was a real risk that some part of the vehicle might have been weakened in the original accident and not adequately repaired. Concealment of the vehicle's history had the potential to mislead both the vehicle inspector and the ultimate purchaser, with the potential to release a dangerous vehicle onto public roads.

40Assessment of the varying degrees of responsibility of those involved in car rebirthing activities is by no means a simple task. However, a number of relevant factors can be identified. First, the fact of involvement will, frequently, allow an inference that those involved were cognizant of the overall scope and purpose of the activities, even if their own roles were limited to a particular stage in the process. Secondly, the profit obtained from the activities will be a relevant consideration, if it is capable of being identified. However, as there are likely to be various individuals who will share in the profits, an understanding of how the profits were in fact shared may well not be forthcoming. Thirdly, the time over which the activities were conducted will be a relevant consideration. A brief period of involvement with a small number of vehicles is likely to be less reprehensible than an involvement over a significantly longer period with a larger number of vehicles.

41In the course of argument it was suggested that an offender will not be guilty under s 154G unless he or she was involved in the rebirthing of at least two cars (or boats). That inference was sought to be derived from the fact that the activity must be carried out on an ""organised basis"", which requires that the planning, organisation or structure must indicate that ""the activity is carried out on more than one occasion and involves more than one participant"": s 154G(4)(a). Assuming that it is not sufficient that there be two or more of the activities identified in s 154G(2), but that such activities must be carried out in relation to at least two vehicles, it does not follow that the offender, who is charged with ""facilitating"" such activities, must have been involved in those activities on more than one occasion. Nevertheless, it is clear that the seriousness of the individual offender's conduct will reflect the extent of his or her involvement over time in the activities carried out on an organised basis.

42It may also be accepted that steps can be taken, and have been taken since the offences the subject of these charges, to make it more difficult for such activities to be carried out. For example, establishing a national register of vehicles may reduce the ability of persons to conceal the history of vehicles by purchasing interstate. However, the fact that a criminal activity could be made more difficult by the authorities does not diminish the culpability of the offender. Rather, viewed from the opposite perspective, offences of this kind have imposed a significant additional burden on the broader community, by way of the increased costs involved in attempts at prevention.

Error on part of sentencing court
43The respondents complained that, at the heart of the Director's case, was the contention that the sentencing judge had erred in her characterisation of the seriousness of the offences. That being an evaluative exercise, it was not appropriate for this Court to interfere to substitute a different view as to the objective seriousness: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] (Spigelman CJ) and [45] (Simpson J). Accordingly, the Court could only intervene if some error of principle were to be discerned, analogous to the approach required in respect of truly discretionary decisions, pursuant to House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.

44So much should be accepted: however, this is a case in which the Director expressly sought to identify errors of approach which resulted in manifestly inadequate sentences. Although the sentencing judge heard some brief evidence, there is nothing to suggest that her assessment of the circumstances turned on any assessment of witnesses, as opposed to a consideration of the involvement of the parties as revealed in the documentary material before the Court. In respect of the car rebirthing offences, her Honour stated, at the end of a lengthy discussion, at pp 13-14:

""For each of the offenders, using the maximum penalty as a worst case, objective considerations and the standard non-parole period to which I have referred, each of these offences falls into the category of offending towards the low end of the scale in my view.""

45With respect to the further offence under s 93T of participating in a criminal group, the sentencing judge said with respect to Mr Tannous (p 14):

""It is a matter that is a s 93T matter where the criminality is below middle range and low to middle range.""

46What precisely was meant by the latter assessment is unclear, and probably does not matter for present purposes. It is sufficient to deal with the characterisation in respect of the car rebirthing offences which were common to all offenders and which were treated alike.

47After giving appropriate consideration to the nature of car rebirthing offences generally, the conduct of the offenders and, to the extent that they were known, their respective roles in the car rebirthing activities, it is difficult to know what was meant by assessing the offending at the ""low range"" of criminality. The concept of high, middle and low ranges is always problematic, without further explanation. The seriousness of the offences was revealed, as the sentencing judge recognised, in the maximum sentence and the specification of a significant standard non-parole period. To impose sentences which, before allowance for the guilty pleas, were of the order of half the standard non-parole period revealed a serious misconception as to the objective seriousness of the offending, absent remarkable subjective circumstances, of a kind which was not available in respect of any of the offenders.

48Nor is there anything in the reasoning which provided an explanation of the characterisation of objective seriousness. In those circumstances, the Director is correct to assert appellable error. For the reasons which follow, the error was reflected in the additional leniency granted by imposing sentences which did not involve full-time custodial terms.

49It remains to identify the involvement of the present respondents, which was significantly dissimilar to that of the four co-offenders separately dealt with. To the extent that the sentences are found to be manifestly inadequate, it will be convenient to identify in each case that which would be an appropriate sentence.

Discretion as to intervention
50For reasons set out below, it is concluded in respect of each respondent that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate and a period of full-time imprisonment would have been appropriate. Against the possibility of such a finding, the respondents argued that the Court should, nevertheless, decline to intervene in the circumstances of their respective cases.

51It is not in doubt that the Court has a discretion to decline to interfere, even when satisfied that the sentence is manifestly inadequate: Criminal Appeal Act, s 5D(1); Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1] and [24]. The respondents contended, on a number of grounds, that the residual discretion should be exercised in their favour. Those factors fell within three categories, namely -

(a) delay;
(b) actual anxiety and distress caused by the appellate process, and
(c) proportionality.

52It may be accepted that each of these factors is a legitimate consideration in considering the exercise of the residual discretion.

53With respect to delay, senior counsel for Mr Tannous noted that the last date of the period of offending was 19 September 2008, a search warrant having been executed on his home on the previous day. He was arrested and charged on 18 June 2009 and committed for trial on 2 May 2011. He eventually entered a guilty plea on 1 August 2011, his matter being stood over for sentence on 10 November 2011. He was finally sentenced after issues relating to compensation and forfeiture had been resolved, on 23 February 2012. The chronology in respect of the respondents Mr Fahda and Mr Dib parallelled that of Mr Tannous.

54The period of time which elapsed between the date of arrest and the date of sentencing might be thought unfortunate, especially in a case in which the respondents were undoubtedly facing at least the possibility of custodial sentences. However, the evidence before this Court did not allow an assessment of the causes of that delay, except in the broadest terms and little reliance was placed upon it in submissions.

55Following the imposition of the sentences, a notice of appeal was lodged promptly by the Deputy Director on 5 March 2012, the respondent Mr Tannous being the third to be served, on 13 March 2012. On 15 March the matter was given a hearing date in this Court. Detailed submissions were filed on behalf of the Director on 30 July 2012. Accordingly, the lapse of time since the sentences were imposed is unremarkable. Further, as will appear, while the appropriate sentences involve full-time custody, the respondents will have the benefit of time served in the community, so that, other considerations aside, the mere lapse of time has not acted to their detriment.

56A second and separate concern is the anxiety and distress caused by the appeal and the resultant uncertainty as to their respective future circumstances. Each has filed an affidavit attesting to the stress suffered. In the case of Mr Tannous, whilst attesting in vivid detail to the stress he has suffered since being served with the notice of appeal, he noted that he had not seen a doctor because he did not think ""there is much that anyone can do for me"". That was, no doubt, an honest response and may be accepted, as may be the balance of his affidavit. What is missing, however, is a comparison with any stress that may have been occasioned following his arrest and prior to his plea of guilty and during the period between plea and sentence.

57Mr Fahda gave evidence that he was extremely worried at the prospect of going to prison for the first time. He said that he had been seeing a psychologist and was now seeing a psychiatrist who had sent him ""to have scans"". The results of the scans were not available at the time he swore his affidavit, nor was their purpose revealed. There was no report from the psychologist or psychiatrist referred to in his affidavit. Again, there was no reference to any stress he may have felt prior to the sentencing.

58These views too may be accepted, although it appears from Mr Fahda's own evidence that he is more concerned about the problems he has had with drugs and alcohol and stated that he had ""refused to be medicated with anti-depressants"" because of those problems.

59Mr Dib also gave evidence of the stress suffered since he was served with the notice of appeal. He too had been to see a psychologist, who had prepared a report dated 20 August 2012 which was in evidence. The psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, had prepared a report prior to his sentencing. It appeared that he had not seen Mr Dib since the sentencing until 17 August 2012. The report supported the view that Mr Dib required treatment involving cognitive behaviour therapy and that he was unlikely to receive appropriate supportive psychotherapy in a custodial environment. He referred to Mr Dib as ""highly anxious and depressed"". He opined that he anticipated ""a major escalation in his symptomatology"" should he be incarcerated.

60In part, the tenor of the affidavits of each respondent was a sense of injustice that they had worked hard to comply with the terms of their intensive correction orders and, if incarcerated, would be subject to additional punishment, for no good reason. Those views should be disregarded. It is for that reason that the Court did not permit the Director to obtain evidence as to whether there had been full compliance with the conditions of the respective orders. If the respondents are to be returned to custody as a result of these proceedings, it will have nothing to do with whether they have complied or not complied with the orders so far.

61Some weight should undoubtedly be given to the anxiety and distress actually suffered by the respondents since they were sentenced. However, that weight should be limited as it may be assumed that they suffered similar degrees of anxiety and distress before being sentenced. If properly advised, they must have been aware of the risk of full-time custodial sentences being imposed.

62There remains the question of proportionality. The submissions on behalf of Mr Tannous referred to the fact that the person responsible for selling the cars, Mr Hussain, had been sentenced for one offence against s 154G and ten offences of obtaining or attempting to obtain a financial benefit by deception. Mr Hussain was sentenced to imprisonment for three years.

63It is not necessary to deal in detail with the differences between Mr Hussain's circumstances and those of the respondents. Suffice it to say that the imposition of full-time custodial sentences on the respondents will not give rise to a significant level of disparity or disproportion with respect to the sentences imposed on Mr Hussain. No doubt the result will be to reduce the difference between the respective sentences, and it may be accepted that such a variation is a relevant circumstance. However, it has limited weight once it is established the sentences imposed on the respondents were manifestly inadequate.

64Taking account of all the factors set out above, it has been necessary for the Court to give careful consideration as to whether or not to intervene. Bearing in mind the full circumstances of the offending in respect of each respondent, and the leniency of the sentences imposed, the case is not an appropriate one in which to decline to intervene.

Individual sentences
(a) Raymond Tannous
65Mr Tannous was charged with two offences. The first, of knowingly facilitating car rebirthing activities carried out on an organised basis, involved three vehicles incorporating stolen parts. The second charge of participating in a criminal group related to nine vehicles which were repaired and upgraded, although the parts were not identified as being stolen. 

66Of the three vehicles the subject of the rebirthing charges, two were located during searches of premises occupied by Mr Hussain. A third was sold to an undercover operative. The third was a base model Toyota Landcruiser which had been involved in a collision in Western Australia and had been deemed a 'repairable write off'. It was purchased in NSW in March 2008 by Christopher Shiel, for $20,356. It was repaired at a smash repair shop at which Mr Tannous worked, following which it was registered with a nominated market value of $30,000. The registration documents were collected from the RTA by Mr Tannous.

67In July 2008 the vehicle was advertised for sale as a Landcruiser Sahara 2007 for $57,850. It was purchased in September by an undercover agent for $56,000. On examination, it was found to contain luxury parts from a Landcruiser Sahara 2007 stolen from Cremorne Point in October 2007.

68Mr Tannous was a qualified vehicle spray painter who facilitated the repair and registration of the vehicles at a smash repair business in Yagoona. Once the vehicles were complete, Mr Tannous arranged for them to be registered in the names of associates and participated in the proceeds of sale. Each of the three vehicles the subject of the rebirthing charge involved, in accordance with the general scheme described above, a base model vehicle which had been deemed a repairable write-off and obtained from interstate, which was later refitted with parts from a superior model stolen and stripped in Sydney. Two of the three base vehicles was obtained for approximately $20,000, registered in the name of Christopher Shiel and ultimately placed on the market in upgraded form at a price of some $40,000.

69Mr Tannous had no remarkable personal circumstances. He was 40 years of age when sentenced and had no significant criminal history. He had forfeited an amount of $125,000 to the Crime Commission and, it was accepted by the Director, had lost any financial gain that he obtained from the offences with which he had been charged. He was working as a truck driver at the time of sentence. The primary judge accepted that he had ""psychological issues to address such as anxiety and depression which he is currently probably exacerbating by his use of alcohol"": Judgment, p 15. She further found that ""his commission of these offences has heightened his anxiety"", although it is not entirely clear whether it was the commission of the offences or his arrest which had that effect. The sentencing judge was satisfied that he was entitled to a discount of 25% for his plea of guilty, a finding which was not challenged.

70Given the discount, the starting point for the sentence in relation to car rebirthing appears to have been 25.3 months. The sentence with respect to the participation in a criminal group, which involved the repair of nine vehicles, each of which was given a false history and proved to be unroadworthy, received a sentence of five months, indicating a starting point of 6.6 months before the discount for the guilty plea. The repairs of the 12 vehicles involved covered a period from early October 2007 until September 2008. The organisation and planning, the period over which the offences extended, and the number of separate vehicles involved in the offences all warranted a significant period of imprisonment. There was nothing to justify the degree of leniency permitted by the sentencing judge. A starting point for the offences involved in the car rebirthing should have been no less than 36 months which, after a discount of 25%, would provide a sentence of two years three months. The fact that this would have been a first custodial sentence and the value which may well be derived from an extended period of supervision in the community, warrant a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That in turn would justify a non-parole period of 18 months, with a balance of term of nine months.

71The offence under s 93T also warranted a term of imprisonment, with a starting point of 16 months. Given the discount for the guilty plea, a period of 12 months imprisonment should have been imposed. There should have been a degree of accumulation of the sentences. Notionally treating the s 93T sentence as involving a non-parole period of nine months, it would have been appropriate to accumulate the car rebirthing sentence on six months of that sentence, giving an overall minimum custodial term of 24 months.

72The next question, in re-sentencing the offender, is to determine what allowance should be made for the time served ""in the community"". On one view, as the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was one of imprisonment, the circumstances of the imprisonment should be disregarded and the respondent should be allowed credit for the whole of the term served. He will then be required to serve a period of 15 months mandatory custody.

(b) Mohammad Fahda
73Mr Fahda faced one charge of knowingly facilitating organised car rebirthing, over a period from 1 July 2007 until 19 September 2008. His activities involved four vehicles. The first vehicle was a base model Mitsubishi Pajero purchased by the offender for $7,500 in the name of his sister, Sarah Fahda. It was repaired and, after first being rejected for registration, later passed inspection and was registered. The vehicle was later upgraded by parts from two stolen vehicles and sold in June 2008 for $33,250. The purchaser was dissatisfied with the vehicle and being re-examined by the same RTA examiner who inspected it first in March 2008, the police were notified. In September 2008 a search warrant was executed at the offender's premises. The second vehicle was a base model Toyota Landcruiser, purchased by the offender's aunt for $7,500 in February 2008. In August 2008 a higher model Landcruiser was stolen, stripped and parts incorporated into the Landcruiser registered in the name of the offender's aunt. It was listed by Mr Hussain at a purchase price of $49,850, but had not sold by the time police executed a search warrant on 18 September 2008.

74A third vehicle, purchased by the offender's aunt for the sum of $12,500 in July 2007, was upgraded with parts from a stolen vehicle and, despite the fact that it was missing the sunroof belonging to the upgraded model and was still badged as a base-level vehicle, sold for $51,000. The fourth vehicle involved a damaged Landcruiser, purchased by the offender's father in October 2007. It was registered in January 2008. Two weeks later a higher level Landcruiser was stolen and stripped. The rebirthed Landcruiser was sold in February 2008 for $44,500.

75When sentenced, Mr Fahda was 29 years of age. His personal circumstances involved little by way of mitigation. The sentencing judge referred to his ""worrying lack of acceptance of responsibility"" and to his purported expressions of remorse which she considered more consistent with feeling sorry for himself and perhaps for the position he had put his family in than a true acceptance of responsibility: Judgment, p 16. She noted that part of the difficulties imposed on his family had resulted from his gambling habit and the resultant debts which the family had taken responsibility for. Her Honour did not accept, understandably, a purported diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder: Judgment, p 17. She noted that he appeared, more recently, to have taken responsibility for the mortgage on the family home which had been taken out to pay for his gambling debts. She considered it a hopeful indication of a belated maturity. She noted his involvement (with other family members) in caring for his severely disabled brother. She concluded at 18:

""The hardship can be seen as part of the overall circumstances in mitigation when considering the sentence. It together with all other matters informs the process. It would not by and of itself convince me that a full time custodial sentence ought be avoided if all other considerations pointed to that as the only appropriate result.""

76Given the objective seriousness of the offence, it is by no means clear what features ultimately persuaded her Honour that an intensive correction order was appropriate.

77The offender's age and lack of serious criminal record, despite a degree of irresponsible behaviour, would justify a finding of special circumstances. Nevertheless, the objective seriousness of the offending taking place over approximately 15 months and involving four vehicles demands a full-time custodial sentence.

78Despite the primary judge's guarded hope of greater maturity, within a short period of commencing his imprisonment in the community, he was charged with dangerous driving and speeding. The charge of dangerous driving was dismissed in August 2012 and he entered a plea of guilty to speeding, was fined $1,083 and disqualified for nine months. He states in his affidavit that he had lodged an appeal against the length of the disqualification. No further details were given as to the speed involved or the circumstances of the offending.

79He claimed that he had paid $8,000 in compensation in February 2012 but accepted he owed ""a further $8,817.23"". He also said there had been ""problems"" with the first payment and that the Court did not have a record of it. He provided no evidence of payment.

80The precise role of Mr Fahda in the offending is less clear than in relation to Mr Tannous. Nevertheless, the conduct involved four cars over a period of 15 months and an appropriate starting point is three years imprisonment. 

81The sentencing judge accepted a discount of 10% for the plea of guilty, which was not entered until the first day of the trial. That would result in a sentence of two years and eight months. Because a finding of special circumstances is appropriate, that sentence should constitute a period of 20 months non-parole period with 12 months balance of term. 

(c) Omar Dib
82Mr Dib was the youngest of the three offenders. The charges involved five vehicles and car rebirthing activities conducted between 17 October 2006 and September 2008. In October 2006, Mr Dib was not yet 18 years of age. At the time of his sentence he was 23 years of age. The agreed facts stated that the offender ""facilitated the rebirthing of the five vehicles by orchestrating their purchase, repair and registration"" and then ""arranged for their subsequent upgrading"". He ""forwarded those vehicles to the co-Accused Hussain for the purposes of sale, knowing that they contained stolen parts and that the vehicles would be offered for sale with false histories"".

83Whilst noting that the was the youngest of the offenders, the sentencing judge also noted that his involvement in the offences ""was similar to the others"". She noted that he had exhibited ""worrying alcohol and gambling abuse which both militate against rehabilitation unless they are effectively tackled"": Judgment, p 18. She further noted (p 19):

""It is suggested he has an adjustment disorder with features of anxiety, depression and poor impulse control. This is an observation a psychologist could make of many with a criminal propensity. Again such an observation does little to support a finding that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he will not re-offend. The opposite in fact is a more rational conclusion from such a diagnosis.""

84Finally, she noted that he had displayed considerable energy in his father's flower business.

85In considering rehabilitation, the primary judge made no reference to the 16 offences for which penalties had been imposed between January 2007 and August 2011. These included numerous motor vehicle offences, offensive behaviour, assault police officer and possession or supply of drugs. A disqualification from driving for three months imposed on 21 September 2006 was followed by a two year disqualification imposed on 16 March 2011 for driving when licence cancelled. Five months later, there was a further conviction for drive while disqualified with a further two year period of disqualification imposed from 31 August 2011. These offences occurred whilst he was on bail with respect to the car rebirthing offences.

86Mr Dib was not sentenced on the same day as the other offenders, apparently because the Court did not have an assessment report. However, on 27 January 2012 an order was made that the offender pay the amount of $10,000 into trust, apparently as part payment of a compensation order in an amount just under $30,000. There was no evidence before the Court that any compensation had been paid. 

87On 23 February 2012 the sentencing judge imposed a 20 month sentence to be served by way of intensive correction order, being the same sentence as that imposed on Mr Fahda. To allow an adequate period on parole there should be a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It is appropriate to impose the same sentence by way of re-sentencing as that imposed on Mr Fahda.

		22 November 2012",2012-11-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760493,Gary Wayne Lobsey v R [2012] NSWCCA 239,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.

2BELLEW J: The applicant Gary Wayne Lobsey seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the Newcastle District Court on 20 August 2009 in respect of a charge of robbery inflicting grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 96 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment. 

3The applicant also seeks an extension of time within which to file the notice of intention to seek leave to appeal. That application is not opposed by the Crown.

THE FACTS
4A statement of agreed facts was before the sentencing judge. The facts can be summarised as follows.

5At about 1pm on New Years Day 2009, Audrey Clarke (""the victim"") who was then 73 years of age, was about to enter a vehicle belonging to her sister which was parked in the car park of the Woolworths supermarket at Mayfield. At the time, the victim and her sister had just completed their grocery shopping. 

6As the victim was about to get into the vehicle, with her handbag over her right shoulder, the applicant pulled her bag from behind. As she was pulled backwards she resisted, but the force exerted by the applicant was such as to cause her to fall heavily to the ground. As she hit the ground, she felt immediate pain in the region of her left hip and left arm but nevertheless kept hold of the bag. Despite the victim's resistance, the applicant continued to pull on the bag, as a consequence of which the victim was dragged across the bitumen surface of the car park. A strap on the bag then broke, enabling the applicant to obtain possession of it and flee the area. Within the bag was a sum of $400 in cash, two key cards, a cheque book, a diary, and a set of keys.

7After the applicant had fled, the victim attempted to stand up. When she did so, her left leg buckled underneath her and she felt what she subsequently described as ""excruciating pain"". A number of areas of skin on her arm were grazed and/or broken, causing her arm to bleed. 

8The victim's sister, along with staff from Woolworths and members of the public, came to the victim's aid. An ambulance and police were summoned, and the victim was immediately conveyed to the John Hunter Hospital at Newcastle. Upon admission to the emergency department of the hospital, she was diagnosed as having sustained a fracture of the neck of her left femur. This necessitated the victim undergoing emergency surgery the following morning, in the form of a total replacement of her left hip. 

9At the time of the offence, Nicole Berg was the girlfriend of the applicant. In an interview with police, Ms Berg stated that she had seen the applicant at about 10am on 1 January 2009, and that having left her, he later returned carrying a handbag. She told police that she did not question the applicant as to his possession of the bag, but that she saw the applicant remove money from it. Shortly after this the applicant again left, before returning with a quantity of heroin, some of which he was then seen to use. 

THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE SENTENCING JUDGE
10The applicant had pleaded guilty before the Local Court and had adhered to that plea when he appeared before the sentencing judge. In addition to the agreed facts, the applicant's criminal history was tendered. That history was lengthy, and included offences of violence. Two photographs of the victim, taken following her admission to hospital, were also tendered. They showed abrasions and grazing to her arm, consistent with her having been dragged along the bitumen surface of the car park in the manner described in the facts. The photographs obviously did not show the victim's primary injury, namely the fracture of the femur, but there was no issue that this injury was caused by the applicant's commission of the offence.

11The applicant gave short evidence before the sentencing judge. In the course of doing so he expressed contrition, which his Honour ultimately accepted as genuine. The applicant also accepted that the victim's injuries were the result of his actions, but said that he had not intended to cause any injury. He said that he had committed the offence for money in order to support his drug addiction. None of this evidence was challenged by the Crown in cross examination.

12The applicant also gave evidence that since being taken into custody on the day following the sentence (some 8 months prior) he had taken steps to obtain his School Certificate, and had undertaken a course in drug and alcohol addiction. However, he agreed in cross examination that in late 2004 he had been sentenced to a period of imprisonment in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and that whilst on parole for those matters he had undertaken drug and alcohol counselling which included his attendance at meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. He agreed that he had since relapsed, and said that he had been a user of heroin for six years.

THE SENTENCING JUDGEMENT
13Having set out the facts, the sentencing judge described the offence as a ""very serious one"" which called for a significant full time custodial sentence. His Honour spent some time detailing what he described as the applicant's ""significant criminal history"". 

14His Honour accepted the applicant's evidence that he did not intend to cause any injury to the victim. However, he observed that it would have been obvious to the applicant that the victim was an elderly lady. His Honour concluded that her injuries had resulted from ""gross recklessness"" and a ""complete lack of care"" on the part of the applicant. 

15Although he accepted the applicant's expressions of contrition as genuine, his Honour expressed doubt as to the applicant's level of insight into his offending, as well as his resolve for the future. He was therefore unable to reach any conclusion about the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.

16His Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""perhaps just below the mid-range"" and proceeded to find special circumstances, based upon the applicant's age and his need for rehabilitation. At the same time, his Honour observed that nothing could detract from the objective seriousness of the offence and that the applicant's criminal history required added prominence to be given to specific deterrence. 

17His Honour proceeded to impose a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment, with a total term of 7 1/2 years imprisonment, both of which were expressed to commence on 2 January 2009, being the date upon which the applicant was taken into custody.

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentence was manifestly excessive
Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in finding facts adverse to the applicant which it was not open to him to find, namely:
(a)the serious injuries caused to the victim were the result of the applicant dragging her along the ground;

(b)that the actions of the applicant constituted a ""vicious, cowardly attack"" upon the victim.

18Ground 2(a) was not pressed at the hearing. It is convenient that grounds 1 and 2(b) be dealt with together.

19Relevant to ground 2(b), his Honour said the following:

""As can be seen, the offence is a very serious one. The victim was an elderly and vulnerable woman. She resisted her handbag being stolen, but in the teeth of that resistance, the offender persisted to the extent that he dragged her along the ground, resulting in the serious injuries to her. Photos of the victim have been tendered. Apart from the injuries it is also obvious, and would have been obvious to the offender, that she is an elderly lady. This was a vicious, cowardly attack by a fit young man on a defenceless elderly woman. It calls for a significant full time custodial sentence"".

20It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that although it was open to the sentencing judge to find that the applicant's conduct was ""cowardly"", it was not open for him to find that it was ""vicious"". Counsel for the applicant went so far as to say that his Honour's use of the word vicious was a factual finding which was both ""overly emotive and inaccurate"". In written submissions, the Crown advanced a definition of the word ""vicious"" as meaning ""...something that is especially cruel, harsh or violent"".

21In my view, there is no substance in the submission made on behalf of the applicant. His Honour's description of the attack was neither overly emotive, nor inaccurate. The actions of the applicant in grabbing the handbag of an unsuspecting 73 year old woman, pulling her to the ground, and then dragging her across the bitumen surface of a car park with sufficient force to break the strap, thereby causing the victim significant injury, are properly regarded as cruel, harsh and violent, and therefore vicious. To reach a conclusion to the contrary would be to ignore the reality of what occurred. 

22It follows that ground 2(b) is not made out. 

23In respect of ground 1, the submissions of counsel for the applicant were centred upon:

(i)suggested mitigating factors;

(ii)the absence of any intention on the part of the applicant to cause injury; 

(iii)other sentences imposed in respect of offences contrary to ss 96 and 98 of the Crimes Act. 

24As to the first of those submissions, the mitigating factors relied upon included:

(a) the absence of any planning;
(b) the small amount of money which was taken;
(c) the fact that the applicant was not in company; and
(d) the fact that there was no weapon.

25Not all of these factors were the subject of submissions to the sentencing judge. In any event, in my view they do not, whether singularly or in combination, undermine the sentencing judge's characterisation of the seriousness of the offence as falling slightly below the mid range. 

26Counsel for the applicant placed particular emphasis on the fact that (as his Honour accepted) the applicant had no intention to cause any injury to the victim. He submitted that such an absence of intention was an important factor bearing upon the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, intention to cause injury is not an element of the offence under s. 96 with which the applicant was charged. Had there been evidence of such an intention on the part of the applicant, one presumes that he would have been charged with some other offence of which intention was an element. 

27Moreover, and accepting that the applicant did not intend to injure the victim, the injuries which were the result of his offending were nevertheless a relevant matter for the sentencing judge to take into account. There is nothing contained within his Honour's reasons which would suggest that he ascribed undue weight to that factor in the sentencing process. 

28Finally, the sentences to which this Court's attention was drawn for comparative purposes are in my view of limited value. There have been a number of observations made, by this Court as well as by the High Court, concerning the care which must be exercised when engaging in such comparisons (see for example Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 per Campbell JA at [2] and Rothman J at [34]; see also Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53] - [56]). A similarly careful approach must be exercised when analysing sentencing statistics. Moreover, the need for a careful approach is heightened in the present case, where some of the sentences with which a comparison was sought to be drawn were imposed for offences different to that with which the applicant was charged. 

29In the present case, the applicant appeared for sentence having pleaded guilty to an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. He did so in circumstances where he had a criminal history dating back some 8 years, which included entries for offences of violence including:

(i) assault occasioning bodily harm;
(ii) common assault;
(iii) resisting police officers in the execution of their duty;
(iv) destroying or damaging property; 
(v) contravening apprehended domestic violence orders; and
(vi) using an offensive weapon to prevent detention.

30Counsel for the applicant described the offending in the present case as amounting to a ""forceful bag snatch"". That, in my view, is an overly charitable description, and one which fails to give proper recognition to the objective seriousness of offending which left an innocent and elderly victim with significant injuries. 

31The nature of that offending, particularly in light of the applicant's criminal history, called for a significant measure of specific deterrence. Questions of general deterrence, as well as the need to protect the community from such behaviour, were also important factors in determining the appropriate sentence. 

32The mitigating features were essentially limited to the early plea of guilty and the applicant's expressed contrition, which his Honour found was genuine. It is clear from the sentencing remarks that his Honour had proper regard to both of those matters.

33For all of these reasons I am not persuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive and accordingly, ground 1 has not been made out.

ORDERS
34I propose the following orders:

(i) extend the time in which to file a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal;
(ii) grant leave to appeal;
(iii) dismiss the appeal.

35BUTTON J: I agree with Bellew J.

		21 November 2012",2012-11-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760494,Cross v R (No. 2) [2012] NSWCCA 234,"Judgment 

1THE COURT:Judgment was delivered in this matter on 10 September 2012: Cross v R [2012] NSWCCA 114. The issue of whether an order should be made under s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was raised but not determined pending the receipt of any further submissions the parties wished to make. This was because the Sentencing Judge made no such order and the parties did not address the matter in their submissions at the hearing of the appeal.

2The particular issue was whether s 50 mandated the making of a parole order in respect of Count 1 even where the Applicant was required to serve two further terms of imprisonment after the date of the expiry of the non-parole period in respect of Count 1. There was the further matter that the date of expiry of the non-parole period in respect of Count 1 had passed. 

3Section 50 of the Act provides:

50 Making of parole orders by court

(1)When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of 3 years or less, being a sentence that has a non-parole period, the court must make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

(2)A parole order may be made under this section even though at the time it is made it appears that the offender may not be eligible for release at the end of the non-parole period because of some other sentence to which the offender is subject.

(3)The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.

4There are some difficulties with the section that are highlighted in the present matter. In the first place, the purpose of the section is obscure. There is the further question of whether the section is directed to each individual sentence or whether it is to be applied in respect of the total sentence. If the former is the case the difficulties highlighted by the present case are apparent. 

5The better view is, however, that the section was addressed to each individual sentence that is imposed. Although sub-s (2) provides some support for that view, the sub-section may equally be addressing the position where an offender has previously been sentenced and the question of a parole order for the sentence later being imposed is under consideration. 

6There is the further difficulty of what purpose might be intended by making a parole order which cannot be effected as a result of a sentence for a further offence being imposed at the same time. That is the precise difficulty in the present case. 

7The submissions of both parties focussed on the word ""may"" in sub-s (2) to suggest that the Court had a discretion whether or not to impose a parole order in respect of Count 1. However, the use of the word ""may"" in the particular context of sub-s (2) suggests that it is a facultative provision rather than a provision which provides a discretion to the sentencing court.

8From the point of view of strict compliance with the section it is likely that a court is obliged to make a parole order notwithstanding that it cannot be complied with. One justification for so doing would be allowing for the possibility that the sentence in respect of the later offence being set aside or interfered with on appeal in such a way that the parole order imposed for the first offence takes effect. 

9Nevertheless, where, in the present case, the non-parole period for Count 1 has expired before the re-sentencing by this Court the making of a parole order in respect of Count 1 would be entirely futile. In our opinion no parole order should be made in respect of Count 1.

10The submissions on behalf of the Applicant proposed two conditions additional to those to which a parole order is automatically subject pursuant to s 128 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 as follows:

(i)The Applicant to report to the Sydney office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days of his release to parole; and

(ii)He is to accept and comply with all reasonable directions for treatment and counselling.

We consider it is appropriate that such additional conditions should be imposed in the light of the offences for which he was convicted.

11In those circumstances we propose that the sentences imposed on 10 September 2012 be varied to read as follows:

(a) In respect of Count 1 and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 9 March 2010 and expiring 8 September 2011 with a balance of term of 6 months;
(b) In respect of Count 2 and taking into account the matter on the Form 16BA, a fixed term of 15 months commencing 9 June 2011 and expiring 8 September 2012;

(c) In respect of Count 3, a non-parole period of 3 months commencing 9 September 2012 and expiring 8 December 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring 8 September 2015. 

(d) Direct that the Applicant be released to parole on 8 December 2012 with the following additional conditions:

(i)The Applicant to report to the Sydney office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days of his release to parole; and

(ii)He is to accept and comply with all reasonable directions for treatment and counselling.

		21 November 2012",2012-11-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760495,Foster v Tolco Pty Limited [2012] NSWSC 1395,"Judgment
Introduction
1By amended statement of claim, filed in court on 12 November 2012, Craig Foster (the plaintiff) claims damages against Tolco Pty Ltd (the defendant) in negligence for injuries to his shoulder and back allegedly sustained in an incident at work on 18 January 2008.
2The plaintiff was employed by Downer Engineering (Downer) as an electrical trades assistant on the Bluescope site at Port Kembla (the Site), where a liquid nitrogen plant was being installed. On 18 January 2008 he was using an elevated work platform (EWP) to lay cable dividers in trays which were attached to the wall at height. He was working with Mitchell Keepin, who was also in an EWP and doing the same task, but further along the wall from where the plaintiff was working. Mr Keepin was in an EWP owned by Downer. The plaintiff was working in an EWP owned by the defendant.
3Although the defendant and its employees had substantially left the Site before Christmas 2007, when the Site closed for about a fortnight, it left its EWP there and permitted its subcontractor, Prokote, to use its EWP to perform painting work. On 18 January 2008, the defendant's EWP was not being used by Prokote. The evidence does not establish that there was any contractual relationship between the defendant and Downer. There is no evidence that Downer was authorised to use the defendant's EWP.
4A Site Safety Management Plan dated 24 April 2007, which appears to be a draft document prepared by the defendant, makes provision, by clause 14, for reporting of injuries or accidents. Clause 25.1 provides that the Site Supervisor has obligations with respect to the safety of plant and equipment.
Liability
Duty owed by the defendant and application of the Civil Liability Act
5The Civil Liability Act 2002 (the Act) applies to the plaintiff's claim since it is a claim for damages for harm alleged to have resulted from the negligence of the defendant. 6Section 5B of the Act provides:
""5B   General principles
(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless: 
(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and
(b) the risk was not insignificant, and
(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.
(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things): 
(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,
(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,
(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,
(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.""
7The relevant risk for the purposes of s 5B of the Act was that someone using the EWP might suffer injury if there was a defect in the machine which caused the basket to drop suddenly and without warning. The risk was foreseeable and not insignificant. The precautions which reasonable care would require be taken would include proper and timely maintenance in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements and adherence to relevant standards.
8In circumstances where it is reasonably foreseeable that a piece of machinery will be used on a site by others, the owner of the machinery owes a duty of care to persons working on the site who might reasonably be expected to use the machinery. The defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff in its capacity as the owner of the EWP. It was not responsible for any system of work, failures by the plaintiff's employer or failures by anyone else on site.
The mechanism of the incident
9The mechanism of the incident the subject of the proceedings is in issue.
10There were two persons present when the incident occurred: the plaintiff and his co-worker, Mr Keepin. The defendant also relied on circumstantial evidence to establish that the incident could not have occurred in the way the plaintiff said it did.
The plaintiff's evidence
11The plaintiff gave evidence that on 18 January 2008, he was working on an EWP at an altitude 1.5 m higher than the EWP being used by Mr Keepin. He said that, at about 1.30 pm -1.45 pm, having worked on the EWP since about 1.00 pm, the basket of his EWP suddenly went into ""free fall"" and fell some 1.5 m. Its descent was broken as it collided with Mr Keepin's EWP.
12Both Mr Keepin and the plaintiff gave evidence that after the collision, the plaintiff climbed into Mr Keepin's EWP, which was then lowered to the ground. The plaintiff then went to the ground-controls of his EWP and lowered it to the ground.
13The fault which had allegedly caused the EWP to ""free fall"" could not be replicated, either then or at any other time.
14The plaintiff's evidence was that prior to this incident, he had turned the engine of his EWP off because he was working with the dividers and wanted his EWP to be stationary while he was doing so. He said that his EWP had a dead man's pedal on the floor of the basket and that the machine could not be operated unless he stepped onto the pedal through an opening in the pedal cover and applied pressure. As referred to below, his counsel conceded in final submissions that the EWP that the plaintiff was using did not in fact have a dead man's pedal.
Mr Keepin's evidence
15Mr Keepin gave evidence that his EWP had initially been at the same height as the plaintiff's on 18 January 2008. Mr Keepin said that the engine of his own EWP was off at the time but that he was not sure whether the engine of the plaintiff's EWP was off. Mr Keepin had not seen the plaintiff move his EWP to a higher position than his or heard the noise of the defendant's EWP being switched on. The last time he saw the plaintiff, the plaintiff was operating the basket at the same level as his basket. He did not have a conversation with the plaintiff about what had happened until after he had disentangled his basket from the plaintiff's basket.
16Although Mr Keepin says that he assumed immediately that the plaintiff's basket had ""free fallen"" and had only come to rest when it had become entangled with his basket, I accept the defendant's submission that his subsequent conduct is inconsistent with any such assumption. Despite the risk that the plaintiff's EWP would continue to fall, Mr Keepin merely lowered his basket to the ground, although he thereby withdrew support from the plaintiff's EWP. Had Mr Keepin truly believed the basket had been in some ""free fall"" prior to lodging on Mr Keepin's basket, he would, in my view, have acted with greater circumspection.
17Mr Keepin said that his EWP had a dead man's pedal at the base of the basket but he was unsure whether the plaintiff's had such a device at the base of its basket.
18In contrast to the plaintiff, Mr Keepin had no particular interest in telling anything except that which he recalled. He bore neither animus or affection towards the plaintiff or the defendant. He made assumptions in favour of the plaintiff but this was borne of his understandable preference for accepting what he was told by a co-worker. His evidence, which was given in a straightforward way, was broadly consistent with a statement he had given on 29 January 2008.
19The differences between his oral evidence and the statement related to assumptions he had made in the plaintiff's favour: including that the engine of the EWP in which the plaintiff had been working had been turned off. Mr Keepin explained that he had assumed that the plaintiff's EWP was off because his own was, and because the machines did not need to be on while the work on the dividers was being done. He said that it was contrary to proper procedures to have the machine on when it was not required to be in motion. The following exchange shows the extent to which Mr Keepin gave the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt:
""Q. You had no reason to think at the time, did you, Mr Keepin, that Craig's basket had, using your word, collapsed because you hadn't seen what had happened? A. Well, no, but given the distance that Craig and I were working apart, I wouldn't think he would have turned the control and crashed into me.""
20The evidence did not resolve any question of what might have caused the plaintiff to elevate his EWP to a height 1.5 m above Mr Keepin's when they were working on the same cable tray, but I do not find that the plaintiff had no reason to elevate his EWP since this was not put to him.
21Mr Keepin did not consider either of them to be in any immediate danger after the baskets collided and observed that when he was in his basket, the basket of the plaintiff's EWP was stationary. I infer from this observation that any force that had operated on the basket of the plaintiff's EWP had ceased to be operative by this time.
22In his statement, which is dated 30 January 2008, the day after Mr Keepin's, the plaintiff estimated the height at which he was working to have been 16 m. He also referred to a distance of 1.5 m, but in the following context:
""The bucket [basket] fell (approx) 1.5 ms down.
The bucket came to rest on Mitch Keepin's EWP bucket.""
23In this context, the plaintiff's statement is self-serving: if the basket of his EWP fell from a height, then the plaintiff could reasonably attribute blame to a fault in the EWP, which rendered the basket susceptible to the forces of gravity.
The plaintiff's credibility
24My assessment of the plaintiff is that he is unreliable. I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence except where it amounts to a statement against interest, is not seriously in dispute or where it is corroborated. I have formed this impression as a result of the following:
(1)The plaintiff's confidence in giving evidence about particular facts which were later conceded to be wrong, or contrary to the evidence;
(2)The difficulty, if not impossibility, of reconciling his version with objective facts and probabilities (addressed further below);
(3)The genesis of the proceedings and admissions made by the plaintiff as to his motive for the proceedings; and
(4)The disparity between the plaintiff as he presented in his examination in chief and how he appeared in still photographs and video surveillance when he was unaware that he was being observed.
25I am satisfied that the plaintiff gave the following evidence, which he later conceded either to be wrong, or contrary to other evidence.
26First, the EWP that he was using was blue. I do not regard this error as particularly material to the colour of the machine as evidence of colour is notoriously unreliable.
27Secondly, the plaintiff's senior counsel conceded in final address that, contrary to the plaintiff's own evidence, the defendant's EWP did not have a dead man's pedal.
28Thirdly, prior to the incident, the plaintiff had used the defendant's EWP many times for months, up to 30 hours a week, and that every time he used it he filled in the log book, which, as a ticketed operator, he was obliged to do. The logbook for the EWP shows a continuous record from 23 November 2007 until 17 January 2008. The first time the plaintiff signed the logbook was in respect of 18 January 2008. I do not accept that the plaintiff had ever used the defendant's EWP before 18 January 2008. I am not satisfied that the plaintiff filled in the logbook as he was required to do before he started to use the EWP on 18 January 2008. I do not accept his explanation for the gap between the entries up to and including 17 January 2008. However, nothing turns on this since it is accepted that the plaintiff was using the defendant's EWP on 18 January 2008.
29Fourthly, the plaintiff said that on the day before the incident he had been sharing the Downer EWP with Mr Keepin. Mr Keepin disagreed. I accept Mr Keepin's evidence.
30The other critical parts of the plaintiffs evidence were that he moved the basket above Mr Keepin's, that he turned his EWP off, that he did not touch the controls and that his basket went into a ""free fall"", that is, fell without warning. I do not accept any of these matters.
31In support of the plaintiff's assertion that the machine was turned off, he called evidence from Mr Keepin. Mr Keepin was asked in chief whether both machines were switched off at the time. He said without qualification that they were. It emerged, in cross-examination, that Mr Keepin:
(1)did not know whether the plaintiff's machine was on or off;
(2)had not seen it move to a position higher than where he had been working in his own EWP; and
(3)despite his evidence in chief that the machine made a loud noise when switched on, he had not heard the machine being turned on.
32The genesis of these proceedings also bears on the plaintiff's credibility. From time to time from 18 January 2008, the plaintiff was paid his wage although he took time off work. He did not at first submit a workers compensation claim. He submitted various medical certificates, which he obtained from Dr Bowman whom he had seen since the Wednesday following the incident. On 10 June 2009, Dr Bowman certified that the plaintiff was fit for his usual duties.
33The plaintiff attended a meeting with representatives of Downer on 12 June 2009, who explained that there had been a downturn in work which resulted in many people being retrenched, including foremen, electricians, boilermakers as well as trades assistants. The minutes of the meeting record that it was explained:
""That we have supported Craig Foster throughout his long recovery and return to work but, unfortunately, we have had to let him go."" 
34Not long after this meeting, the plaintiff submitted a workers compensation claim to Downer which forwarded it to its insurer, Allianz.
35By statement of claim filed on 29 July 2009, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the District Court, claiming: ""Damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit"".
36On 27 August 2009, the plaintiff was referred by Allianz to IOH for vocational assessment. The report of the assessment identifies several ""psychosocial considerations"" including the following:
""Compensation issues:Lack of financial incentive to return to work. Mr Foster advised that even though he needs to earn $800/week to keep his house, he has been advised by his Solicitor that even if he is awarded only half of what they are asking for in compensation, he will be able to retire and his wife will receive some payments for the care she needs to provide him, and his daughter will receive some payments until she is 16 years of age to compensate her for her father's lack of ability to teach her certain skills, transport her to and from activities etc
Mr Foster has engaged a solicitor who appears to be very confident of a financial wind-fall for Mr Foster and Mr Foster shares this confidence.
Treatment and diagnosis... he consulted a Solicitor to see if it was worth pursuing legal action but decided against it, but now that he has been sacked, he is 'going for the lot!'
Return to workMr Foster is angry about his termination and this, coupled with his perception of mis-diagnosis immediately post injury, has him determined to seek compensation
BehaviourMr Foster explained that he has withdrawn from doing any physical activity around the home for fear that this will jeopardise his claim for compensation. ""I know I could mow lawns but the Solicitor has told me even if you feel you can, don't because the Insurance Company is after you""
37I accept the record of the plaintiff's statements in this report as accurate. To the extent to which the plaintiff does not admit that he made the statements, denies that he made them, or does not recall making them, I reject his evidence.
38The undoubted financial motivation the plaintiff has to obtain a ""financial windfall"", coupled with his desire to take revenge for his dismissal (even against the defendant, who was not in any way associated with it or implicated in it) together with his willingness to conceal his true capacity for work so as to enhance his prospects of obtaining a substantial windfall are amply revealed by these admissions.
39For example, he told Dr Millons in July 2012 that there had been no change in his condition for a long time and adhered to that statement in his evidence in court. He told Dr Ng that he had no prior condition in his right shoulder although the clinical records of his general practitioner record a suspected rotator cuff syndrome some years ago.
40The facts do not accord with the plaintiff's hypothesis. The plaintiff, a relatively slight man, had difficulties with his back, shoulder and knees before the incident, which may well have been made worse by the heavy lifting and bending that he was required to do in the course of his own landscaping business. For example, when he presented to Dr Cheyne on 18 December 2001, he complained of shoulder and knee pain which had been going on for 10 years. Furthermore, he had presented to his general practitioner, Dr Healey, on 4 September 2007, about four months prior to the incident, complaining of depression, for which he was prescribed Zoloft. Dr Haber performed an operation on the plaintiff's right shoulder on 4 July 2008. On review six weeks afterwards, he was found to be making a good recovery.
41The defendant obtained video surveillance of the plaintiff which was taken in June 2012. It showed the plaintiff using his utility to move house. The plaintiff loaded and unloaded the utility three times. He was assisted by his father-in-law and his brother-in-law. The work involved the plaintiff lifting a trampoline and a lawnmower and various other items. On occasions the plaintiff lifted with what he described as ""correct posture"" and on other occasions he lifted by bending his back which he accepted was not the correct posture. There was no indication on the video that the plaintiff was in any discomfort or that the tasks he was performing caused him any difficulty.
42The plaintiff objected to the film on the basis that it had not been served. I considered that the defendant had a legitimate forensic purpose in not revealing the film: namely, to test the plaintiff's credibility. The capacity of a claimant for compensation to tailor evidence so as to accommodate video surveillance which has been disclosed is well known. As was successfully argued in Australian Postal Commission v Hayes [1989] FCA 176; 87 ALR 283 at 290, per Wilcox J, it is important that:
""a mendacious witness not be aware of the material available to the cross-examiner to contradict the evidence under manufacture.""
43That the plaintiff, when particular activities were put to him, was prepared to admit that he could undertake them, did not enhance his credibility. Rather it demonstrated that the plaintiff approached this litigation as if it were a contest in which, if he did not get caught out, he would be awarded substantial damages. The significant matter is that in his evidence in chief, he came across as a broken man, who was depressed and disabled and whose life was, effectively, over. After cross-examination, I was left with the impression that the plaintiff could, in large measure, do whatever he wanted to do physically, and to the extent to which he chose not to, this was a result either of the limitations of his natural physique or his fear of exposure before the proceedings had been concluded.
44The plaintiff was evasive, defensive and belligerent in the course of being shown the video surveillance. The following exchange in his cross-examination indicates, but does not fully capture, the extent of his attitude:
""Q. That is you driving the ute with the lawnmower in the back, Mr Foster? A. I suppose it was but I don't know if it was a lawnmower. I couldn't tell you that. 
Q. Didn't you see yourself in the film lifting with another person the lawnmower in the back of the ute? A. I didn't. You can replay it.""
45The plaintiff was not prepared to make any admission that he was not required to make. His vagueness about the events of June 2012 was, at best, implausible, as the following exchange illustrates:
""Q. Would you agree, Mr Foster, you are loading up your ute again?  A. I can't see from - I don't know. 
Q. Don't you remember? A. I couldn't tell you. 
Q. Is this your second or third trip for the morning? A. I couldn't tell you that.""
46The gross exaggeration of symptoms and incapacity was inconsistent with Dr Healey's interpretation of the MRI and CT scan which showed degenerative changes which manifested themselves in what Dr Healey described as ""mechanical back pain"" rather than radicular pain, since there was no nerve root involvement. Although Dr Healey considered that the changes were more significant than one would have normally expected of someone of the plaintiff's age, I am not satisfied that these changes could reasonably be attributed to an incident in which the plaintiff was jolted but did not fall; as distinct from other activities including years of working as a landscape gardener in the family business.
47Dr Healey was shown the parts of the video surveillance film, which depicted the plaintiff lifting a lawnmower and a trampoline with the assistance of other men. The following exchange occurred in his cross-examination:
""... Is that behaviour consistent with the way the plaintiff has been presenting to you over the past two years? A. I would have thought that Mr Foster would have difficulty with carrying on activity like that with the level of pain that he presents with when he sees me."" 
48The plaintiff demonstrated in the witness box that he could squat. Still photographs that were tendered show that he is able to crouch and sit on his haunches when having a discussion with people sitting on the grass.
49The plaintiff's evidence did not become more credible by reason of any evidence his wife gave. She was evasive, circumspect and had adopted the same false hypothesis for which the plaintiff contended. For example, she said of her knowledge of any medication the plaintiff was taking prior to January 2008, that the plaintiff was prescribed Zoloft but ""never took that medication"". The following exchanges occurred in her cross-examination:
""Q. Leaving aside that medication what other sort of medication had he been taking in the years before this particular incident?  A. Not anything that really I am aware of to be honest. 
Q. Nothing at all? A. Going back such a long way, I am not sure I am really not.
...
Q. You said in answer to a question from Mr Lidden when asked about the period before January 2008 medication you said he never took anything, remember saying that? A. Yeah, not that I was aware of. 
Q. Weren't you aware of it in terms of Panadeine Forte, Zoloft, you say he didn't take Zoloft, Panadeine Forte and Voltaren, weren't they prescribed mediation he has been taking? A. Yeah, he come home and said he had to take these and I said, okay, fine. I didn't really take much notice to be honest. 
Q. I am wondering when Mr Lidden asked you before January 2008 your husband had been taking medication, I am just asking your explanation Mrs Foster why you said he didn't take anything, if you knew he had been taking Panadeine Forte and Voltaren? A. I am not sure.""
50While this may be an understandable reaction of a loyal spouse, it did not advance the plaintiff's case, because I do not accept her evidence except either where it is against interest or corroborated by a source other than the plaintiff.
51The plaintiff was not a reliable witness. Whether consciously, as the admissions above suggest, or subconsciously, the plaintiff has constructed a hypothesis of his life whereby everything was fine prior to the incident with the EWP and he has been in constant pain since then.
52The plaintiff falls, in my view, into the category described by Lord Pearce in Onassis v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyds Rep 403 at 431:
""Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active.""
Expert evidence: the mechanisms of the incident
53Dr Shafaghi, who was retained by the plaintiff, and Mr Stewart, who was retained by the defendant, prepared reports which were tendered. They gave concurrent evidence. They were both qualified to give opinion evidence as to the cause of the alleged malfunction of the EWP. Mr Stewart's qualifications, however, were more germane since he is, and was, an active member of and represented the Institute of Engineers on numerous relevant working committees for aspects of the principal relevant standards: AS1418 and AS2550.
54The plaintiff's version of the incident, which formed the basis of the experts' opinion, was reduced to four fundamental propositions:
(1)There was a dead man's pedal on the base of the basket of the EWP;
(2)The engine was off;
(3)The plaintiff was not operating the controls; and
(4)The basket of the EWP went into ""free fall"" for 1.5 m.
55As referred to above, (1) is conceded to be wrong and I am not satisfied of any of (2), (3) or (4).
56The experts agreed that:
(1)There are various ways in which the incident could have occurred if, contrary to the plaintiff's evidence, he had been operating the controls of the EWP, including operator error; and
(2)There is no credible and available hypothesis which can explain the incident occurring in the way the plaintiff described it in circumstances where the plaintiff was not operating any of the controls.
57The differences between the experts were not substantial. Mr Stewart opined that it was impossible for the incident to have occurred in the way the plaintiff described. Dr Shafaghi opined that although he could not conceive of a hypothesis which was consistent with the plaintiff's version he did not consider that he had made sufficient enquiries or conducted sufficient investigations to say that it was impossible.
58Furthermore, Dr Stuart has identified, in a positive way, why the incident could not have occurred as the plaintiff maintained. There is a check valve which is a failsafe device. There is no evidence that the check valve was not working at any time prior to the incident or not working after the incident. There is no evidence of any defect being discovered with the check valve. If the EWP was turned off, the check valve prevents movement of the boom and hence the basket. There is no foundation in the evidence for the allegation in the particulars of negligence of pockets of air in the hydraulics system, or a failure to bleed the hydraulic system of air.
Maintenance of the EWP
59The plaintiff's case was advanced on the basis of failure by the defendant to maintain the EWP adequately in circumstances where it was reasonably foreseeable that such machinery would be used on site by the plaintiff.
60The defendant relied on evidence of the maintenance history and provenance of the EWP as well as the defendant's response to the incident.
Evidence as to the provenance of the EWP
61The evidence established the following:
(1)The relevant EWP was purchased from its manufacturer, Haulotte, for $77,700 by Millennium Access Rentals (MAR) in March 2004;
(2)Periodic maintenance inspections were conducted on the EWP while it was owned by MAR and records were kept. The last such record was a record of a quarterly maintenance inspection conducted on 16 April 2007;
(3)In May 2007, MAR sold the EWP to Genie Australia (Genie) for $58,300;
(4)The defendant purchased the EWP at an auction conducted by Pickles Auction House on 16 November 2007 for $22,000;
(5)The maintenance records for the EWP were not made available at the time of purchase or auction, or subsequently, although the defendant had requested them;
(6)The logbook which accompanied the EWP when it was sold to the defendant recorded that a quarterly inspection had been carried out by MAR on 10 May 2007 at 1707 hours and an annual inspection had been carried out on 30 October 2007 at 1770 hours. There is no maintenance inspection resport that corresponds with the logbook entry for 10 May 2007. The report most proximate in time is a report dated 16 April 2007 which records the hourmeter at 1899.
(7)A document entitled ""Risk Management Report"" was provided to the defendant by Pickles Auctions upon purchase of the EWP. It contained warnings that the item was sold in an ""as is"" condition with known and unknown safety hazards. Included amongst numerous caveats was the following, which was said to have a ""date due"" of 14 November 2007:
""This item of plant is not to be used until a structural engineer inspects this item for mechanical soundness and certifies this item of plant safe to be used for its intended purpose. It is recommended that before any sale of this item of plant a new inspection and certification take place by a qualified and competent structural engineer.""
(8)An inspection of the EWP was conducted by Mr Chinnock, an engineer engaged by Bluescope, on 21 November 2007. The report of the inspection noted:
""Partial inspection only due to failure of units battery, no functionally [sic] testing was carried out. The unit has recently undergone and [sic] annual inspection with no problems detected"";
I accept on the basis of this business record that the EWP had, as at 21 November ""recently undergone"" an annual inspection and that no problems were detected. There were discrepancies in the record of the hourmeter of the EWP which are evident from a comparison of the maintenance reports kept by MAR and the logbook which accompanied the EWP;
(9)An annual inspection was, at least for the first ten years of an EWP's life, the most rigorous safety and maintenance inspection to which an EWP would be required to be subjected;
(10)By memorandum dated 23 November 2007, Bluescope wrote to the Defendant in the following terms concerning the EWP:
""The rectification work listed in the attached report is required to bring the unit up to satisfactory operating standard. As detailed in the 1998 revision of the Mobile Crane Entry and Operating conditions, a re-inspection would normally be required.
However in the option of the Crane Engineer, the items listed do not appear to significantly conpromise [sic] the unit's safety. You are hence given the opportunity to undertake these repairs without the need for a re-inspection. To avail yourself of this opportunity, it is necessary to return the attached declaration WITHIN FOUR WEEKS of the date of this letter. If the declaration, or an acceptable explanation requesting an extention [sic] is not received within this period, a re-inspection will be required with an additional fee paid"";
(11)By memorandum dated 12 December 2007, Mr Paine, the defendant's operations co-ordinator/manager, on behalf of the defendant, certified as follows:
""All items listed on the attached inspection report have been effectively repaired and subsequently inspected by a qualified person. The unit is now in serviceable condition and complies with safety requirements"";
(12)A Bluescope Crane Incident Investigation Report, dated 9 March 2010, referred to the incident as having occurred on 11 January 2008 (although it obviously concerns the subject incident). The report recorded the testing to which the EWP had been subjected and that no problems had been detected;
(13)In may 2009, it was reported that the EWP had a fault ""as boom creeping down"". This was unable to be replicated. As neither expert considered this to be of any significance, I propose to disregard it as irrelevant.
Evidence as to the defendant's response to the incident
62After the incident, Mr Blackman, the project manager engaged by the defendant, attended the Site. As far as he could see, there was no damage to the EWP. There was no oil spill or anything that he could observe.
63The EWP was subsequently taken off site and delivered to the defendant's premises. It was inspected and tested by Mr Paine. No defect was found and the alleged fault could not be replicated.
64The EWP remained at the premises of the defendant until it was inspected by Bluescope and Haulotte. Also at this time, Haulotte undertook its yearly inspection. 
65According to extracts tendered from its logbook, which I accept to be accurate, this EWP had had an annual inspection on 30 October 2007. Nonetheless, it underwent another annual inspection and safety check, carried out by Haulotte on 8 February 2008 at the defendant's request on the defendant's premises. Dr Shafaghi accepted that Haulotte would be the most expert and suitable organisation to carry out any inspection of the EWP. Of the matters identified in the course of the inspection, none was related to anything that could be associated with the incident involving the plaintiff. No fault or defect could be found which would explain the type of event suggested by the plaintiff.
66Nor did Haulotte, in the report of the annual machine inspection, note that any modification had been made to any aspect of the EWP. I infer from the absence of comment in the report that that no modifications had been made to the machine since its manufacture. The significance of this finding is that the plaintiff's case, up until final address, depended on there having been a dead man's pedal in the base of the basket (that being his unequivocal evidence) which had been removed before 8 February 2008 and the fault which allegedly caused the incident having been repaired prior to that time.
Expert evidence: maintenance of the EWP
67Dr Shafaghi and Mr Stewart both gave evidence as to the degree of maintenance required of a recently acquired EWP such as the one used by the plaintiff on the day of the incident.
68There is no evidence of failure to comply with any standard or regulation in respect of servicing and maintenance. All that has been alleged was that the service records were somehow deficient. The documents as to prior servicing came from subpoenas rather than from the defendant. Mr Paine said his attempts to get them at the time of purchase were unsuccessful. The defendant has not been shown to be aware of any deficiency in maintenance records at the time of purchase.
69The extracts of the log book refer specifically to a service in May 2007 and the annual inspection having been carried out in October 2007, shortly before the defendant purchased it. As is evident from the Bluesope inspection and report dated 21 November 2007, the reference to the recent annual inspection was sufficient for Bluescope's purposes. I reject the plaintiff's submission that the defendant, by its staff, was either naïve or foolish to accept what was recorded in a logbook.
70Mr Paine was very familiar with these types of machines, having 28 years of relevant experience. He tested the operation of the machine before sending it to the Site. He knew that Bluesope's Mr Chinnock was an engineer and that Bluescope would not allow it to be used on the site without it carrying out its own assessment. He knew that Bluescope had approved its use. In my view, nothing more was reasonably required of him.
71In any event, the EWP had its annual inspection by the manufacturer in February 2008. No fault was found which could explain what the plaintiff says happened. As such, it must follow that, even if such annual inspection or some special inspection had taken place in November or December 2007, no such fault would have been found. The experts agreed with this. It further follows that, even if the battery was not flat when Bluescope tested the machine in November 2007, no such fault would have been found. The defendant does not bear the onus of proving a negative. The plaintiff bears the onus of establishing all facts relevant to causation: s 5E of the Act.
Res ipsa loquitur
72The plaintiff submitted that the principal of res ipsa loquitur applied and that I ought infer negligence from the freefall of the EWP. There are two fundamental difficulties with this submission: first, the maxim is not applicable in the case of complex machinery: Shellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited [2000] HCA 18; 200 CLR 121. Furthermore, I am not, for the reasons given above, satisfied that the engine of the plaintiff's EWP was off. Unless the machine was off, there are many ways in which the basket could have dropped, which do not involve negligence on the part of the defendant.
Credibility of the plaintiff's case
73Aside from the plaintiff's own lack of credibility, there were aspects of his case which were unsatisfactory.
Concession that there was no dead man's pedal
74As referred to above, the plaintiff maintained, until addresses, that the defendant's EWP had a dead man's pedal, at which point it was conceded that the EWP did not. While forensic decisions ought involve proper considerations in the course of litigation, the presence of a dead man's pedal as at 18 January 2008 and its later removal formed a substantial consideration in the expert's evidence and in the plaintiff's allegation that the defendant had behaved in an underhanded way.
75The plaintiff engaged three experts: Dr Gillies, Dr Adams and Dr Shafaghi. He relied only on one, Dr Shafaghi. Dr Shafaghi was instructed that the incident occurred as alleged by the plaintiff and that the defendant had removed the dead man's pedal after the incident.
76The belated concession that there was no dead man's pedal revealed, in my view, the extent to which the plaintiff's case was a construct borne of opportunism.
Allegations of dishonesty for which there was no substantial basis
77The plaintiff's counsel made several serious allegations of dishonesty against the defendant and others in support of various of his submissions, none of which had any substantial basis. 
Allegation that the defendant had concealed or deliberately destroyed the logbook
78The plaintiff's counsel submitted that I ought infer that the EWP's original logbook had been disposed of or concealed by the defendant and that only certain pages had been made available because the balance would harm the defendant's case and that I ought draw inferences against the defendant on that basis. The plaintiff relied on the defendant's obligation imposed by reg 143(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 to keep records of ""any tests, maintenance, inspections, commissioning or alteration of plant relevant to controlling risks arising from the plant"", since its employees used the plant.
79Had there been evidence that the defendant's destruction or non-production of the original logbook was deliberate, such an inference might have been available. However, not only is there no evidence to support this proposition, there is some evidence to the contrary. The defendant tendered a facsimile cover sheet dated 30 January 2008 from Paul Sunshine of Downer to Mr Blackman, the defendant's project manager to which was attached photocopies of certain pages of the EWP's logbook. These pages are the same pages that have been tendered in these proceedings. I infer that the original logbook, as at the time of the facsimile, was not in the possession of the defendant and was in the possession of Downer. Since Downer was the plaintiff's employer, Downer had a legitimate interest in examining the logbook for its own investigations. Approximately 18 months had passed from the time of the incident until the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant. Until that time, the defendant had no forensic interest in the location of the original logbook. Although it is possible that the defendant was in breach of reg 143(1) by not retaining the log book, whether by inadvertence or any other reason, the obligation imposed by reg 143 does not, in terms, require retention of a log book per se. Other evidence indicates that the defendant kept maintenance records in respect of the EWP since its acquisition.
80In these circumstances I do not consider there to be any basis to draw the inference for which the plaintiff contended.
Discrepancy in the record of hourmeter and date of quarterly inspection
81The plaintiff also submitted that the defendant ought to have inferred that the EWP was defective because there was a discrepancy in the date of the most recent quarterly inspection when it was transferred from MAR to Genie and that there was a record of the hourmeter showing the number of hours decreasing rather than increasing, which the defendant ought to have assumed was fraudulent. I accept the defendant's submission that there is no evidence that the defendant was aware of the discrepancy at the time of purchase, or indeed at any time prior to the date on which the documents subpoenaed from MAR were produced.
82The plaintiff also submitted that I ought infer that the defendant had secretly altered the EWP between 21 January 2008 and 8 February 2008 when it was inspected at the defendant's premises by its manufacturer. It was common ground between the experts that any such alterations as had been suggested would require an electrical engineer to perform them.
83I do not consider there to be any basis on which I could draw such an inference. The bases for the allegation that the machine was altered was: first, that the dead man's pedal had been removed before the time of the inspection on 8 February 2008; and secondly, that the incident could not have happened if the EWP had been as it was on inspection on 8 February 2008. The plaintiff is not only generally unreliable in respect of many aspects of his evidence, but he is also wrong about several matters germane to the EWP. Furthermore, to accept the allegation I would have to find that the defendant's witnesses lied in their evidence. Such a finding would be contrary to my impression of each of them: namely that they were honest and reliable witnesses who, though they were, or had been, associated with the defendant, were relevantly disinterested.
Findings on liability
84I am not satisfied that the incident occurred as the plaintiff described. I am not satisfied that the engine of his EWP was off at the time of the collision.
85For the reasons set out it is possible that the plaintiff had omitted to turn the engine of the EWP off when he started to work on the dividers in the cable tray. He may have endeavoured to move his EWP sideways and made an error of judgment which led his basket to collide with that of Mr Keepin's. However, since the plaintiff has not established his version of how the incident occurred, it is not only unnecessary to speculate how it happened, but also it would be inconsistent with the nature of adversary litigation were I to do so.
86In any event, even were I to accept the plaintiff's version of events, which I do not, the EWP complied with all standards and regulations. 
87The plaintiff has not established that the defendant failed to take care. Nor has he established what the defendant should have done in the exercise of reasonable care which would have prevented the injuries to the plaintiff as required by s 5D of the Act. The plaintiff has established neither negligence nor causation.
Damages
88I am obliged to assess damages on the basis that liability has, contrary to my findings, been established: Wolfenden v International Theme Park Pty Ltd (Trading As Wonderland) and Anor [2008] NSWCA 78 at [6], per Giles JA. The assessment is largely influenced by the impression I have formed of the plaintiff.
89The plaintiff was born on 29 July 1967. He left school in Year 10. His work history was not continuous. He joined the Army in June 1987 but was discharged in October 1988. In 1989 he obtained subcontract labouring work. In 1990 he set up his own landscaping business which he conducted from 1990 until 2003. It was conducted in association with other family members: his father, a builder, and his brother-in-law, a horticulturalist. He reported in the course of a vocational assessment, and I accept, that he:
""Closed [the] business because he grew tired of chasing money and long, physical hours.""
90Since 2003, the plaintiff has not engaged in heavy physical work.
91The plaintiff was employed by Downer from August 2004, but not continuously. He had periods off work due to coccyx bruising and lumbar back strains in 2005.
92The plaintiff suffered from pre-existing problems in his right shoulder. He did not inform any of the doctors that he saw for the purposes of this case, including for treatment, of this earlier right shoulder problem. The problem attributed to the incident was in the same area as prior complaints. The plaintiff admitted in evidence in chief that his shoulder was not much of a problem and that he had regained 95% use of it. In cross-examination he admitted that he had no problems with his right shoulder. That was borne out by the film.
93Notwithstanding my reservations about the plaintiff's credibility, I accept that the plaintiff sustained the injury to his right shoulder in the incident. Dr Haber performed an arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder on 4 July 2008. I find that he made a full recovery from his right shoulder injury prior to the termination of his employment in June 2009.
94On the basis that the plaintiff complained of back pain when he first saw the doctors five days after the incident I accept that the plaintiff injured his back.
95The plaintiff's employment was terminated in June 2009 when he was certified fit to return to full duties by Dr Bowman. I find that any residual incapacity post-termination arises from the plaintiff's back complaint.
96Dr Healey, the plaintiff's general practitioner, does not consider that he needed to be referred to a specialist for treatment. His pain is mechanical rather than radicular. The plaintiff grossly exaggerated his level of complaint. The film showed the plaintiff to be able to load and unload and carry heavy objects. I assess the plaintiff's back problem to be relatively mild.
97I reject the plaintiff's submission that I am bound to accept the medical evidence when it is based on a false, inaccurate or incomplete history. Whether the disparity renders the opinion of no utility or whether the opinion still has value is a question for the court's judgment: Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; 108 CLR 642; Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd  [1985] HCA 58; 59 ALJR 844. Insofar as the plaintiff submitted that Strinic v Singh [2009] NSWCA 15; 74 NSWLR 419 is to the contrary, I reject his submission.
98There is no obligation on the defendant to request that all the medical practitioners consider a different set of facts or a different history or different level of complaints. Whether to call practitioners in reply to put a more accurate foundation to them is a forensic decision for plaintiff's counsel. Plaintiff's counsel obviously decided against that course in the instant case.
99The defendant conceded, properly in my view, that the evidence does not establish that the plaintiff suffered from any pre-existing back condition of such significance that any back problems can be attributed to any earlier incident, or to a pre-existing condition. Accordingly, it has not discharged the Watts v Rake [1960] HCA 58; 108 CLR 158 onus.
100On this basis, I find that the plaintiff, as a result of the incident, suffers from an ongoing diminution in earning capacity and that he is, and will be, unable to perform heavy manual work. The extent to which this diminution has produced, or is likely to be productive of, economic loss is difficult to determine.
101As at the date of the incident, the plaintiff was already 40 years old. I do not consider that there was a substantial prospect that he would, but for the incident, have undertaken heavy physical work on any sustained basis. However, his reduced ability to do so sounds in some measure of damages.
Non-economic loss
102I assess non-economic loss at 25% of the most extreme case.
Past loss of earning capacity
103It is agreed that before the incident the plaintiff earned $929 net per week.
104In the period from the date of the incident to the date of trial, the plaintiff earned a total of $153,883: $102,435 by way of workers' compensation payments and $51,448 by way of income for work performed. He did not perform any remunerative work for anyone other than Downer and he has not performed any remunerative work at all since he was dismissed in June 2009.
105I allow, from 18 January 2008 to June 2009, $35,000 for past loss of earning capacity including superannuation, which is broadly equivalent to an average loss of $400 net per week for that period plus superannuation.
106I allow, from June 2009 to present, an amount of $30,000 for past loss of earning capacity including superannuation to an average loss of $150 net per week plus superannuation at 11%.
Future loss of earning capacity
107For future loss of earning capacity and future superannuation, I allow a buffer of $60,000 since I consider the prospects of the plaintiff doing heavy work, but for the incident, to be even more reduced as he gets older than they were up to this time. This figure is broadly equivalent to an average loss of $100 per week using a multiplier of 666.4, and deducting 15% for vicissitudes. 11% is allowed for superannuation.
108The Fox v Wood [1981] HCA 41; 148 CLR 438 component is agreed at $20,487.
Out of pocket expenses
109The past out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $60,068.67. Of this total, $16,000 is referable to rehabilitation and relates to expenses incurred by the workers' compensation insurer in purported discharge of its statutory obligation. The plaintiff's evidence was that the services provided were of little, or no, utility. I am not satisfied that such services were reasonably required or that those amounts were reasonable expended. Accordingly, I allow the amount of $44,068.67 for past out-of-pocket expenses.
110I make no allowance for future out-of-pocket expenses. In my view, the plaintiff does not require any future consultations with medical practitioners or service providers as a consequence of the injuries sustained through the incident. Nor am I satisfied that he requires any pain relief as a consequence thereof.
Domestic assistance
111I make no allowance for care. The evidence of both the plaintiff and his wife was not sufficient to overcome the statutory threshold set out in s 15 of the Act (at least 6 hours per week and solely caused by the incident.) The plaintiff is not entitled to any allowance for care merely because his wife may have spent a month caring for him after the operation. That does not satisfy the 6 month test. In any event I do not accept that he had any such reasonable requirement for care.

10 years/ 6 years 6 months


Count 4 

Aggravated sexual assault in company

15 years / 8 years

3In addition to these matters, the sentencing judge was also asked to take into account, in respect of count 4, two offences of specially aggravated detaining for advantage and two offences of aggravated detaining for advantage which were contained in a Form 1. 

4The overall sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment of 25 years commencing on 3 January 2009, with an effective non-parole period of 18 years expiring on 2 January 2027, with an additional term of 7 years expiring on 3 January 2034.

THE FACTS
5There was no statement of facts before the sentencing judge. However, the crown tendered a number of statements of witnesses, along with some associated material, on the basis of which his Honour was asked to determine the facts. 

6It is important to note that counsel for the applicant took no issue with any aspect of his Honour's findings of fact. Similarly, he conceded that his Honour's conclusions as to the role played by the applicant in the offending, were open on the evidence. The facts as found by his Honour were as follows.

7In the early hours of 2 November 2008 five students were at their residence in Arthur Street, Coffs Harbour. All were from overseas and had been granted visas to study in Australia at the Coffs Harbour Campus of the Southern Cross University. 

8The residence in which the students lived was a double storey townhouse, on the upper level of which were three bedrooms. Entry to the premises was gained from the ground floor, either through the front door or alternatively through a glass sliding door at the rear of the premises which led from the lounge room to the rear yard. The rear yard was intended to be securely separated from an adjoining parkland by a wooden boundary fence. However at the time of the commission of the offences, the fence was damaged, thus allowing access to be gained to the backyard of the premises from the parkland.

9At or about midnight on 2 November 2008, one of the occupants of the residence, a 26 year old male (""victim one"") was seated in the downstairs lounge room watching television. He saw the applicant approaching the glass sliding door from the backyard. He mistakenly believed that the applicant was a neighbour and, under that belief, partially opened the sliding door to a distance of about 10cm. The applicant then forcibly pushed the door open and entered the premises. In doing so, he pushed victim one to the chest and forced him onto the lounge. 

10The applicant's two co-offenders, Graham Quinlan (""Quinlan"") and Nathan Dungay (""Dungay""), then entered the premises behind the applicant. All three persons then stood around victim one and demanded money. Victim one replied that he did not have any, whereupon the applicant punched him in the face. 

11Victim one was then directed to go upstairs and hand over money. He walked to the top of the stairs, where he saw his roommate, a male aged 19 (""victim two""). The applicant then demanded that both victims one and two hand over their wallets. 

12At that point, the co-offender Dungay produced a knife some 35cm long, and held the knife at the chest of victim one, demanding money and threatening victim one that if he did not hand over money he would be killed. Dungay also threatened to kill victim one in the event that victim one took any steps to inform the police of what had occurred. At that time, either the applicant or Quinlan held up a beer bottle and threatened victim one with it. Thereafter, the applicant punched victim one causing him to fall to the floor, where upon Dungay kicked him. Victim one was also struck on the head with the beer bottle. The applicant then punched victim two in the face on more than one occasion, causing him to fall to the floor and suffer a bleeding nose. 

13Quinlan and victim one then went into the bedroom on the first floor of the premises which was occupied by victims one and two. The applicant and victim two entered the bedroom. Dungay entered an adjoining bedroom which was occupied by another victim (""victim three"") who was a male aged 25, and his girlfriend, a female aged 22 (""victim four""). Dungay demanded money from each of victims three and four and a sum of $105.00 was handed to him. Dungay then ordered that victims three and four join victims one and two in the other bedroom, whereupon all four persons were ordered to sit on the bed. 

14The remaining occupant of the premises was a 21-year-old female student (""victim five""). At the time of the entry of the applicant and his co-offenders into the premises, victim five had been alone in the third bedroom studying. She had actually seen Dungay in the upstairs area shortly after the three offenders had forced their way into the premises when Dungay had asked her for directions to the toilet. She thought at that time that Dungay may have been a friend of one of her housemates.

15When victim five heard noises coming from other areas of the premises, including demands for money, she became obviously and justifiably concerned for her own safety. Although she shut the door of her bedroom, the door was not lockable, and so she stood behind it. She heard victims one and two come upstairs and thereafter heard exchanges, and what she believed to be fighting or some form of violence. She heard one of the offenders demand money, at which time she became even more scared. She then heard one of the offenders ask, somewhat ominously:

""Where is the girl?""

16A short time later the applicant started to open the door of victim five's bedroom. Victim five pushed against it in an effort to prevent entry, but her efforts were to no avail. The applicant forced his way into her bedroom and demanded money. In response to that demand, victim five handed over her wallet from which the applicant removed an amount of $70.00. The applicant then shut the bedroom door, as a result of which he and victim five were alone. 

17The applicant ordered victim five to remain silent. He then directed her to drop to the floor. She did so, whereupon he ordered that she perform oral sex upon him. Victim five complied with that demand out of extreme fear. In the course of doing so, the applicant placed his hand on victim five's head, thrusting her head backwards and forwards. That activity lasted a couple of minutes. The applicant did not ejaculate. 

18The applicant then kissed victim five on the mouth before grabbing her by the shoulders and turning her around so that she faced away from him. He then demanded that she bend over, a demand with which victim five again complied out of extreme fear. The applicant then placed his right hand on victim five's back. Acutely aware of what was about to occur, victim five asked the applicant whether he was going to use a condom. The applicant responded, dismissively:

""I don't use them"".

19The applicant then pulled the victim's pyjamas and underwear down, and forced his penis into her vagina from behind. At the time victim five was a virgin. The applicant's forceful penetration of her vagina caused her significant pain. The applicant continued to have forceful vaginal intercourse with victim five for a period of 2 or 3 minutes.

20The applicant then brutally forced his penis into the anus of victim five, again causing her significant pain. He continued forceful anal intercourse for some two minutes before stopping, adjusting his clothing, pointing to the bed and reminding the victim that she was to remain silent. Having just been the victim of a degrading, violent and vicious sexual assault perpetrated by the applicant, and in obvious fear, victim five obeyed the applicant. At that point, she could feel blood running down her left leg. That was a consequence of an injury caused to her vagina during the earlier penetration, although there was little doubt that the extent of that injury was related, at least in part, to her previous virginity. 

21The applicant then pushed victim five onto the bed, pushed her legs apart and forced her feet on to the edge of the bed so that her knees were bent. The applicant then had vaginal intercourse with the victim, during which he said to her:
""You are international, I can give you Australian"".

22Whilst the applicant was having vaginal intercourse in this way, Dungay entered the room. When he did so, the applicant said to him:

""Go out, you're next"".

23Dungay then left the room, and shut the door but returned a short time later. When he did so, he again produced the knife which was in his possession and placed it on the bed. Having done so, and whilst victim five was still being subjected to non-consensual vaginal intercourse by the applicant, Dungay grabbed victim five's face, pushed his penis into her mouth, and had oral intercourse with her. 

24The applicant continued to force vaginal intercourse upon victim five before ceasing and then leaving the room. Victim five, due (amongst other things) to her sexual inexperience, was not able to determine whether or not the applicant ejaculated. 

25When the applicant ceased having vaginal intercourse with the victim and left the room, Dungay removed his penis from the mouth of the victim, only to proceed to force further vaginal intercourse upon her. When Dungay ceased, he adjusted his clothing, placed the knife back in the top of his pants and left the room. 

26At about this point, the co-offender Quinlan entered the room. He apologised to the victim for the actions of the applicant and Dungay, and expressed his disapproval of their actions, before leaving.

27The applicant then returned to the bedroom where victim five had remained. At that point, he said to her: 

""Before you can leave, you must do it again"".

28The applicant then pushed victim five into the corner of the room and kissed her on the mouth. He then pushed her to the floor and said: 

""I really love you, can you go with me now?""

29The applicant then forced victim five to perform oral sex on him for approximately one minute. He then ordered her:

""Do it like a dog"".

30The applicant then forced his penis into victim five's vagina from behind. When that final act of vaginal intercourse ended, the applicant said to the victim:

""Don't say anything, can you leave with me now?""

31The applicant also asked victim five whether he could return to the premises in the future. Victim five, in a state of complete devastation, remained in her bedroom until all three offenders left the premises. 

THE SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS
32The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge and asserted that a long standing addiction to alcohol and drugs had played ""a very big part"" in his commission of the offences. He also said that at the time of the offending he was still suffering the after effects of the ingestion of drugs some weeks before. 

33The applicant's lengthy criminal history was tendered before his Honour. It included convictions for a range of offences including break enter and steal, wilful destruction of property and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. However, by far the most disturbing aspect of such history was the fact that in 2003 the applicant had been sentenced to 6 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years, for an offence of aggravated sexual assault (""the 2003 offence""). An appeal by the applicant against the sentence imposed in respect of the 2003 offence was dismissed by this Court on 30 August 2004 (see R v Haines [2004] NSWCCA 294). 

34The statement of facts in respect of the 2003 offence was tendered before the sentencing judge in the present matters. That statement of facts established that the applicant had been staying at the home of the victim and was walking with her back to her premises one evening. In the course of doing so, the applicant made sexual advances to that victim, which she sought to deflect by consenting (reluctantly) to kiss the applicant. 

35As they walked a little further, the applicant grabbed the victim and pulled her into a side alley. She attempted to resist him by kicking and hitting him, at which time the applicant pushed her onto the bonnet of a parked car. The victim's screams drew the attention of a nearby resident who saw her struggling with the applicant. The neighbour turned away briefly and heard a ""slap"". Upon turning back again, the neighbour saw the victim on the ground, apparently unconscious, with the applicant standing over her. At that point the applicant, at a time when the victim remained unconscious in the alley, removed her clothing and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. 

36At the time of commission of the present offences, the applicant had been on parole in respect of the 2003 offence for less than 3 months. In the course of the sentence proceedings, his Honour took the applicant to the circumstances in which the 2003 offence had been committed:

""Q The matter you got the 6 years for, were you affected by alcohol or drugs in that offence?
A Same. Same.

Q You were. What alcohol, what drugs?
A I was drinking all day and I was on valiums and rohies and that. 

Q Valium and what?
A Rohypnol.""

37Also tendered to his Honour was a report of Catherine Jones (Occupational Therapist) and Dr Satish Dayalin (Psychiatrist) dated 22 September 2008 following an assessment of the applicant shortly before he was released on parole. That report included the following observations:

""He was happy for this assessment as he could see changes within himself since completing the CUBIT program. He was due to finish the CUBIT program in early July. He was referred to the Connections Program for drug and alcohol programs and linking in with the community. He was going to be accommodated in a Koori hostel in Granville and carry out parenting classes and TAFE classes"".

38Amongst the recommendations arising out of this report were the following:

""Mr Haines might benefit from continued drug and alcohol rehabilitation offered in the community. He might benefit from attending a twelve step program such as Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous.

Mr Haines would benefit from continued support to assist in achieving his educational and vocational goals.""

39The sentencing judge also took the applicant to the issue of his participation in the CUBIT Program: 

""Q The CUBIT Program, did you gain any benefit from that?
A I gained some benefits, I took some of it on board, some of it I didn't. It was a good program for me. I learnt a bit about myself and things like that there, and like they teach all these skills that I never knew. Things, you know, like how to communicate with other people and you know to talk about your feelings and how you felt about the crime you committed, and write the victim a few letters and that, things like that. That's basically what it was about.

Q You could understand that others in the community would look and say, well Mr Haines got that 6 year sentence for a sex offence, serious sexual offence, had the CUBIT Program, got out, 3 months later he's committed these serious sexual offences, that Mr Haines is a danger to the community because of his sexual offending. Could you understand that some in the community would look at your history like that?
A Yeah, I can understand your point of view and where your coming from. 

Q But you don't look at it like that?
A I don't - like I can see what your saying and that, yeah. To me like its not like I go around you know like stalking women and things like that there. You know, like I don't go around doing that type of behaviour.""


40The evidence before his Honour also included a report of Dr Adam Martin, Forensic Psychiatrist, who, having diagnosed the applicant as suffering from polysubstance dependence, said: 

""In terms of the future, he requires assertive management of his drug and alcohol problems at some stage and in time he might benefit from referral to a residential drug and alcohol service. I do not believe he requires psychiatric hospitalisation, and I do not believe he is currently psychotic or suffering a major mood disorder.

His prognosis is poor in view of his past history, although he did appear to acknowledge that he does have a drug and alcohol and problem. However, his history suggests that he has not made a assertive attempts to manage this, and this suggests to me that his insight is limited."" 

41His Honour did not make any finding regarding the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. Dr Martin's opinion certainly did not support any optimistic view being formed in relation to that issue. 

42Having set out the facts in the terms outlined above, his Honour reached a number of conclusions concerning the applicant's offending. It is appropriate that I set out those conclusions in full: 

""The conduct of this offender as regards the sexual offending was of the most depraved nature. It is difficult to understand that Mr Haines could treat victim five in such an inhuman and disrespectful fashion. She was, after all, at her home. It was around midnight, and she was studying in her bedroom. Like all citizens she was entitled to feel safe in her own residence, but her safety or sense of safety was violated by the entry of this offender and his two accomplices, one of whom was armed. There followed physical assaults upon the house mates and robberies upon them. Victim five was then subjected to the most appalling, degrading and inhuman conduct by this offender and the co-offender Dungay. Neither this offender nor Dungay had any regard for the rights of this young woman. She was merely a sexual plaything for each of them. Continuing a vaginal rape of the victim, when Dungay entered the room and engaged in oral intercourse without consent, almost beggars belief.

One only needs to state the facts in relation to the sexual matters to conclude that the criminality of the sexual offences is in the upper-range of the middle-range. In R v Way it was stated that the middle range of seriousness is a broad range. I accept (the submissions on behalf of the applicant) that there were no other acts of violence, by striking or demeaning the victim. But the sexual penetration that she was subjected to, orally, vaginally and anally, was absolutely unacceptable. This offender arrogantly ordered the victim to adopt certain positions, merely so he could achieve some sexual gratification. He had no regard for her rights to protective sex, even taking into account that she was not consenting. He permitted, apparently, Dungay's entry into sexual activity upon the bed. I find that (the applicant) must have known at that time that the victim was absolutely terrified by his behaviour. She had the gross indignity of having her body violated, and her virginity taken in those appalling circumstances. She was a visitor to our country, far from her own land and her family. 

I find on the facts that the offender Mr Haines was the ringleader in respect to the home invasion. I also find that he was the ringleader, and the major participant in, the sexual offences. The behaviour of Dungay was gross but the behaviour of (the applicant) was more prolonged and worse.""

43No issue is taken on behalf of the applicant with any of these conclusions. In my view, they were completely justified. 

44In circumstances where the applicant's pleas of guilty were entered in the District Court after committal for trial, a discount of 15 percent was applied so as to reflect their utilitarian value. His Honour also took into account, as aggravating factors, the fact that the applicant had recently been released on parole in respect of a serious sexual assault, as well as the fact that all of the offences occurred in the home of the victims.

45His Honour observed that the medical evidence established that in circumstances where the applicant had been a participant in a sexual offender's program when previously in custody, he had committed the present offence within a short time of his release on parole. This, he said, was an indication that whatever programs had been undertaken, they had not been successful in addressing the applicant's issues.
46His Honour generally accepted the applicant's evidence and concluded that in his opinion, the applicant was, seeking to be frank with the court. He was clearly impressed with the applicant's presentation before him, observing that it was ""difficult to reconcile his presentation and behaviour with the facts alleged against him"".

47 Having addressed all of the relevant matters, his Honour imposed the individual sentences set out above. In doing so, he said:

""I next address the issues of totality. This was very serious criminal behaviour. There must be a message sent not only to this offender but to any like-minded individuals that any home invasion is viewed most seriously by the courts. Even more so, is any home invasion which then involves sexual assault upon the unfortunate victim. Having allowed the offender the discount for his plea of guilty, and including an allowance that he is regretful in his sober state for his behaviour, I consider the offender should receive an effective sentence of 25 years imprisonment. I intend to impose an effective minimum period of 18 years imprisonment.""

THE GROUND OF APPEAL
The overall sentence is unreasonable and/or plainly unjust.
48In support of this single ground of appeal counsel for the applicant advanced three broad propositions, namely:

(i)the extent to which a number of the offences shared common features indicated that a greater degree of concurrency of the sentences would have been appropriate in order to properly reflect the totality of the criminality involved;

(ii)in assessing the totality of the criminality involved, it was relevant that the offences were committed as part of the one course of conduct, albeit comprising several distinct episodes;

(iii)the overall sentence was of such a magnitude as to have a crushing effect upon the applicant's hopes of rehabilitation, and his prospects of reform.

49In developing the first of these submissions, counsel pointed out the following:

(i) in respect of the offences of aggravated sexual assault (counts 1, 2, 3, 14 and 15), aggravated sexual assault in company (counts 4, 5 and 6) and specially aggravated detain for advantage (count 10) the circumstance of aggravation was the same, namely, the infliction of actual bodily harm;

(ii) in respect of each of counts 1, 5 and 15, the harm which was relied upon was that caused to victim one before those particular offences were committed;

(iii) in respect of counts 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 15, the harm relied upon was that caused to the victim five, being harm that was:

(a) caused during the act constituting count 2;
(b) caused immediately before the act constituting count 3;
(c) caused during the act constituting count 10; and 
(d) aggravated during the acts constituting counts 4, 6 and 15. 

50There were undoubtedly some common features arising from these circumstances. At the same, it must be recognised that the actions of the applicant, although in one sense committed in the one episode of conduct, manifested themselves in quite separate and distinct instances of offending. What is also particularly significant in terms of the applicant's sexual offending against victim five, is that having perpetrated a number of violent sexual acts upon her, the applicant left the bedroom, only to return and commit a further three quite separate and distinct offences upon that same victim.

51Moreover, and even accepting the proposition that the offences were committed in the one course of conduct, each offence necessarily contributed to the total criminality involved. His Honour was required to take care so as to ensure that the overall effective sentence was appropriate having regard to the numerous offences which were committed in that course of conduct (see R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; (2002) 137 A Crim R 326 at 340; [57] per Sperling J). In my view, it is clear from his Honour's reasons that such an approach was taken. Matters of accumulation are necessarily matters within the discretion of the sentencing judge. In my view, there is no indication that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried in any way.

52Counsel went to some lengths to emphasise that the applicant's offending occurred over a period of approximately one hour. He submitted that this was a circumstance which supported the conclusion that the sentence imposed was unreasonable and/or plainly unjust. In my view, that submission should be rejected. In assessing the circumstances of the applicant's offending, and its objective seriousness, the primary focus must necessarily be upon what the applicant did in terms of offending, rather than upon the period of time over which that offending occurred. His offending involved the commission of sixteen separate offences. It exhibited a high degree of criminality, for which a significant penalty was warranted. In my view, the seriousness of such offending is not in any way moderated by the time over which it occurred. The fact of the matter is that it was a period of time which was sufficient to allow the applicant to commit multiple offences. 


53In one sense, and for good reason, his Honour's reasons centred upon the offences of indecent assault, aggravated sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault in company which were perpetrated upon victim five. However, it is relevant to bear in mind that the applicant's commission of those offences had been immediately preceded by the commission of a number of other serious offences. The totality of the applicant's offending covered a wide range criminal conduct for which the legislature has seen fit to impose significant penalties and, in some cases, lengthy standard non-parole periods. In particular: 

(i) each of counts 4, 5 and 6 (being offences of aggravated sexual assault in company pursuant to s. 61JA of the Crimes Act) carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment;

(ii) each of counts 1, 2, 3, 14 and 15 (being offences of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to s. 61J of the Crimes Act) carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment;

(iii) count 10 (being an offence of specially aggravated detaining for advantage carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment;

(v) each of counts 11, 12, 13 and 16 (being offences of robbery in company pursuant to s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act) carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment; and

(iv) count 9 (being an offence of aggravated entry of a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence pursuant to s. 111(2) of the Crimes Act) carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.

54In each of those instances of offending where a standard non-parole period was prescribed (being a period of 15 years imprisonment in three instances and a period of 10 years imprisonment in five others) his Honour was at liberty to use that standard non-parole period as a guide post in the sentencing process (see generally Muldrock v R (2011 244 CLR 120). His Honour found that the applicant's offending was in the upper range of the mid range of seriousness, and no issue has been taken by the applicant with that finding. The commission of multiple offences for which significant standard non-parole periods applied, is a factor which, in the circumstances of this case, tends against the proposition that the overall sentence imposed by his Honour was one which was unreasonable and/or plainly unjust. 

55In support of the submission that the sentence amounted to a ""crushing"" one, counsel for the applicant relied upon the judgement of this court in R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 where it was observed (at 164; [17]):

"" ... an extremely long total sentence may be ""crushing"" upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there maybe of rehabilitation and reform.""

56It is important to bear in mind that such a statement was accompanied by the following observation:

""Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.""

57Any assessment of whether or not a sentence is properly described as ""crushing"" must have regard to a number of circumstances. Those circumstances include the maximum penalties, any standard non-parole periods, the objective and subjective factors, and the application of principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality (see Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242 esp. at [215] per Johnson J with whom Tobias AJA and Hall J agreed). 

58As I have pointed out, 8 of the 16 offences committed by the applicant carried a standard non-parole period. Even in respect of the remaining 8 offences for which no standard non-parole period was prescribed, the maximum penalties set by the legislature were nevertheless significant. Those offences were committed by the applicant, in the capacity of what his Honour described as ""the ring leader"", only a matter of months following the applicant's release on parole in respect of a previous offence of aggravated sexual assault. The objective seriousness of his offending towards the five victims was assessed by the sentencing judge, appropriately in my view, as falling at the upper end of the mid range. Despite the favourable impression formed by the sentencing judge following the offender's evidence, the medical evidence expressed a poor prognosis and provided no support for a favourable finding in terms of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

59Taking all of these factors into consideration, I do not regard the overall sentence imposed as one which is appropriately described as ""crushing"", in the sense in which that term has previously been used by this Court. The various circumstances to which I have referred disentitled the applicant to the benefit of any element of mercy of the kind to which the court referred in MAK. 

60Further, in determining an appropriate sentence for the applicant's offending, there was a clear requirement on the part of the sentencing judge to give appropriate weight to the need to protect the community. One of the aggravating factors to which his Honour justifiably had regard was that the offences were committed in the home of the victims. In R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740 Street CJ, in the context of observations regarding the increase in the commission of the offence of break, enter and steal observed (at 742):
""The invasion of people's homes and the plundering of their property is a social evil from which the community looks for protection to the law enforcement agencies and the criminal courts"". 

61In the same case, Lee J said (at 744): 
""The police and the criminal courts are all that a citizen has to look to protect him against the activities of criminals, and the courts have a duty to make clear that they recognise that, so far as our society is concerned, their prime responsibility is the protection of the community. (The sentencing judge's) remarks on sentence make quite clear that his Honour was not in doubt as to the court's responsibility. The community has the right to expect that the courts will use against crime the weapons which it has at its disposal, and that it will take stern measures in the face of repeated defiant criminal conduct involving breaking and entering.""


62Notwithstanding the period which has elapsed since those observations were made, and even though they were made in the context of a particular type of offending which was seen at the time to be increasing, they nevertheless remain apposite, particularly in the circumstances of the present case. The actions of the appellant and his co-offenders in forcibly entering the premises amounted to an invasion of the home, and an invasion of the privacy, of the victims. That invasion was followed by what can only be described as serious criminal conduct. 

63The sentencing judge properly pointed out that members of the community are entitled to assume that they will be safe in the confines of their own home. Persons whose criminal offending interferes with those justifiable assumptions of safety must expect the imposition of condign punishment. That is particularly so in circumstances such as the present, where the initial invasion of the premises by the applicant, who had only recently been released on parole, was followed by the commission of multiple offences of violence perpetrated against five victims, and where the commission of some of those offences involved conduct of the most depraved, immoral and degrading nature imaginable.

64For all of these reasons, the ground of appeal has not been made out.

ORDERS
65I propose the following orders:

(i) grant leave to appeal;

(ii) dismiss the appeal.

2760497,R v Page [2012] NSWDC 300,"Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: Harley Page was convicted a short time ago of an offence of robbery with corporal violence. He had pleaded not guilty to that offence but after a short trial the jury convicted him. I also convicted him in a matter appearing on a s 166 certificate arising out of the same circumstances, an offence against s 11A (1) of the Summary Offences Act. He thus is to be sentenced for both of those matters which were committed by Mr Page while he was on bail for an offence of robbery in company.

2The circumstances which led to Mr Page committing these offences were set out in some detail in the evidence of the various witnesses. A group of music students had gone out drinking one night and they were heading home when their group was approached by another group of young people, that group including the offender and his brother Levy and a man by the name of Isherwood amongst others. It is apparent that some of those people in the offender's camp, including the offender himself, were looking for some violence. 

3It seems that to some people a good night out cannot be had unless you end up punching someone. The last sentence I did before this one concerned an offence of drunken violence and I have to say, in particular, Newcastle District Court faces offences of drunken violence with depressing regularity. What it is that makes people like the offender, Mr Isherwood and others whose behaviour I saw on CCTV actually desire to become involved in violence as a means of entertainment is something which is beyond me, but it is apparent that that was what was planned. 

4The offender's group, at least members of it, began taunting the complainant's group until some of the latter sought refuge in a 7/11 store at the end of the Hunter Street mall. I mentioned before that I saw aspects of the behaviour on CCTV footage. There were three cameras operating that night and they recorded part of what went on. What did go on was that Mr Isherwood in particular, and the offender, began to punch people. The offender began to punch Mr Copeman. All he did to deserve this attack was to walk along the street. He did not provoke the offender in any way. He did not abuse him. He barely even looked at him but, as I mentioned, the offender seems to be, or at least was that night, the sort of person that goes looking for trouble because he enjoys it.

5Mr Copeman, whilst being struck by the offender repeatedly, bent over and put his hands up to protect his head. This occurred just outside the 7/11 store and was visible on one of the bits of CCTV footage. A friend of Mr Copeman bravely entered the fray and dragged Mr Copeman inside. The offender followed but turned his attentions to other people and began hitting others. Mr Isherwood was also violent that night but the Crown did not present its case against the offender in the trial matter as involving any sort of derivative liability for what Mr Isherwood did. The young music students who had just gone out to have a good night found themselves confronted by violent, aggressive and, I have to say, somewhat out of control, thugs.

6Not everyone in the offender's group was acting that way and indeed his brother Levy Page can be seen trying to stop members of his group acting in such a reprehensible way. He is to be congratulated for his actions that night. It is a shame that his brother the offender did not pay more attention to Levy's sensible actions.

7It will be noted that so far I have not said anything that involves a robbery and that is for this reason. Mr Copeman gave evidence that whilst he was being struck outside the 7/11 he was holding the purse or wallet, or ""clutch"" as it was described, of a female friend of his. He gave evidence that as he was being struck the offender made a demand for that property. However, once he was dragged inside, the offender appears to have abandoned any intent to rob, having more fun by hitting other people than by taking whatever it was that Mr Copeman had in his hand.

8The gravamen of the offender's misconduct that night was his violent actions rather than his brief and abandoned intent to rob. Certainly the jury has found him guilty of the offence but really I am sure what is of concern to the victims of his offence and to the community and to anyone who witnessed the video is the violence rather than the desire to steal.

9The offender, as I mentioned, was on bail at the time for an offence of robbery in company. He was convicted of that matter and is now serving a sentence. That sentence imposed by Judge Cogswell consists of a non parole period of two years six months with a period of eligibility for parole of 18 months. The pre sentence report prepared for that matter dated only a few months ago was tendered in the present proceedings. It reveals that the offender is now 23 years of age and has four siblings. His parents separated when he was young and he was raised by his mother. He has the support of his mother and his siblings. Indeed, a number of them are in court today.

10The offender appears to have taken his parents' separation somewhat badly. The pre sentence report indicates that he longed for his father to return. Eventually he did resume contact with his father at the age of 16. The offender left school at 15 after he was asked to leave because he rarely attended. He was a member of the rugby league team and would avoid going to school when there was a risk that there would be drug or alcohol tests but since leaving school he has not worked very much. There are occasional stints of work as a labourer or at a food processing manufacture but the pre sentence report summarises it thus:

""Mr Page's employment history is negligible and he has mostly been in receipt of Social Security benefits. The offender uses drugs, commencing with cannabis at the age of 15 and uses alcohol too, commencing drinking at the age of 16.""


One of the most accurate things I have read in the pre sentence report is this:


""The offender informed that he becomes aggressive under the influence of alcohol"".


That is clearly the case.

11One of the problems that this sentencing exercise faces concerns the question of totality and the circumstance that any sentence imposed partially accumulatively on the non parole period that he is currently serving, will eat into the period of eligibility for parole. It is an unfortunate act of timing that has led to the offender being dealt with for the robbery in company offence prior to this offence but it does have consequences as regards the selection of the appropriate sentence and, in particular, whether he can be actually punished for the summary offences matter. One of the consequences will be that although I make a finding of special circumstances, the variation is less than it would otherwise have been when the overall ratio is considered.

12Of course the harm to Mr Copeman is an important aspect of determining the appropriate sentence. Not surprisingly, without objection from Mr Corish, the Crown told me that he experiences difficulty going out and is apprehensive, much more than he used to be. These are the entirely understandable and foreseeable consequences of an offence of this type.

13But of course it is not only Mr Copeman who suffers. Everyone who saw what occurred that night is entitled to feel just that bit more apprehensive when they go out in Newcastle in the evening. It makes all of us feel a bit less safe knowing that there are people like the offender who delight in violence, or at least who did so on that occasion.

14Since going into custody the offender has begun to work productively. He is apparently a different person when he is not drinking. He begins to use his abilities he has. That suggest that there are prospects for the offender's rehabilitation if he can do something about his excessive consumption of alcohol. If he truly does recognise that he is the sort of person who becomes aggressive under the influence of alcohol, then the necessary consequence is obvious. He has to be one of those people who just does not drink alcohol. If he is able to take that significant step, then his prospects of rehabilitation are significantly enhanced. If he does not, then I regret to say that it is likely that Mr Page will spend more and more time in custody as the years go on.

15Mr Page is sentenced to imprisonment as follows.

16For the matter on the s 166 certificate I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of six months to commence on 28 February 2013.

17For the offence of robbery in circumstance of aggravation I set a non parole period of two years to date from 28 February 2013, a head sentence of four years. Thus the non parole period will expire on 28 February 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

18I will dismiss the back up charges on the s 166 certificate.

		26 November 2013",2012-11-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760498,R v West [2012] NSWDC 257,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Today I have before me yet another offence of drunken violence being dealt with in the Newcastle District Court. Time without number, judges sitting in Newcastle and elsewhere have referred to the harm that is caused to individuals and society as a result of drunken violence. We have a rather startling example in the present case. 

2Christopher West has pleaded guilty to an offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm. He did this when he was drunk. The harm that has been occasioned to the victim, Mr Holborow, is enormous. And the harm that flows through to society generally, the people that witnessed the drunken violence and the people that learn about it indirectly, is also significant. 

3All of us feel more apprehensive when we visit licensed premises because of offences of this kind. In truth, we should be able to go out and have a few drinks without worrying that someone will hit us and someone will cause harm to us as has occurred in the present case.

4The offender finished work early on 1 November last year because it was Melbourne Cup Day. He went to the Gladstone Hotel where he had a few drinks. Also in that hotel was a man by the name of Grant Holborow. Mr Holborow regarded the offender as someone who had acted inappropriately towards his daughter. He stared at Mr West on occasions. Mr West did not know who Mr Holborow was or why he was being stared at.

5It is clear that Mr Holborow, who was also drinking, got angry. He was drinking with a man by the name of Brad Webster who said that at some point in the afternoon Mr Holborow's mood changed: ""He saw a guy who I didn't know and said something like 'That bloke diddled with my daughter'. It is obvious that Mr Holborow was angry at what the offender had previously done.

6What happened as the offender left the hotel was captured on closed-circuit television footage. As he walked past Mr Holborow to go outside, Mr Holborow, after a short moment, followed him, punching the air as he did so. It is obvious that Mr Holborow was angry. Mr West was outside using his mobile phone when Mr Holborow approached him. Most of what thereafter happened is captured on the same CCTV footage. The events happened outside a window and there is a reasonably clear view.

7The initial confrontation is slightly out of camera. The offender says that there was a verbal altercation as Mr Holborow identified himself and the offender asked whether Mr Holborow was going to hit him. The offender says that in response Mr Holborow raised his fists.

8Thereafter there was a great deal of violence, all of it coming from the offender. He struck Mr Holborow once to his chin. Mr Holborow fell backwards until he was on the ground in a relatively defenceless position. The offender just lived across the road and could easily have left at this time but he did not. He claims that he hit Mr Holborow again whilst he was on the ground because he was acting in self-defence. I reject that.

9There was no need at all for Mr West to continue punching Mr Holborow while he was on the ground. He could, as I have said, easily have left and gone home but he did not. He punched Mr Holborow repeatedly. I have seen on the DVD what occurred. Something in the order of eight times was Mr Holborow struck by this fit young man as he lay relatively defenceless on the ground.

10Eventually the offender stopped. Mr Holborow was not moving. Police and ambulance were called. Mr Holborow was taken to hospital and the offender was arrested. When he was arrested he told police a few lies. He admitted that he was responsible for the violence but denied the extent of it.

11When Mr Holborow got to hospital he was, of course, examined. To say that his injuries were significant is an understatement. He had fractures of his left and right zygomatic arch and his left and right zygoma; his nose was broken; he had fractures of his mid-face and maxilla; he had left and right orbital floor fractures; his jaw was broken and his left eyeball was ruptured. Extensive treatment was required. 

12He required a tracheostomy. His left eye was completely removed, the result of course that he is entirely blind in that eye. Surgery was required. There were approximately 15 plates inserted into his face. He remained in hospital for about two weeks.

13As the Crown accurately pointed out, in determining the objective gravity of an offence of violence the relevant factors include the extent of the violence inflicted and the harm to the victim. Both of those in this case were highly significant. I have seen the extent of the violence and I have read the extent of the injuries. This was objectively a very serious offence indeed.

14I note that the maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment and it carries a standard non-parole period of four years. I have taken into account both of those in determining the appropriate penalty to impose upon Mr West. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

15In contrast to many offenders who appear in court for sentence, Mr West has little in his background which would explain this offending. He is a man, apart from some aspects I will mention in a little while, of otherwise good character. He is a good worker, he is respected by his employer and he is respected in the wider community. References were tendered in his case and those who know him regard him highly.

16The offender is now twenty-three, he was twenty-two at the time of the offence. His parents separated when he was very young but he remains close to his mother and lives with his father with whom he also has a good relationship.

17He got his HSC and then commenced training as a fitness instructor, doing various levels of certificates before he worked as a gym instructor at a number of health studios. He then moved to work as a scaffolder and it was there that he was working at the time of this offence. A reference from his employer was, as I mentioned, tendered and it speaks highly of him. 

18He is single, he is not in a relationship and he has no children.

19He pleaded guilty to this offence at a late stage. It is conceded that the utilitarian benefit should result in a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed of about 10 per cent. Although he could have pleaded guilty to this offence when arraigned for the more serious offence, he did not do so. When this matter was raised in the course of submissions, from the dock the offender said that he did not know that that was an alternative. That does not affect the utilitarian benefit from a plea of guilty but is a matter that I will take into account in determining the remorsefulness or otherwise of the offender. It is to that issue that I will now turn.

20He remained at the hotel until police arrived. He exhibited signs of distress. He believed at one stage that he may even have killed Mr Holborow but did not try to run away at that stage. He did not, however, tell the police the entire truth about the extent of the violence he had inflicted upon Mr Holborow and his evidence today is of some concern.

21Whilst he clearly did not intend Mr Holborow to suffer the awful harm that he has suffered and is remorseful to that extent, it is the case that he seems to blame Mr Holborow to a fairly significant extent for what eventuated. He says that he struck Mr Holborow on the ground repeatedly because he was afraid that Mr Holborow would get up and hit him. He says that he was acting in self-defence. I reject that. I am satisfied and satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting in self-defence nor did he believe himself to be acting in self-defence. No person, intoxicated or otherwise, could have acted in the way I saw on that video and caused the harm that was occasioned to Mr Holborow believing that that was necessary in self-defence.

22The CCTV footage was chilling and disturbing. It is disturbing to see a man lying relatively defenceless on the ground, being punched repeatedly by a fit young man who is standing over him. It was a sustained attack and led to injuries which are exactly what would be expected to have occurred from a sustained attack of that nature. The offender was attacking Mr Holborow's face and the injuries that Mr Holborow thus suffered were entirely foreseeable.

23I accept, of course, that trouble came to the offender, not the other way around. As I explained in outlining what occurred on 1 November last year, it was Mr Holborow who approached the offender, not the other way around, but it was the offender who resorted to violence, not Mr Holborow. If there was an invitation to fight, it was an initiation that the offender accepted rather than walk away. And more importantly, it was the offender who did not stop once Mr Holborow had fallen to the ground.

24So, although of course it is an important matter that it was Mr Holborow who approached the offender rather than the other way around, and that Mr Holborow was angry at the time, it must be remembered that the offender responded with violence at a very high level.

25The offender had been drinking and, indeed, when police took him back to the police station he fell asleep in the dock and an investigating officer allowed him to recover from the effects of alcohol. 

26The offender says to Dr Bench, a psychiatrist who interviewed him for the purposes of these proceedings, that he is a lightweight when it comes to consuming alcohol. That is not a description that I would give to the drinking history that he gave to Dr Bench. The offender has told him that he had experienced alcoholic blackouts and that if he drank fifteen standard drinks or more he may have an alcoholic blackout. That level of alcohol consumption is not consistent with his description of being a lightweight when it comes to consuming alcohol.

27Of course, the circumstance that alcohol has been consumed when an offence is committed is sometimes called in by an offender as suggesting that it is a mitigating matter. Only yesterday the Court of Criminal Appeal re-examined this issue. That decision confirmed that in narrow circumstances, where the alcohol has caused a person to act out of character, it might be thought that the consumption of an excessive quantity of alcohol can be a mitigating matter, but it does not appear that the offender did act out of character, I regret to say.

28Although there are no previous assaults on his criminal history, he was suspended for fighting whilst at school. He fought with an ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend when he was seventeen. He was the only one who punched on that occasion too. And in 2007 he responded to being denied entry into a licensed establishment by urinating on the wall outside. Whilst, of course, he has not ever acted in such a violent way as brings him before the court today, it is not the case that alcohol has caused him to act out of character to the extent that I regard it as a mitigating circumstance in this case.

29Just to make it clear that I have taken into account some matters relied on by Mr Brady, the offence was not planned, the offence was provoked to some small extent, there was aggression from Mr Holborow and the offender was, apart from the matters I have mentioned, of otherwise good character. It remains, of course, that the sentence to be imposed must reflect the objective gravity of what the offender has done and it is also the case that there needs to be a significant component of general deterrence built into the sentence to be imposed upon Mr West.

30Although he was seen by a forensic psychiatrist, there is no suggestion that he ever suffered from any form of mental illness or that there should be any reduction in the extent to which the sentence has a component of general deterrence built into it.

31As I began these remarks on sentence, what Mr West did on this occasion caused enormous harm to Mr Holborow and is part of the significant harm that is occasioned to society generally through the problem of drunken violence. Nothing less than fulltime custody is required. The sentence I impose is as follows:

32I set a non-parole period of two years and three months to date from today, 22 November 2012. I set a head sentence of four and a half years. It will be obvious that I have made a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour based on this being his first time in custody and his relative youth.

33The non-parole period will expire on 21 February 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		01 March 2013",2012-11-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760500,R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Johnson J.
2JOHNSON J:  This is a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentence imposed upon the Respondent, GWM, at the Bathurst District Court on 26 April 2012 for an offence of aggravated sexual assault.
3Following a plea of guilty, the Respondent was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and eight months commencing on 2 September 2011 and concluding on 1 May 2014, with a balance of term of two years and seven months commencing on 2 May 2014 and expiring on 1 December 2016.  The maximum penalty for an offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for 20 years, and a standard non-parole period of 10 years is applicable to the offence.
Facts of Offence
4A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered in the District Court without objection.
5The victim, TL, was born on 22 August 2000.  She was 11 years and eight days' old at the time of the offence committed on 1 September 2011.  
6The victim lived with her mother and brother in Mudgee.  The Respondent is the paternal uncle of the victim.  The victim's mother had separated from the victim's father before she was born.  Prior to May 2011, the victim had never met the Respondent.
7In May 2011, the Respondent came to the victim's home and asked to stay with the family.  The victim's mother, who had not seen the Respondent for some years, agreed and he moved into the spare room. 
8The Respondent was a heavy drinker and cannabis user and would regularly drink and smoke cannabis until he passed out.
9At about 9.30 pm on the evening of 1 September 2011, the victim woke in her bed to find the Respondent tickling her under her arm.  He said ""I wanna show you something"" and then pulled her pyjama pants down.  The victim tried to push him off.  The Respondent removed his pants and got on top of her.  
10The Respondent then put his penis in the victim's vagina, causing her pain.  She told him to stop but he said ""No, you're liking it"".  She told the Respondent she needed to go to the toilet and he stopped.  The victim ran and told her mother that something had happened involving the Respondent.  The victim slept the rest of the night in her mother's bed.
11The following morning, the victim told her mother that the Respondent had put his penis ""in her belly"" and that ""her belly was hurting"".  The victim's mother then comprehended fully what the Respondent had done.  She reported the matter to police and the victim underwent a sexual assault examination at Dubbo Base Hospital.
12The Respondent did not use a condom during the offence and he had ejaculated in the victim's vagina.
13The victim received the morning-after pill to prevent pregnancy and antibiotics to prevent infection.  Further blood tests were required to be undertaken 12 months after the offence to exclude the possibility of infection with HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.
14Semen was detected on two high vaginal swabs taken from the victim which yielded DNA with the same profile as the Respondent.  
15The Respondent was questioned by police the morning after the assault.  He said he had no recollection of anything happening.  He told police he had smoked a significant quantity of cannabis and had consumed an equally significant quantity of cask wine on the day of the offence.  
16The Respondent initially denied the allegations.  However, in light of the DNA evidence, he accepted that he had committed the offence and pleaded guilty in the Local Court.
17The Respondent was arrested and charged on 2 September 2011 and has remained in continuous custody since that time.
The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances
18The Respondent was born in January 1984.  He was 27 years' old at the time of the offence and 28 years' old at the time of sentence.  
19His criminal history contained a single entry, at Beenleigh Magistrates Court on 18 August 2003, for unlawful use of a motor vehicle for which he was placed on probation for 18 months with no conviction being recorded.
20No presentence report or psychiatric or psychological report was tendered as part of the sentencing proceedings.  A letter from the Respondent's mother was tendered which set out part of his life history.  In addition, the Respondent gave evidence.  
21The sentencing Judge accepted the Respondent's evidence concerning his background.  He is the fifth of six children and his early childhood was marked by significant domestic abuse by his father upon his mother.  His parents separated when he was three years' old.  
22The Respondent maintained a close relationship with his father, notwithstanding his parents' separation.  When the Respondent was 13 years of age, his father committed suicide.  Following this, the sentencing Judge observed:
""That would have been a traumatic experience for anybody, and it was for this offender, and it was shortly after the funeral of his father that his life unravelled and which led him to commit the dreadful offence for which he is to be sentenced today.""
23His Honour accepted that the Respondent became involved in excessive drinking and the consumption of cannabis at a very young age, as well as the use of amphetamines.  He was expelled from school.  The Respondent had some employment but was unable to hold a job for very long.  The Respondent sought counselling at the age of 17 years, but that did not have any significant effect.
24In his evidence before the District Court, the Respondent said that he had left school in Year 10 and that, whilst he had worked during his early 20s, he had not had permanent employment for a period of four years before the offence.  He said that this was due to his drug and alcohol problems which meant that he could not maintain steady employment.
The Sentencing Hearing and Remarks on Sentence
The Hearing
25The sentencing hearing took place at the Bathurst District Court on 26 April 2012, with his Honour passing sentence in ex tempore remarks delivered later that day.  
26The Crown tendered a number of documents and the victim then commenced to read her victim impact statement from the closed-circuit television room located in the courthouse.  That process took its toll upon the victim (then aged 11 years and eight months), and she broke down with her mother completing the reading of the statement.  
27The victim impact statement outlined the victim's distress as the offence was being committed and her feelings of confusion, guilt, discomfort and disgust at the subsequent examinations of her, the testing for disease and the delay in learning that there had been no disease transmitted.  Associated with these features were a loss of confidence at sleeping in her own room, the detrimental impact of the offence upon her family and her mother, a need to change schools and a general feeling of anxiety and lack of trust and confidence arising from the offence.  
28As mentioned earlier, the Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing.  His evidence included his personal history, including his education and employment and his problems with alcohol and drugs.  He gave evidence that he had suffered from epilepsy for 10 years.  The Respondent said that he had been to counselling concerning his alcohol and drug problems, and had attempted to find help within the prison system with limited success given his status as a remand prisoner.
29The Respondent said that he was well affected by alcohol at the time of the offence and had been using cannabis as well before then.  He had no recollection of the offence.  When confronted with the evidence, he accepted that the offence had occurred.  He said that he was ""appalled"" and ""disgusted"" in himself for having done such a thing to a family member and he apologised to the victim.  He was being held on protection at his own request.
30Under cross-examination, the Crown asked the Respondent:
""Q.  She was telling you to stop but you did these things and you said to her 'You're liking it' do you remember reading that?A.  Yes.
Q.  Would you accept from what she has said that it's not a case where you were blind drunk walking in mumbling and stumbling you were in control of your movements and going against her expressed verbal and physical indications of resistance, that's right isn't it according to what [the victim] says, you weren't blind drunk, stumbling in, falling over were you?A.  I know I was blind drunk I was getting drunk all the time.""
31The Crown Prosecutor provided written submissions to the sentencing Judge contending, amongst other things, that the offence fell ""in the mid range of offending"", with reference being made to the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  The Crown submission concerning objective gravity noted that the offence was an isolated incident, the Respondent was the victim's uncle in a position of authority, the offence involved a breach of trust, the fact that the Respondent had proceeded with the sexual assault despite strong verbal and physical requests to desist, the fact that the victim was aged just over 11 years and that the offence involved penile vaginal intercourse.  
32During the course of oral submissions from the Crown, his Honour enquired:
""HIS HONOUR:  What are the Crown submissions on the way in which the effects, combined effects of alcohol and cannabis work on the will of the offender?  That's the first question.  And what are the Crown submissions on the issue of special circumstances?
SHAW:  Well in terms of the effect of alcohol, your Honour accepting the version of events of - because there is no other of the complainant as I suggested in cross-examination, the Crown submission is that he was [not] so affected that he wasn't capable of knowing clearly what he was doing, he may not have had a memory subsequently but there was conversation, there was deliberation in his movements and even an endeavour to convince [the] 11 year-old complainant that she'd like being abused by her uncle.  Those are matters that really demonstrate the Crown submission that the effect of alcohol and drugs was disinhibiting rather than [placing] him in a position where he was close to having no ability to comprehend what he was doing.
In terms of special circumstances, there is clearly a need given that his drug and alcohol problems have not been addressed today for him to undergo supervision upon his release.  It is his first time in custody and in fact his first time before the court according to the record.""
33Counsel for the Respondent then made oral submissions on sentence, including the submission that the Respondent ""obviously has some significant problems in relation to drugs and alcohol"".  No submission was made that the Respondent's intoxication bore upon the objective gravity of the offence, nor was any challenge made to the Crown submission concerning the relevance of intoxication as set out in the preceding paragraph.  The focus of attention in submissions was the Respondent's subjective circumstances, including his sad life, remorse, prior good character, his plea of guilty and good prospects of rehabilitation.  
34In response to the Crown submission concerning aggravating factors, defence counsel accepted that the offence constituted a breach of trust, but disagreed that the Respondent was in a position of authority, contending that there was no evidence to suggest that he was.
35His Honour stood the matter down for sentence later in the day.  In the meantime, a letter prepared by the Respondent's mother arrived at Court and was tendered by consent in the Respondent's case.  The letter corroborated the Respondent's account concerning his unhappy family history.
The Remarks on Sentence
36His Honour sentenced the Respondent by way of ex tempore remarks delivered that afternoon.  
37The remarks on sentence were succinct.  Following a reference to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for the offence, his Honour recited the facts of the offence, before noting that the Respondent had no recollection of the offence itself.  


38His Honour said:
""Some cross examination of [the Respondent] was undertaken by the learned Crown Prosecutor today on the question of capacity and intent.
I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that [the Respondent] not only has no memory of what occurred on that night, but that his long standing problems with alcohol and drugs - to which I shall soon return - were the immediate and effective cause of his criminal conduct.
There is absolutely no suggestion in any of the evidence that he has an interest, ie a sexual interest per se, in children.""
39Reference was made to the victim impact statement and the consequences of the offence upon the victim.  
40The sentencing Judge said with respect to the offence itself:
""It is important to bear in mind when considering the objective seriousness of this offence, that apart from the offence itself (and by use of the word 'apart' I do not intend to diminish the seriousness of it) there was no violence, threat of violence, physical abuse or other aggravating factors which one frequently sees inflicted upon victims of sexual assault.""
41His Honour then turned to the Respondent's subjective circumstances, referring to his background of physical and mental abuse and his excessive consumption of alcohol and cannabis from an early age. 
42His Honour observed that the Respondent had come to Mudgee where his alcohol and cannabis consumption continued.  The sentencing Judge then said:
""I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the criminal conduct of [the Respondent] on this night is directly attributable to his long-term and untreated problems of alcohol and illicit drugs.
That consumption of those drugs and alcohol does not of course excuse in any way what was done but it provides the context in which this offence was committed.""
43Reference was made to the Respondent's limited criminal history and his expression of remorse for this offence.  A 25% discount was allowed for the Respondent's plea of guilty.  The Court found that the Respondent was genuinely remorseful and that this was an important factor in considering his prospects for rehabilitation.
44The sentencing Judge referred to the need to punish wrongdoing and to set up an environment where the wrongdoer can be rehabilitated.  His Honour found that the Respondent had ""reasonable to good prospects of rehabilitation provided that he does receive effective counselling for his long term problem of drugs and alcohol and the underlying factors, psychological and psychiatric factors, which have led him to these addictions"".
45A finding of special circumstances was made upon the basis of the Respondent's good prospects of rehabilitation, his age, the fact that he would serve his sentence largely, if not exclusively, in isolation and because of his lack of criminal history.
46The sentencing Judge observed that if the Respondent received treatment for his addiction, he was unlikely to reoffend and therefore, in his case, considerations of specific deterrence were not as prominent as might otherwise have been the case, but that general deterrence was ""a very significant factor"".
47Having found special circumstances, his Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years and eight months, with a balance of term of two years and seven months.  His Honour strongly recommended to the Department of Corrective Services that, whilst the Respondent was serving his sentence and when he was admitted to parole, he ""receive appropriate counselling and treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and also for the underlying psychological and psychiatric illnesses from which he is likely to suffer"".  
Grounds of Appeal
48The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
(a)Ground 1 - The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly consider the objective seriousness of the offence.
(b)Ground 2 - The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly consider the standard non-parole period.
(c)Ground 3 - The learned sentencing Judge erred in his Honour's approach to self-induced intoxication.
(d)Ground 4 - The learned sentencing Judge erred in that his Honour imposed a non-parole period that failed to reflect the criminality of the offending.
(e)Ground 5 - The sentence is manifestly inadequate.
Ground 1 - Failure to Properly Consider the Objective Seriousness of the Offence
Ground 2 - Failure to Properly Consider the Standard Non-Parole Period
49These grounds of appeal may be considered together.
Submissions of the Parties
50The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had failed to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and did not address the Crown submission on this issue or otherwise refer to factors which bore upon the objective seriousness of the offence, apart from observing an absence of violence towards the victim.  It was submitted that the need to consider and assess the objective gravity of the offence, even since the decision in Muldrock v The Queen, had not been met in this case.  The Crown submitted that this failure led in turn to the imposition of a sentence that failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
51In support of the second ground, the Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had mentioned the existence of a standard non-parole period for this offence at the commencement of the remarks on sentence, but that no later assessment was made to give effective meaning to the standard non-parole period in this case.  Submissions advanced in support of the first ground were made in support of this related ground of appeal.  
52Ms Manuell SC, for the Respondent, submitted that the sentencing Judge had referred to the facts of the offence and had described it as ""dreadful"" and a ""terrible thing"".  It was submitted that his Honour had conducted the sentencing hearing that day and had read the Agreed Statement of Facts for that purpose, together with the Crown written submissions.  In this way, it was submitted that the sentencing Judge had before him all relevant matters so that it was clear that they had been taken into account on sentence.  
53It was submitted for the Respondent, as well, that his Honour had found a causal link between the offence and the Respondent's consumption of alcohol and drugs, and that this bore upon an assessment of objective seriousness or objective gravity in this case.
54Ms Manuell SC emphasised that his Honour had proceeded to give ex tempore remarks on sentence at a busy circuit court, and that this consideration should be kept in mind when reading and considering the remarks on sentence:  Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [48]-[51]; R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130 at [34].
55Concerning the second ground, Ms Manuell SC emphasised the approach required in accordance with Muldrock v The Queen, and submitted that no error had been made by the sentencing Judge in this case as asserted in this ground.
Decision
56The observations made in R v Speechley at [34]-[35] are pertinent to consideration of these grounds:
""34... it is necessary to keep in mind that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing on 3 February 2012.  This course had the undoubted advantage that those present in Court could hear immediately the sentence which was passed and his Honour's reasons for passing that sentence.  A consequence of this approach, which is understandable in a busy court, is that remarks on sentence may not be 'as robustly structured as they might otherwise have been' (Simpson J in Simkhada v R [2010] NSWCCA 284 at [24]) and may 'lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing' (Simpson J in Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 at [57]).  
35When considering whether error has been demonstrated in the ways alleged by the Crown, it will be necessary to fairly read his Honour's remarks on sentence, bearing in mind the features of an ex tempore decision.""
57In Corby v R at [51], it was said that this Court should take a practical approach in assessing remarks on sentence, with an emphasis upon substance (and the resulting sentence) and not just matters of form.  
58In R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189, the Court said at [29]-[33]:
""[29] ... The principal purpose of remarks on sentence is to provide an oral explanation to the offender, the victim(s) and persons in court at the time when sentence is being passed: R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254 at [12]; Curtis v R [2007] NSWCCA 11 at [30]-[31]; R v Hersi [2010] NSWCCA 57 at [7].
[30] Remarks on sentence serve other purposes as well, including informing the community and an appellate court of the reason for imposition of the sentence: R v Duffy [1999] NSWCCA 321 at [11]; R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at 394-395 [42]-[44]; R v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498 ; 120 A Crim R 18 at 21 [19]; Thomas v R [2006] NSWCCA 313 at [16].
[31] In addition, various statutory provisions (such as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, ss 45(2) and 54B(4)) require reasons to be given in specified areas. The giving of remarks on sentence has been rendered more complex, not only by such statutory requirements, but also by the greater complexity of sentencing principle generally, as the detailed judgments of this court attest.
[32] It is important to recognise, therefore, that there is a practical tension between the principles requiring oral reasons, delivered in plain English and with brevity (usually in a busy list) and the need for reasons to satisfy the requirements of the law in the particular case. Remarks on sentence are frequently delivered ex tempore and, as the Chief Justice has observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 ; 66 NSWLR 566, at [48] 577:
The conditions under which District Court judges give such reasons are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed.
[33] Notwithstanding this tension, the obligation to give reasons remains. It is not a discretionary component of the sentencing process. ...""
59Although R v Hamieh predated the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen, the general statements concerning the necessary content of remarks on sentence, and the approach to be taken in reading them, remain applicable.  
60Making all due allowance for the ex tempore nature of the remarks on sentence, I am nevertheless satisfied that there was not a proper consideration of the objective seriousness or objective gravity of the offence in this case.  
61The Crown had made a submission in the District Court, not challenged directly by defence counsel, that the offence fell in the mid-range of offending.  
62An assessment of objective gravity is an important part of the sentencing function with respect to all offences.  In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL, I said at [46]:
""The process of instinctive synthesis to be undertaken by a sentencing court involves the sentencing judge identifying all the factors that are relevant to the sentence and then making a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 377-378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen at 1162 [26]. Assessment of the objective gravity of an offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]. It is an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis, a purpose of which is the imposition of a proportionate sentence, which adequately punishes an offender: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""
63The sentencing Judge's recital of the facts, accompanied by passing reference to the ""dreadful"" nature of the offence, did not suffice in this case.  The absence of additional acts of violence directed to the victim was not illuminating.  It is clear that a dominant factor, in the mind of the sentencing Judge, was the Respondent's intoxication, an issue to which I will return in the context of the third ground of appeal.
64The Crown submitted (correctly) that a number of features of this offence rendered it a serious example of aggravated sexual assault:  
(a)the assault involved full penile penetration - penile penetration of a young child involves conduct of a graver order of criminality than other forms of sexual intercourse contemplated by s.61H Crimes Act 1900 :  R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [27]-[28];
(b)the tender age of the victim - she had turned 11 years of age only eight days before the offence.  The victim was well below the age of 16 years, the chronological threshold for a s.61J offence of aggravated sexual assault:  s.61J(2)(d);  R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; 154 A Crim R 268 at 276 [42]-[43];
(c)the act of penetration hurt the victim:  R v PGM at [27]-[28];
(d)the degradation of the victim was increased by the Respondent ejaculating inside her vagina (R v Oloitoa [2007] NSWCCA 177 at [42]-[43]), with this necessitating her taking the morning-after pill to avoid pregnancy and undergoing ongoing serology testing for HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases;
(e)the forceful nature of the assault, with the Respondent forcing himself onto the victim over her protestations;
(f)the degrading assertion by the Respondent to the victim ""You're liking it"";
(g)the offence involved a breach of trust as the Respondent was the victim's uncle:  s.21A(2)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;
(h)the offence occurred in the victim's home:  s.21A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
65Further, the statement that the offence was an isolated one was to be understood in the context of an immediate complaint by the victim to her mother, followed by the speedy arrest of the Respondent the next day:  RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235 at [148].  This does not mean that a sentencing court should approach the matter upon the basis that there was likely to be a repetition of the offending conduct if the Respondent had not been arrested.  Rather, the point is that this was not a case where the offence occurred, and a significant time had passed before his arrest, so as to allow a positive submission to be made that this was a single offence not repeated, despite opportunities to do so, and was thus truly an isolated offence.  
66In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the Crown has made good the first ground of appeal.  There is an overlap between this and later grounds, so that an assessment of what flows from the success of this ground may be left until later in the judgment.  
67There is substantial overlap between the first and second grounds of appeal.  The standard non-parole period was a legislative guidepost on sentence:  Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [27].
68I do not consider it necessary in this case to add to the jurisprudence concerning the approach to be taken to the standard non-parole period since the decision in Muldrock v The Queen.  Error has been established in accordance with the first ground of appeal.   As will be seen, other grounds of appeal will also be upheld. 
69In these circumstances, it is not necessary to devote further attention to the second ground of appeal.
Ground 3 - Error in the Approach to Self-Induced Intoxication
Submissions of the Parties
70The Crown noted that the findings made by the sentencing Judge with respect to intoxication, and a suggested causal link to the offence, were not advanced by the Respondent's counsel in the District Court.  The Crown submitted that the approach of the Crown (and not disputed by defence counsel) in the District Court (see [32] above) reflected the correct approach to this issue, but that the sentencing Judge fell into error in making the findings which he did.
71The Crown submitted that intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs, may be mitigating in a limited way insofar as it indicates that an offence was impulsive, unplanned and that an offender's capacity to exercise judgment was impaired:  Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219 at [38]; R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296 at [34].  It was submitted that the Respondent's intoxication may serve to explain how his judgment was affected (to some extent) to act in this way, but that this was a not uncommon scenario for sexual assault offences, and can provide limited assistance only to an offender on sentence:  BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 279 at 397 [79].
72The Crown submitted that, in truth, the Respondent's intoxication should more appropriately be regarded as an aggravating feature.  He chose to consume a large quantity of alcohol and cannabis and he had known for many years that he had problems with drugs and alcohol.  It was submitted that such self-induced intoxication in a mature man increases, rather than decreases, his moral culpability for the predictable consequences of that choice:  R v Bourke [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at 44 [28]; Mendes v R [2012] NSWCCA 103 at [83].  
73The Crown submitted that his Honour had erroneously regarded the Respondent's intoxication as a powerfully mitigating factor and that this contributed to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence.  
74Ms Manuell SC submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the Respondent's absence of criminal convictions (and in particular, offences of this type) despite his history of heavy abuse of alcohol and cannabis, and that this assisted the Respondent in a conclusion that the offence was ""out of character"".  It was submitted that his Honour did not err in making the findings under challenge nor in approaching this issue as a mitigating factor in this case.  
Decision
75The present appeal concerns an aggravated sexual assault of an 11-year old girl by her 27-year old uncle.  It is difficult to see how voluntary or self-induced intoxication could bear upon the gravity of the offence, except as a possible aggravating factor.
76In Director of Public Prosecutions v G [2002] VSCA 6, Winneke P (Buchanan and Vincent JJA agreeing) observed, in the context of a sentence appeal for incest committed by an intoxicated offender upon a 14-year old victim, that the offender's conduct could not be ""explained, excused or ameliorated by the fact that his lust had been provoked by the liquor which had disinhibited him"" (at [10]).  Winneke P observed that the offender had abused the trust and confidence reposed in him and that ""parents - and those in loco parentis - who fail to exercise the restraint which the community expects of them, and who give into their own sexual gratification, must expect to be severely and appropriately punished"" (at [10]).
77These statements of Winneke P have particular resonance in a case such as this, where the young victim was assaulted sexually in her own bed by a supposedly trusted relative.
78Even in circumstances of offending against adult victims, voluntary intoxication  operates rarely (at best) to mitigate penalty.  In Hasan v R [2010] VSCA 352; 31 VR 28, the Victorian Court of Appeal (Maxwell P, Redlich and Harper JJA) considered a sentence appeal for rape of an adult victim by an offender who stated that he was heavily intoxicated at the time and had no memory of the offence.  The decision contains a most helpful review of authorities in the area of intoxication and offences of violence, including sexual assault.  Their Honours said at 33-34 [20]-[22]:
""[20] It is notorious that intoxication of the offender is a common feature of violent offending in general, and of sexual violence in particular. Not infrequently, sentencing judges are faced with a submission that the offender's intoxication made him/her behave in a manner that was 'out of character' and that his/her moral culpability for the offending should be seen as lessened accordingly. As already indicated, that is the submission which was advanced on this appeal.
[21] In the circumstances, it is timely to review the state of the law regarding intoxication as a sentencing consideration. As will appear, courts around Australia have consistently rejected the proposition that intoxication can mitigate the seriousness of an offence or reduce the offender's culpability. An 'out of character' exception is acknowledged to exist, but it has almost never been applied. On the other hand, it is recognised that intoxication can be an aggravating factor where the offender is shown to have had foreknowledge of how he/she is likely to behave when affected by alcohol. No issue of that kind arises here.
[22] The starting point for most modern discussions of the subject is R v Bradley [(1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 12], where Lord Widgery CJ said:
'This Court finds nothing in the case to indicate that that sentence was other than entirely correct. It is said that he was in drink. So he was. But the day is long past when somebody can come along and say 'I know I have committed these offences, but I was full of drink.' If the drink is induced by himself, then there is no answer at all. It is said it is out of character. So it was. He has a clean character. He had no previous convictions at all. It was said that he is a good son to his mother and he has a number of other skills as a citizen.
The plain fact is that on this afternoon he behaved himself in such a manner as to make it absolutely imperative that some suitable condign punishment should be imposed upon him. That was done and the appeal is dismissed'.""
79Their Honours observed (at 34 [23]-[24]) that the dictum of Lord Widgery CJ in R v Bradley (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 12 had been applied in decisions of different appellate courts in Australia.  
80Their Honours turned then (at 34 [25]ff) to cases which had considered the ""out of character"" exception concerning intoxication.  Reference was made to New South Wales decisions (at 35 [26]-[27]):
""[26] The exception was likewise recognised by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Coleman [(1990) 47 A Crim R 306], a case involving sexual violence. Speaking for the court, Hunt J said:
'The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account; such intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender's breach of the law. In some circumstances, it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated; in other circumstances, it may mitigate the crime because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character'.
[27]In [New South Wales], the existence of the exception was accepted in R v Fletcher-Jones [(1994) 75 A Crim R 381 at 387 (""Fletcher-Jones"")] and in R v Gordon [(1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 467]. But in neither case was the exception found to be applicable. In Fletcher-Jones [(1994) 75 A Crim R 381], the Court of Criminal Appeal (McInerney J) said [at 387]]:
'It has been pointed out by this Court on many occasions that whilst being affected by alcohol may explain why an offence occurred, it is not a licence to commit crimes, particularly in the nature of these [violent sexual] offences'.
More recent appellate decisions in Victoria have been to much the same effect. In three successive decisions - R v Walker [(unreported, Victorian Court of Appeal, 31 May 1996) (""Walker"")], R v Laffey [[1998] 1 VR 155 at 162] and R v Groom [[1999] 2 VR 159 at 164, [22]-[23]] - the Court of Appeal acknowledged the existence of the 'out of character' exception but held that it did not apply to the case at hand.""
81After references to other Victorian cases, their Honours said at 36-37 [31]-[34]:
""[31]Nor - with the exception of Davis [Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 May 1980, unreported - where a 17-year old offender with no sexual experience committed rape when drunk 'on the spur of the moment'] - have attempts to rely on intoxication in mitigation of sexual offending found favour in this court. In R v Phillips [[2000] VSCA 225], the trial judge had found that the offender was drunk when he raped his victim. This court held that the judge had not erred in refusing to treat the intoxication as a mitigating circumstance. In Director of Public Prosecutions v G [[2002] VSCA 6], which concerned an offender's sexual abuse of his 14-year-old step-daughter while affected by liquor, Winneke P said:
Nor, in my view, is the [offender's] conduct to be explained, excused or ameliorated by the fact that his lust had been provoked by the liquor which had disinhibited him'.
""[32] Our research has identified only one other instance of the application of the 'out of character' exception. As will appear, the circumstances were atypical. In Stanford v R [[2007] NSWCCA 73] the New South Wales Court of Appeal (Rothman J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hulme J agreed) said [at [56]-[57]]:
In this instance, the applicant became inebriated at his place with friends. He was consuming alcoholic drinks mixed by others and became uncharacteristically drunk to an extent that overwhelmed him. He went to bed and was awoken by the victims in search of Mr Davis. He then proceeded to prevent an assault on Mr Davis. The comment by his Honour the sentencing judge that the reaction to the disturbance and agitation by the victims was possibly affected by his inebriated state, is an inference with which it is difficult to cavil. The aberrant nature of the conduct supports the proposition that the applicant's overreaction was induced by the alcohol. The criminal conduct, however reprehensible, was an irrational response to the conduct of the victims, which irrationality was brought about by the effect of the alcohol. In those circumstances the intoxication is properly used as a mitigating factor.
Having come to that view, it cannot be stressed enough that the use of a firearm once intoxicated must be understood as conduct of the most serious and dangerous kind. The mitigation, in this case, does not derogate from that principle. The mitigation arises, not because the intoxication ameliorates the use of the weapon, but because the intoxication ameliorates what is otherwise an irrational reaction to the conduct of the victims, part of which reaction was the use of the weapon.
[33] Because the out of character exception has been so rarely applied, there has been almost no judicial exploration of the circumstances in which the exception might be applicable. It seems clear enough, however, that the circumstances must be quite exceptional before intoxication at the time of offending can mitigate the offender's moral culpability.
[34] On ordinary principles, the offender would bear the onus of showing that he/she did not know what effect alcohol would have on him/her. Given the widespread use of alcohol, and the fact that even a non-drinker would be well aware of its effects on a person who becomes intoxicated, this is doubtless a difficult burden to discharge. Moreover, an attempt to invoke the exception also carries with it the forensic risk that an investigation of the offender's drinking habits might lead to the conclusion that the state of intoxication was an aggravating rather than a mitigating circumstance.""
82The conclusions expressed by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Hasan represent the law to be applied on sentence in this State.  Properly understood, the ""out of character"" concept is a narrow one.  It has no application in the present case.
83Intoxication was a common state for the Respondent.  The fact that he had not previously committed an offence of this type, even though he was a heavy user of alcohol and cannabis, was as far as any available finding should have gone in this case.  The disinhibiting effect of his alcohol and cannabis use was of no assistance to him (see the observations of Winneke P in Director of Public Prosecutions v G set out at [76] above).
84The Respondent was able to exploit his proximity to his niece, for his own sexual gratification.  He made his way to her bedroom, clearly with an intention to sexually abuse her.  He was able to achieve an erection and ejaculate, at the same time suggesting to the victim that she was ""liking it"", despite her physical and verbal protests.  His intoxication may have had a disinhibiting effect, but it did not impede his verbal and physical ability to sexually abuse his niece in a grave manner.
85It was a generous finding to conclude that there was ""absolutely no suggestion"" that the Respondent had any sexual interest in children, given that he had committed this very offence against an 11-year old girl.  There was no psychiatric evidence before the sentencing Judge, nor any evidence concerning the risk of him reoffending in this way.
86A finding of a causal link between the Applicant's alcohol and cannabis abuse and the commission of this serious sexual assault offence was not open on the evidence before the sentencing Judge.
87In reality, the most favourable finding available to the Respondent in the circumstances was that his intoxication was not an aggravating factor in this case.
88The finding of substantial mitigation by the sentencing Judge was not supported by the evidence, and was not consistent with sentencing principles concerning the relevance of voluntary or self-induced intoxication on sentence.
89This ground of appeal has been made good.
Ground 4 - Error in Imposing a Non-Parole Period that Failed to Reflect the Criminality of the Offending - The ""Special Circumstances"" Issue
Submissions of the Parties
90Whilst accepting (as the Crown did at first instance) that a finding of ""special circumstances"" was appropriate in this case, the Crown submitted that there were both patent and latent errors in the discretionary determination undertaken by the sentencing Judge in the fixing of the non-parole period.
91The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had erred in taking into account a number of matters to find special circumstances, and that this approach involved according disproportionate weight to the Respondent's subjective circumstances in setting a non-parole period that failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence.
92The Crown accepted that the Respondent's prospects of rehabilitation warranted a finding of ""special circumstances"", however the extent of the departure from the statutory ratio was excessive, and resulted in a non-parole period that failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the purposes of sentencing.
93Referring to the factors which gave rise to the finding of ""special circumstances"", the Crown submitted that the Respondent's age (28 years at the date of sentence) was not a factor which was pertinent.  The Respondent was not a young offender and he was aware of his established problem of alcohol and cannabis abuse.
94The Crown submitted that the finding that the Respondent would serve his sentence in isolation was erroneous.
95Finally, the Crown noted that the Respondent's lack of criminal history, and the fact that it would be his first time in custody, were not circumstances which could be regarded as special, referring to decisions of this Court which have made this point, although noting other decisions of this Court had given effect to this factor as an available special circumstance.  
96Ms Manuell SC pointed to the Crown concession in the District Court (see [32] above) which accepted the relevance of the Respondent's need for supervision upon release given his alcohol and drug problems, and the fact that this was his first time in custody and his absence of prior criminal record.  
97Whilst acknowledging that the sentencing Judge had erred in finding that the Respondent would serve his sentence, or part of it, in isolation, it was submitted that other factors identified by the sentencing Judge gave rise to a strong foundation for a finding of ""special circumstances"" and a significant variation in the statutory ratio.
98 Ms Manuell SC pointed to a number of decisions of this Court which have accepted as ""special circumstances"" the fact that an offender had no prior criminal history and was entering custody for the first time, with particular reference being made to R v Kaliti [2001] NSWCCA 268.
99It was submitted that it had not been demonstrated that the variation of the statutory ratio gave rise to a clearly inadequate non-parole period in this case.
Decision
100The head sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was 63 months with a non-parole period of 32 months.  Accordingly, the non-parole period slightly exceeded 50% of the full term.  This was a very significant variation of the statutory ratio under s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
101This Court has emphasised the discretionary nature of a finding of ""special circumstances"".  However, the discretion is not unfettered.  Clearly, there is a need to identify the relevant circumstances as being ""special"".  
102This Court has also made clear that factors taken into account for the purpose of fixing the full term of imprisonment are not to be double counted as ""special circumstances"" in favour of the offender in setting the non-parole period.  This is not to say that factors considered for the purpose of setting the full term of imprisonment must be entirely disregarded when the time comes to set the non-parole period.  Clearly, there is the prospect for some overlap between factors which operate in making these two associated decisions as part of the sentencing process.  
103Given the issues raised on this appeal, it is appropriate to refer to certain decisions of this Court which have touched on these questions.  Although a judgment of a two-Judge Bench, the observations of Wood CJ at CL in R v Kaliti, at [10]-[13], are helpful:
""[10] In Kama [2000] NSWCCA 23, Spigelman CJ questioned whether the age and lack of antecedents of an offender and the fact that the sentence is one involving a first occasion of custody are, of themselves, special circumstances within the meaning of the legislation.
[11] I share that doubt, save to the extent that in an appropriate case, those circumstances may be reasons why, in conjunction with the remaining subjective circumstances, an assessment was justified that the applicant required a longer period than usual subject to a supervised release. Some care does need to be taken to avoid automatically elevating subjective circumstances of this kind, which are properly taken into account when fixing the term of the sentence, into special circumstances when consideration is given to s44(2) of the Act.
[12] Neither the age of the applicant, nor the fact of his prior clear record, or the absence of any previous custodial experience, point in that direction in this case, and I am not satisfied that they would here, themselves, constitute special circumstances.
[13] Where special help is needed to overcome an alcohol or drug problem, or where some form of psychiatric assistance is needed to deal with the underlying circumstances which generate those problems, and where that help cannot adequately be provided within the corrective system, or where it would require an extended period of release subject to supervision, then it may be accepted that special circumstances do exist.""
104The second member of the Bench, Howie J, agreed with Wood CJ at CL, with additional observations at [21]:
""I agree, but I simply want to add that in my view the finding of the personal circumstances which will permit a reduction in the non-parole period must be purposeful. The purpose to be achieved by a reduction of the non-parole period or a lengthening of the parole period must be something other than simply to relieve the offender of the burden of serving a minimum sentence of imprisonment as would be required by the operation of s44. In my view, there is no purpose for which the longer parole period or a lesser non-parole period would serve in this particular case, and, therefore, there are no special circumstances.""
105Statements of Spigelman CJ (Hulme and Adams JJ agreeing) in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 are frequently cited in this context.  The Chief Justice said at [18]-[20]:
""[18] In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, this Court identified the wide range of factors capable of constituting special circumstances. Nevertheless, on each occasion in which s 44(2) of the Act is invoked, it is necessary for the sentencing judge to make a decision, as noted in Simpson at [68] that the circumstances are sufficiently special for the statutory proportion to be reduced. Section 44(2) requires the 'decision' to be that the statutory proportion of one-third be 'less'. 'Double counting' for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non parole period, must be avoided. (See Simpson at [47]). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur.
[19] The flow of appeals on the issues of special circumstances to the court has not abated, notwithstanding the observations in Simpson at [73]:
As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.
[20] There is evidence that findings of special circumstances have become so common that it appears likely that there can be nothing 'special' about many cases in which the finding is made. Research by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales of the sentences imposed on 2,801 offenders in the Supreme and District Courts during 2002 suggest that Parliament's intention that the statutory proportion apply unless 'special circumstances' exist that justify departure from it, is not being carried out.""

106After referring to sentencing research, the Chief Justice continued at [22]:
""This research makes it necessary for this Court to state the obvious. Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a 'special circumstance' does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. To repeat what was said in Simpson at [68], it is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special to justify a variation.""
107More recently, McClellan CJ at CL (RA Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing) said in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [35]-[36]:
""35It was submitted to this Court that the applicant, being almost 50 years of age and facing her first time in custody with good prospects of rehabilitation, should have been given the benefit of a finding of special circumstances. 
36Inherent in this submission appears to be a misunderstanding of the role of special circumstances when sentencing. A finding of special circumstances is appropriate and relevant to a decision by a sentencing judge as to whether to depart from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the overall sentence. The authorities are replete with findings by sentencing judges and by this Court of special circumstances. When an offender's history of offending or personal circumstances indicate that he or she would benefit from an extended period of supervision within the community a finding of special circumstances may be appropriate. For my part, as I said in R v Clark [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [12], I have considerable reservations about whether the fact that a person will be in custody for the first time is capable of constituting special circumstances: see also R v Kama [2000] NSWCCA 23; (2000) 110 A Crim 47 at [10]. The fact that a person has no previous criminal record and, accordingly, has not previously been incarcerated is a matter relevant to the total sentence and non-parole period. However, it is unlikely to be a circumstance warranting further leniency to an offender by a reduction in the term of the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] (Spigelman CJ). Many persons who are sentenced will receive a sentence of imprisonment for the first time. That fact alone is unlikely to justify a finding that the offender's circumstances are special.""
108The resolution of this ground of appeal in the present case involves an assessment of the circumstances of the Respondent advanced as being special, so as to give rise to a variation in the statutory ratio.
109The Respondent has a long-standing problem with alcohol and cannabis abuse, about which not much had been done by him in the past to confront these difficulties and to rehabilitate himself.  This very serious offence was committed by him at the age of 27 years, at a time when he was intoxicated.  The Respondent recognises the gross nature of his offending and the need to take serious action to rehabilitate himself.  The fact that these events have occurred when he is in his late 20s means that there is still significant time in his life to confront these problems.  Beyond that, his age has little bearing on this question.  
110The fact that the Respondent has no prior history of offending, and in particular, sexual offending, means that this is, in reality, the first time that he is confronting his problems in the context of the criminal justice system.  In this way, there is some interaction between the Respondent's prospects of rehabilitation, his age, his lack of criminal history and the fact that this is his first time in custody.  
111It is common ground that the sentencing Judge's finding that the Respondent's sentence would be served, in whole or in part, ""in isolation"" was erroneous in fact and was thus wrongly taken into account as a factor bearing upon ""special circumstances"".
112However, the remaining factors identified by the sentencing Judge were capable of supporting a finding of ""special circumstances"" in this case.  This was the Crown concession in the District Court.
113It is the combination, or cumulative effect, of these factors in the Respondent's case which renders them ""special"".  Taken separately, as the authorities referred to earlier have emphasised, the fact that an offender has no criminal history, and is entering custody for the first time, cannot be regarded as special.  However, in this case, the Respondent is strongly motivated to take action with respect to features of his life which have interacted with his serious criminal offending, and which will require supervision in the community for an extended period upon release.
114A finding of ""special circumstances"" is a statutory precondition to departure from the 75% ratio.  However, as Howie J observed in R v Kaliti at [21] (see [104] above), the reduction of the non-parole period must be ""purposeful"".  As Wood CJ at CL said in R v Kaliti (at [13]), where ""special help"" is needed or some specific assistance is needed which cannot be provided in a custodial setting or where it would require an extended period of supervision, then ""special circumstances"" may exist (see [103] above).  What is clear, as Howie J observed in R v Kaliti, is that the purpose must be something other than simply to relieve the offender of the burden of serving a minimum sentence as required by s.44.  
115It may be seen, in this case, that a variation in the statutory ratio would be ""purposeful"".  The Respondent needs specific assistance and this assistance will be purposeful when he is released into the community, where alcohol and cannabis use will be available to him and he will require supervision and assistance.
116The effect of this conclusion, however, is only that some departure from the statutory ratio is warranted.
117There is a further consideration which must be kept in mind in considering the length of a parole period to be set as part of the sentence.  Unless an offender is within the narrow class of persons defined as ""serious offenders"" (and the Respondent is not), parole supervision will not extend beyond a period of three years after release on parole:  Clause 228 Crimes (Administration of Sentence) Regulation 2008; AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 at [90]; Collier v R at [37].  As it happens, the Respondent's parole period on the present sentence is 31 months.  However, upon resentencing, it will be necessary to keep in mind the maximum period of actual parole supervision available in determining the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence in his case.
118As the decision of this Court in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 (at 718 [65]) makes clear, the adjustment of the statutory ratio, after considering factors relevant to the fettered sentencing discretion, must lead to the imposition of a non-parole period which constitutes the minimum period which the offender should spend in custody having regard to all objective and subjective circumstances, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence.  The non-parole period should constitute the least period which the Respondent ought be required to serve for his crime before being eligible for parole, having regard to all the purposes of punishment and not simply his rehabilitation:  Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36].  
119A finding of ""special circumstances"" was both open and appropriate in this case.  However, I am satisfied that the extensive variation of the statutory ratio in this case (from 75% to just over 50%), taken with the quantum of the non-parole period itself (32 months), demonstrates that disproportionate weight has been given to the subjective circumstances of the Respondent:  R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466 at [25].  
120The circumstances of this case which warranted variation of the s.44(2) ratio, although capable of supporting a finding of ""special circumstances"", were incapable of supporting a finding leading to the imposition of a non-parole period just over 50% of the head sentence.  The non-parole period imposed, in my view, failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence:  Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [28].  
121I would uphold the fourth ground of appeal.
Ground 5 - The Sentence is Manifestly Inadequate
Submissions of the Parties
122The Crown submitted that the errors identified in the grounds of appeal already considered serve to explain and demonstrate how a manifestly inadequate sentence came to be imposed in this case.  
123Whilst acknowledging the limitations of sentencing statistics, the Crown noted that sentences for s.61J offences committed between January 2004 and December 2010 involved 184 offenders.  Of these, 78% received head sentences over five years (the Respondent received a head sentence of five years and three months) and 75% of offenders received a non-parole period of three years or more (the Respondent received a non-parole period of two years and eight months).
124The Crown referred to the decision in Enriquez v R [2012] NSWCCA 60, where an offender appealed unsuccessfully against an overall sentence of eight years and six months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years.  The offence involved a 15-year old victim.  The offender had previously been in a relationship with the victim's mother, with the offence being committed in the victim's home at a time when the offender was intoxicated and with no memory of the offence.  The offender was 39 years' old at the time of the offence.  The offender was of prior good character.  Garling J (McClellan CJ at CL and Davies J agreeing) noted (at [60]-[64]) that the objective seriousness of the criminality and the culpability of the offender, assumed principal importance in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  Notwithstanding the offender's good prospects of rehabilitation, a non-parole period of six years was justified.  
125The Crown referred, as well, to the decision in R v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217, where a substantial sentence was imposed upon an offender following trial.  
126The Crown submitted that the head sentence and non-parole period in this case were manifestly inadequate and that this Court should move to resentence the Respondent.  
127Ms Manuell SC submitted that an examination of sentencing statistics  indicated that the sentence imposed upon the Respondent was not outside the range of sentence for such offences.  By reference to statistics for the period January 2005 to December 2011, it was submitted that the total terms imposed in that period involved 55 offenders who had pleaded guilty with a median total sentence of six years' imprisonment and a median non-parole period of 42 months.
128It was submitted for the Respondent that there were features of Enriquez v R which were distinguishable from the present case, and that R v FB was directly affected by the decision in Muldrock v The Queen so that it ought be placed to one side for present purposes.
129Ms Manuell SC submitted that the sentence imposed in this case lay within the range of sentences available in the proper exercise of sentencing discretion in all the circumstances of the case.  
Decision
130A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust:  Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58].
131As this Court has said on many occasions, considerable caution should be exercised in the use of bare sentencing statistics in considering an appeal against sentence in a particular case.  Likewise, the sentencing outcome in other specific cases is of very limited assistance, unless the offenders are related offenders for the purpose of application of the principles of parity and proportionality.  
132The particular features of the Respondent's offence which bear upon an assessment of its objective gravity were referred to earlier (at [64]).  Of particular importance is the age of the victim, barely 11 years' old.  
133The victim in this case was asleep at home in her bed, entitled to the security which those circumstances ought provide to a child.  The Respondent took advantage of the position of trust in which he had been placed by  sexually assaulting his niece.  
134Full penile vaginal intercourse took place with the Respondent ejaculating in the victim.  The victim manifested to the Respondent her lack of consent and her protest at these actions.  Although the Respondent's intoxicated state may have blunted his reactions to an extent, he persisted in the course of conduct for his own sexual gratification, disregarding entirely the interests of his victim.  
135There was ample material before the sentencing Judge demonstrating the significant detrimental impact caused to the victim in this case, with those effects likely to be long standing in their adverse effects on her life.
136Undue attention to the Respondent's subjective circumstances caused inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case, resulting in the imposition of a sentence which was not reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the crime:  R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.
137In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed upon the Respondent was manifestly inadequate.  
138I would uphold this ground of appeal. Discretionary Considerations and Resentencing the Respondent
139If the point was reached on the Crown appeal where the Court found error and was considering resentencing the Respondent, Ms Manuell SC submitted that the Court ought receive further evidence, in the form of an affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 4 October 2012, and an affidavit of the Respondent's solicitor affirmed on 4 October 2012.  The affidavit of the Respondent outlined steps he had been taking in custody in an effort to obtain counselling and treatment.  Annexed to the affidavit of the Respondent's solicitor are a report of Dr Peter Ashkar, consultant forensic psychologist, dated 24 September 2012 and a report of Dr Adam Martin, forensic psychiatrist, dated 16 January 2012, together with other documents relating to the Respondent's classification and placement in custody.  
140The report of Dr Martin was available to the Respondent's legal representatives at the time of his sentencing hearing in the District Court, although not deployed at that hearing.  However, it may be relied upon by the Respondent on a Crown appeal to this Court against sentence, where the Court is considering the question of resentence.
141The Report of Dr Martin appears to have been prepared largely for the purpose of an assessment as to fitness to be tried.  Dr Martin did not find the Respondent to have current major cognitive problems and, on the basis of the information available to him, did not diagnose paraphilia such as paedophilia, although further review was suggested in this respect.  In terms of future management, Dr Martin considered that the Respondent clearly required ""assertive intervention regarding drug and alcohol misuse and further psychiatric and psychological review aimed at excluding paraphilia which might require psychiatric intervention"".
142The purpose of the report from Dr Ashkar was to assess the Respondent's conditions of custody after sentence and their psychological impact, and the conditions of the Respondent's custody since the lodgement of the Crown appeal and their psychological impact.  Dr Ashkar concluded that the Respondent was experiencing significant symptoms of anxiety and depression because of the Crown appeal against his sentence.  Dr Ashkar concluded that the Respondent was motivated to address his substance abuse and offending behaviour, and that he would benefit from timely access to treatment.
143Evidence concerning the actual adverse impact of the pending Crown appeal upon the Respondent is relevant and admissible at the hearing of a Crown appeal:  R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 32 [141]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 42-43 [174]-[178].
144However, clear error has been demonstrated by the Crown, and there is no proper discretionary basis for this Court to decline to intervene and resentence the Respondent.
145Having regard to the objective gravity of the Respondent's offence, the importance of general deterrence and the Respondent's subjective circumstances, and bearing in mind the statutory guideposts in the form of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, I am satisfied that a head sentence of 10 years' imprisonment is appropriate before applying the 25% discount for the Respondent's plea of guilty.  After discount, the head sentence will be one of seven years and six months.
146The psychiatric and psychological evidence before this Court serves to fortify the conclusion that intervention is required to assist rehabilitative steps concerning the Respondent, and that this consideration supports a finding of ""special circumstances"" leading to a variation of the statutory ratio to provide for an extended period of parole supervision when the Respondent returns to the community.
147If the s.44 statutory ratio remained in place, the non-parole period would be five years, seven months and two weeks.  I would find special circumstances and fix a non-parole period of four years and 10 months in this case.  In my view, no lesser non-parole period is appropriate having regard to relevant sentencing principles and, in particular, the objective gravity of the Respondent's crime.
148It is appropriate to confirm the recommendation of the sentencing Judge concerning counselling and treatment for the Respondent both in custody and when admitted to parole.
Conclusion
149I propose the following orders:
(a)Crown appeal allowed;
(b)sentence imposed upon the Respondent on 26 April 2012 in the District Court is quashed;
(c)for the offence under s.61J Crimes Act 1900, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and 10 months, commencing on 2 September 2011 and expiring on 1 July 2016, with a balance of term of two years and eight months commencing on 2 July 2016 and expiring on 1 March 2019;
(d)confirm the recommendation to the Department of Corrective Services that whilst the Respondent is serving his sentence, and whilst he is subject to parole, he receive appropriate counselling and treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and also for any underlying psychological and psychiatric illnesses diagnosed in his case.
150BELLEW J:  I agree with Johnson J.

		21 November 2012",2012-11-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760507,R v Lauren Mae Batcheldor [2012] NSWSC 1398,"Judgment
INtroduction
1On 30 July 2010, Lauren Mae Batcheldor (""the offender"") was jointly indicted with Richard James Walsh (""Walsh"") in the following terms:

(i)that they, between 22 January 2010 and 25 January 2010, whilst in the company of each other, detained Matthew Digby without his consent, and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely to obtain information about property previously stolen, and that at the time of the detaining, actual bodily harm was occasioned to Matthew Digby.

(ii)that they between 22 January 2010 and 25 January 2010 at Dapto in the State of New South Wales, did murder Matthew Digby.


2The offender pleaded not guilty to each of those charges. 

3On 17 August 2012 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of both charges. I heard submissions in respect of sentence on 2 November 2012.

4The Crown case against the offender in respect of the second count in the indictment, namely the offence of murdering Matthew Digby (""the deceased"") was one of constructive murder. The Crown alleged that the deceased was killed during the commission, by the offender and Walsh (""Walsh""), of the offence in the first count, namely the offence of kidnapping in circumstances of special aggravation, pursuant to s. 86(3) of the Crimes Act. 

5The offence of specially aggravated kidnapping carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period prescribed. 

6The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Pursuant to s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment is prescribed for that offence.

7In written submissions the Crown drew my attention to the provisions of s 61(1) of the Sentencing Act which mandates the imposition of a life sentence for the offence of murder if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. However, the Crown did not submit that the offence of murder committed by the offender fell into that category and I am satisfied that it does not. Accordingly, the imposition of a life sentence is not warranted.

SENTENCING PRINCIPLES
General considerations
8As I have indicated, the offence of murder carries a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment. I must therefore adopt an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a conclusion reached as to the appropriate sentence, having regard to such factors. Such an approach is mandated by the relevant statutory provisions generally, and by the provisions of ss 55B(2), 54B(3) and 21A of the Sentencing Act in particular (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26] citing Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]).

9The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It therefore represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27]; [31]). 

10For the purposes of determining an appropriate sentence, I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the circumstances of the offending. Any factual findings I make must be consistent with the jury's verdicts. In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by those verdicts and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is inconsistent with those verdicts (see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374). The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender. The offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation, on the balance of probabilities. 

11Finally, in circumstances where the offender has been convicted of two offences, I must have regard to principles of totality (see Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610).

Sentencing in cases of constructive murder
12As I have already noted, the Crown case against the offender in respect of the second count was one of constructive murder. Counsel for the offender submitted that this should lead to the imposition of a lesser sentence than would have been imposed had the Crown put its case against the offender on the basis that she had intentionally killed the deceased. In my view, that submission should be rejected. 

13In R v Mills (NSWCCA 5 April 1995 unreported) Gleeson CJ rejected the proposition that cases of constructive murder involve a lower level of culpability, such that they should attract a lower sentence than would apply to a case of an intentional killing. That principle has been confirmed in a number of cases since. For example in R v Jacobs [2004] NSWCCA 462; (2004) 151 A Crim R 452 Wood CJ at CL (with whom Kirby and Sperling JJ agreed) said (at [332]):

""Constructive murder is not to be regarded as less serious, and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period, than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder: R v Mills NSWCCA 3 April 1995. Just as is the case for the other categories, there are degrees of seriousness of constructive murder and the determination of the appropriate sentence for any individual offence depends upon the nature of the offender's conduct and the part which he or she played in the events giving rise to the death: R v JB [1999] NSWCCA 93.


THE VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS
14The court received victim impact statements from John Digby, the deceased's father (which was read to the court by Mr Digby on behalf of both himself and the deceased's mother Dianne Digby), and from Marcus Digby, the deceased's brother. Mrs Digby also read to the court a victim impact statement on behalf of her son, Leighton. 

15Unsurprisingly, the members of the deceased's immediate family continue to suffer considerable grief following the loss of their son and brother. Their grief stems not only from the fact of the deceased's death, but also from the circumstances in which that death occurred, and from what occurred in its aftermath. 

16I wish to take this opportunity of expressing my condolences to each of the members of the deceased's family upon their loss. It is to be hoped that the opportunity that they were given to provide their statements to the court will go some way to assisting them in their grieving.

17In his written submissions, the Crown Prosecutor raised an issue regarding the continuing applicability of the statement of principle contained in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 pertaining to victim impact statements. In doing so, the Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to the provisions of ss 3A(g) and 21A(2)(g) of the Sentencing Act, and to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300; (2005) 41 MVR 399. Section 3A(g) of the Sentencing Act provides that one of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence upon an offender is to ""recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community"". Section 21A(2)(g) of the Sentencing Act includes, as an aggravating factor, a circumstance where ""the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial"". 

18In Previtera Hunt CJ at CL observed:

""A victim impact statement was provided by the deceased's son ... In my opinion however, it could never be appropriate to take a statement of that nature into account in sentencing the offender in such a case"".

19Having explained why this was so, his Honour said:

""The victim impact statement in the present case, as I have said, speaks of the reactions of the deceased's son and daughter to the murder. That material is relevant to any compensation which they may seek from the Victims Compensation Tribunal but it is irrelevant to the task which I have to perform here in sentencing the prisoner. It is therefore inappropriate to consider it in determining the sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner in this case"".


20In Berg Wood CJ at CL, in reference to the decision in Previtera, observed (at [42] - [43]; 407):

""[42] That case does suggest that a victim impact statement is not relevant to the sentencing exercise, at least in the circumstances considered in that case, where there had been a death.

[43] The reasons given in Previtera may need to be reconsidered in an appropriate case, by reason of the inclusion of the statement of the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the (Sentencing Act). I 
refer particularly to the reference in s 3A(g)..."".


21In SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231 Johnson J (at [86]) said:

""A sentencing judge must approach victim impact statements (from the family of a deceased) within the confines laid down in R v Previtera at 84-87; R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 at 529-530; R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274 at [15]-[18] and Whybrow v R [2008] NSWCCA 270 at [17].""

22More recently, in Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41 Howie J, with specific reference to the decision in Berg as well to the same legislative provisions as those to which the Crown drew my attention, said (at [36]):

""The Crown, however, relied upon s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 particularly having regard to what the Chief Justice said in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300; (2004) 41 MVR 399 as to the implications of that section upon the continued application of the principle enunciated in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. That decision held that a court could take into account the effects of the death of the deceased upon family or others when sentencing for murder.

[37] The particular of s 3A relied upon is s 3A(g) which in effect states that one of the purposes of punishment is to ""recognise the harm done to the victim and the community"". Reliance is also placed upon s 21A(2)(g) of the Act, that in effect provides that it is an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing that ""injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial"". In Berg the Chief Justice questioned whether the existence of s3(A)(g) and 21A(2)(g), and the introduction of victim impact statements into sentencing proceedings, might result in a need to revisit Previtera. In R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274 a specially constituted Court of five judges was convened to reconsider Previtera but, after hearing argument in the matter, the Court determined that it was not a suitable vehicle for that purpose. This Court has continued to apply Previtera and the obiter of the Chief Justice in Berg has never again been considered in that regard.

[38] In my opinion neither the existence of s 3A(g) or s 21A(2)(g) leads to a conclusion that the common law of this State has been altered by the introduction of those provisions.""

23In my view, it is clear from these authorities that the statement of principle of Hunt CJ at CL in Previtera, concerning the use of victim impact statements provided by the members of the family of a deceased person, remains applicable. 

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING
24The Crown submitted, and counsel for the offender accepted, that it was evident from the jury's verdict on the first count in the indictment that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that: 

(1)the offender detained the deceased;

(2)she did so knowing that he was not consenting;

(3)she did so with the intention of obtaining information from him concerning the robbery;

(4)she was acting in the company of the co-offender Walsh in do doing; and

(5)actual bodily harm was inflicted upon the deceased whilst he was detained.

25Bearing these matters in mind, and also bearing in mind the fact that the jury found the offender guilty of murder based upon her commission of the offence in the first count, I am satisfied that the circumstances of the offending were as follows.

The burglary at the offender's home
26Between about 14 and 15 January 2010 the offender's home was the subject of a burglary. As a consequence, various items of property were stolen. Amongst those items, and of particular significance in the present case, was a gold necklace. A coin collection belonging to Walsh, who was a long standing acquaintance of the offender, was also stolen. 

The disposal of stolen property by the deceased
27On or about 18 January 2010 the deceased sold the gold necklace which had been stolen from the offender's premises to a second hand dealer in Wollongong for a sum $250. How that item came to be in the possession of the deceased is not entirely clear. There was some evidence given in the trial that the deceased had told the offender that he had acquired the necklace from a prostitute. In any event, it is not necessary for present purposes that I reach an affirmative conclusion in relation to that issue.

28Evidence was given at the trial, which was not disputed, that on the afternoon of 18 January 2010 the offender visited the second hand dealer in the company of a friend, Evren Agdiran (""Agdiran""). On that occasion, she identified the necklace as the one which had been stolen from her home. She also managed to identify the deceased as being the person who sold it to the second hand dealer earlier that day. 

29Agdiran subsequently made a statement to the police and was called by the Crown to give evidence at the trial. Despite his attempts to resile from his statement, I am satisfied that after attending the second hand dealer, the offender said to Agdiran, in reference to a proposed visit to the deceased's premises: 

""I'm going to go there and get my shit back. I'm going to baseball bat, smash the house"".

30I am satisfied that upon learning that the deceased had been responsible for selling her necklace to a second hand dealer, the offender formed a suspicion that the deceased was responsible for the burglary at her home, or that he might at least have information regarding the burglary. It was in these circumstances that she initiated an attendance, by herself and others, at the deceased's home. 

The offender's attendance at the deceased's premises
31On the evening of 18 January 2010 the offender, Walsh and Cihan Karaoglu (""Karaoglu"") all attended upon the deceased's premises. Another person, in respect of whom there are non-publication orders, and to whom I will refer as ""A"", accompanied them. A was originally charged with the deceased's murder. However, that charge was withdrawn, and A was granted an indemnity by the Attorney-General. A gave evidence for the Crown. Having observed A give evidence, I formed the view that generally speaking, A was doing the best to be truthful.

32When the offender and the other three persons arrived at the deceased's premises, the deceased was not present. The only person in attendance was Michael Small, who was an acquaintance of the deceased. I am satisfied, having regard to the evidence given at the trial, that upon the arrival of these four persons at the deceased's premises, the offender who asked for the deceased. I am also satisfied that the offender, having determined that the deceased was not there, asked Mr Small to telephone the deceased, following which the offender and the deceased had a conversation. 

33Following that, Walsh and Karaoglu started searching the premises. In light of the offender's evidence that she had told Walsh and Karaoglu that there might be jewellery at the premises, I am satisfied that although the premises were not personally searched by the offender, they were searched by persons on her behalf. 

34Whilst the offender and the others were still there, the deceased arrived home, having been driven there by a friend, Tini Eli, who gave evidence in the trial. The deceased told Mr Eli that the ""big boys"" wanted to speak with him. I infer that this comment, and the deceased's arrival at his home, were consequent upon his earlier telephone conversation with the offender. 

35Mr Eli also gave evidence, which I accept, that he remained outside the premises and could hear shouting and swearing. He also gave evidence that when all of the persons (including the offender) came out of the premises one of them said to the deceased words to the effect ""you'd better get that stuff back"". 

36Agdiran also gave evidence, and I am satisfied, that following the visit to the deceased's premises the offender had said (in reference to the deceased):

""He didn't want to buckle, you know, he's staunch"".

37The offender admitted when giving evidence at the trial that she was ""not calm"" when she attended the deceased's premises, and that the tone of the conversation was ""not polite"". She also agreed that the atmosphere ""would have been a little bit stressful"" for Mr Small, because there were ""three strangers there that he didn't know"". I am satisfied that the attendance of the offender and the others at the premises would have been equally stressful for the deceased. 

Subsequent contact between the offender and the deceased
38On 19 and 20 January 2010 there was regular mobile telephone contact between the offender and the deceased. I am satisfied that this contact was in relation to the offender's stolen property. It culminated in the deceased and the offender attending the second hand dealer on 20 January 2010, where the deceased redeemed the necklace which he had previously sold and returned it to the offender.

The meeting at Beaton Park
39There was no dispute at the trial that a meeting took place at Beaton Park between the offender, Walsh and the deceased at about 12.30am on 23 January 2010. It was the offender's case at trial that this meeting was a completely innocent one, and involved no more than the deceased offering to sell her an ""X-Box"" console. It is evident from the jury's verdict that they rejected that account, and that they accepted the Crown case that the deceased was detained without his consent at that meeting, for the purposes of obtaining further information from him regarding the burglary at the offender's premises. 

40There was evidence in the Crown case at trial that between 20 January 2010 and 23 January 2010 the offender was in regular telephone contact with the deceased and Walsh. That telephone contact included contact between the offender and the deceased at 12.02am on 23 January 2010 (being a telephone call from the offender to the deceased) and further contact at 12.03am by way of an SMS message from the offender to the deceased. I am satisfied that the telephone contact between 20 January and 23 January to which I have referred related, at least in part, to the subject of the stolen property, and that in the course of that contact arrangements were made for the meeting at Beaton Park to take place. Just has she had previously initiated the search of the deceased's premises, I am satisfied that the offender also initiated the meeting at Beaton Park. 

41According to the offender a fourth person, Stacey Callaghan, was also present. Ms Callaghan had originally provided a statement to the police in relation to that matter. Only a matter of days later, she provided another statement to the offender's solicitor, the contents of which were, at least in part, contrary to those of the first statement. Although Ms Callaghan was issued with a subpoena to attend and give evidence she did not do so and her whereabouts were unknown. The contents of both of her statements were before the jury but in circumstances where her evidence was not tested, I am not able to determine whether or not she was present at the meeting at Beaton Park. 

42I am satisfied on the evidence that the deceased arrived in his own vehicle at Beaton Park, that he met with the offender and Walsh, and that at that point he was detained. I am further satisfied that the deceased left Beaton Park in the company of Walsh, in a vehicle owned by A, the deceased's own vehicle remaining at Beaton Park at that point.

The death of the deceased
43According to the offender, she left Beaton Park, after which Walsh and the deceased then attended her premises, at which time the deceased informed her of the whereabouts of the stolen property. I am not satisfied that such a visit occurred. If it were the case that the deceased wanted to convey that information to the offender, he could simply have done so by telephone. A personal visit to her premises in the early hours of the morning was simply not necessary for that purpose.

44I am satisfied that having left Beaton Park, the offender made her way to A's premises, separately from Walsh who had the offender detained in his car. On the way, the offender told A that she and Walsh were on their way to her premises and upon her arrival, the offender asked A to open the garage door. A short time later, Walsh arrived, drove the vehicle in which the deceased was detained into the garage, and entered the premises through an internal door, telling A that he ""had (the deceased) in the car"". 

45At that stage Walsh told A that he was going to speak to the deceased ""to find out what he knows and where the things are"", following which he returned downstairs to the garage. At about this point, the offender left the premises. There was a subsequent altercation in the garage of the premises between Walsh and the deceased, in the course of which the deceased was killed. As I have set out more fully in my reasons for sentence in relation to Walsh, I am satisfied that the deceased was killed by the act of Walsh in the course of an altercation between the two of them in the garage of A's premises.

46As I have already observed, there had been a considerable amount of telephone contact between the offender and the deceased leading up to their meeting at Beaton Park. The last such contact was recorded as having occurred at 2.46 am on 23 January 2010. There is no evidence that the offender tried to contact the deceased after that time. I am satisfied that she did not do so because she was aware that the deceased had been killed. 

Events following the deceased's death
47At some point later in the morning of 23 January, the offender returned to A's premises. In the presence of the offender, Walsh told A to move the deceased's car from where it had been left at Beaton Park. This, I am satisfied, was to create the impression that the deceased had simply left of his own accord, rather than raise some suspicion that he had left with Walsh. The offender then drove A to Beaton Park and she identified the deceased's vehicle. A then followed the offender out of Beaton Park in that vehicle and drove it to the Botanical Gardens nearby, where it was left.

48On 24 January 2010 Walsh told A that he needed some masks. I infer that this request was made due to the fact that the deceased's body was decomposing. A and the offender then drove to Kiama where they acquired what A described as two ""rubber masks"". They then returned to A's premises, at which time Walsh directed A to go to Wollongong Hospital to obtain a quantity of syringes. According to A, Walsh told her to walk inside so as to be depicted on CCTV footage. When A asked why, Walsh explained, in the offender's presence, that he was going to dispose of A's vehicle, in which the deceased still remained. It is apparent that this was an attempt at creating some alibi for A. The offender then drove A to the hospital.

49Subsequently, A received a telephone call from Walsh asking her to collect him from an area known as Mount Murray. I am satisfied that Walsh had driven to that location in A's vehicle, and had set fire to the vehicle with the deceased's body still inside. A then used the offender's vehicle to collect Walsh, before returning home. 

50At about 7am, on 25 January 2010, the body of the deceased was found in a burnt out vehicle in bushland at Mount Murray. His body had been chained to the front passenger seat of the vehicle. 

51On that same morning, A drove to the offender's home in the offender's vehicle. As she was leaving home, Walsh placed a bag in the vehicle which he said he wanted burned, and which contained the clothing that he was wearing when he set alight to the vehicle containing the deceased's body. Upon arrival at the offender's premises, A told the offender that Walsh had incinerated the car, and that the deceased's body was inside it. The offender said nothing by way of response. I am satisfied that this was because she knew of the deceased's death by this time.

52A also informed the offender of the bag which Walsh had placed in the car, and of his request that it be burned. I am satisfied that the offender telephoned her then boyfriend to have him come and collect the bag and dispose of it, and that in the course of doing so she said to him: 

""Please don't ask questions Mick, just can you do it for me, there's one thing I need you to do, that's that"".

53The offender's boyfriend then removed the bag from the vehicle. I am satisfied that he disposed of it, although where and how he did so is not known. 

54On the evening of the same day, 25 January 2010, at 11.31pm, the offender sent an SMS message to her boyfriend which read:

""After everything that's happened you still accuse me of lying. I can't believe you Mick, I am really on edge you know. Why would you do this to me, I'm really sorry I got you involved. But I do thank you very much for helping me. I would be fucked if you didn't and will never forget what you did for me.""

55I am satisfied that this message referred, at least in part, to the disposal of the bag by the offender's boyfriend.

56As A had no vehicle, she continued to use the offender's vehicle over the ensuing days, before the offender asked for its return. At the offender's suggestion, arrangements were made for A to obtain a rental car for a short period, for which the offender paid.

57Finally, in his statement to police, Agdiran said that at some time after 26 January, the offender had said to him:

""Do you know if there is a website where you can check whether there are CCTV cameras like at Macquarie Pass or Beaton Park because that's where we met him, at Beaton Park. I don't know if there's cameras there?""

58Despite Agdiran's attempts to resile from his statement, I am satisfied that these words were said by the offender.

THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING
59The gravamen of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping is the unlawful detaining of a person. There are a number of factors which can be relevant in making a determination of the seriousness of such offence. They include the circumstances of the detention, its period, and its purpose. The nature of the advantage sought to be obtained is not conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence. In particular, the presence or absence of a ransom as the advantage is not decisive in a determination of the seriousness of the offence (see R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [32].

60The offender was apparently not satisfied with having visited the deceased's premises, and intimidating and frightening him in the manner I have previously described, nor was she satisfied with having retrieved the stolen necklace. She proceeded to make arrangements with the deceased to meet him at Beaton Park. The jury's verdict in respect of the first count reflects an acceptance of the Crown case that the deceased was detained at that point, for the purpose of obtaining information regarding the burglary. On the Crown case, the offender was not directly responsible for detaining the deceased in a physical sense, although once he was detained she exhibited little or no regard for his welfare. Although the evidence is not precise, I am satisfied that the deceased's detention extended over some hours, during which time the deceased would obviously have been in great fear. Thereafter, the offender was instrumental in assisting to remove the deceased's car from Beaton Park, so as to avoid suspicion. 

61From the time at which she discovered that her home had been broken into, the offender, like all citizens who regrettably find themselves the victims of burglary and similar criminal activity, had available to her a conventional, lawful and non-violent avenue of redress: she could simply have reported the burglary to the police, and allowed them to undertake the necessary investigation. That she chose not to take that course, and resorted instead to detaining the deceased in the manner I have described, renders the specially aggravated kidnapping offence a serious one. The end result serves as a stark reminder what can occur when people inappropriately choose to take the law into their own hands. 

62The seriousness of an offence of murder needs no emphasis. However, I must have regard to the fact that there is no evidence that the offender, in detaining the deceased, contemplated that he would be killed. I must also have regard to the fact that she is not to be sentenced on the basis that she was responsible for the act which caused the deceased's death, and that she was not responsible for the incineration of the vehicle containing the deceased's body. She did, however, assist in other ways, including arranging the disposal of a bag containing the clothes worn by Walsh at the time he set alight to the vehicle containing the deceased's body. 

63Taking all of these matters into account, it is my view that the offending in respect of each matter falls slightly below the mid range of objective seriousness. 

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES
64On behalf of the offender there was a large amount of documentary material tendered on sentence. The contents of that material may be summarised as follows:

(i)a report of Dr Richard Furst, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrst dated 22 October 2012;

(ii)clinical notes made available by the offender's General Practitioner;

(iii)a number of testimonials;

(iv)documentary evidence of rehabilitative courses which have been undertaken by the offender since being taken into custody at the conclusion of her trial. 

65In addition to the written material, I heard evidence from the offender's mother as well as from John Pearman, the father of the offender's former boyfriend. I accept that both persons remain supportive of the offender, notwithstanding the jury's verdict. 

66The offender is now 31 years of age. She has two children, a 12 year old son and a 7 year old daughter who are being cared for by their father and by the offender's mother. 

67The offender has a long history of drug use, particularly amphetamines. Contained within the material tendered on sentence is a report of Alex Hains, Clinical Psychologist, of 2 May 2012, in which Mr Hains reported having treated the offender as a consequence of an escalation in her use of amphetamines in the period leading up to her trial. This treatment followed similar treatments undertaken by the offender, for the same reasons, in 2011. According to Mr Hains, she had ""responded positively"" to that treatment. 

68The history provided to Dr Furst by the offender confirms her prior drug and alcohol use. In that regard Dr Furst reported as follows:

""Ms Batcheldor has a history of drinking and cannabis abuse from the age of 14 years. She tended to drink on the weekends. She used amphetamines from the age of 15 years. There was a pattern of on going drinking in her teen and 20s. She was drinking on a daily basis about 6 years ago, generally one bottle of bourbon per day. There were no withdrawal symptoms when she did not drink, suggesting she was not dependent on alcohol. 

She used ""ecstasy"" (MDMA) between her teens and the age of 25 years, generally on an intermittent basis on weekends. She used 'ice' (crystal methyl - amphetamine) from the age of 25 years, which became a daily pattern of use during her post-natal depression 6 years ago. She generally used one gram per day at the time, with less drinking. She denied ever using heroin.""

69 Dr Furst also recorded a history of the offender suffering from depression and anxiety. He also made reference to the fact that the offender was ""under the care of a psychiatrist working for Justice Health in relation to her emotional distress and inability to cope away from her children and family"". I do not have a report from the offender's treating psychiatrist before me, but I accept that she is undergoing treatment. I also accept, on the basis of the report of Dr Furst, that the offender is currently taking anti-depressant medication.

70Dr Furst diagnosed the offender as suffering from a major depressive disorder. He noted that she presented with a history of depression over a period of 10 years, with a particularly severe depressive episode following the birth of her daughter which coincided with the break down of her relationship with the father of both of her children. He also noted evidence of ongoing and severe depressive symptoms in 2010 that required treatment with medication, and a reported suicide attempt whilst the offender was on bail.

71Dr Furst expressed the view that the offender's custodial setting is likely to ""weigh more heavily on (her) than the average inmate by virtue of her mental disorder"". I have had regard to Dr Furst's opinion, although there is no evidence before me which might suggest that the offender will not be afforded appropriate medication, or that she will not otherwise be adequately treated, whilst serving any sentence.

72In addressing the offender's prospects of rehabilitation Dr Furst expressed the following opinion:

""Ms Batcheldor is articulate and open to further psychiatric and psychological treatment. She has a good prognosis provided she receives adequate support, as outlined in the treatment plan above. There were no criminal antecedents of a violent nature, she has a history of gainful employment and long-term relationships, and she probably has a low risk of future offending despite the serious nature of the offences in question before the court.""

73As I have previously noted, amongst the material tendered on behalf of the offender was evidence confirming that she has undergone at least one rehabilitative course since being taken into custody. In my view, that evidence supports a conclusion that the offender, in a short time, has exhibited some degree of commitment towards rehabilitation. 

74I have had regard to each of the testimonials tendered on the offender's behalf. Although some of them do not expressly acknowledge an awareness of the jury's verdicts, I am satisfied that the offender will continue to have the support of a large number of people. 

75I am satisfied, on the whole of the evidence, that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. However, no submission was made on behalf of the offender that I should find special circumstances, and accordingly I make no such finding. 

76The offender's mother gave evidence that at or about the time of the death of the deceased, the offender was upset and ill. Section 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act includes, as a mitigating factor, remorse which is shown by an offender, but only if:

(i)the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions; and

(ii)the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).

77Counsel for the offender submitted that the evidence of the offender's mother should be regarded as evidence of remorse. The offender did not give evidence before me on sentence. However, s 21A(3)(i) does not require that an offender give evidence before remorse can be taken into account The section merely requires that an offender provide such evidence (see Butters v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 1 per Fullerton J at [16]).

78However, even allowing for that, the evidence which is relied upon in this regard must nevertheless fall within the terms of section 21A(3)(i). In other words, there must be evidence:

(i)that the offender has accepted responsibility for his or her actions; and

(ii)that the offender has acknowledged the injury loss or damage caused and has made reparation for such injury loss or damage.

79In my view, even at its highest, the evidence of the offender's mother falls substantially short of amounting to evidence that the offender has accepted responsibility for her actions. It follows that I am not satisfied that there has been any expression of remorse on the part of the offender. 

80Tendered before the court was the offender's criminal history which is limited to three entries, namely:

(i)an appearance before the Wollongong Local Court on 29 April 2008 on a charge of possessing a prohibited drug for which the offender was fined;

(ii)an appearance before the same court on 2 September 2008 for a further offence of possessing a prohibited drug in resect of which she was again fined; and

(iii)an appearance before the Port Kembla Local Court on 16 November 2011 for possessing equipment for the use of administering prohibited drugs in respect of which she was again fined. 


81Those entries are broadly consistent with that part of the report of Dr Furst which confirms that the offender has a previous history of drug abuse. There are no entries for any offence involving violence, nor indeed, for any offence remotely approaching the scale of seriousness of those of which the jury found the offender guilty. 

82It follows that the offender does not have any significant record of previous convictions. That is a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act.

PERIODS OF PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY
83The offender was arrested on 23 February 2010 and was refused bail. She was granted bail by this Court on 10 December 2010. 

84She remained on bail between 10 December 2010 and 17 August 2012, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty. She has been in custody since 17 August 2012.

85If these two periods are aggregated and then rounded up, they total 13 months. I therefore propose to backdate the commencement of the sentences by a period of 13 months so as to reflect the offender's total period of pre-sentence custody.

conclusion
86The circumstances in which the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping was committed necessarily provide the context in which the offence of murder was committed. I have determined that in these circumstances, and having regard to principles of totality, the sentences should be served wholly concurrently. I have not set a non-parole period in respect of the sentence for the first count, having regard to the sentence for the second count. 

87The offender is sentenced as follows:

(i)in respect of the charge of specially aggravated kidnapping of Matthew Digby, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 7 years, commencing on 22 October 2011, and ending on 21 October 2018. I decline to impose a non-parole period in respect of that sentence.

(ii)in respect of the charge of the murder of Matthew Digby, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 years imprisonment, commencing on 22 October 2011 and ending on 21 October 2029, with an additional term of 6 years imprisonment, commencing on 22 October 2029 and ending on 21 October 2035, that is a total of 24 years imprisonment.

(iv)the offender will be eligible for release on parole on 22 October 2029 and her sentence will end on 21 October 2035.

		06 February 2013",2012-11-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760511,R v Richard James Walsh [2012] NSWSC 1399,"Judgment

1On 30 July 2010, Richard James Walsh (""the offender"") was jointly indicted with the co-offender Lauren Mae Batcheldor in the following terms:

(i)that they, between 22 January 2010 and 25 January 2010, whilst in the company of each other, detained Matthew Digby without his consent, and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely to obtain information about property previously stolen, and that at the time of the detaining, actual bodily harm was occasioned to Matthew Digby.

(ii)that they between 22 January 2010 and 25 January 2010 at Dapto in the State of New South Wales did murder Matthew Digby.

2The offender pleaded not guilty to both counts in the indictment. In respect of the second count he entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of Matthew Digby (""the deceased""). That plea was not accepted by the Crown.

3On 17 August 2012 the offender was found guilty by a jury of both counts in the indictment. 

4The matter came before me on 2 November 2012 at which time I heard submissions from both the Crown and senior counsel for the offender. 

5The first count in the indictment of specially aggravated kidnapping is an offence against s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period is prescribed.

6The second count in the indictment, namely the count of murder, carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (see Crimes Act 1900 s19A). Pursuant to s54A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act""), a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment is prescribed for that offence.

7Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Act mandates the imposition of a life sentence for an offence of murder if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. The Crown, in its written submissions, drew my attention to that provision but did not argue that the offence of murder against the offender fell into the category contemplated by s 61(1). I am satisfied that it does not and accordingly, a life sentence is not warranted. 

SENTENCING PRINCIPLES
8In sentencing the offender, and bearing in mind that one of the offences of which he was convicted carries a standard non-parole period, I must adopt an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified and a judgment reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors. Such an approach is mandated by the relevant statutory provisions generally, and by the provisions of s55B(2), s54B(3) and s21A of the Sentencing Act in particular (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26] citing Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]).

9Further, the standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It therefore represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27]; [31]).

10For the purposes of determining an appropriate sentence, I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the offending. In the circumstances of the present case, which are more fully set out below, I am required to make particular findings of fact in relation to the offender's commission of the murder of the deceased. Any factual finding I make in relation to any matter must be consistent with the jury's verdicts. In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by those verdicts and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is inconsistent with those verdicts: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender. The offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation, on the balance of probabilities. 

11In circumstances where the offender has been convicted of two offences I must have regard to the principles of totality (see Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610). 

THE VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS
12The court received victim impact statements from John Digby, the deceased's father (which was read to the court by Mr Digby on behalf of both himself and the deceased's mother Dianne Digby), and Marcus Digby, the deceased's brother. Mrs Digby also read to the court a victim impact statement on behalf of her son, Leighton. 

13Those statements set out, in some detail, the effect of the deceased's death upon the members of his family. Unsurprisingly, the deceased's parents, and his brothers, continue to suffer considerable grief following the loss of their son and sibling. Their grief stems not only from the fact of the deceased's death, but also from the circumstances in which that death occurred, and also what occurred in its aftermath. 

14As I did when sentencing the co-offender Batcheldor earlier today, I again express my condolences to each of the members of the deceased's family upon their loss. It is to be hoped that the opportunity that they were given to provide their statements to the court will go some way to assisting them in their grieving process.

15I have dealt with an issue raised by the Crown concerning the victim impact statements in my judgment in the case of the co-offender (see R v Batcheldor [2012] NSWSC 1398 at [14] - [23]). I do not propose to repeat those matters. I simply note that for the reasons expressed in that judgment, I take the view that the statement of principle in R v Previtera (1999) 94 A Crim R 76, concerning the use of victim impact statements provided by the members of the family of a deceased person, remains applicable. 

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING
16It is evident from the jury's verdict of guilty on the first count in the indictment that the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that:

(1)the offender detained the deceased;

(2)he did so knowing that he was not consenting;

(3)he did so with the intention of obtaining information from him;

(4)he was acting in the company of Batcheldor; and

(5)actual bodily harm was inflicted upon the deceased whilst he was detained.

17However in relation to the second count, namely that of the murder of the deceased, the Crown put its case on alternative bases, namely:

(i)that the offender was guilty of strangling the deceased, with the intention of killing him; 

(ii)that the offender was engaged, with the co-offender Batcheldor, in the detaining of the deceased and that in the course of that detaining, the deceased was killed by a deliberate act of the offender. 

18The verdict of the jury does not, of course, disclose which of these alternatives was accepted. I am therefore required to make factual findings, consistent with the jury's verdict, regarding the circumstances in which the deceased was killed. 

The burglary at the co-offender's home
19Between about 14 and 15 January 2010 the home of the co-offender Batcheldor was broken into, and various items of property were stolen. Amongst those items, and of particular significance in the present case, was a gold necklace. A coin collection belonging to the offender, who was a long standing acquaintance of Batcheldor, was also stolen. 

20On or about 18 January 2010 the gold necklace was sold by the deceased to a second hand dealer in Wollongong for a sum of $250.00. How that item came to be in the possession of the deceased is not entirely clear. There was some evidence given in the trial that the deceased had told others that he had been given the necklace by a prostitute. In any event, it is not necessary, for present purposes, to reach an affirmative conclusion in relation to that issue.

21Evidence was given at the trial, which was not disputed, that on the afternoon of 18 January 2010 the co-offender Batcheldor attended the second hand dealer in the company of a friend, and identified the necklace as that which had been stolen from her home. In doing so, she also managed to identify the deceased as being the person who sold it to the second hand dealer earlier that day. 

22On the evening of 18 January 2010 Batcheldor, the offender and Cihan Karaoglu (""Karaoglu"") all attended the deceased's premises. They were accompanied by another person, to whom I will refer as ""A"", and in respect of whom various orders are in place preventing the publication of any material which might reveal the identity of A. A was originally charged with the murder of the deceased. However, that charge was subsequently withdrawn and the witness was granted an indemnity by the Attorney-General in respect of evidence given at the trial. I will refer in more detail to some aspects of the evidence of A later in this judgment. 

23At the time of the arrival of the offender and others at the deceased's premises, the only person in attendance was Michael Small, an acquaintance of the deceased. Mr Small gave evidence for the Crown at the trial. I am satisfied that upon arrival at the premises, it was the co-offender Batcheldor who asked for the deceased and who, having determined that he was not there, asked Mr Small to telephone him. I am also satisfied that Mr Small did so, following which Batcheldor spoke with the deceased. 

24Mr Small gave evidence, which I accept, that all of the blinds were closed, following which the offender and Karaoglu started searching the premises. In the course of doing so, one of them said words to the effect:

""We've got something to sort out with Matthew"".

25Ultimately, the deceased arrived at his premises when the offender and others were still present. He was driven there by Tini Eli, who gave evidence that the deceased had told him that the ""big boys"" wanted to speak with him. I am satisfied that in returning to the premises, the deceased was fearful for his safety, and that the presence of the offender and others at his premises would necessarily have been intimidating. Whilst the offender was present and took part in a search of the premises, I am satisfied that the visit to the premises was instigated by the co-offender Batcheldor, although the offender was clearly present and assisting.

26On 20 January 2010 the necklace was redeemed by the deceased and returned to the co-offender Batcheldor. Between 20 January 2010 and 23 January 2010 the offender was in telephone contact with Batcheldor. In that same period, Batcheldor was in contact with the deceased. All of this contact culminated in Batcheldor and the offender meeting with the deceased at Beaton Park at about 12.30am on 23 January 2010. I am satisfied that in the course of that telephone contact the offender played some part in making arrangements for that meeting to take place.

The meeting at Beaton Park
27There was no dispute at the trial that a meeting had taken place at Beaton Park between the offender, Batcheldor, and the deceased. There was some evidence in the trial about the presence of a fourth person, Stacey Callaghan. Ms Callaghan had provided a statement to the police in this regard and, only a matter of days later, had provided a statement to the legal representative of the offender Batcheldor, in which she contradicted what she had told the police. Although she was issued with a subpoena to give evidence at the trial, she did not respond to that subpoena. The contents of both of her statements were before the jury but because of their inconsistencies, I am not able to determine whether or not she was at the Beaton Park meeting.

28Although the offender did not dispute that a meeting had taken place at Beaton Park, there was a significant issue at the trial about what had occurred at the time. The Crown case against the offender in this respect came primarily from the evidence of a witness to whom I shall refer as B, and in respect of whom orders are in place preventing the publication of any material which might reveal the identity of B. 

29B had shared a cell with the offender whilst on remand for an offence of armed robbery. On the basis of the evidence of B, the Crown alleged that the offender was responsible for physically detaining the deceased at Beaton Park, dragging him back into A's car, and taking him to A's premises. 

30The offender, on the other hand, denied this. He asserted that having met the deceased at Beaton Park, he had offered the deceased drugs in return for information about the robbery, an offer which the deceased accepted. The offender said that the deceased had voluntarily left Beaton Park with him. 

31It is evident from their verdicts that the jury rejected the offender's account in this regard, and accepted that the deceased had been detained by the offender at Beaton Park, in the company of the co-offender Batcheldor.

The death of the deceased
32The offender did not dispute at the trial that the deceased was killed whilst he and the offender were in the garage of A's premises, following their meeting at Beaton Park. The offender also did not dispute that it was his act which caused that death. However the nature of that act, and the circumstances in which it occurred, were issues in the trial. They remain issues which I must determine, in a manner consistent with the verdicts of the jury, for the purposes of sentence. 

33The Crown's principal case at trial was that the offender had intentionally strangled the deceased, by placing a chain around his neck whilst in the garage of A's premises, and pulling on it from behind. The Crown case was that this act had been done by the offender with an intention to kill the deceased.

34In the alternative, the Crown put its case on the basis of constructive murder, the foundational offence being the specially aggravated kidnapping. On this basis, the Crown alleged that a deliberate act of the offender, perpetrated during or immediately after the detention of the deceased, caused the deceased's death.

35The offender denied that he had strangled the deceased as alleged by the Crown. He gave evidence that there was an altercation with the deceased in the garage, in the course of which he was stabbed by the deceased, and in the course of which he executed a particular physical manoeuvre on the deceased which caused his death. 

36Because the deceased's body was ultimately incinerated, there was no medical evidence adduced in the trial from a forensic pathologist which might have assisted in determining the cause of the deceased's death. I am therefore left to determine the factual issues surrounding the circumstances of his death by a consideration of the evidence of three principal witnesses, namely A, B and the offender. 

The evidence of A
37A gave evidence that the offender arrived at their home and that having parked the vehicle in the downstairs garage, he came up into the house and said that he ""had (the deceased) in the car"" and was going to speak with him ""to find out what he knows and where the things are"". A also gave evidence that the offender then went back down to the garage before returning upstairs and said (apparently in reference to the stolen property) that the deceased ""had told him everything he needed to know and where everything was"". The offender then asked A for a drink to take down to the deceased. 

38A then gave the following evidence: 

Q. So after that conversation did you stay in the house or did you leave and go somewhere else, just yes or no?
A. No, I, no, I stayed in the house.

Q. Was there any further conversation about Mr Digby?
A. No, only that Richard was going to go downstairs, let him out of the car and have a drink, stretch his legs.

Q. The drinks that you poured what were they?
A. Cordial, cold, just cold cordial.

Q. With what, it wasn't just cordial?
A. No, like, yep, made up cordial, like water and yeah.

Q. What's the next thing that occurred after he's left and gone down with the drinks?
A. Richard has gone downstairs and I've locked the top internal door, like the top of the garage steps, because I was, yeah and then yeah and then there was a bit of banging down the garage and I'd banged on the, my bedroom floor which was above the garage as in, just to stay, be quiet sort of thing, you'll wake the kids and then I heard footsteps coming back up the garage steps.

Q. Where was Ms Batcheldor at this point?
A. She had left.

Q. Now at what point had she left, relative to what Richard was doing?
A. More or less when Richard was going back downstairs, it was sort of, yeah.

Q. So was that before or after you poured the drinks?
A. After.

Q. So you hear this banging sound, can you be any more precise as to what it sounded like?
A. A car door opening and shutting, more just like thudding bangs, yeah.

Q. The sound that you described as a car door opening and shutting, is that a sound you heard once or more than once?
A. No, I heard it a couple of times.

Q. So then you hear footsteps in the internal staircase?
A. Yes, footsteps coming fast, sort of like running up the steps.

Q. Did you hear any sound other than the footsteps?
A. No, not until Richard banged on the door and said, ""Let me in babe.""

Q. What did you do?
A. Unlocked the door and opened it.

Q. Okay, and what did you see when you opened it?
A. Richard like sort of pushed past me and said, ""The prick nearly got me.""

Q. What did he do?
A. Ran into the bedroom and hopped in the shower in the en suite.

Q. Did he say anything else about what--
A. He said he had blood all over him.

Q. Were you able to see any blood?
A. No.

Q. As far as him getting in the shower was concerned, what's the next thing that happened after he entered the shower? He got out I presume?
A. Yeah, he got out of the shower and got a plastic bag and put the - well his clothes that he was wearing, he only had board shorts and - and that on, and put them in a plastic bag.


39I should note at this point that at the trial an issue emerged as to the precise words said by the offender upon returning upstairs for the final time. According to the offender, he had said ""the prick almost got me"" rather than ""nearly got me"". For the reasons more fully set out below, I do not regard either phrase as being consistent with the offender's assertion that he was stabbed by the deceased.

The evidence of B
40B gave evidence at the trial that he had shared a cell with the offender whilst each of them were in custody, the offender being on remand for the present offences, and B being on remand for an offence of armed robbery. B gave evidence of a conversation with the offender, whilst they were both in custody. That evidence included the following: 

""He told me he'd gone upstairs, he got himself a drink and he came back down. Mr Digby was still chained up in the back of the car. Richard then told me he'd slapped him around a little bit to wake him up and asked him a few questions in regard to money that was taken. Richard told me Mr Digby had told him to ""fuck off"" and wasn't going to tell him anything. At that point Richard had, he'd told me, he'd done a few things to try and get Mr Digby to talk. He wasn't saying anything and he said that he was, Mr Digby said, ""if you don't let me go, I'm going to come back and kill your Mrs and kids"". And he said ""While now you've said that, I can't let you go"". Mr Walsh had then asked Mr Digby what he wanted for his last drink. Mr Digby was, Mr Walsh told me Mr Digby at this time was very upset, he said, ""don't do this"". He said he wanted a water. Mr Walsh walked upstairs to get him a glass of water. 

He come back downstairs and seen Mr Digby had one hand free. By this time Richard was getting a little angry, agitated, he was, he said he ran over the to car and put one hand on the side door, one hand on the roof and was just kicking him in the face and ""How fucking dare you try and get away"". He'd knocked him out then, Richard knocked out Mr Digby, he climbed in the back of the station wagon ... got the dog chain, put it around Mr Digby's neck and by this, he's emphasised he's put his feet on the back seat of the back seat of the car and he's pulled back. He said he held the chain around his neck for about four minutes until he stopped moving. He said he heard cracks in Mr Digby's neck and he held it there until he stopped moving"" (emphasis added).

The evidence of the offender
41The offender's account was that he had gone into A's house, asked A to pour two drinks, and obtained two syringes before going back down into the garage. He said that when he arrived in the garage the deceased was ""crouching down"". He then gave the following evidence:
Q. And could you see what he was doing?
A. Like, as I say, the look on his face - immediately I put the drinks down, like as you come through the door there's a, it's like a set of shelves that run right up to the door that I come through so I just put the drinks straight down and said ""Fuck, what are you doing man"" you know like and as I walked over to the car that's when he stood up with a screwdriver. The glove box was open, which I know I locked before he hopped in the car and that's how it all started.

Q. Did he say anything to you when you said ""What are you doing man""?
A. Like because he'd been caught he had no other option. He said fucking something about drugs and ""Fucking give it to me"" and stuff like that you know.

Q. Now the screwdriver that you say he had in his hand, was that your screwdriver or (A's) screwdriver?
A. Yeah I'd say so but I could be wrong and he could've had it in his pocket the whole time we were in the car.

        ...

Q. At that stage could you see what sort of screwdriver it was?
A. No, not really.

Q. Where did you go. You said you put the drinks down. Where did you go, physically?
A. Straight over to the car.

Q. Where was he?
A. By that time he sort of stood up and like I said I could see the glove box and he sort of stepped back to the back passenger door, like the back part of the car and I kicked the door shut and that's when he was saying what he was saying and I was saying ""Fucking"" you know ""What are you f'ing doing"" and this and that and we just went at each other.

Q. Well what happened?
A. He sort of lunged at me. Like I say we both just came together like neither of us was backing down. I mean he was caught red handed breaking into the car--

...Q. Did he have anything in his hands?
A. Yeah he had the screwdriver.

Q. And what happened, if anything, to the screwdriver?
A. He stabbed me with it.

Q. And whereabouts did he stab you?
A. On the left hand side just about like where your waist, or the belt goes.

...Q. In terms of what happened next, what did you do?
A. After we started wrestling around I managed to like get him in, it's called a guillotine, it's like a sort of a headlock, where like your arm goes through there and I've got him in the neck and I pull up like that and take him down to the ground and wrap my legs around the back of his back and pulled like that and just yeah, just.

HIS HONOUR: The witness indicates a movement where he goes, as it were, back first towards the ground.

...Q. Have you learnt this hold in any martial arts training?
A. When I was growing up I had a little cousin that used to do kick boxing and I lived with him in Newcastle for a while and he was actually a bit of a champion in his leg and yeah. We used to train and spar and fight all the time.

Q. Had you ever used that hold on anyone before?
A. Not that exact hold. I mean I'm no angel. I've had fights at pubs and everything else and yeah but I don't think I've ever--

...

Q. When you released him was he still moving?
A. No he wasn't.

Q. When you released him what did you think had happened to him?
A. Because I seen he wasn't moving at first I just thought like he was asleep.

Q. When you say asleep do you mean unconscious?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you do anything to check whether he was alive or dead?
A. I just grabbed him by the shirt and yeah just, but he wasn't waking up.

Q. Did you do anything else to check whether he was alive or dead?
A. After that I panicked a bit and like I don't really know how to check for pulses but I could not find a pulse.""


42In addition to this evidence, the offender also gave an account of the circumstances in which the chains which were found on the charred remains of the deceased had been placed on his body. The offender said that the chains were attached to the body of the deceased whilst he was on the way to Mount Murray to set fire to the vehicle. He explained that because of the speed at which he was travelling, and because the deceased's body was not secure, it was ""leaning over"" onto the offender's side of the car. In particular, he said:

""I hopped out and looked around for the dog chains and I couldn't find them and I was taking stuff out of the back of the car and putting into the back seat of the car, like looking. Then I found the chains and I think that's when I put the seat down or I don't know if it fell down while I was tying him up, I can't remember.

43When asked by the Crown where the chains had come from, the offender initially said they were ""probably"" in the vehicle. He could give no reason for material of that nature being present in the car, other than saying that it was ""one of them cars that there were lots of things in, you couldn't explain it"". 

44The offender also confirmed that there was a seat belt on the passenger's side of the vehicle. When asked whether he had used the seat belt, the offender said:

""I don't know, I can't answer that"".

The submissions of the parties
45The Crown submitted, correctly in my view, that the verdict of the jury in respect of the second count of murder necessarily meant that they rejected at least that part of the evidence of the offender which, had it been accepted, would have supported a guilty verdict of manslaughter. 

46The Crown urged that I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was intentionally strangled by the offender in the manner which B had described in his evidence. The Crown submitted that the evidence of B in this regard was consistent with the fact that chains were found on the body of the deceased. In this particular respect, the Crown submitted that the offender's explanation for the circumstances in which the chains were applied to the deceased's body was implausible. 

47Senior counsel for the offender submitted that B's evidence ought not be accepted, and further submitted that in considering his evidence, I should have regard to the circumstances surrounding B himself, including the fact that he had pleaded guilty to an offence of armed robbery, and that a discount was applied to that sentence on account of his agreement to give evidence against the offender. 

48Senior counsel also pointed to inconsistencies between the evidence of B and other evidence. She cited, by way of example, evidence given by B that he had been told by the offender that he had applied an angle grinder to the deceased. She pointed out that not only did A specifically state that she did not hear an angle grinder being used at any time, but also that forensic examination of an angle grinder found in the garage did not reveal the presence of any human tissue, nor did it exhibit any sign of having recently been cleaned. 

49In addition, Senior counsel also relied on the fact that B had given evidence of the offender having said that he cleaned the garage floor with bleach. She pointed out that evidence called by the Crown of the results of an examination of the floor of the garage revealed no evidence at all of the use of bleach.

50However, perhaps most importantly, Senior counsel relied upon the evidence given by A that the offender had told her that the deceased had informed him, whilst in the garage, about the whereabouts of the property. This, she submitted, was diametrically opposed to the evidence of B, who had said that the offender disclosed that the deceased had refused to give him any such information. 

51Senior counsel submitted that in the light of such a glaring inconsistency, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had strangled the deceased, intending to kill him. Whilst Senior counsel accepted that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any act of the offender causing the death of the deceased was not done in self defence, she submitted that this did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the jury must have found that the offender strangled the deceased intending to kill him. 

52Senior counsel further submitted that the evidence of A, and in particular the reference to the offender intending to allow the deceased out of the car ""to stretch his legs"", was consistent with the jury obviously having determined that the deceased had been detained up to that point. She submitted that the evidence pointed to the deceased having been killed in an altercation which followed in the garage, and that the jury's verdict did not exclude a finding that the deceased had displayed some aggression towards the offender.

Consideration
53The evidence of each of A and B was the subject of a direction to the jury in accordance with s165 of the Evidence Act. In the case of A, that direction stemmed from the fact that the witness had originally been charged with the deceased's murder, but was later given the benefit of an indemnity, and the charge withdrawn. In the case of B, the direction stemmed firstly from the circumstances in which the conversation with the offender was said to have occurred, namely where B was on remand for a serious charge of armed robbery, and secondly from the fact that a significant discount was applied to the sentence imposed in respect of that offence, on account of B's undertaking to give evidence against the offender. 

54Senior counsel for the offender submitted that I should necessarily have regard to these matters in making any factual determination and that I should, in effect, apply the same direction to my own deliberations as was given to the jury. I accept that this is the correct approach, although having observed A and B give evidence, I formed the view that each of them was, generally speaking, doing the best that each of them could to give truthful evidence. That said, and like all other witnesses, it is open to me to accept part of the evidence of each of them, and reject part.

55There is some force in the Crown's submission concerning the implausibility of the offender's account of how the chains came to be around the deceased's body. The proposition that the offender stopped by the side of the road, obtained the chains, and then wrapped them around the body of the deceased is, in my view, a most unlikely one. 

56Further, and leaving aside what I regard to be a largely unsatisfactory explanation of how the chains came to be in A's vehicle in the first place, the offender admitted in evidence that there was a seat belt fitted to the front passenger seat of the vehicle. If it were the case that he merely wanted to secure the deceased's body to stop it moving, the use of the seatbelt would not only have been a far simpler way of going about things, it would have been one which would have been likely to attract far less attention. Having regard to the offender's evidence that he was in a hurry to get to Mount Murray, the utilisation of the seat belt would also have taken a fraction of the time. 

57The offender's assertion that he was stabbed by the deceased is also difficult to accept. According to A, at the time that he returned upstairs on the final occasion he said that the deceased had ""nearly got (him)"". The offender gave evidence that he had in fact said that the deceased had ""almost"" done so. As I have said, in my view neither expression is consistent with having been stabbed. It is also significant that despite the offender's evidence that he was injured as a result of the stabbing, A did not observe any injury consistent with the offender having been stabbed in the period leading up to the offender's arrest. 

Conclusion as to the circumstances of the deceased's death
58As Senior counsel for the offender submitted, there is a material inconsistency between the evidence of A and B. According to A, the offender told A that the deceased had provided the information to him regarding the stolen property. That, to say the least, does not sit comfortably with the evidence of B, who said that the deceased had refused, seemingly more than once, to provide that information. The provision of that information was a material factor in this case. Indeed it was, on the Crown case, the reason for the deceased's detention. 

59I am also mindful of the fact that there were things which B said were disclosed by the offender which were not consistent with other evidence given at the trial. They included what was said to have been the offender's account about the application of an angle grinder to the deceased whilst he was detained. I am satisfied, having regard to the evidence of A, as well as the scientific evidence called by the Crown, that no angle grinder was used by the offender upon the deceased. 

60I accept that the offender informed A that the deceased provided the information the offender wanted in relation to the burglary. I also accept the evidence of A that the offender had said at that point that he was proposing to allow the deceased to ""stretch his legs"". I am satisfied on the basis of this evidence that at the point at which this conversation took place, the deceased remained under restraint. Accepting part of the evidence of B, I find that such restraint was by the application of the chains. His evidence in that regard is independently supported by the fact that there were chains found on the remains of the deceased's body. In making such findings, I obviously reject the account of the offender as to how the chains came to be applied. 

61However, whilst there is independent support for the evidence of B concerning the deceased's restraint, there is no independent evidence which supports a conclusion that the deceased was strangled. Moreover, as I have pointed out, there are some significant inconsistencies in at least part of the evidence given by B. In these circumstances, and particularly in the absence of any medical evidence which might establish the cause of death, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was strangled by the offender as was alleged by the Crown. 

62I am satisfied that when the offender returned downstairs to the garage after A had prepared the two drinks, there was an altercation between he and the deceased. In this regard, and apart from the evidence of the offender, A gave evidence of having heard noises generally consistent with some altercation having occurred. 

63I am satisfied that in the course of that altercation, the deceased died as a result of a deliberate act of the offender, and that this act was not done in self defence. The evidence does not enable me to reach any conclusion as to the precise nature of that act. However, I am not satisfied that the deceased was in possession of a screwdriver, nor am I satisfied that the offender was stabbed. 

64These findings are consistent with the alternative basis upon which the Crown advanced its case on the second count to the jury, nameIy that of constructive murder. It should be noted however, that in R v Mills (NSWCCA 5 April 1995 unreported) Gleeson CJ expressly rejected the proposition that cases of constructive murder involve a lower level of culpability, such that they should attract a lower sentence than would apply to a case of an intentional killing. That principle has been confirmed in a number of cases since. For example in R v Jacobs [2004] NSWCCA 462; (2004) 151 A Crim R 452 Wood CJ at CL said (at [332]):

""Constructive murder is not to be regarded as less serious, and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder: R v Mills NSWCCA 3 April 1995. Just as is the case for the other categories, there are degrees of seriousness of constructive murder and the determination of the appropriate sentence for any individual offence depends upon the nature of the offender's conduct and the part which he or she played in the events giving rise to the death: R v JB [1999] NSWCCA 93.


Events following the deceased's death
65The offender admitted in evidence that he asked A to move the deceased's vehicle from Beaton Park. He also admitted that he had told A to adopt a disguise for the purpose of doing so. 

66Having regard to the evidence of both A and B, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did request A to obtain a mask or masks, and that he did so on account of the fact that the deceased's body was starting to decompose. In this respect, and although there was no evidence that A and B knew one another, each independently gave evidence in relation to this issue which supported the Crown's position.

67The offender also agreed in his evidence at the trial that on 24 January, which was the day following the deceased's death, he formulated a plan to dispose of the deceased's body, in order to ""destroy everything"". That plan ultimately involved obtaining tins of paint from his garage to use as an accelerant, driving to Mount Murray, and setting A's car alight with the deceased's body still within it. It also involved sending A to the Wollongong Hospital in an attempt to provide some alibi for her movements at the time that her vehicle was set alight. 

68I am satisfied that at about 7am on 25 January 2010 the body of the deceased was found in A's burnt out vehicle in bushland at Mount Murray. Chains were around the deceased's body when it was discovered. On that morning, as A was leaving the premises to drive to the home of the co-offender Batcheldor, the offender placed a bag in the boot of Batcheldor's car (which was being driven by A at the time), which he said he wanted burned. That bag contained the clothes he was wearing at the time of setting A's vehicle alight at Mount Murray.

CONCLUSIONS AS TO OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS
69The offender's involvement in the specially aggravated kidnapping was significant. I am satisfied that he had been in contact with Batcheldor in the days leading up to the meeting at Beaton Park, and that he played some part in arranging it. It was the Crown case that he had been largely responsible for the physical detaining of the deceased following the meeting a Beaton Park in the manner described by B in evidence. 

70The advantage which was sought to be obtained from the deceased was information relating to the burglary at Batcheldor's home. However, in determining the seriousness of an offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, the nature of the advantage which is sought to be obtained is not conclusive. There are a number of factors relevant to that determination, including the circumstances of the detention, its period and its purpose. The presence or absence of a ransom is not a decisive consideration (see R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [32]. 

71I have already made reference to the circumstances of the detention, and its purpose. Although it is difficult to determine the period of the detention, I am satisfied that it extended over some hours. All of these matters point to an offence of considerable seriousness. One can only imagine the fear by which the deceased would have been beset in the final hours of his life.

72To the extent that a coin collection belonging to the offender had been stolen in a burglary, the offender did have a legitimate interest in obtaining information in relation to the burglary, just as he had a legitimate interest in having any item of which he was the owner returned to him. However, his chosen method of protecting that interest, namely detaining the deceased for the purpose of extracting information from him, was both violent and unlawful. 

73The investigation of criminal activity such as burglary is the responsibility of the police. It is not the responsibility of the individual, even where that individual's rights may have been infringed. Taking the law into one's own hands in the manner in which the offender did cannot, under any circumstances, be justified. The present case demonstrates the tragic consequences which such a course of action can bring about. 

74Any comment about the seriousness of an offence of murder would be superfluous. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, for the reasons I have previously expressed, that the offender strangled the deceased to death intending to kill him. However, I am satisfied, consistent with the alternative case of constructive murder advanced by the Crown, that the deceased died in the course of being detained, and that it was the offender's deliberate act which caused his death. 

75The offender's conduct giving rise to his liability for the death of the deceased was subsequently aggravated in the manner in which I have previously described. In particular, the offender chose to dispose of the deceased's body by setting fire to a car in which that body was contained. On the offender's own evidence before the jury, that act in itself was the subject of some planning, and was motivated by a desire to ensure that evidence was destroyed. It resulted in the deceased's body being reduced to nothing more than charred remains. It is well established that an offender's treatment of a deceased's body can amount to an aggravating factor: see for example Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315. 

76Having regard to all of these matters, the offending, both in terms of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping and the offence of murder, falls above the mid range of seriousness.

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE
77The offender is currently 34 years of age. He did not give evidence before me on sentence and there is no evidence of any expression of remorse on his part. The matters of background which are set out below are taken from the material tendered before me on sentence.

78The material included a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist. The report is dated 16 May 2012 and it therefore predates the offender's trial. It is evident from the final paragraph of that report that part of the purpose of the examination by Dr Nielssen was to determine whether the offender was mentally ill at the time of the alleged offending. It was Dr Nielssen's opinion that this was not the case. Notwithstanding the fact that the report was prepared for a specific purpose prior to the trial, it nevertheless contains information concerning the offender's background which is relevant to my determination of the appropriate sentence.

79The offender has a long history of substance abuse. He began drinking alcohol around the age of 12 or 13 and by the time of his arrest for these offences, he had reached the point which he would consume alcohol every day. 

80The offender also began using cannabis at around the age of 12 or 13. By the time he reached adulthood, he used cannabis daily. 

81At about the age of 16, the offender began using amphetamines and such use increased steadily in the ensuing years. According to the report of Dr Nielssen, the offender's use of amphetamines in the months leading up to his arrest had reached the point of being continuous, and was accompanied by long periods without sleep. Unsurprisingly, given the history which was provided to him, Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender as suffering from substance dependence and abuse disorder which, he concluded, was based largely upon the history of a pattern of daily use of hazardous quantities of alcohol, cannabis and amphetamines. 

82The report of Dr Nielssen paints a picture of the offender having consistently abused alcohol and prohibited drugs for a period of more than 20 years. Overcoming these addictions will require a concerted effort on the part of the offender. I have no evidence before me of any support which might be available to the offender, from his family or otherwise, which might assist him in this regard. 

83In these circumstances, and particularly where the offender's history of alcohol and substance abuse is so long standing, I am not able to make any determination about his prospects of rehabilitation. 

84The offender has a criminal history dating back to 1996. It contains entries in respect of a number of matters, including for offences of common assault, stalking and intimidating, and contravening a prohibition or restriction in a domestic violence order. Indeed, there are repeated entries for such matters. There is, however, nothing on the scale of the present matter. His record does not assist him, but I do not regard it as an aggravating factor. 

CONCLUSION
85The offender was arrested on 23 February 2010 and has remained in custody since that time. It is therefore appropriate that the sentences be back dated to commence on that date.

86As was the case with the co-offender Batcheldor, the circumstances in which the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping were committed necessarily provide the context in which the offence of murder was committed. I have therefore determined, having regard to principles of totality, that the sentences to be imposed upon the offender should be served wholly concurrently. 

87I have not set a non-parole period in respect of the sentence for the first count, having regard to the sentence for the second count. 

88The offender is sentenced as follows:

(i) in respect of the offence of the specially aggravated kidnapping of Matthew Digby, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of 8 years imprisonment commencing on 23 February 2010 and ending on 22 February 2018;

(ii)in respect of the offence of murder of Matthew Digby, the offender is sentenced to a non parole period of 21 years imprisonment commencing on 23 February 2010 and ending on 22 February 2031, with an additional term of 7 years imprisonment commencing on 23 February 2031 and ending on 22 February 2038, that is a total term of 28 years imprisonment;

(iii)the offender will be eligible for release on parole on 23 February 2031 and his sentence will end on 22 February 2038.

2760512,R v Matthew MOORE [2012] NSWDC 295,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1Matthew Moore is a young man with a bad criminal law track record. When he mixes illegal drugs and alcohol with his unstable mental condition he becomes very aggressive. He did this earlier this year and held up two teenagers at a train station and this has resulted in him being charged with a crime known as robbery in company. 

2He is before me today for sentencing for that crime and for another related assault. Robbery in company is regarded as a serious offence by the New South Wales Parliament. This is indicated by the fact that Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime. 

3In sentencing anyone a judge needs to say something about what happened to bring about the charges and also something about the offender so that both the events that made up the crime and the personal circumstances of the offender are put into the mix in the sentence which is imposed. 

4This case is an example of where the mix is important because there are some particularly nasty aspects about the offence and there are also some significant aspects about Mr Moore's own personal history.

5First I should say something about what resulted in these charges. Matthew Moore, who is still only 20, was drinking with a man named Scott Wright on Saturday 18 February 2012. He had also been taking a mixture of illegal drugs including amphetamines. At some stage Mr Moore got upset because he found that $100 was missing from where he lived. He got angry and he and Scott Wright left to find the culprit. 

6They turned up at Kingswood Railway Station at about 8:50pm that night. They walked on to one of the platforms. Scott Wright was holding onto a baseball bat. By that time, I should add, it seems that Matthew Moore had abandoned the idea of looking for the person he thought had stolen the money. They were accompanied by another man who is not identified. That man waited near the exit. Matthew Moore and Scott Wright went towards two teenage boys who were on the platform. As they approached the two boys Scott Wright passed the baseball bat to Matthew Moore.

7What happened next is described in what are called the District Court facts which are contained in exhibit A and I will quote selectively from that. When they saw the baseball bat, understandably ""both victims became fearful for their safety"". Matthew Moore said ""Put the money on the floor. Give it to us."" One of the boys removed his watch and put it on the platform. He then dropped his mobile phone on to the platform but it bounced on to the tracks. What Mr Moore then did was to tell that boy to ""get on to the track and retrieve the mobile phone"". The boy got on to the tracks and put the phone back on to the platform. Then both Mr Wright and Mr Moore walked away and left the platform with what they had stolen.

8There is also included in exhibit A statements from the two boys. The boy who had the phone said that he had had it since the beginning of the previous year and it was worth about $600. He then goes on to say that when he got onto the track and had put the phone onto the platform he ""couldn't get back up off the tracks"". He then saw the men walk away. He still ""couldn't jump back off the tracks, so I had to cross the tracks and walk a short distance before I found a ladder, which I could climb back up to the other platform"".

9The police arrived a short time later and he reported what happened. Understandably he said that during the whole incident he was ""really afraid"". He thought that they were going to hit them with the baseball bat. When he was on the tracks he was ""afraid that I was going to get hit by a train. Since that's happened I get flashbacks and think about the situation a lot"".

10The other boy described the same incident and said that he ""felt scared because they had a metal bat. I thought that they could have killed us with it. That was the first thing that came to my head, 'Was I going to die'. I think about what happened every day."" 

11It was not until 16 May 2012 that Matthew Moore was arrested and he then was interviewed and made what the District Court facts call full and frank admissions to his involvement in the offence. He informed the police that he was affected by intoxicating liquor and amphetamines at the time of the robbery.

12I have been supplied with a transcript of the interview which Matthew Moore gave to the police. He was frank about what he had done in committing this offence and at one stage admitted that when he and the others saw the two boys on the platform one of the men said ""Let's go bash them ones, yeah. We should go bash them and get some anger out"".

13Mr Moore admitted that he was being aggressive. He also said that when he was ""under the influence I'm a whole different person"". He said this mostly happens when he is drinking wine and he acknowledged that he gets ""very aggressive on alcohol. That's why I don't like to drink"". He said that he was quite shocked when he found out that the boys were only 15. 

14As a result of what he did he was charged with the robbery in company and also charged with a common assault to the other boy brought about by the other boy's fear which was instilled by being approached with the baseball bat. That offence has been made the subject of a related offence under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and I will deal with it in due course.

15Turning to matters which are personal to Matthew Moore, a judge has to first look at an offender's criminal record. In Matthew Moore's case for a 20 year old it is a bad criminal record. He has a history of being convicted for assaults, break and enter, assaulting and resisting police officers and, significantly, two offences of aggravated robbery. These were all committed when he was under 18 and therefore were dealt with in the Children's Court. In addition he has been charged with offences of shoplifting, larceny and goods in custody.

16The most serious of the offences were the two aggravated robberies and for those offences the Magistrate made control orders which is in effect custody for a young person. It is not surprising that the Magistrate did this when the facts of what happened on those two previous occasions are taken into account. They were tendered as part of the evidence for me to take into account. 

17The offences occurred a day apart in June 2009 and Matthew Moore and another young man laid in wait for people in a park. On one occasion they picked on a 54 year old woman who was described as small in stature. Matthew Moore walked behind her quickly which startled her. She began to run, Matthew Moore pursued her and grabbed her handbag which was over her shoulder. She struggled. Matthew Moore then swung the victim violently to and fro. The straps were broken. He hit her several times on the face. He hit her at least once when she was on the ground. They got away with her handbag. 

18The following day they picked on a boy who was 15 years old and described again as having a ""slight"" frame. They approached him and asked for money. He declined and then what happened is that he was ""viciously struck in the face numerous times"" by Matthew Moore. They then got away with his wallet and with money in the wallet. The victim of that offence ""suffered a significant laceration below his left eye due to the eye glasses he was wearing being smashed into his skin"".

19I do not refer to the details of those offences to aggravate at all what happened on this occasion but to indicate that two of the offences which are on Matthew Moore's criminal record are for violent robberies and this is a factor for me to take into account in sentencing him now. It not only deprives him of his claim to any leniency because of having no previous record but in my opinion it requires me to place more emphasis on deterring Matthew Moore from committing these sorts of offences.

20I now turn to some of the factors which are relevant to Matthew Moore's own personal background and mental state. Ms C. Summerfield who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions tendered a pre sentence report which was dated 15 November 2012. It is more extensive than the usual pre sentence reports. It summarises its conclusions in the following terms:

""Mr Moore is a 20 year old man, who presented as a quickly spoken individual and appeared to be quite forthright during the preparation of this report. For such a young man the offender already has an unenviable criminal history, which comprises of various offences similar in nature to the one currently before the court.

By all accounts he has exhibited a number of problematic, behavioural issues from a very young age, which not only impacted on his familial relationships, but also his educational opportunities. He described an event in his early adolescence as being the precipitating factor to his initial illicit substance use and involvement in anti-social and criminal behaviours. It is likely that at least some of these behavioural issues stem from what his medical practitioner described as 'schizoid personality' traits, and it is positive that the offender reported that his current regime of medication is assisting him in managing his mental health status and has advised he is willing to maintain compliance. There is little doubt that any mental health condition is negatively impacted by any illicit substance use and the offender will need to work toward long-term abstinence. A breakdown in his relationship 12 months ago and the circumstances surrounding this appear to have been a further catalyst for the offender to retreat into the world of illicit drug use as a mechanism for coping with a difficult person situation. It is considered that he will need to undertake drug and alcohol counselling to assist him in again achieving abstinence, which it is anticipated may in turn see a stabilisation in his life and it is positive that he has verbalised his willingness to do the same.""

21The references to the event early in his adolescence and to the circumstances surrounding the breakdown in his relationship mean this. Matthew Moore described his first childhood memory as being when he was 11 and it concerned the death of his 16 year old cousin by way of a drug overdose. He told the probation officer that he was ""significantly affected by this death and identified this as being the point at which his life started to deteriorate; he rebelled against any form of authority figure; particularly his mother; commenced illicit substance use; started associating with a negative peer group; and engaging in anti-social and criminal behaviours.""

22His mother reported that she recollected Matthew's behaviour deteriorating since that event.

23His background he had otherwise described as having little recollection about but he did not think that he was subjected to any physical or psychological abuse.

24The circumstances precipitating the break-up of relationship are picked up by the author of the report when she takes her history. Until he was 14 Matthew Moore had believed that his step-father was his biological father but it was discovered through testing that this person was not his biological father. He said that that ""hurt a little"" but until about a year ago he continued to consider him as his father. But about 12 months ago the author of the report records that ""his step-father commenced a relationship with the offender's partner of 2 years"". That means that Matthew has ceased having contact with his step-father and Matthew ""indicated that the loss of this relationship saw him continue in a further downward spiral in terms of his lifestyle"". His mother confirmed that that relationship had indeed occurred and that it had a distinct negative impact on her son.

25Matthew Moore apparently started drinking when he was 15 and tried cannabis even earlier than that and by 15 was taking amphetamines twice a week. He increased the amount and extent of his illegal drug use when the relationship broke down. He has been unsuccessful in previous efforts to engage in a program which might assist him.

26The information in that report is supplemented by a report of the Forensic Psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen dated 3 November 2012 and some other material which were tendered by Mr B. P. Hancock of counsel who appears for Matthew Moore. Significantly Dr Nielssen, an experienced Forensic Psychiatrist, diagnosed four disorders. The first was obvious and is a substance dependence and abuse disorder. The second is significant and is described as a substance induced psychotic illness. The third is a conduct disorder, which is hardly surprising. The fourth is a possible impulse control disorder.

27Dr Nielssen also expressed the opinion that Matthew Moore was affected by symptoms of the psychotic illness around the time of the offence. He also expressed the opinion that despite what he described as Matthew Moore's ""array of psychological problems"", his offences ""appear to be directly related to substance abuse and his prospects for rehabilitation would appear to be directly related to his successful participation in long term drug rehabilitation.""

28Mr Hancock also tendered a report from an alcohol and other drug worker with the Department of Corrective Services. It noted that Matthew Moore ""did express his willingness to enter and participate in a long term community based residential rehabilitation program. Also, if this was not an option, he was also willing to participate in custody based interventions to address his offending behaviour.""

29Matthew Moore has been assessed as suitable and placed on a waiting list at a residential drug rehabilitation program. However that is community based. 

30It can be seen that sentencing Matthew Moore presents complications beyond the mere description of the seriousness of his offending behaviour. His personal background, his behavioural problems, his psychiatric condition and his drug taking together with his age as well mean that some accommodation needs to be made for giving him an opportunity to, as Dr Nielssen said, ""get himself off the drug habit which is complicating his medical condition and contributing to his criminal behaviour.""

31In her helpful written submissions Ms Summerfield acknowledged that Matthew Moore's plea of guilty was at the earliest available opportunity. This means that in due course I will reduce a sentence I might otherwise have imposed by 25 per cent because of the practical contribution that his pleading guilty has made to shortening the Court lists and the administration of Justice. 

32Ms Summerfield referred to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. She went through the various factors which the Court of Criminal Appeal took into account in fixing a guideline which was a head sentence of 4 to 5 years full term after an allowance of 10 per cent for a late plea.

33As she pointed out, one of the factors was that an offender would have little or no criminal history. But in this case Mr Moore has a significant criminal history. Most, if not all, of the factors coincide with Mr Moore's case except that he entered an early plea of guilty which should attract, as I said, 25 per cent. I do regard both victims as being vulnerable for the reasons that Ms Summerfield explains, as 15 year old boys. They were ""dependent upon public transport"" to make their way around. They relied upon ""the good will of community members to be able to maintain"" their personal safety ""and not be put in fear, be humiliated and robbed."" 

34Ms Summerfield submitted that the offence fell within the middle of the range for these kinds of crimes but towards the lower end of that category.

35Ms Summerfield acknowledged that Matthew Moore's prospects of re-offending depend of course upon him dealing with his drug addiction and, in my opinion, so do his prospects of rehabilitation. There is some evidence of remorse and contrition. He acknowledged that it was his fault in the pre sentence report. Ms Summerfield also pointed out his awareness that he was prone to acting aggressively when he combined alcohol and the drugs that he took. I accept her submission that his drug and alcohol addiction should not be taken into account to reduce his moral culpability because of that factor.

36Ms Summerfield drew my attention to the statistics for sentencing for this offence made available by the Judicial Commission as well as helpfully some cases from the Public Defender Office Sentencing Table. She emphasised the importance of ""endorsing a clear message to the public that robbery by young people, of people in the community who are simply engaging in the necessary aspects of their daily life, such as the victim who was relying upon public transport as his mode of transport, is not to be tolerated. And sentences of full time custody are warranted to reflect the community's need for protection against such acts of violence.""

37Her submissions were made in respect of the offence of robbery in company on one of the boys.

38Mr Hancock realistically acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and the significance of his client's record. He pointed to the relevance of his client's age. He was 20 when he committed the offences and is still 20 years old. This is the first time Matthew Moore has been in adult custody. Mr Hancock pointed out that his client was in protection because of the acts of other prisoners and is likely to remain there. He reminded me of what the Court of Criminal Appeal had said about mental illness in its decision of R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, and I will return to that shortly.

39He argued that there were special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between the non-parole period and the full term of any sentence. They were his client's need for rehabilitation and his client's young age as well as his first time in custody. Ms Summerfield also realistically acknowledged that there were special circumstances for adjusting that ratio and that an extensive period of residential rehabilitation whilst on parole would be warranted.

40Matthew Moore has been in custody since he was arrested on 16 May 2012 and Ms Summerfield argued that the time he has spent to date is not sufficient given the seriousness of the offence and his prior convictions. I agree with that submission which must be right. The problematic background that Matthew Moore has - particularly regarding the two events that seem to aggravate his developing alcohol problem and his mental health - concern me. As I have said, Dr Nielssen has specifically diagnosed a psychotic illness which was affecting Matthew Moore at the time of the offences.

41Sperling J in R v Hemsley - with whom Dowd J agreed - pointed out at [33] and following that ""an offender's mental illness may be relevant in three ways. First the mental illness may contribute to the commission of the offence in a material way, it may reduce the moral culpability of the offender. There may not be the same call for denunciation and punishment.""

42I can appreciate the force of that observation but in this case Matthew Moore knew very well how a combination of drugs and alcohol would affect his behaviour. I put little weight on that factor. 

43""Mental illness"", Sperling J went on, ""may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration"". I do take into account that factor as well as the third factor referred to by his Honour that custody may weigh more heavily on a person with a mental illness. That, I repeat, is a factor which I take into account. 

44Despite Matthew Moore's age I would regard an appropriate commencing sentence for his crime as being one of 4 years, in other words at the lower end of the guideline suggested by Court of Criminal Appeal in Henry. However because of the impact of his mental health condition I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 3 ½ years or 42 months. That sentence I will reduce about 25 per cent because of his plea of guilty, so that the sentence which I propose to impose is 32 months. Thirty-two months is just short of 25 per cent but I have in fact been, I regard, a little more generous in making the allowance for his mental health condition. So the sentence that I will impose will be 32 months being 2 years and 8 months. Normally a sentence of 2 years and 8 months or 32 months would attract a non-parole period of 2 years being three quarters of that period but I propose to reduce the non-parole period to 16 months which will be 50 per cent of the overall sentence. That is more than I would usually reduce such a non-parole period to. The main reasons are his age, as I have said, and his need for rehabilitation and the strong recommendations for him to enter into a residential rehabilitation program in the community. He needs to serve some time in custody because of the seriousness of his offending, particularly given his record, and it needs to be longer than he has already served. But on the other hand he really needs to confront at this early age the mental health condition which he suffers from and the drug addiction which he suffers from. I need to give him an opportunity to deal with that once and for all.

45Accordingly I will impose that sentence if you would stand up, thank you. I convict you of the offence of robbery in company. I fix a non-parole period of 16 months to date from 16 May 2012 and to expire on 15 September 2013. The balance of the period will be 16 months to commence on 16 September 2013 and to expire on 15 January 2015. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing your release on parole on 15 September 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Three things: one is the mathematics I need you all to check. Two is any conditions of parole, and, three, is I need to remember to sentence him for the other matter. So please check the mathematics first.

SUMMERFIELD: I think they're correct your Honour.

HANCOCK: Yes your Honour, I think they're correct.

HIS HONOUR: All right; parole conditions, as I fix them. Obviously good behaviour, staying in touch, turning up to court, change of address, things like that, but any particular ones? Supervision obviously, Probation and Parole.

HANCOCK: Well I think he should accept reasonable directions and to address his drug and alcohol conditions, the need for rehabilitation and directions as to accepting supervision of any medical practitioner as to medication for his mental health condition.

HIS HONOUR: Okay.

SUMMERFIELD: Perhaps attendance at residential rehabilitation.

HIS HONOUR: Should it be a condition? I guess if it's recommended.

SUMMERFIELD: If it's recommended, your Honour, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Do you agree Mr Hancock?

HANCOCK: Yes your Honour.

46The conditions of parole are these: (1) That he be of good behaviour; (2) That he attend court if receiving a notice calling upon him to do so; (3) That he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address; (4) That he accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service and accept all of their reasonable directions or recommendations particularly regarding rehabilitation for drug and alcohol addiction and the undertaking of any residential drug rehabilitation program; (5) That he accept and comply with any reasonable recommendations and directions given by a medical practitioner regarding medication for his mental health condition.

HIS HONOUR: Does that cover it?

SUMMERFIELD: And the only other thing your Honour I was thinking was urinalysis with his--

47Yes; and the recommendations from the Probation and Parole Service, the ones I have mentioned, plus urinalysis.

HIS HONOUR: What should I do with the assault Mr Hancock, I'm not sure that I should necessarily impose a custodial sentence, I may, I may not, I don't know. One has to be careful, just say yes we'll give him 6 months, because there are some instances where custodial sentences have been imposed and you can see it just because it's concurrent and you look at it and it doesn't warrant it. But it may, I don't know, because he's got a record. But this is his first adult offence perhaps it should be a good behaviour bond, I don't know, what do you say?

HANCOCK: Well certainly I agree with your Honour's reasoning in the matter. The objective seriousness I suppose is characterised by the fact that the person upon whom the assault was committed was the other person present and the assault was putting that person in fear. There was no actual--

HIS HONOUR: Physical assault.

HANCOCK: --physical assault, no your Honour. So that person was put in fear by the circumstances that they were presented with. Certainly there was an intention to put the people in fear, that can't be denied. I think the first thing your Honour would be concerned about is to in some way ensure that the very careful orders that your Honour has given is in relation to the other matter not in any way compromised.

HIS HONOUR: Compromised, yes I agree. Could I fine him, I don't know, what are his means?

HANCOCK: Well I don't think he has any means at present your Honour so I don't think a fine would be appropriate. Your Honour could sentence him to the rising of the Court, that's an option I suppose.

HIS HONOUR: What do you think Ms Summerfield?

SUMMERFIELD: Your Honour I would have thought a sentence that indicated the gravity of the offence more than the rising of the Court would do.

HIS HONOUR: Just that it's his first adult offence. The other one is very serious and that's why he's got a custodial sentence, this one is shaking a baseball bat at someone and scaring the life out of them. 

SUMMERFIELD: It is, it's in the context of the other offence too of course.

HIS HONOUR: I know but I've got to be careful not to - you're right.

SUMMERFIELD: To duplicate. Certainly your Honour the Crown's view would be that a bond would be appropriate.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, but I can't post-date a bond can I?

SUMMERFIELD: No, it would have to date from today.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, what do you say Mr Hancock, bond to be of good behaviour for 3 months or something. But he's in custody so if he--

HANCOCK: He's likely to remain of good behaviour during the time he's in custody your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: He is yes. What about a bond for 3 months?

HANCOCK: Well I couldn't say anything further your Honour I don't think.

48In respect of the matter under the common assault under s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act I convict him of that offence and under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment I make an order directing Mr Moore to enter into a good behaviour bond for 3 months and the terms of the bond are that he be of good behaviour.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else?

HANCOCK: No your Honour.

SUMMERFIELD: The only other issue was that in relation to compensation.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I saw that.

SUMMERFIELD: With respect to the victim of the robbery's claim for compensation of $50 given that the watch wasn't returned.

HIS HONOUR: I make an order under?

SUMMERFIELD: I haven't got my practice here, I'm sorry your Honour. I could find out and advise.

HIS HONOUR: Yes would you, because I'm doing the other, are you in the other matter?

SUMMERFIELD: I'm not, no.

HIS HONOUR: Do you mind. Which practice is it in, do you know? I'll give you volume 1, you can have a look whilst you're here.

SUMMERFIELD: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now Matthew Moore you have heard the sentence which I have imposed and you have heard why and you have got a sentence of 2 years and 8 months, 32 months. I have backdated it to when you were arrested so it started on 16 May when you come into custody, so the sentencing itself expires on 15 January 2015, that is the overall sentence. Normally a non-parole period would be 2 years, so you would be in for 2 years until May 2014, but I have brought that back to 16 months. So it starts 16 May 2012 and your non-parole period expires on 15 September next year. So you are going to get out in less than a year and you are going to get out about 3 months before, okay. Now I have fixed your parole conditions, you will be on parole. You have got to stay out of trouble or you come back before me and I may be sentencing you again. If you change your address you have got to let the Court know and if you get a notice in the mail saying you have got to come to court you have got to turn up rather than have the police or Sheriffs come and chase you. Now the most important condition I have made is that you accept supervision from Probation and Parole. I think they looked after you once before; is that right?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Let them help you and you have got to comply with their recommendations that are reasonable, particular regarding urinalysis and drug and alcohol rehabilitation or any residential one and there is some program which Corrective Services thought you could do as well. And if you see a doctor and the doctor recommends some medication for your mental health condition then you have got to comply with those reasonable recommendations. They are for your own good. It is easy for me to say, but you have been taking your medication since you have been in custody haven't you?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: What do you think about the effect of the medication, does it help or not?

OFFENDER: It's helped a lot, I no longer feel paranoid.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

OFFENDER: I have no more psychotic episodes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

OFFENDER: I'm feeling actually pretty happy with the outcome.

HIS HONOUR: Good, okay. Well the idea is that you keep that up when you're out and you get yourself into a rehab and you, as I keep saying, you're not yet 21 you're a young man, you can put all this past - that was apparently started off you know when you're about 14 or something - behind you and just start off. It's not going to be easy doing this residential rehabilitation or any sort of rehabilitation but you'll make a good start by being drug-free when you leave prison, so stay away from any drugs in prison.

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You will make a good start, you will come out clean and that will give you a very good start and then you have now got an opportunity to turn your life around. You've got the support of your mother so that will make a difference and I think you've got to take it from there. Now do you understand all that I have said?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And I have given you a 3 month good behaviour bond for the other assault, all right. I'll just find out about the compensation.

SUMMERFIELD: Your Honour I won't pursue that application for compensation, there is another avenue available.

HIS HONOUR: There's another avenue available, right okay.

SUMMERFIELD: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right Mr Moore, now good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Thanks Mr Hancock, thank you Ms Summerfield.

HANCOCK: Thank you your Honour.

SUMMERFIELD: Thank you your Honour.

		21 August 2013",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760516,R v Tuki [2012] NSWSC 1436,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: This is an inquiry under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 as to whether the Accused, Ray Tuki, is unfit to be tried for a number of serious offences. 

2There are eight counts contained in an indictment: 

(a) Count 1 - that on 29 June 2010, a number of persons committed a serious indictable offence, namely the armed robbery of James Stiff, and the Accused concealed the commission of that offence without reasonable excuse (s.316(1) Crimes Act 1900).

(b) Count 2 - that on 1 July 2010 at Warwick Farm, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a meat cleaver, the Accused robbed Maxine Rogers of a mobile phone and a laptop computer (s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900). 

(c) Count 3 - that on or about 1 July 2010 at Lurnea, the Accused did murder Kesley Burgess (s.18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900). 

(d) Count 4 - in the alternative to Count 3, that the Accused, between 1 and 4 July 2010 at Villawood, was an accessory after the fact to the murder of Kesley Burgess (s.349(1) Crimes Act 1900). 

(e) Count 5 - that on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea, the Accused, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a meat cleaver, robbed Tracey Burgess of a handbag (s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900). 

(f) Count 6 - that on or about 3 July 2010 at Villawood, the Accused did conspire with John Khoury, Mohammed Karimi and others to murder an unknown person (s.26 Crimes Act 1900). 

(g) Count 7 - in the alternative to Count 6, that on 4 July 2010 at Miller, while in the company of Mohammed Karimi and other persons, the Accused possessed an offensive weapon, namely a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely affray (s.33B(2) Crimes Act 1900). 

(h) Count 8 - that on 4 July 2010 at Miller, the Accused did possess a firearm, namely a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, without being authorised to do so by a licence or permit (s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996). 

3The Accused appeared before Latham J in the Arraignments List on 3 August 2012 with respect to these charges. He was not arraigned on that occasion. The Court was informed that there was an issue as to his fitness to be tried, and an inquiry was listed to proceed before me today to determine that question. 

Applicable Legal Principles

4The principles to be applied on a hearing such as this are not in doubt. 

5Section 12(3) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 provides that the onus of proof of the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings in respect of the offence. The proceedings are by way of inquiry which is not to be conducted in an adversary manner: s.12(2). 

6The sole question to be determined is whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Accused is unfit to be tried for the offences alleged against him: s.6. 

7This issue falls to be determined by application of what is called the Presser test. This test emerges from the decision of Smith J in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48. This is the test concerning fitness to be tried to be applied in an inquiry of this type: R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; 59 NSWLR 284 at 294-295 [279]-[286]. 

8The Presser test has been described in decisions of the High Court of Australia, including Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; 181 CLR 230 at 245-246 and Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51; 211 ALR 1 at 5 [9] (footnote 2). 

9In R v Presser, Smith J stated that, before a trial could proceed without unfairness or injustice, an accused person should meet certain minimum standards. Such minimum standards include the ability to understand the offence charged, the nature of the proceedings and the effect of any evidence given against the accused person. Additionally, Smith J said that an accused person should possess sufficient capacity to be able to decide whether he or she will rely upon a defence and, if so, be in a position to communicate either to the Court or counsel the facts necessary for the defence. 

10In Kesavarajah v The Queen, Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ observed, at 246, that the Court should take into account as well the potential length of the trial, and the likely ability of the accused person to remain fit to be tried for the duration of the trial itself. 

11It is also relevant to take into account the nature of the charges and their potential complexity, because these issues are interrelated with the ability of an accused person to understand the charges and provide instructions concerning them. 

12It is a requirement in s.11(2) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 that, where an accused person is found unfit to be tried, the Court must, as part of its determination, record the relevant principles of law and the findings of fact on which the Court has relied. 

13It is the principles which I have described which will be applied for the purpose of this inquiry. 
 
Evidence Adduced at the Inquiry

14The evidence placed before the Court on this inquiry is documentary in nature. That evidence is as follows: 

(a) report of Dr Adam Martin, psychiatrist, dated 27 July 2011 (Exhibit A);

(b) report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 1 November 2011 (Exhibit B);

(c) report of Dr Andrew White, psychiatrist, dated 10 January 2012 (Exhibit C);

(d) the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal concerning the Accused, with respect to other matters, dated 14 March 2012 (Exhibit D);

(e) report of Dr Adam Martin, dated 21 March 2012 (Exhibit E);

(f) a further report of Dr Adam Martin, dated 28 August 2012 (Exhibit F). 

(g) a document that identifies the Accused's current custodial placement as the Mental Health Unit of Long Bay Hospital (Exhibit G).

(h) the Crown case statement, which sets out the nature of the allegations against the Accused with respect to the charges identified earlier in this judgment (Exhibit H). 



The Determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal on 14 March 2012

15It will be apparent from what I have said that the Mental Health Review Tribunal has already played a part with respect to the Accused. The evidence reveals that, on 21 November 2011, his Honour Judge Keleman SC at the Parramatta District Court found the Accused unfit to be tried with respect to charges of attempted choke with intent to commit a serious indictable offence and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Those offences are said to have been committed, as I understand it, in late 2009. 

16As a result of the finding of his Honour Judge Keleman SC, the Mental Health Review Tribunal undertook an inquiry on 27 January 2012 and published a determination on 14 March 2012 with respect to the District Court matters. 

17The Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that, on the totality the material, it was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Accused remained unfit for trial and was unlikely to become fit within the next 12 months. As a consequence of that finding, a special hearing is listed in the District Court on 4 March 2013 concerning the charges before that Court: s.21 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

18I observe that s.15 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 provides for a presumption as to findings concerning unfitness. It is to be presumed that a person who has been found to be unfit to be tried for ""an offence"" continues to be unfit to be tried for ""the offence"" until the contrary is, on the balance of probabilities, determined to be the case. 

19The finding of his Honour Judge Keleman SC, and the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, apply to the offences that are before the District Court. The presumption in s.15 applies to those offences. The presumption does not extend to the different charges which are before this Court. 

20Accordingly, it remains for this Court to make its own finding as to whether the Accused is fit to be tried for the Supreme Court matters. That said, the history of the Accused on the District Court charges, including the finding of his Honour Judge Keleman SC and the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, constitute significant evidence before this Court at this inquiry, and assists the Court in reaching a finding in this case. 

The Charges Against the Accused in this Court

21The charges against the Accused involve allegations of very serious criminality over a period of days in late June 2010 and early July 2010.

22It is said that the Accused and other persons engaged in a series of home invasions involving, in one case, the murder of Kesley Burgess. 

23The Crown case statement, which is in evidence, identifies a number of people who have been charged with respect to these matters. I have some familiarity with these prosecutions because a number of the persons referred to in the Crown case statement have, in fact, pleaded guilty before me to various charges, including murder (MA, Thomas Byquar, Tomasi Natuba, David Ramos and Aneterea Tamapua). In addition, there is to be a trial in the Supreme Court in March 2013 of John Khoury, Mohammed Karimi and Mahdi Mir for murder and other alleged offences.

24The charges against the Accused involve events with, on a number of counts, the Crown case being dependent upon principles of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise. As I understand it, it is not the Crown case that the Accused entered the premises on each occasion when persons were robbed, injured or killed. The Crown case is that, in various ways, the Accused is criminally responsible for a number of these matters, although he did not wield a weapon. 

25I mention this because the charges against the Accused are not without complexity. To comprehend the charges which he faces, and to give instructions with respect to them, is a more demanding process in this case than may occur in a more straightforward case. This is relevant to the question of fitness to be tried. It is a more demanding set of circumstances which the Accused needs to understand for the purpose of giving instructions as to plea or as to defence. 

26It is not necessary, for the purpose of this judgment, to recite in any detail the nature of the charges themselves. It will be apparent from a recital of the charges, that a number of persons in different places were robbed, injured or killed. The Crown case statement, which is in evidence, provides a more elaborate explanation of the way in which the Crown puts its case against the Accused and other persons. 

27It is sufficient to make the observations which I have about the complexity of the charges, because that is of particular relevance to the task which I am performing today. 

The Medical Evidence

28Dr Adam Martin examined the Accused on behalf of the legal representatives of the Accused. Dr Olav Nielssen examined the Accused on behalf of the Crown. 

29The reports of Dr Martin have identified, in some detail, the Accused's history with respect to mental illness and disorder. It is not necessary to recite these matters in detail in this judgment. It is sufficient to note that, in Dr Martin's first report of 27 July 2011, he expressed the opinion that the Accused was probably not fit to stand trial. It should be borne in mind that the charges in relation to which Dr Martin was then expressing an opinion were different to those before the Court today. On one view of it, they are more straightforward as to the nature of the allegations against the Accused. They arose out of what was said to be a very serious but, it would seem, single incident of violence towards the Accused's then partner. 

30Thereafter, Dr Nielssen, on 1 November 2011, expressed the opinion that the Accused was unfit to be tried, in particular upon the basis of his refusal or inability to respond to the charges, and what seemed to be an inability to provide reliable instructions to his legal representative about how to present his case. Again, I observe that Dr Nielssen was addressing the District Court charges, and not the present set of charges. 

31His Honour Judge Keleman SC found the Accused unfit to be tried on 21 November 2011, and referred the Accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

32Thereafter, Dr Andrew White, psychiatrist with Justice Health, examined the Accused at the request of the Mental Health Review Tribunal for the purpose of its then forthcoming inquiry. On 10 January 2012, Dr White reported on that examination, and indicated that he applied directly the elements of the Presser test. Dr White expressed the opinion that, on balance, the Accused was unfit to be tried for the District Court matters. Dr White's main concern was the Accused's ability to follow proceedings, and that that would impact on his ability to understand the substantial effect of evidence given against him. Dr White observed that the Accused's ability to cope with stress would lead to an issue of unfitness as outlined in Kesavarajah v The Queen. 

33The Mental Health Review Tribunal then conducted an inquiry on 27 January 2012. The Tribunal was constituted by its then President, the Honourable Greg James AM QC, Dr Peter Shea, psychiatrist, and Mr John Haigh. 

34In its determination of 14 March 2012, the Tribunal referred to the reports of Dr Martin, Dr Nielssen and Dr White. The Tribunal indicated that there was some confusion as to the Accused's precise charges. The Accused seemed to understand that the then relevant charges related to what was said to be an altercation with his partner, but he was of no assistance as to the other charges. The ""other charges"" I take to be the present charges, which were at that time before the Local Court but, since August 2012, have been before this Court. 

35As I have already noted, the Tribunal concluded that the Accused was unfit to be tried, and was unlikely to become fit to be tried within the next 12 months. 

36Dr Adam Martin provided a further report dated 21 March 2012, which followed an examination of the Accused at the MRRC on 7 March 2012. Once again, Dr Martin sought to apply the Presser test. It would seem that Dr Martin, at that stage, was still confining his inquiry to the matters before the District Court. However, even with that more straightforward set of charges, Dr Martin concluded that, given the Accused's responses to his questions relevant to the Presser test, it was difficult to reach any conclusion other than the Accused was probably unfit to plead or to stand trial. There had been no apparent progress in his condition and, according to the Accused's subjective account of his symptoms, in some ways he appeared to have worsened. 

37Dr Martin concluded that it was highly unlikely that the Accused's level of understanding of the Court process was likely to change materially, regardless of which medication he was prescribed. 

38The most recent medical evidence before the Court is the report of Dr Martin of 28 August 2012. Dr Martin examined the Accused on 23 August 2012 at the Long Bay Hospital. Dr Martin observed that the Accused had two separate sets of charges and understood, by that time, that the inquiry fixed for today was to take place in the Supreme Court. 

39Accordingly, Dr Martin's examination of the Accused on 23 August 2012 was undertaken for the current set of charges as well as, indirectly, the District Court matters. 

40In this report, Dr Martin concluded that the Accused appeared to have difficulty concentrating and understanding concepts, even when explained fairly basically. Dr Martin was not convinced that the Accused was then likely to be able to understand satisfactorily the legal process or to be able to make a reasoned defence, challenge evidence or instruct his defence team adequately. 

41Dr Martin's impression was that the Accused was unlikely to be fit to stand trial, and his assessment was that that was unlikely to change even with ongoing antipsychotic treatment. Dr Martin formed the view that the Accused was probably of borderline intelligence only, and that this impacted upon his level of understanding of the Court process as well. 

Decision Concerning Fitness to be Tried

42The sole question for decision is whether the Accused is presently unfit to be tried for the Supreme Court matters. The Presser test sets out the minimum requirement for an accused person to stand trial. 

43It is apparent from the medical evidence, and the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, that there is a long and consistent history of identification of factors that have seen the Accused considered unfit to be tried. 

44I add to that the determination of his Honour Judge Keleman SC in the District Court on 21 November 2011. In effect the medical evidence, taken with the finding of his Honour Judge Keleman SC and the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, is all one way. 

45The application of the Presser test has led consistently to the formation of the view that the Accused is unfit to be tried. 

46As a consequence of the finding made with respect to the other charges, a special hearing is to take place in the District Court on 4 March 2013. 

47Having regard to the evidence before me, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that the Accused is unfit to be tried on the charges contained in the indictment in this Court, to which I have referred. It is apparent that the Accused is restricted in his capacity to communicate effectively the facts necessary for his defence, and to provide instructions with respect to the relatively complex set of charges brought against him in this Court. 

48Having reached that conclusion at this inquiry, the criminal proceedings against the Accused must not be continued, and I am required to refer the Accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s.14(a) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. It will be for that Tribunal to determine as soon as practicable whether, on the balance of probabilities, the Accused will, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the Supreme Court offences for the purpose of s.16(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. Depending upon the Tribunal's determination, ss.17 or 19 of that Act may have application to the Accused. 

49It is appropriate to make an order under s.14(b)(iii) of the Act remanding the Accused in custody until the determination of the Tribunal under s.16 has been given effect to. 

50I make the following findings and orders: 

(a) I find that the Accused, Ray Tuki, is unfit to be tried for the offences contained in the indictment dated 23 November 2012, a copy of which will be furnished, together with the documentary exhibits, to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

(b) In accordance with s.14 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I refer the Accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

(c) Pursuant to s.14(b)(iii) of that Act, I remand the Accused in custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s.16 of that Act. 

(d) I direct that copies of all exhibits at this inquiry, together with a copy of the indictment, be furnished to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, to assist the discharge of its statutory functions under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

2760517,R v Craig DUNN [2012] NSWDC 297,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1Craig Dunn has pleaded guilty to a crime under s 316(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The indictment says that somebody else committed an offence of possessing pseudoephedrine which is a precursor used in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. It goes on to charge that Mr Dunn, believing that someone had committed that offence and believing that he had information which might be of material assistance in having that person prosecuted, failed to bring that information to the attention of the police without having a reasonable excuse. 

2Briefly, the police found in a backyard shed an amateur drug laboratory which contained almost half a kilogram of pseudoephedrine which is a precursor to the manufacture of amphetamine. They were found in the shed of a house in Emu Plains. Pseudoephedrine is itself a prohibited drug. The find was made on 11 February 2011. A few months later, on 27 May, Craig Dunn was arrested. 

3Fingerprint evidence had been found connecting him with some of the equipment which was discovered in the shed. Police found his fingerprints on a blender box and a plastic container which itself contained pseudoephedrine and some containers of methylated spirits as well as on a plastic bag which contained tablets from which some of the material is extracted. 

4Mr Dunn was arrested and taken into custody and did not get bail until 2 December 2011 so he spent 6 months and 5 days in custody. 

5Mr Dunn was originally charged with possessing a precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, intending that that be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine but the Director of Public Prosecutions, represented in these sentence proceedings by Mr W Dawe QC, has accepted a plea of guilty to the alternative which is the offence I am sentencing him for. 

6Mr Dunn has a criminal record. It mainly involves public nuisance offences and some offences regarding restricted substances and one driving offence. It also involves a couple of offences in Queensland which I do not take into account because no conviction was recorded in respect of those. 

7Mr P M Skinner who appears for Mr Dunn points out that his client has served 6 months and 5 days in custody whereas the more serious charge which was originally laid is no longer being proceeded with. He points out that his client pleaded guilty to the charge I am sentencing him for as soon as it became available as an option. 

8Mr Skinner has also helpfully provided me with some statistics kept by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for offences of this kind and they indicate that only about 2 per cent - from a relatively small database but nevertheless 42 - received prison sentences. 

9An easy way of dealing with this matter would be to sentence Mr Dunn to 6 months and 5 days imprisonment and indicate that that sentence has been served. However it seems to me that that penalty would be too severe given the statistics which Mr Skinner has produced. A sentencer sentencing Mr Dunn for any other offences - which hopefully he will not commit in the future - would see that he has received a custodial sentence. I do not think that would be fair. In the circumstances Mr Skinner argued that I should dismiss this charge under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I propose to accept that submission for two reasons. One is that his client pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. The second is that he has effectively served a prison sentence for this crime. But I do not think that that time in custody should appear on his record as a prison sentence. 

10For those reasons I convict you of the offence to which you have pleaded guilty and I dispose of these proceedings without imposing any other penalty and that order is made under s 10A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Anything else I should do Mr Skinner or Mr Dawe?

SKINNER: No your Honour not from my side. 
DAWE: Only have it recorded somewhere on the papers your Honour that the charge - the original charge of knowingly take part in the manufacture of pseudoephedrine - has received a no further proceedings marking. 
HIS HONOUR: Yes when did that happen?
DAWE: That happened on Tuesday morning.
HIS HONOUR: And the indictment was changed?
DAWE: Yes the indictment was changed. 
HIS HONOUR: Okay I will add something to my remarks. 

11In addition Mr Dunn was originally charged with knowingly taking part in the manufacture of pseudoephedrine. That charge was formally not continued with last Tuesday, 20 November 2012. That is a very serious offence and no doubt explained why Mr Dunn may have been refused bail for the period that he was. That is another matter which I have taken into account in making the order that I made.

		06 September 2013",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760519,R v Anthony Jones [2012] NSWSC 1433,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender, Anthony Jones, is to be sentenced for the murder of Edan Brown at Dee Why on 23 May 2010. The offender and the deceased, who were friends, met at a party in the backyard of a house in Dee Why on the evening of 22 May 2010. The offender arrived first and sent the deceased a message suggesting that he attend the party, but there is no suggestion that he did so out of any intent to do him harm. The deceased arrived at about 11:00pm. 

2There were upwards of a dozen people at the party and most were drinking alcohol. There was a garage in the backyard of the house and some surrounding lawn, and a number of those attending the party were in the garage or on the grass nearby drinking alcohol. 

3Shortly before 1:00am there was a heated exchange between the offender and the deceased. The evidence does not establish why. The offender and the deceased fought and the deceased was knocked to the ground. Two men, one of whom was the offender, fought the deceased as he lay and struggled on the ground. 

4During the struggle, the offender delivered two blows with a knife. One blow struck the left side of the back of the lower chest of the deceased. The resulting wound terminated in soft tissue without entering the left pleural cavity. Not much force would have been needed to inflict the wound. The second blow was fatal. It struck the deceased on the right side on the back of the lower chest. The knife penetrated fatty tissue and went between ribs before entering the bottom of the lower lobe of the right lung. It continued on to end in a superficial portion of the top of the liver. 

5The knife produced no bony injury and no great force would have been necessary to inflict the wound. As it passed between the ribs it severed an artery. The right lung collapsed. The deceased died because of loss of blood from the severed artery and because he could not breathe properly. 

6The knife used by the offender was never found. The house was the residence of Tylah Maaka and his partner, Awhina Noble. During the evening, Ms Noble was in the kitchen of the house preparing food for the guests. The offender entered the kitchen and spoke to her. Above the stove was a block of cutlery including a set of six serrated steak knives. 

7After these events, police came to the premises and asked the guests and the occupants to leave. They were not permitted to take their things with them. When Ms Noble returned to the house, she realised that one of the knives from the set was missing. 

8The pathologist who gave evidence, Dr Istvan Szentmariay, was supplied with a knife from the set. He expressed the opinion, which I accept, that the wounds suffered by the deceased were consistent with having been caused by the knife. In coming to his opinion, Dr Szentmariay observed a number of features of the knife, such as that it was sharp on one edge but not on the other and that it was serrated. The width of the blade was consistent with the shape of the wounds. It had a sharp point and its length was sufficient to have caused the wounds. 

9There is no explanation of how the missing knife went missing or of how wounds consistent with its use came to be inflicted unless the offender removed the knife from the set and used it when attacking the deceased. If that is what happened it shows two things, first that the offender did not take the knife to the party, confirming my impression that at that time he bore the deceased no ill will, and secondly, that he lay hands on the knife at some time, however long or short I cannot say, before he began to attack the deceased. It is not as though he snatched it opportunistically as the fight was beginning. I think that he took it from the kitchen. 

10Mr Maaka pulled the offender and the other man off the deceased. The deceased got to his feet, left the premises and walked up the street seeking help. He knocked on the window of a nearby premises and roused Mr Al Yaman Al Khayer, who called another neighbour, Mr Ibrahim Khala. Mr Khala and Mr Al Khayer were very helpful and resourceful. They did what they could to stem the bleeding from the deceased's wound. They telephoned the emergency services so that ambulance officers came to the house. Mr Al Khayer and Mr Khala are to be commended. The ambulance officers attended to the deceased as best they could but unfortunately he died on the way to hospital. 

11The deceased knew who had stabbed him and named the offender when speaking to the neighbours and to the ambulance officers. Immediately after stabbing the deceased the offender left the premises in company. Within hours of the attack, having been told that the deceased had died, he described how he had stabbed him. From then on and for the next few days he avoided his ordinary place of residence and stayed in hotels in places away from the suburb where he ordinarily resided. 

12Although Mr Maaka did not identify the men he pulled off the deceased and although there was no direct evidence identifying the offender as the one who stabbed the deceased, there was a respectable Crown case.

13This was the offender's second trial on this charge. His first trial was held in February 2012. He gave evidence denying his involvement in the crime. The jury were unable to agree. The second trial, which was held before me, began on 3 October 2012 and continued until 16 October 2012 when the accused asked to be arraigned again and pleaded guilty to the charge.

14At both trials, counsel for the offender told the jury that there was a reasonable possibility that another man and not the offender inflicted the wound that caused the death of the deceased. Counsel named the other man. He was present at the party. The offender's change of plea came when the Crown case was more than half over. About 30 witnesses had given evidence and the named man was due to give evidence. 

15The offender was born on 4 January 1986. He knows very little about his father, who left home when he was 5 years old. When he was 7, his mother began a relationship with a man who became his step father, but he died of a drug overdose in 2003. The offender's mother is addicted to heroin. He has a half-brother, a half sister and two step brothers. For most of his childhood he was raised by his half-brother. The offender attended a number of schools and apparently did not do well academically. He was keen on sport and attended a high school that encouraged sport but he was frequently involved in fights and was asked to leave. That he did after year nine. The offender began an apprenticeship but did not complete it. He did a number of manual jobs.

16The offender was dealt with in the Children's Court for a number of offences of violence and dishonesty, some of them associated with alcohol. In 2003 he was dealt with in the District Court for stealing in a dwelling house and aggravated robbery with wounding. A short term of imprisonment was imposed. On 19 November 2004, he was sentenced in the District Court to a 5-year term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for aggravated robbery. The non-parole period ended in January 2007. There had been a number of control orders in the Children's Court from time to time for offences of violence and dishonesty. The offender's most recent custodial sentence was a 1-month term of imprisonment imposed in the Local Court expiring in August 2011. 

17In recent times the offender has worked part-time as a labourer and has completed a certificate in personal training at a fitness institute. He was working in that capacity when he was arrested. He is not married and has no children. 

18A consulting psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro, provided a report for the Court. Most of the offender's history that I have related has been extracted from the report. According to Mr Watson-Munro, the offender was disappointed when he was injured and could not make a career playing football. With the end of his prospects in that direction, his reliance on alcohol increased. This led to offending. It is reported that the offender drank alcohol heavily the night before the party and on the night of the party. On the day before the offence, he had snorted cocaine and consumed alcohol. According to Mr Watson-Munro, the offender concedes that this behaviour affected his judgment and impulse control.

19Mr Watson-Munro administered standard psychological tests and concluded that the offender had severe depression as well as increasing anxiety as his sentence approached. The offender felt guilty and expected to be punished. Mr Watson-Munro is of the opinion that the offender's change to his plea indicates his genuine remorse. 

20Earlier in these remarks I set out the history of the offender's defence of the charge at his first trial and at this one in order to give an appreciation of the position he found himself in when he changed his plea. It would be correct to say that ordinarily a plea which came late and in the face of a strong Crown case would not be regarded as evidence or much evidence of remorse. However, the circumstances are unusual. Mr Watson-Munro has called them unprecedented in his long experience and I am prepared to accept the offender's statement, even though it was not made directly to the Court, that his change of heart resulted from his increasing embarrassment, shame and feelings of guilt. I accept that the offender feels sympathy for the family of the deceased.

21The plea of guilty, coming as late as it did, is of minimal utilitarian value. 

22There are aggravating features of the offence. It was committed in company. A knife was used. The offence was committed in the house of another. The offender was on conditional liberty at the time, having been charged and bailed on 26 January 2010. He was also subject to a bond to be of good behaviour for 12 months, dating from 4 June 2009 for resisting or hindering police and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. Although there was no long term planning, the offender took the knife from the kitchen anticipating trouble. 

23The offender has a considerable criminal history including offences of violence, but I do not consider it so serious as to aggravate his criminality. Of course, his record disentitles him to leniency.

24I do not regard his use of alcohol or drugs as relevant other than to explain how things came about. Their effect on him neither aggravated nor mitigated his criminality. 

25There are mitigating features. The offender has now admitted his involvement and a small utilitarian benefit flows to the community from that. More importantly, he has pleaded guilty and is remorseful. 

26The evidence does not satisfy me that the offender intended to kill the deceased. He should be dealt with as having intended to do him grievous bodily harm. 

27The offender was arrested on 15 June 2010 and has been held in custody since then. His sentence should begin on that day. 

28The standard non-parole period for murder is 20 years' imprisonment. I shall bear it in mind when fixing the sentence as I take into account the features I have summarised. 

29I must impose a substantial period of imprisonment upon the offender. While he is in custody he will be offered programs which will encourage and help him to master his use of alcohol and drugs and moderate his violent behaviour. His genuine remorse is a good indicator that he is prepared to seize the opportunities he is given. There are prospects of rehabilitation. I cannot find that he will not reoffend but there are encouraging prospects that he will learn to live a more useful and law-abiding life. 

30A victim impact statement was received from the mother of Edan Brown, Mrs Wendy Brown. I know that Mrs Brown has been informed that the matters contained in it cannot be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed. Nevertheless, I have read the statement and it is proper to acknowledge the pain and suffering that the loss of her son has caused her. I wish to express the sympathy of the Court to Mrs Brown and her family and all that have been touched by these tragic events. It is to be hoped that now that these proceedings are finished Mrs Brown and others concerned will have healing and comfort.

31I have considered whether there are circumstances justifying an increase in the parole period of the sentence I shall impose and a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period. The matters put forward by Mr Brady on behalf of the offender as justifying such a course were the very length of the sentence I must impose and the need for the offender upon release to be supervised to ensure appropriate psychological treatment and a drug free lifestyle. 

32I accept that these are genuine concerns but I find it difficult to judge what period of supervision will be necessary to control his desire for the use of drugs. I would expect that those having the control of the offender during his non-parole period will offer him assistance in changing his attitudes towards such substances. Significant progress should have been made by the time the offender is granted parole. The pressures on release will be different, of course, and he will need additional help, but I am not satisfied that it will be necessary to extend his period of parole in order to reach a satisfactory result. 

33Anthony Jones for the murder of Edan Brown I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of fourteen years which will be taken to have commenced on 15 June 2010 and will expire on 14 June 2024. The balance of the term will be 4 years and 8 months, expiring on 14 February 2029. The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 14 June 2024.

		23 November 2012",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760520,R v Moustapha Dib [2012] NSWSC 1431,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1The offender, Moustapha Dib, has been found guilty by the jury of the offences that on 23 November 2000 at Punchbowl he murdered Anita Vrzina and that at the same time and place he wounded Ahmed Banat with intent to murder him.

2Mr Banat was driving his car northwards in Kathleen Street Punchbowl some time after 10pm on 23 November 2000. His wife, Anita Vrzina, was seated in the front passenger seat. Their young son was seated in the back seat. They were travelling in company with friends, Jalal al Zahab and Monzer el Husseini, who were in another vehicle. That vehicle was ahead of Mr Banat's. A stolen car flashed its lights as it approached Mr Banat's vehicle from the rear. Mr Banat stopped and the stolen car stopped on Mr Banat's offside. The offender was seated in the front passenger seat of the stolen car. He fired at least four bullets into Mr Banat's car. Two struck Ms Vrzina and killed her. Only one bullet struck Mr Banat. It passed clean through his neck from side to side under the line of the jaw. Almost miraculously it did not kill him. The car containing the offender sped off. A few minutes later it was abandoned and set on fire not far away. 

3After he was shot Mr Banat, who was bleeding badly and in need of urgent medical help, drove his car northwards along Kathleen Street and overtook the vehicle containing Mr Al Zahab and Mr El Husseini, which had stopped. He drove into the Boulevard and stopped after a couple of blocks. The other vehicle followed. Mr Al Zahab, the driver, stopped his vehicle near Mr Banat's. Police officers responding to a call about another incident saw the erratic career of the cars and stopped. When they realised what had happened they gave what help they could and called an ambulance. Ambulance officers attended. Sadly, they could do nothing for Ms Vrzina. They rendered first aid to Mr Banat. Police and ambulance officers took him to hospital, where arrangements were made for him to be taken to St George hospital for surgery. 

4Mr Banat spent more than three hours in the operating theatre and was discharged to recover in the Intensive Care Unit in the early hours of 24 November. Police officers guarded him.

5The police were anxious to interview Mr Banat to try to ascertain who had shot him. With the permission of hospital staff Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony spoke to Mr Banat as he lay in bed. There were a number of conversations over that day and the next. Mr Banat could not speak but he could think and write. Over a period of hours he answered the officers' questions by writing his answers on paper supplied to him.

6Mr Banat had known the offender for years. He was then 22 years of age and the offender 17 years of age. He knew the offender from school and had seen him on numerous occasions in the company of others. He knew him by the nickname ""Fairy"", or it may have been ""Ferry"". 

7Detective Sergeant Karras asked Mr Banat whether he could tell him who had done this to him. Mr Banat wrote the nickname. He spelt it ""Fairy"". He also wrote the names of two other persons as occupants of the car. He wrote that there was a fourth person whom he did not identify. He described the car. 

8On the evening of 24 November Mr Banat's brother, Mohamad Banat, visited him and spoke privately to him. During their interview Mr Banat wrote on paper the names of occupants of the car, including the nickname ""Fairy"". Mr Mohamad Banat signed the paper and wrote on it the time and date and handed it to Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony. 

9Early in his interview with the two police officers, immediately after he first wrote the nickname ""Fairy"", Mr Banat wrote a question, enquiring whether the police had shown statements. I am satisfied that he was referring to a statement he had made at the New South Wales Crime Commission on 13 July 2000 in which he had described an event that had taken place shortly after the stabbing of a schoolboy, Edward Lee in 1998. On that occasion Mr Banat was visiting the house of a friend. The offender was there and had blood on him. There were clothes with blood on them. Blood was being hosed away. Others present were remonstrating with the offender for what he had done. 

10Although the offender was eventually charged over the killing of Edward Lee, pleaded guilty of his manslaughter and was sentenced for that offence, he had not been charged when Mr Banat made his statement at the New South Wales Crime Commission. I am satisfied that when he wrote the question for Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony Mr Banat, knowing that the offender had shot him and his wife, believed that the reason for that might be that the offender had somehow learned about the statement he had made. 

11By the end of 25 November Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony had a number of notes written by Mr Banat, but they desired to have the information he was giving incorporated in an official statement, signed by Mr Banat. They invited him to sign a statement, but he put them off. He later declined further invitations to make a statement

12On 15 December 2000, after his discharge from hospital, Mr Banat went to the police station and made a written statement in which he said that he could not identify any of the occupants of the car. He said that they were wearing balaclavas. Whenever he has been asked about the matter since, Mr Banat has said that he could not identify the occupants of the car. That was his evidence at trial. The jury rejected that evidence and were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statements written for Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony identifying the offender as the gunman were truthful and accurate.

13In his evidence before the jury Mr Banat accepted that he had written the notes but put forward a number of reasons for doing so. He said that, perhaps influenced by drugs that had been administered to him in the course of his treatment, he had had a nightmare. The implication was that he was writing not what he had seen but what he had dreamed or imagined. He criticised Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony, saying that they had overborne him, putting into his mind while he was in a suggestive state the idea that the offender must have been the gunman. He said that they told him, among other things, that the police had a cap with the offender's DNA on it. In fact a cap was picked up off the road in Kathleen Street on the night of the shooting and a DNA profile matching the offender's was developed from it, but not until the following March. I am satisfied that he was lying about the conduct of Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony. 

14Mohamad Banat gave evidence in which he asserted that Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony had not allowed him to have a private conversation with Mr Ahmed Banat. That notwithstanding that he had previously told a Court that they had had a private conversation. He said that while he was there Mr Banat wrote ""balaclavas"" on a piece of paper and handed it to him. He no longer had the piece of paper. He was invited to consider the discrepancy between Mr Banat's expression of the names of the occupants of the car and the implication of a statement that they were wearing balaclavas, but was unable to explain it. He could scarcely deny the authenticity of the document bearing the names of the asserted occupants in Mr Banat's handwriting and bearing his own signature with a time and date. I am satisfied that he told lies as far as he thought he was able. I am satisfied that there was never a document on which Mr Banat wrote ""balaclavas"".

15I found Mr Banat an unsatisfactory witness. He was generally unprepared to listen to questions and answer them in terms. He frequently took the opportunity to burst out and make speeches of his own devising. He attacked the Crown prosecutor verbally and threatened to do him violence. I am satisfied that he set out to do anything he thought he could to assist the defence. The jury rejected his denials. 

16Based upon his evidence at trial, Mr Richter, Queen's Counsel for the offender, launched a strong attack on Detective Sergeant Karras and Detective Senior Constable Apolony. By their verdicts, the jury accepted the reliability of the information contained in the notes written in response to questions asked by Detective Sergeant Karras. For my part, I am satisfied that the two officers behaved appropriately and in the interests of Mr Banat and of the citizens of this State. I am satisfied that they did not attempt to manipulate him or suggest to him who the gunman must have been or otherwise deal with him unfairly. I am satisfied that they said nothing about any cap and any DNA. That was a lie made up by Mr Banat long after he left hospital, based on events which took place after he left hospital.

17There was disputed evidence about things said by Mr Banat when the police first came on the scene in the Boulevard. I need not deal with it all here. It is enough to say that in my opinion there was no mention at that time of balaclavas. That subject was not raised until after Mr Banat was discharged from hospital. 

18It was the Crown case at trial that the offender's motive in committing these offences was to prevent Mr Banat from giving evidence if he, the offender, should later be charged over the killing of Edward Lee. Evidence was given by a protected witness using the name John Lee. He knew the offender well and was frequently in the street where the offender lived. At the time of these events he saw the offender every day. In a conversation that took place about a week before the shooting the offender said that Mr Banat was a dog. He also said, ""if you testify, next of kin will die"". Mr Lee said that the term ""dog"" meant someone who gives statements to police. He said that others also used to say that Mr Banat was a dog, but mainly the offender.

19At about the same time there was a conversation in which the offender said that Mr Banat was going to testify the next day, but he did not say what the case was about. There was no reason to think that it concerned the offender. 

20According to Mr Lee, a couple of days before the shooting the offender said, ""if you testify your next of kin will die"". 

21The day after the shooting the offender said, ""If you shoot someone you have to shoot the witness too. I don't feel sorry for no one because that's how people get done for murder"". On that day or the day after there was a conversation when those present were looking at a copy of the Daily Telegraph. The offender said that Mr Banat had been shot in the voice box and would not be able to testify. His wife would not be able to be a witness. 

22I think it very likely that the offender discovered that Mr Banat had informed on him and believed that he might give evidence against him if he were charged over the killing of Edward Lee. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that that was his precise reason for committing these offences. He knew or believed that Mr Banat was an informer. He mentioned a particular matter due to take place, on the following day, which presumably did not involve the offender. While he was apparently prepared to speak freely about Mr Banat and what he thought of him, there is no evidence of any acknowledgment that he expected Mr Banat to give evidence against him, let alone in relation to the Edward Lee stabbing.

23Although I think it highly probable that the offender carried out this assassination to stop Mr Banat giving evidence implicating him in the Edward Lee stabbing, it is also possible that he took the action he did to forestall evidence in another matter, unmentioned, or to express his disapproval of Mr Banat as an informer generally.

24I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the offender committed these offences to prevent Mr Banat from assisting the authorities as an informer, including giving evidence in Court, and to prevent Ms Vrzina from identifying him as the one who shot Mr Banat. Another reason for killing Ms Vrzina was her relationship to an informer. 

25It was submitted by Mr Dhanji of Senior Counsel for the offender, that the offender was less culpable than might appear because although the offender fired the bullets intending to kill he was not intending to kill Ms Vrzina. Mr Dhanji submitted that the Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew that Ms Vrzina was in Mr Banat's car at all. 

26Even if the facts were as postulated I would not regard such a killing as any less blameworthy than if the offender had intended to kill Ms Vrzina. But I do not accept the premise on which the submission was based. The things said by the offender as reported by Mr Lee show the importance placed by the offender on the need, when shooting anyone, to shoot any witness as well. Mr Lee's evidence also shows that the offender's view was that it was appropriate to execute the next of kin of informers. 

27Mr Dhanji attacked the reliability of Mr Lee's evidence, particularly his use of the term ""next of kin"" and submitted that that expression came not spontaneously from Mr Lee but from the investigating police officers. Mr Lee was a very important Crown witness and I listened very carefully to him and watched him closely as he gave evidence. I bear in mind that he gave evidence in fulfilment of an undertaking to a Judge of the District Court to do so, having received a substantially lower sentence than he would have otherwise received in exchange for the undertaking. I thought he was telling the truth.

28Mr Banat and Ms Vrzina were living together in a unit in Melrose Ave, right opposite the southern end of Kathleen Street. Marta Vrzina, Ms Vrzina's younger sister, was visiting them on that day. She saw Mr Banat and Ms Vrzina get into their car. Their son was seated in the back seat. Mr Banat was driving and Ms Vrzina was in the front passenger seat. Marta Vrzina was at the front of the block of units looking along Kathleen Street when she saw Mr Banat drive the car northwards along Kathleen Street, following the vehicle containing Mr Al Zahab and Mr El Husseini. The distance between the southern end of Kathleen Street and the northern end where it terminates at the Boulevard is about 350 metres. The distance between Melrose avenue and the point at which Mr Banat stopped his car in response to the flashing headlights of the car following is about 250 - 300 metres. It would have taken Mr Banat's car less than half a minute, probably closer to 20 seconds, to reach the point at which the shots were fired. The short distances and the times involved show that the offender must have been waiting for Mr Banat. He must have known that he was in the car as his car followed Mr Banat's and flashed its lights. If the offender knew that because he had seen Mr Banat enter the car, he would also have known that Ms Vrzina was in the car, for she entered it at the same time. 

29Mr Dhanji submitted that the light was not good, that the shooting took place over a very short time during which the cars were moving, that Ms Vrzina was seated beside Mr Banat, who might have hidden her from the offender's view, that her headscarf may have made her harder to see and that the offender would have been concentrating on Mr Banat. 

30Although Mr Banat lied about his ability to identify the gunman there is no reason not to accept his evidence of the way in which the cars behaved. He said that in response to the flashing lights he brought his car almost to a stop. A little later he said that he had brought it to a full stop, but not for long. Then both cars moved and a number of shots were fired. He thought five. He said the cars were within 2 metres of each other. The offender's window was down. He did not remember whether his window was down but the manner in which the bullets passed into Mr Banat's car and the damage to the car show that it was. 

31In my opinion, the offender had enough time and enough light to see Ms Vrzina in the car, even if he did not already know that she was there. Both opposing windows were open and the vehicles were within 2 metres of one another, side by side. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew when he fired no fewer than four shots that Ms Vrzina was in Mr Banat's car. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a principle of his that when shooting anyone, any witness should be shot as well. I am satisfied that it was a principle of his that informers' ""next of kin"" should be killed. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender fired at least four bullets intending to kill both Mr Banat and Ms Vrzina. 

32The car which the offender used was stolen at his request. I am satisfied that he requested it with the intention of killing Mr Banat. The offender had to obtain a firearm and ammunition. He had to lie in wait for Mr Banat. He was able to carry out his intended attack only by making careful preparations. The shooting was accordingly well planned. 

33The offences were more serious because they were carried out in company. The attack was launched in a public street without regard for public safety. 

34To assassinate a person to prevent their giving evidence strikes at the heart of our system of justice. Those who use firearms to inflict serious wounds as they attempt to do so deserve to be punished severely. Those who murder spouses or near relatives of those who inform in order to deter them from assisting the authorities or to send out a warning to others who might inform or who murder those who witness their crimes offend very seriously indeed. To my mind it makes no difference whether an offender acts as he does to protect his own interests or anybody else's. In my opinion, such offences fall into the worst category of cases and may attract the maximum sentence. For murder the maximum sentence in this state is imprisonment for life. For wounding with intent to murder the maximum sentence is imprisonment for 25 years. 

35The offender was born on 16 December 1982 and was 17 years and 10 months old when he committed these offences. He was dealt with a number of times in the Children's Court but I shall take no notice of those matters.

36In 2000, the offender was arrested and charged with assault, affray, being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence and destroying or damaging property. He was sentenced in the Local Court to serve concurrent terms of 6 months' imprisonment, commencing on 22 December 2000 and expiring on 21 June 2001. 

37On 5 February 2001 he was charged with the murder of Edward Lee. After pleading guilty of his manslaughter he was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years, commencing on 26 May 2001 and expiring on 25 May 2011. A non-parole period of 5 years was fixed, expiring on 25 May 2006. 

38On 27 February 2004 the offender pleaded guilty to two charges of supplying a prohibited drug, one of heroin and the other of cocaine. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years, commencing on 27 February 2004 and expiring on 26 February 2010. A non-parole period of 4 years was set, expiring on 26 February 2008. 

39The offender was arrested on the present charges on 26 November 2000 and was in custody on those charges alone for a period of 26 days until the commencement of the sentences imposed in the Local Court. From then on his successive and partly concurrent sentences continued until the drug supply sentences expired. The offender was not taken into custody again until the jury found him guilty of the present charges on 9 July 2012. 

40The offender became eligible for release to parole on 26 January 2008 but was not released. The Parole Authority cited as reasons for refusing parole the lack of post-release accommodation and the outstanding charges, which were only those leading to the present offences. The Authority's reasons were extracted in the judgment of Patten AJ at [2009] NSWSC 575 at [10]. Those reasons suggest to me that of the two reasons given, the existence of these charges was the more important. The Authority refused parole again on 11 March 2009, this time for reasons it would not disclose. However, the present proceedings had by then been discontinued and there is no reason to think that these charges formed any part of the Authority's reasons. It seems to me that the outstanding charges were largely responsible for the refusal of parole between 26 January 2008 and 11 March 2009. Taking into account the period of 26 days between the offender's arrest and the commencement of the Local Court sentences and the greater part of the period between 26 January 2008 and 11 March 2009, I shall allow the offender 12 months' credit as pre-sentence custody. I shall accordingly set his sentences to begin on 9 July 2011.

41There are two reasons why in my view maximum sentences should not be imposed. The first is the offender's age when he committed the offences. He was still two months short of adulthood. When sentencing young offenders, the Court ordinarily lays less emphasis on general deterrence and retribution and more on promoting rehabilitation. The court has said that young persons that deliberately engage in activities of the kind that adults perform may be treated on sentence as though they were adults, and further that the significance of an offender's youth will become less as the offender approaches adulthood. Even so, it seems to me that the age of this offender when he committed these offences should be given some weight.

42The second reason is the substantial delay that has taken place between charge and conviction. The trial of the offender on these charges began in September 2003 but had to be aborted. The trial restarted in the following month but that trial had to be stopped as well. The trial was set down for hearing a third time but in the meantime Mr Banat had left Australia and the Crown did not know where he was. The third attempt to try the offender was abandoned. I do not need to set out the detail of what happened after that. It is sufficient to say that the Director of Public Prosecutions twice directed that there be no further proceedings and twice reinstituted proceedings by the filing of an indictment ex officio. The trial which led to the conviction of the offender was held pursuant to an ex officio indictment filed on 20 October 2011, after Mr Banat had been arrested in Syria and extradited to New South Wales. The result has been a delay of about 9 years in the conviction of the offender and he is not to be blamed for the delay. In the meantime, he has served the sentences I have mentioned and has been released to parole. All his prior sentences have now expired. 

43In my opinion, the court should impose less than the maximum sentence for each offence. 

44The offender's early history of offending shows that he was undisciplined and impulsive and frequently offended. In sentencing him for the manslaughter of Edward Lee, Wood CJ at CL remarked on his impulsive nature. 

45The offender was held in continuous custody, beginning not long after these events on 22 December 2000 and ending on his release to parole on 10 August 2009. He participated in the treatment phase of the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (VOTP) between 17 July 2006 and 19 April 2007. That program is designed to assist violent offenders change their behaviour by changing their thinking, attitudes and feelings. Participants are expected to take responsibility for their offending behaviour and develop a detailed program to manage the risk of relapse. A report was issued on the offender's completing the program on 20 April 2007. Those reporting commented thus on the offender's attitude at the commencement of the program - 

""Treatment Participation and General Unit Behaviour

Mr Dib had a strong presence in the VOTP community. He presented as a dominant and serious person who was rigid in his thinking and behaviour. Mr Dib followed a regimented fitness routine and attended regular group prayer times. He preferred to know ahead of time any changes in the program schedule so he could amend his daily routine accordingly. His desire for routine was evidenced in group where he quickly became the time keeper, checking his watch in group and indicating when a break was due. Mr Dib ceased doing this when it was brought to his attention. Early in the program he was often annoyed by any changes to routine, however, his willingness to be flexible did improve through the course of the program. Mr Dib was generally not a management problem in the unit and typically kept to himself. 

Some paranoid beliefs and cognitions were significant impediments to Mr Dib's treatment in the early stages of the program. He was suspicious of the facilitator's motives and was concerned that questioning was intended to gather information to use against them (e.g. to profile them). This was also evident in early modules where offenders were asked to talk about their families. Mr Dib was at times quick to anger in group and accuse staff of trying to place blame onto his parents. This improved over the course of the program and Mr Dib became more trusting of the facilitators' intentions. 

...

Mr Dib reported early on in the program that he felt very uncomfortable interacting with officers. Prior to commencing the program he had been in segregation for several years and he also admitted to very strong anti-authority attitudes. Increasing his interaction with custodial staff was a specific treatment goal for Mr Dib, particularly in Stage two of the program where he made an effort to increase his communication with staff and to address them by their first name. He displayed some progress in this area. 

Aggression Management

This section was part of the readiness phase, prior to the treatment phase of the programme. Mr Dib participated well in groups and completed all required homework conscientiously. He recognised that he previously had a poor understanding of the emotion and its varying levels. Mr Dib was able to recognise he typically exhibited significant control over this anger, however, in highly anger provoking situations he acknowledged that he would lose control and often act violently. This insight assisted Mr Dib in understanding an important behaviour pattern. In addition, Mr Dib was able to identify typical anger-provoking situations which usually involved feeling slighted for some perceived unfairness, for example: being kept for too long in a holding cell and being deprived of things he believed he was entitled to. Mr Dib was able to identify the thoughts that would lead him to feel angry in these situations (""not again"" and ""why me"") and then generated positive coping statements that could reduce his level of anger in these situations (""that's part of gaol"", ""it's not worth it"" and ""think of the consequences""). In addition to using more positive self-talk to reduce and control his level of anger, Mr Dib identified time-out, training and talking to a friend as other effective strategies. 

Initially Mr Dib had some difficulty understanding defence mechanisms and how they are used to excuse and/or minimise violent behaviour. With further explanation he was able to identify that he has typically used justification (e.g. ""he hit me first"") as his main defence mechanism to excuse his use of violence. Overall, Mr Dib satisfactorily completed this module and acknowledged that anger and his use of violence was a problem he needed to address in the programme...""

46The report went on to deal in detail with the several aspects of the VOTP and the initial attitude and response of the offender. The report concluded as follows - 

""On entry into the program Mr Dib was assessed as moderate in terms of his general risk of reoffending in the 12 months following release from custody...Through completing the work in the program Mr Dib has improved his understanding of the factors that contributed to the development of his criminal lifestyle. He stayed in the program despite his initial reluctance and was diligent in completing the work assigned. Over the course of the program Mr Dib became more willing to listen to and consider other people's opinions and acknowledge that he can benefit from this. His willingness to communicate with custodial staff improved and he made attempts to interact with them more regularly. In addition, Mr Dib's understanding of anger has improved. He recognised that his pride often triggered his anger and resulted in him reacting aggressively. He reports that he is now better able to challenge his thinking around this and reminds himself of his long term goals. Mr Dib reported that the most significant gain for him was learning about his thinking that leads to his offending behaviour. He identified many thoughts that encourage violence and criminal behaviour and developed counter thoughts to challenge these. 

Along with the improvements from Mr Dib's participation in the program, limitations and ongoing areas of need have also been identified. Mr Dib came into custody before he was 18. He has no significant work history and he demonstrated some naivety with regards to potential risk factors in the community. Accordingly, he often voiced an optimistic view of what life will be like when he is released from custody. In addition, Mr Dib displayed limited understanding of others' influence on his behaviour, which will remain a risk factor for him on release. Issues around unfairness and entitlement also continue to be strong risk factors to him acting aggressively. Furthermore, Mr Dib's thinking style is very rigid and concrete and he continues to have limitations in his ability to empathise. His risk of reoffending remains at the moderate level. 

After completion of the VOTP it is recommended that Mr Dib attend custody-based maintenance at his gaol of classification; continue to identify, develop and challenge his thinking that is related to his offending; continue to work towards a reduction in his classification; continue to develop his perspective taking skills and consider the impact of his behaviour on others; and obtain employment whilst in custody to prepare him for the workplace on release. Following his release from custody it is recommended that Mr Dib avoid contact with criminal associates; participate in pro-social activities to develop non-criminal relationships; attend community-based maintenance and receive a high level of supervision from parole"". 

47On 10 December 2008, in a pre-release report, officers of the Probation and Parole Service noted that the offender had accepted the opportunity to address his offending behaviour and prepare himself for release to conditional liberty. 

48Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, saw the offender and wrote a report for the Court. He also gave oral evidence. Dr Westmore made the point, as borne out by official records, that the offender tended to be impulsive when young. He thought that during the 12 years that had passed since the present offences there were positive factors for risk prediction. Dr Westmore thought that there was good evidence of maturation, likely to lead to better decision making by the offender. He thought that he had coped quite well with the stresses and strains of custody and had made significant progress. Although Dr Westmore thought that the fact of the prior killing of Edward Lee was a matter of concern when sentencing for a further murder and an attempted murder, the two offences were dissimilar in that the Edward Lee killing was a criminal act carried out impulsively by a member of a group whereas the offences for which the offender must now be sentenced were the result of planning. Even so, Dr Westmore thought that in view of the significant time that had passed since the offences were committed, during which progress had been made, there was a potential for further progress. He thought that the degree of risk of re-offending would continue to reduce over time. 

49Between the offender's release to parole and his re-entering custody following the jury's verdict there was no adverse report about his conduct. The period was substantial and the offender was in work. He has a partner, a young woman with two children by a former relationship, and he exhibits signs of the maturity about which Dr Westmore spoke. Testimonials put before the Court show that the offender is well regarded and a good worker. I accept that he has benefited by opportunities given to him in custody and is a more responsible person than he was when he committed these offences. There are prospects of rehabilitation. The offender's history of behaviour in custody and on parole suggests that he may become less rigid in his attitudes, better able to understand others' points of view and less aggressive. Of course, the length of the sentence I must impose will mean that the offender will not be released to parole for many years. By then time alone will have made him a very different person. How different I cannot tell. 

50I do not regard the offender's other offences as aggravating the present offences and I have dealt with them merely in order to explain my understanding of the forces that have shaped him. I cannot say that the offender is unlikely to reoffend, but he has changed. 

51The offender told Dr Westmore that he was sorry for ""the victim and her family"". He was not reported as saying anything about Mr Banat. He denies responsibility for his offences. I put no weight on his statement to Dr Westmore. He is without remorse. 

52These two offences were committed at the same time, with the same intent and for the same reason. In accordance with the principles of totality the resulting sentences therefore need to be largely concurrent. Some accumulation is called for, however, in acknowledgement of the fact that one life was deliberately taken away and another person suffered serious injury and was almost killed. I have already remarked on the behaviour of Mr Banat in Court. The occasion did not arise during the trial and there would have been no point in asking him how the shooting had affected him. I think from my own observations that it affected him badly and that while he may have recovered physically he has been injured psychologically. 

53I have considered whether the circumstances justify imposing a sentence for either offence the balance of whose term exceeds one-third of the non-parole period. It was not submitted that any such circumstances existed. As far as I can tell the parole period I shall allow for will be sufficient to permit those supervising the offender to ensure his reintegration into the community. The only matter is the accumulation of sentences, and I shall make an adjustment to achieve a total effective sentence whose parole period is one third of its non-parole period. 

54The Court received victim impact statements, which were read on behalf of Matija Vrzina, the mother of Ms Vrzina, Ante Vrzina, her father, and her sisters, Tanja and Marta. I know that it has been explained to Ms Vrzina's parents and sisters that the Court cannot take into account, in imposing sentence, the hurt and distress that they have suffered and are continuing to suffer as a result of these tragic events. However, the Court can and does publicly acknowledge their loss and hurt and extends its sympathy to them. It is to be hoped that now these proceedings are finished they will have healing and comfort. 

55Section 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (""the Act"") forbids the publication of the name of an accused person who was a child at the time of any offence the subject of charge. Accordingly, the offender has been referred to throughout these proceedings as Z. Section 15C of the Act empowers a Court which sentences such a child on conviction for a serious children's indictable offence to authorise by order the publication or broadcasting of the name of the person. The two offences of which the offender has been convicted and is to be sentenced are serious children's indictable offences. The Crown has applied for such an order. When the subject was raised during the sentencing hearing Mr Dhanji, for the offender, did not wish to be heard. 

56Section 15C(3) requires these matters to be taken into account by the Court in determining whether to make such an order - 
(a) the level of seriousness of the offence concerned,
(b) the effect of the offence on any victim of the offence and (in the case of an offence that resulted in the death of the victim) the effect of the offence on the victim's family,
(c) the weight to be given to general deterrence,
(d) the subjective features of the offender,
(e) the offender's prospects of rehabilitation,
(f) such other matters as the court considers relevant having regard to the interests of justice.

57I have considered the application. The three matters which I think are most important and outweigh all other considerations are these. The offender was close to adulthood when he committed these offences. One of them, the murder of Ms Vrzina, has seriously affected the parents and sisters of Ms Vrzina. The offender planned and perpetrated a public execution. Weight must be given to general deterrence in imposing sentence for such offences. 

58Accordingly, I authorise the publication and broadcasting of the name of the offender. 

59Moustapha Dib for wounding Ahmed Banat with intent to murder him I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 15 years which will be taken to have commenced on 9 July 2011 and which will expire on 8 July 2026. The balance of the term of your sentence will be 5 years, expiring on 8 July 2031. 

60For the murder of Anita Vrzina I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 25 years which will commence on 9 July 2016 and expire on 8 July 2041. The balance of the term of your sentence will be 10 years, expiring on 8 July 2051. 

61The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 8 July 2041.

		23 November 2012",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760523,R v Booth [2012] NSWSC 1424,"SENTENCE

1The offender, Martin John Booth, pleaded guilty on 25 July 2012 to manslaughter in full discharge of an indictment alleging that he murdered James Nolan on 19 March 2011. The plea was accepted by the Crown on the basis of excessive self defence. A further five offences (possess unregistered firearm, possess shortened firearm, possess prohibited drug, possess ammunition without a licence or permit and not keep firearm safely) on a Form 1 are to be taken into account when the sentence for the manslaughter offence is imposed.

2Manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The offence has often been described in terms of its protean nature, meaning that the sentences imposed are as varied as the circumstances capable of qualifying at law as manslaughter. The fact that the offender took the life of another young man, with whom he had no direct dispute, by discharging a sawn off shotgun at close range arouses in most members of our community a sense of horror and an expectation that the offender will be severely punished. That sense of horror and that particular expectation is much greater on the part of the victim's immediate family. That is entirely understandable. However, it is an expectation that does not necessarily take account of the circumstances surrounding the offence, the impact of those surrounding circumstances on the offender's state of mind and the wide range of factors that I am bound by law to take into account according to sentencing practice in this state. 

3These reasons in no way diminish the value of the victim's life as a son, brother, father and friend, nor do they seek to attribute responsibility for the offence to the victim. They are primarily concerned with an assessment of the offender's criminality and the extent to which his personal circumstances affect the sentence that might otherwise be imposed. The offender's criminality can only be assessed in the context of what he perceived to be a threat of violence towards him from the victim, albeit the offender's response to that threat was excessive in all the circumstances. 

4The events giving rise to the offence are sadly typical of a drug culture involving the abuse of amphetamines which appears prevalent in Newcastle. Between 18 and 19 March 2011, a series of SMS messages were sent and received between phones linked to the offender and his partner, Sabina Pinkovai, on the one hand and the sister of the victim on the other. The messages related to the delivery of amphetamines or money owed for the purchase of that drug as between the offender and Ms Nolan. 

5In the early hours of 19 March 2011, Ms Pincovai went to Ms Nolan's unit in Toronto. A number of other persons were present including Shane Fields, a friend of Ms Nolan's. A dispute erupted between Ms Pincovai and Ms Nolan and others, resulting in Ms Pincovai attempting to leave the premises. She had trouble starting her car and contacted the offender. The offender arrived at the premises with another male. According to the statement of facts, the offender was armed with a weapon that he was waving about and pointing at people. The offender gave evidence that he went to the premises primarily to assist Ms Pincovai, and that he obtained a bat from his car in response to a threat of violence from Mr Fields. Mr Fields and the offender assaulted each other, although the offender got the better of the fight and Mr Fields was hospitalised with minor injuries.

6At about 6am, according to his evidence, the offender went to the manhole in the kitchen ceiling and recovered a shortened firearm, which he placed against the door jam at the front door. He said that he did so in response to a death threat he received from Ms Nolan after returning to his home. I do not accept his evidence to the effect that he was unaware whether the firearm was loaded. That evidence is inconsistent with an acknowledgment that he was pleading guilty to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self defence. That plea brings with it an acceptance on the part of the offender that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm or death to the victim by the discharge of the firearm, but that his response to the perceived threat was excessive in all the circumstances. Moreover, given the offender's evidence to the effect that death threats were made in the course of the communications from Ms Nolan and others, it is inherently unlikely that the offender would seek to protect himself with a firearm in ignorance of whether it was loaded.

7Further SMS messages were sent from a phone registered to Ms Pincovai to Ms Nolan, and from the offender to Ms Nolan, indicating that the offender would be pursuing Ms Nolan for what she owed him. Ms Nolan replied to the effect that she did not intend to honour the debt. The offender replied ""don't start that shit again. You got all the last of it three days ago. Before you tell anyone to go fuck themselves, you did note I was not alone."" This was apparently a reference to the presence of a large Maori man in the offender's company at Ms Nolan's home earlier that day.

8At about 11:30 am on 19 March 2011, James Nolan arrived at the premises where the earlier assault had taken place. He spoke with a friend of Ms Nolan's and told her that he intended to ""go over and see Boothy and see what the fuck's going on."" The victim was told that the offender had a gun and warned him not to go there. The victim replied ""I know he's got a gun but if he tries to start on me, I'll take out his dog. You know how much he loves her.""

9Pat Nolan, the victim's brother, first went to the offender's house about midday on 19 March 2011. He went there to purchase amphetamines. He injected the drug whilst he was at the offender's home. The offender mentioned that there was a ""feud"" with Ms Nolan and said that ""he had been to Jenny's place that morning and some bullshit happened over drugs"". The offender told Pat Nolan that there had been a flight and that he was armed with an extendable baton, not a gun.

10After leaving the offender's home, Pat Nolan spoke to his brother, the victim, about the events of that morning. The victim said that he believed the offender had been armed when he arrived at the home earlier that day. Pat Nolan told his brother that the offender had denied being armed. He suggested a meeting with the offender so that the victim might hear his version of the events. The victim indicated he was willing to attend a meeting and he arranged to meet his brother at a friend's home later that day in order to go to the offender's home together.

11Sometime later, Pat Nolan returned to the offender's house to swap a set of wheels for a quantity of amphetamines. Pat Nolan again spoke to the offender about the events of that morning. The offender told Pat Nolan that ""Jimmy was coming to bash him"". Pat Nolan said he would speak to his brother and may return later that evening. 

12On this occasion a friend of the offender, Mr Browning, was present at the offender's home. He heard Pat Nolan say ""there's going to be trouble if you stop, if you stop like you're doing, like if you're not."" After Pat Nolan left, the offender told Mr Browning about the assault that morning. The offender said that ""Jimmy was coming back to sort him out what happened from this morning"". Before Mr Browning left the premises, the offender received a phone call which appeared to unsettle the offender. The offender said ""I can't believe what's happening - he reckoned that Jim and another bloke apparently was coming over."" Later that evening, Mr Browning saw the offender answering text messages and phone calls on his mobile. He saw that the offender was becoming angry and that the offender said during one conversation ""just wake up to yourself"" and ""youse are not welcome here"". After one of these conversations the offender told Mr Browning ""Jimmy and one of his mates was on his way.""

13Shortly after 8 pm and again at about 8:30 pm, Pat Nolan rang the offender to tell him that he and his brother were on their way to the offender's home. When they arrived, Pat Nolan went to the house and spoke with the offender. He asked whether the offender wanted to come out and see the victim or whether the victim was to come in to see the offender. There were other persons at the house at this time. The offender said that he would get rid of the visitors and that they should return in 10 minutes.

14At 8:44 pm, Pat Nolan rang the offender to tell him that they were on their way back. On this occasion Pat Nolan and the victim got out of the car and went to the front door. The screen door was open although the wooden door to the premises was closed. Pat Nolan knocked on the door and the offender called from inside ""who's with you?"" Pat Nolan replied ""me brother"" whereupon the offender opened the door a short way.

15According to a statement made by Pat Nolan during a demonstration to police at the offender's home, almost as soon as the offender opened the door, his brother came past him saying something like ""oh you're home you dog"". The offender moved back and to his right as the victim attempted to enter the premises. At that time, the victim was armed with a baton which was attached to his wrist by a strap. The offender was holding the shortened firearm at the side of his body, apparently covered with a cloth. The offender raised the firearm and deliberately discharged it at the victim. The projectile struck the victim in the lower chest region causing almost instantaneous death. The muzzle of the shot gun was between 50 cm to 1 m from the victim when fired. It would appear from a head wound suffered by the offender that the victim had succeeded in striking a blow to the offender before the firearm was discharged.

16Mr Browning provided a statement indicating that Pat Nolan came to the offender's home on three occasions. On the first occasion, Pat Nolan told the offender ""Jim is on his way so the best thing is for us not to be here"" and ""so prepare to lock up or go out - he is very angry with you ... he is going to deal with you."" The offender told Mr Browning ""there is trouble coming"". Mr Browning says that on the second occasion, Pat Nolan spoke to Ms Pincovai through the closed door, telling her to keep the door locked, ""just say you're not at home, I'll say Martin has gone out"" and ""I'll be back in an hour"". Mr Browning says that the offender was in the kitchen cooking at this time and that Ms Pincovai went and spoke with him. Mr Browning says that on the third occasion, approximately 5 min later, the offender went from the kitchen to the timber door, opened it and said ""what are you doing here?"" 

17Mr Browning gave an account of the actual confrontation between the offender and the victim which is considered unreliable in certain respects and which needs no further elucidation here.

18The offender was arrested on 21 March 2011 in a car park adjacent to a shopping centre. According to his evidence, he was in the process of consulting a solicitor with a view to surrendering himself to police. At the time of his arrest, the offender said ""it was self-defence, they threatened my missus"". The offender later told members of his family ""I've got nothing to worry about, I did what I had to do, they ran in on me"".

19The offender's home was searched and two firearms, a quantity of ammunition and a small quantity of cannabis were found. These are the subject of the Form 1 offences.

The Objective Gravity of the Offence

20There are a number of features of the offence that contribute to an assessment of its objective gravity. The offender, on his own acknowledgement, had no dispute with the victim. The victim's brother was attempting to act as peacemaker, to the knowledge of the offender. Moreover, the offender had ample notice that the victim and his brother were coming to his home, yet he chose to confront them with a deadly weapon. The weapon was loaded and at the ready near the front door, where it had been placed early that day. The offender was armed when he opened the door, notwithstanding that he had no objective basis for inferring that his visitors were intent on killing him. Given the proximity of the offender to the victim and the nature of the firearm, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the victim. 

21The offender's senior counsel submitted that the discharge of the gun was not a pre-emptive strike and that there was an element of provocation offered to the offender, in that the victim was armed with a baton and was in the act of assaulting the offender when the firearm was discharged. That submission may be accepted if one has regard only to the very short period of time between the offender opening the door and the fatal shot. However, the submission has less merit when account is taken of the whole of the offender's conduct that day. There are many features of this offence that distinguish it from those in R v Cook [2012] NSWSC 480 upon which the offender's counsel placed some reliance.

22I accept that the actual confrontation between the offender and the victim was extremely brief and that it left the offender no time for calm reflection in the face of a sudden and imminent assault. It remains true to say that the killing would in all likelihood not have occurred, but for the offender's resort to the use of a firearm. 

23Objectively, it was a wholly disproportionate and excessive response to the threat that was actually offered. There is no basis in the agreed statement of facts for a finding that the offender received death threats from members of the Nolan family. I accept that the offender may have interpreted some of the communications from members of the Nolan family as death threats, but I do not accept that such threats were actually uttered. The SMS messages recovered from the various phones indicate that the offender also made veiled threats towards the Nolans, to the effect that they would be pursued by the offender in order to extract what they owed him, even if that involved the application of force. The height of the explicit threats received by the offender was threats of physical assault, and the offender himself understood that the victim was coming over ""to bash him"".

24I have sought to stress thus far that this assessment is undertaken objectively, that is, without regard to factors personal to the offender. On this basis, the offence is a serious case of manslaughter, although I would not place it in the ""worst case"" category. The penalty must also reflect the criminality inherent in the offences on the Form 1.

25That said, there are subjective factors that bear upon the moral culpability of the offender and therefore upon the sentence to be imposed. 

26Clearly, the dispute escalated out of all proportion to its origins. The tendency to resort to threats of violence and to actual violence whenever drugs, particularly amphetamines, are at the centre of a disagreement is a regrettable feature of matters coming before the courts of this state. The fact that the offender was a user, and apparently a supplier, of amphetamines made him susceptible to ill-considered and irrational responses to the threats he received, and which he may have misinterpreted. That in no way excuses his behaviour, but it does go some way towards explaining it. 

27It is also relevant to an assessment of his moral culpability that he had injected two points of ""ice"" approximately 2 hours before the victim's arrival at his home. The offender's father in his evidence described the offender's general behaviour since 2006 in terms that suggested the offender was pervasively paranoid. The offender's heavy use of amphetamines since the death of his younger brother in 2001 no doubt contributed significantly to this state of mind. 

28Whilst these are matters that I take into account, they cannot in my view ameliorate the sentence otherwise appropriate to the offence by more than a modest amount. The fact remains that the offender chose a drug abusing lifestyle as a way of dealing with the pain of his brother's death and the guilt that he felt over the last interaction he had with his brother. The offender was 27 years of age when his brother died in a car accident. Whilst I accept that was a traumatic event which triggered clinical depression, the offender was an adult who consciously embarked upon sustained drug taking. Dr Westmore's report indicates that the offender was diagnosed with cannabis and amphetamine dependence by the Hunter New England Mental Health Service within 6 months of his brother's death. The offender also claims to have seen a psychologist over the last 10 years on about 20 occasions but the offender does not appear to have benefited from any medical intervention. 

The Offender's Background.

29The offender is presently 38 years of age. His parents separated when he was five or six years of age. He has an older sister and a younger half brother, the product of his mother's second relationship. He lived with his mother following his parent's separation and did not see his father for several years. He resumed regular contact with his father in about 2006.

30He completed his secondary schooling to year 10, and began working as a rigger in the building industry until his brother's death in 2001. Immediately prior to his brother leaving the family home and crashing his car, the offender and his brother had an argument, in the course of which the offender said ""I wish you were dead"". The offender apparently heard of the car accident and went to the scene to investigate. He witnessed his brother's death. This appears to be the genesis of a long-standing depression and occasional drug induced psychosis. He still becomes tearful on speaking of his brother's death.

31The offender has an 11-year-old daughter, the product of one of three relationships. He has contact with his daughter and with her mother, who remains supportive of him.

32The offender has been unemployed since his brother's death and has made no efforts to secure gainful employment. He has supported himself on a disability pension. Since entering custody, he has expressed a wish to work within his father's courier business on his release. The offender reportedly has a tumour on his left ankle which is yet to be treated.

33The offender has a criminal history commencing in 1995 including convictions for assault, malicious damage and motor vehicle offences. These are of a summary nature and were dealt with by way of fines or recognisances. In September 2003, November 2005 and October 2009 the offender was fined or placed on 12 month good behaviour bonds for offences of possess a prohibited drug. In November 2005 the offender was convicted of possessing ammunition without holding a licence or permit and in November 2009 the offender was convicted of four counts of possess or use a prohibited weapon without a permit. These offences were also dealt with by way of fine or good behaviour bond. Accordingly, this is the offender's first time in custody.

34The offender placed himself on protection because of threats that he received through members and associates of the victim's family. The offender's counsel submitted that the very restricted access to programs and facilities afforded by the offender's protection status hampered the offender's rehabilitation whilst in custody. It was not submitted that the head sentence itself ought be reduced to reflect this factor, rather it was submitted that it was a circumstance warranting the alteration of the usual statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term. I am prepared to allow a slight reduction in the non-parole period to allow for this factor, and on the basis that this is his first custodial sentence which will necessarily place the offender at some disadvantage in terms of his employment prospects, given his current age and limited work experience.

35I accept that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. He has demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition both in the course of his evidence and through the contents of a letter that was tendered to the Court. If the offender makes good his promise to reject his lifestyle to date it is unlikely that he will re-offend. However, that very much depends on the strength of the offender's resolve on his release to the community. He will require a measure of supervision and assistance to achieve that aim.

36The plea of guilty was entered on the date fixed for trial. The offender's counsel maintained that the plea was only entered after he came into possession of Crown material that he had not seen until the eve of the trial. Be that as it may, the Court of Criminal Appeal has made abundantly clear that generally speaking the discount for the plea of guilty is assessed by reference to the utilitarian value of the plea, regardless of the reasons for the timing of the plea. In my view, a discount of 10% is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.

37Taking all of these matters into account, I impose the following sentence.

(1)Martin John Booth, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter.

(2)I impose a non parole period of 6 years, to date from 21 March 2011, expiring 20 March 2017. The balance of term is 3 years, expiring 20 March 2020. You are eligible for release on 21 March 2017.

(3)I have taken into account the offences on the Form 1 when imposing this sentence and I dismiss two charges, namely possess barrel for firearm with licence and receive stolen property.

		27 November 2012",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760524,R v Kevin Gall; R v Bruce Gall (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 1432,"Judgment

1On 14 September 2012, Kevin Gall was convicted after trial by jury of two offences:

(a)the murder of Neil Green (the deceased); and

(b)discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Michael Fox.

2On the first day of the trial, Kevin Gall pleaded guilty to:

(a)two counts of unauthorised possession on 6 May 2010 of a prohibited firearm, being a silver .32 automatic calibre Fabrique Nationale self-loading pistol and a black 9mm calibre submachine gun;

(b)two counts of unauthorised possession on 6 May 2010 of a prohibited weapon, being a black silencer and a magazine holding eleven 9 mm Federal cartridges; and

(c)influencing Martin Lapich on 19 June 2010 to give a false account to police and destroy evidence, his mobile phone, with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice.

3Bruce Gall was convicted after trial by jury of being an accessory after the fact to murder.

4On the first day of the trial, Bruce Gall pleaded guilty to:

(a)one count of unauthorised possession on 16 November 2010 of a prohibited firearm, being a .38 Smith & Wesson special calibre 6 chamber revolver; and

(b)influencing Martin Lapich on 19 June 2010 to give a false account to police with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice.

The facts

5As sentencing judge, I may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the offender unless the facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt, but if there are circumstances which I propose to take into account in favour of the offender it is sufficient that they be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

The association between the offenders and the deceased

6The deceased and Kevin Gall had, in the past, been on good terms. They had met in 2004 or 2005 through Peter Van Straalen, who owned P & L Cycles at Toongabbie Road. The deceased knew Kevin Gall to have skills as a machinist using computerised equipment which could be used to make metal parts. From that time on until they fell out, the deceased was a regular visitor to 8 Wiltona Place, which was not only Bruce Gall's home, but also the workshop from which Bruce and Kevin Gall worked.

7The deceased brought other motorcycle enthusiasts to Wiltona Place and Kevin Gall would do work on their motor bikes. As a result of this association the deceased and Kevin Gall became friends. They would also socialise together: every two weeks or so they went to nightclubs and also went on long rides together, sometimes in the countryside past Mudgee.

8According to Kevin Gall, in about 2006, the deceased approached him with another friend, Tim Donnan, to repair a firearm, a Norinco .45. He repaired the weapon and test fired it into the vacant lot at 10 Wiltona Place. He did not charge the deceased or Mr Donnan any money for doing the repair because they were ""mates"" of his. They also asked Kevin Gall to repair a Mac 10 pistol but he was unable to repair it. Later, the deceased asked Kevin Gall to increase the capacity of certain machine pistols but he was unable to do so.

9Kevin Gall also gave evidence that the deceased then asked him to hold one of the pistols along with ammunition and a silencer. Kevin Gall agreed to do so.

10I do not accept Kevin Gall's evidence of the provenance of these guns or his version as to how they came to be in his possession, although for reasons to which I will come, I accept that Kevin had some firearms which belonged to the deceased.

The drug charges against the deceased

11The relationship between Kevin Gall and the deceased soured on 1 April 2008 when the deceased was driving a hire car in which Kevin Gall was a passenger. The previous evening, the deceased and Kevin Gall had occupied a hotel room with at least one prostitute. Drugs had been used. Afterwards, the drugs were put in the boot of the hire car. The car was stopped for speeding and searched. Various prohibited items were found, including drugs. Both the deceased and Kevin Gall were arrested, but only the deceased was charged. Thereafter the deceased and Kevin Gall saw each other less frequently. 

12At about this time, the deceased was involved in a serious car accident, as a result of which he spent time in an intensive care unit. The long-term effects of his injuries were that he lost both fitness and agility and became depressed. Mr Donnan was also involved in the accident. The deceased had not worked since the accident and was on a disability pension. He drove an old Commodore as well as a motorbike and he lived in a three-storey town house in Northmead. 

13Following these events, the deceased, together with two men named Adrian and Lionel who were associated with a motorcycle club known as the Nomads Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, met with Kevin Gall at 8 Wiltona Place. The deceased also belonged to the Nomads. The three men asked Kevin Gall to go to the deceased's solicitor's office to swear an affidavit with a view to the possession charges against the deceased being dropped. Kevin Gall refused go to the solicitor's office, although he had never seen any draft of the affidavit which he was expected to swear.

14The hearing of the charges against the deceased was listed for trial in the District Court at Parramatta on Monday 29 March 2010, but it was adjourned to a date in August, on the deceased's application. On that day, the deceased's solicitor asked the police whether Kevin Gall's DNA was on file. He told the police, for the first time, that the deceased's defence would be that there was another person's DNA on the prohibited drugs and he believed that it was Kevin Gall's DNA. 

15I do not consider that this issue was of particular importance to the events of Friday 16 April 2010 except in so far that it showed that the friendship between the deceased and Kevin Gall had markedly deteriorated by that time. In particular, I am not satisfied that the deceased went to 8 Wiltona Place with a view to inclining Kevin Gall to swear an affidavit to assist him to defend the criminal charge.

Previous attempts to retrieve the deceased's property from Kevin Gall

16From early 2010, the deceased made it known that he wanted to retrieve certain property from Kevin Gall. The evidence is not sufficient to identify the property.

17The people with whom the deceased had spoken about retrieving his property included Martin Lapich, who moved in circles which included the deceased; Mr Van Straalen; Garth Jones who was a good friend of the deceased and also worked at Mr Van Straalen's business premises; and Michael Fox, a friend of the deceased who had met Kevin Gall and his half-brother Troy Ryan on trail bike rides when Kevin Gall and the deceased were still on good terms. Mr Fox had the nickname ""the soldier"" because he had spent some time in the Australian Army.

18In January or February 2010, Mr Lapich spoke to the deceased who asked him whether he had seen Kevin Gall lately. Mr Lapich said, ""No, why?"" The deceased said, ""He has something of mine. I want it back. Tell him to ring me."" A couple of weeks later Mr Lapich spoke to Kevin Gall at 8 Wiltona Place and said, ""Neil wants you to ring him"", to which Kevin Gall said, ""I don't want to talk to the cunt."" 

19In early 2010, Mr Van Straalen visited 8 Wiltona Place and asked Kevin Gall for the deceased's belongings but he refused to return them. On another occasion, in January 2010, a man called Tori Nati went to 8 Wiltona Place to tell Kevin Gall that the deceased wanted to talk to him.

20When Mr Fox heard about the dispute, he was concerned that the deceased would be in danger if he went to 8 Wiltona Place by himself. Accordingly, he offered to go to 8 Wiltona Place himself to retrieve the deceased's property.

21Mr Fox, who was not concerned to know the nature of the property, as long as it was not drugs, suggested to the deceased that they use the euphemism ""bike parts and manuals"" when referring to the property.

22Although Mr Fox knew that Kevin Gall had refused to swear an affidavit to help the deceased with respect to the drug charges, he did not believe that matter to have any bearing on the dispute about the recovery of the property. Mr Fox's view was shared by Mr Van Straalen.

23Mr Fox visited 8 Wiltona Place twice before Friday 16 April 2010. On the first occasion there appeared to be no one home when he knocked on the front door. He returned a couple of days later and heard the blinds klink in the upstairs window, which was open. Mr Fox started talking and Bruce Gall responded. Mr Fox asked if Kevin or Troy were at home and Bruce said no. Mr Fox explained that Kevin had property of the deceased's and suggested that Bruce obtain the property, which he would then collect on the deceased's behalf. Bruce Gall said he knew nothing about it. Before Mr Fox left, he told Bruce that he would leave a business card in the letterbox and asked Bruce to call once he had spoken to Kevin and Troy.

24A few days later Mr Fox rang the home phone number for 8 Wiltona Place and spoke to someone who identified himself as Bruce, who said: ""The boys said to tell you, 'to get fucked'"".

25About three days later, the deceased suggested to Mr Fox that the two of them go around to 8 Wiltona Place to speak to Kevin Gall or Troy Ryan about the return of the property. At that time, Mr Fox was not aware of the previous visits made by Mr Van Straalen and Mr Nati.

Friday 16 April 2010

26At about lunchtime on Friday 16 April 2010, Mr Fox drove in his blue Ford Laser to Westmead to collect the deceased. He asked the deceased whether he was ""carrying""; in other words, whether he was armed. The deceased said that he was not. Mr Fox's view about guns was:

""A gun's a gun. It will kill you. If you carry them, you'll get shot.""

27When Mr Fox and the deceased arrived at 8 Wiltona Place, they drove through the gate and around to the back of the property. Mr Fox left the keys to the car in the ignition. He also left his passport, his wallet and his mobile phone in the car.

28One of the men said to Bruce Gall in a raised voice:

""Where the fuck is your son? We want him here now. Ring him on the phone. Get the cunt here now.""

29The deceased asked Bruce Gall if there were guns lying around and he said no. Mr Fox said to Bruce Gall: ""Don't look to me for trouble"" and pulled up his shirt to show him that he was not armed. 

30Bruce Gall asked the deceased what the property was and the deceased said ""two and a half"". Bruce Gall then asked whether it was two and a half thousand and the deceased said, ""No, it was two and a half million."" The sum of money involved came as a surprise to Mr Fox. On the basis of Mr Fox's evidence that the deceased also mentioned a couple of firearms in connection with his property, I accept that Kevin Gall was in possession of firearms which belonged to the deceased.

31Bruce Gall went inside a building referred to as ""the office"" and rang Kevin. By chance Mr Lapich was in the office. By prior arrangement, Mr Lapich had caught the train from Gosford that morning in the hope of obtaining ""bike work"" from either Kevin Gall or Mr Ryan. Some time after, Mr Lapich arrived, he either rang or sent a text to Kevin to let him know that he was waiting for him there. 

32When Bruce Gall came out of the office he told the deceased and Mr Fox that he had spoken to Kevin and that he was coming. 

33Mr Lapich, who was aware of the conflict between the deceased and Kevin Gall, was reluctant to remain on the scene. The deceased offered to drive him to P & L Cycles in the Ford Laser. Mr Fox remained with Bruce Gall at 8 Wiltona Place. At some stage after he had returned from dropping off Mr Lapich, the deceased motioned to Mr Fox that Kevin Gall might come back armed.

34Mr Lapich was obviously rattled by these events. Mr Jones, who was at P & L Cycles at the time, overheard Mr Lapich talking on the telephone about who was at 8 Wiltona Place, and told him not to talk about such matters on the phone. Mr Jones and Mr Fox shared what appears to have been a general understanding: that it was not appropriate to discuss matters concerning bikies. Mr Lapich told Mr Jones that: ""some other bloke is around there with Neil and they're blowing up at the old boy"". Mr Jones drove Mr Lapich to a nearby railway station so that he could return home to Gosford.

35At 12.59 pm Kevin Gall booked a taxi from his home at Stanhope Gardens to 8 Wiltona Place, which arrived to collect him at 1.09 pm. He took a .45 gun in his grey satchel with him, as had been his invariable practice at least since he had been asked to swear an affidavit to assist the deceased in his defence of the possession charges. When Kevin Gall was in the taxi, he received a text message from Mr Lapich saying: ""Don't come Neil here."" Instead of asking the taxi to take him to the door of 8 Wiltona Place, Kevin Gall requested that the taxi driver take him to the intersection of Targa Road and Toongabbie Road. He arrived at that intersection at 1.28 pm.

36Kevin Gall then made his way on foot to 8 Wiltona Place. He ran the length of a back lane at the rear of the workshop, then across the paddock at the neighbouring vacant lot at 10 Wiltona Place and came up beside the fence with 8 Wiltona Place.

37Meanwhile, Bruce Gall, the deceased and Mr Fox were outside the office at the back of 8 Wiltona Place. Kevin Gall, who by that time had positioned himself on the opposite side the fence near where the other men were standing, saw Bruce run back towards the office. Kevin then appeared over the fence with his gun drawn. He shot the deceased at close range at least three times, intending to kill him. The deceased fell after the first shot.

38Kevin Gall did not shoot the deceased to defend or protect his father. Rather, he took the opportunity which the deceased's presence at 8 Wiltona Place afforded to kill the deceased so that he would not have to relinquish the deceased's property, whatever it might have been.

39As soon as Kevin Gall had shot the deceased, he trained the gun on Mr Fox and began firing in his direction. Mr Fox ran down into the corner of the block and sought shelter behind a trailer. At this point the gun which Kevin Gall was using ceased firing, either because it had a malfunction or because it had run out of ammunition. In this intervening period, Mr Fox leapt over the fence and ran as fast as he could. Kevin Gall then shot at him again, intending to cause him grievous bodily harm.

40Kevin Gall then removed the deceased's body from the floor of the carport and disposed of it. 

41Later that day, Bruce Gall assisted his son to escape detection by hosing away the deceased's blood from the concrete floor with a high-pressure hose. 

Subsequent events

42Within a day or so of killing the deceased, Kevin Gall changed the number plates of the Ford Laser which Mr Fox had driven to 8 Wiltona Place with the deceased on 16 April 2010. He also, at some stage, repainted it. Both acts were done with the intention of disguising the identity of the vehicle so that it could not be tested for DNA. He later delivered it to Mr Van Straalen's workshop to be disposed of.

43Either on Friday 16 April 2010, or on the weekend of 17 and 18 April 2010, the hard drive of the CCTV cameras at 8 Wiltona Place was removed. I do not accept that the CCTV cameras operated only at night-time. The removal of the hard drive had the effect that a filmed record of what had occurred on 16 April 2010 was no longer available and could not, accordingly, be seized by police.

44On 23 April 2010, Kevin Gall's residence at Stanhope Gardens was ""fire bombed"". Kevin Gall was not at home at the time, but his girlfriend was. She escaped without serious injury. Kevin Gall understood this to be an act of reprisal for his killing of the deceased and assumed that the Nomads had been responsible for the ""fire bombing"".

45On 6 and 7 May 2010, police executed a search warrant at 8 Wiltona Place. Kevin Gall possessed a silver .32 automatic calibre Fabrique Nationale self-loading pistol, a black 9mm calibre submachine gun, a black silencer and a magazine holding eleven 9 mm Federal cartridges. According to Kevin Gall, none of these weapons had been used to shoot either the deceased or Mr Fox, the relevant weapon having been stripped and destroyed soon after the offences had been committed.

46Kevin Gall gave evidence that the sub-machine gun and the black silencer belonged to the deceased and that he was ""holding on to"" the weapons for him. I do not accept this evidence since I am not satisfied that these weapons were the weapons that belonged to the deceased.

47On 19 June 2010, there was a discussion between Bruce Gall, Kevin Gall, Mr Lapich and Mr Van Straalen which was recorded by police on a listening device. In the course of the discussion, Kevin Gall spoke to Mr Lapich to influence him to give a false account to police about his whereabouts on 16 April 2010 and to destroy his mobile phone so that the text messages he had sent to Kevin Gall on that day would never be recovered. Bruce also encouraged Mr Lapich to give a false version of his whereabouts on the day.

48On 16 November 2010, a further search warrant was executed at 8 Wiltona Place. In the process of executing the search warrant, Bruce Gall escorted police into the office where, in response to questioning, he indicated the whereabouts of a six round .38 calibre revolver, to the unauthorised possession of which he has pleaded guilty. The revolver was wrapped in a light-brown cloth on top of the table in the middle of the office. Police seized the revolver and found it to be loaded with six .38 calibre rounds.

49On 16 November 2010, Kevin and Bruce Gall were arrested and charged. Kevin Gall has been in custody since. Bruce Gall was released on conditional bail on 22 September 2011, having spent the intervening period in custody. In structuring the sentences for the two offenders I take into account time already served.

50On 20 April 2011, Kevin Gall, through his then solicitor, provided a handwritten statement to police in which he said that he had shot the deceased and killed him in order to defend his father from attack. He made no mention in the statement of shooting at, or in the direction of, Mr Fox. He said that he had taken the deceased's body into the bush to bury it. He said that he destroyed the equipment used to bury the deceased and also the handgun with which he had killed him.

51Kevin Gall's statement concluded:

""I am willing to accompany police with my lawyers to where Neil Green is buried.""

52Kevin Gall accompanied police to the State Forest at Nabiac on two occasions. Notwithstanding thorough searches and the assistance of trained dogs, the deceased's body was never found.

53I do not accept Kevin Gall's account of the manner of the disposal of the deceased's body, or its location.

Subjective circumstances

54Kevin Gall did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. The statements as to his subjective circumstances in his counsel's written submissions are unsupported by evidence and untested.

55He is now 34 years old, having been born on 3 June 1978. At the time of the offending he was 32; he was charged when he was 33. His father, the co-offender is aged 62, and his mother is aged 60 years. He is one of two children.

56Kevin Gall attended high school, where he was interested in metalwork and tech-drawing and other engineering focused subjects. In 1994, he completed his High School Certificate and commenced an apprenticeship. In 1998, Kevin Gall completed his apprenticeship and achieved a TAFE certificate in Mechanical Engineering after completing a 4 year course.

57Kevin Gall has no significant or related prior criminal convictions and has never previously served a custodial sentence.

58Bruce Gall neither gave evidence at the trial, nor at the sentence hearing. The facts as to Bruce Gall's subjective circumstances which are set out below are substantially derived from the pre-sentence report dated 26 October 2012. Mr Gall also relied on a report of a psychologist, Bradley Jones, dated 1 October 2012. However the history given to Mr Jones was not established and accordingly the opinions expressed are without foundation in the evidence: Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; 108 CLR 642; R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358, at [25] per Whealy J, Ipp JA and Davidson AJ agreeing.

59Bruce Gall was born on 3 August 1951, the younger of two siblings. His mother abused alcohol and was violent. She left the family home when Bruce was about 12. He was relieved and had little further contact with her. He did not attend her funeral. His father remarried but he was rejected by his stepmother and left the family home when he was about 17. 

60Bruce Gall left school at 15 and commenced an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. He worked with his father who owned an engineering company but when his father died that company ceased operating, Mr Gall having already started his own business.

61Bruce Gall married in 1970 and has two sons, one of who is the co-offender Kevin Gall. Although Bruce and his former wife separated in 1999 and divorced in 2000, they remain on good terms. He presently resides with his former wife, who continues to provide him with support and friendship.

62Bruce Gall has a prior criminal record but this is of little moment since the most recent offence, of which he was convicted prior to the subject offences, occurred in 1990. He was fined for that offence and was subjected to a community service order.

Factors relevant to sentence

63I turn to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). In dealing with each of the offenders I take into account the purposes of sentencing that are set out in s 3A and the provisions of s 21A of the Act. The latter section requires the Court to take into account both the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2) and the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3) that are relevant and known to the Court, together with any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence.

Kevin Gall

Murder

64I turn first to the conviction of Kevin Gall for murder. The offence of murder carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The applicable standard non-parole period (SNPP) is 20 years. The SNPP represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness whereas the maximum sentence is to be given only in the most severe of cases. The SNPP and the maximum sentence are legislative guideposts that inform the exercise of sentencing discretion: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, at [27].

65Section 61(1) of the Act provides that a court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. The Crown, in my view correctly, did not contend that this murder is in the category of offences to which s 61(1) applies.

66The death of the deceased was brought about by Kevin Gall's desire to rid himself of an unwanted adversary. The full extent of the basis of his hostility to the deceased was not revealed in the evidence. The jury's verdict shows that it rejected the proposition that Kevin Gall had killed the deceased to defend or protect his father. The unlawful and intentional taking of a human life is a heinous crime.

67I consider the offence committed by Kevin Gall to be in the middle of the range of seriousness of offences of murder. 

68The aggravating factors include, as referred to above, that Kevin Gall disposed of the body of the deceased, which was never found and could therefore never be examined and never appropriately put to rest. I do not accept Kevin Gall's submission that his disposal of the body of the deceased was more motivated by fear of retribution by the Nomads than investigation by the police. Kevin Gall must, in my view, have appreciated that it was inevitable that Mr Fox would inform the Nomads that Kevin Gall had shot the deceased.

69The Crown submitted that it was an aggravating factor to be taken into account under s 21A(2)(e) of the Act that Kevin Gall committed the murder and the intentional shooting at Mr Fox in company with his father. I do not accept this submission since I consider that Bruce Gall's presence was merely incidental to what occurred. 

70The Crown also submitted that it was an aggravating factor to be taken into account under s 21A(2)(n) of the Act that the offence of murder was part of a planned criminal activity. I accept that the offence was planned in the sense that Kevin Gall chose to take an unobtrusive path to 8 Wiltona Place such that his arrival would not easily be detected by Mr Fox or the deceased. He took the gun out of the satchel in which he had carried it for months, since the disintegration of his friendship with the deceased. He had it in his hand, ready to be fired as he approached the fence between the vacant lot and 8 Wiltona Place. To that extent the offence was planned, albeit that the period of planning was relatively short.

71The Crown accepted, as do I, that it was a mitigating factor to be taken into account under s 21A(3)(c) of the Act that the offence was provoked by the victim. The deceased's act in going to 8 Wiltona Place, with Mr Fox, and demanding Kevin Gall's presence there amounted to significant provocation since it was designed to, and did, bring matters to a head. Mr Fox and the deceased spoke to Bruce Gall in tones which were both aggressive and confrontational. 

72The Crown also accepted, as do I, that I should take into account as a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(h) of the Act that Kevin Gall has good prospects of rehabilitation and, as a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(e), that his prior criminal record was of little consequence and does not include any periods of imprisonment, apart from the time spent in custody in relation to the offence of murder in respect of which he is to be sentenced.

73Kevin Gall contended that it was a mitigating factor to be taken into account under s 21A(3)(f) that he was a person of good character. In assessing whether Kevin Gall was a person of good character, I am obliged to set aside the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, and I do so.

74Kevin Gall relied on references from his mother, his aunt and two associates. The people referred to above are likely, because of their relationship with the offender, to be partial to him. There is no evidence that any of these persons was acquainted with the fact that Kevin Gall was in possession of illegal firearms or that for some months he invariably carried a loaded firearm on his person in his satchel. On his own evidence, Kevin Gall was involved in manufacturing illegal firearms in his own workshop and repairing gun parts for members of the Nomads.

75I accept that Kevin Gall had some good personal qualities which showed themselves when he was in the company of those who have given references. However I am not satisfied that Kevin Gall was a person of good character.

76Kevin Gall contended that it was a mitigating factor to be taken into account under s 21A(3)(i) that he had shown remorse. In support of his contention he relied on a letter addressed to me dated 30 October 2012 in which he wrote, in part:

""I can only imagine what kind of pain my actions have caused Neil's family and although I know I can never change what took place, from the bottom of my heart I am so very sorry.""

77Although the Crown did not submit that I should reject the letter, it contended that I ought give it little or no weight because it had not been, and could not be, tested. I do not consider that any weight should be given to this statement because of its provenance, its timing and the circumstance that its author was not prepared to give sworn evidence to the effect of its contents: R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358 at [25], per Whealy J, Ipp JA and Davidson AJ agreeing. I am not satisfied that Kevin Gall has shown remorse. His undoubted regret that things have turned out as they have does not amount to remorse and is not a mitigating factor.

78Had I set a separate sentence for murder, I would have set the non-parole period at 20 years. The non-parole period which is provided for in the aggregate sentence which I shall impose is a lesser figure than 20 years in order to preserve what I consider to be an appropriate ratio between the period of imprisonment and the total sentence. I do not find special circumstances.

Discharging a firearm with intention to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Fox

79The maximum sentence for this offence is 25 years: s 33A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. There is no SNPP. The SNPP for the more serious offence of shooting with intent to murder is 10 years.

80Mr Fox was an eyewitness to the killing of the deceased. Although the jury acquitted Kevin Gall of the more serious charge of attempted murder and accordingly did not consider that Kevin Gall intended to kill Mr Fox when he shot at him, it nonetheless found that he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm.

81This offence was not, to any significant degree, planned, and arose by reason of Kevin Gall's fear of the consequences of his killing of the deceased. Nor was it relevantly in company. I take into account that the jury acquitted Bruce Gall of the same offence. 

82The relevant aggravating factor is that the offence was committed without regard for public safety: 21A(2)(i).

83The relevant mitigating factors which I take into account are as follows: the injury caused by the offence was not substantial, although this was the consequence of good fortune and incompetent firing rather than anything else; it was not part of a planned activity; Kevin Gall does not have any significant record of previous convictions; he is unlikely to re-offend; and has good prospects of rehabilitation.

84I do not accept that Kevin Gall was provoked by the victim. At the relevant time, Mr Fox, who knew that the deceased would already have died from the several gun shot wounds that he had received, was simply trying to escape so that he too would not be shot.

Perverting the course of justice

85The offence of doing any act intending to pervert the course of justice carries a maximum sentence of 14 years: s 319 of the Crimes Act. There is no SNPP.

86I am required to take into account the plea of guilty: s 22 of the Act. The utilitarian value of the plea was diminished by its timing, since it was made on the first day of trial. A discount of 10% is appropriate.

87The objective seriousness of the offence Kevin Gall committed cannot be gainsaid: it is a serious matter to encourage a potential witness to destroy evidence and give a false account if questioned by police with a view to concealing a homicide.

88These acts occurred more than two months after the murder. Although the police had questioned some witnesses about the disappearance of the deceased, Kevin Gall was not arrested until 16 November 2010, some seven months after the death of the deceased. 

89As at 19 June 2010, Kevin (and Bruce) Gall:

(1)knew that Kevin Gall had not been arrested or charged with the murder of Neil Green;

(2)knew that the hard-drive of the CCTV on the premises at 8 Wiltona Place had been removed and that therefore any recording of the relevant events would no longer be available;

(3)believed (albeit incorrectly) that the Ford Laser had been adequately disposed of so that it would not be found and tested for DNA; and 

(4)believed that although Michael Fox had told the Nomads that Kevin Gall had shot and killed the deceased at 8 Wiltona Place, he had refused to reveal this to the police when questioned by them. 

90Kevin and Bruce Gall's acts of encouraging Mr Lapich to give false evidence and Kevin Gall's act in encouraging Mr Lapich to destroy his mobile phone were potentially highly significant acts in deflecting the police investigation away from Kevin, as the deceased's killer. These acts were done at a time when both Kevin and Bruce Gall had had plenty of time to think about the circumstances of the killing and the various ways in which the investigation of the killing could be thwarted with a view to Kevin Gall's culpability never being discovered by police.

91I do not accept Kevin Gall's submission that the motivation for this offence was concern regarding retribution from Nomads rather than the ramifications of prosecution. Kevin Gall's residence had already been fire-bombed by persons believed to be associated with the Nomads. The terms of the conversation on 19 June 2010 and the concerns expressed by its participants show that Kevin and Bruce Gall were highly attuned to the various ways in which the police could potentially link Kevin Gall to the killing of the deceased and the need to ensure that such evidence as might have that effect either had been destroyed or could be rendered unavailable to police.

92I take into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company. By way of mitigation, I reject Kevin Gall's submission that the damage caused by the offence was not substantial since I have insufficient evidence to ascertain by how long the arrest of Kevin Gall was delayed and the extent to which the police investigation was compromised or retarded by reason of the offence. I am not satisfied that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

93I take into account the other mitigating factors such as lack of substantial criminal record, the unlikelihood of re-offending and Kevin Gall's good prospects of rehabilitation.

Unlawful possession of firearms

94The offence of possessing a prohibited firearm or pistol carries a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. The SNPP is three years. 

95I am required to take into account the plea of guilty: s 22 of the Act. The utilitarian value of the plea was diminished by its timing, since it was made on the first day of trial. A discount of 10% is appropriate.

96It was submitted on Kevin Gall's behalf that he was:

""either minding the illegal firearms for others or having them for his protection and the protection of his family and friends.""

97I do not accept this rather benign description of what occurred. First, Kevin Gall said, in evidence at the trial, that he was ""minding"" illegal firearms for the deceased and that he refused to return them because he did not want to arm the deceased, who was dangerous and a member of the Nomads. His explanation was, at best, implausible, since he accepted that the deceased had, if he so chose, access to firearms, and indeed said that he believed, at the time he shot him, that the deceased was armed.

98Secondly, the proposition that a gun can be used for ""protection"" is, at best, flawed. A gun, if used, has a substantial potential to cause death or grievous bodily harm. It is, in no sense, a shield. Thirdly, as I have said above, I am not satisfied that any of the firearms or weapons, of which Kevin Gall was in possession as at 6 May 2010, belonged to the deceased.

99In terms of mitigating factors, I accept that the harm caused by the offence was not substantial, although these weapons have, as the murder of the deceased demonstrates, substantial potential to cause death and grievous bodily harm. I am not satisfied that the offence of possession of firearms was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. I take into account the other mitigating factors: his lack of substantial criminal record, that he is unlikely to re-offend, and has good prospects of rehabilitation.

Power to reduce penalties for pre-trial disclosure

100Kevin Gall submitted that I should reduce his penalties because of the degree to which the administration of justice had been facilitated by the defence (whether by disclosures made pre-trial or during the trial or otherwise). Reference was made to admissions during the trial and a significant shortening of the trial which was said to facilitate the course of justice. In particular Kevin Gall admitted in opening that he had shot and killed the deceased and had intended to do so which meant that the issue on the murder charge related to self defence or defence of another.

101In my view, counsel for Kevin Gall conducted the case properly and efficiently which meant that many witnesses did not need to be called and which led to a shortening of the trial.

102Kevin Gall himself gave evidence of the way in which he had disposed of the body, removed vehicle identification numbers from relevant vehicles, destroyed the murder weapon, put bullets fired in Mr Fox's direction through a vice and otherwise endeavoured to ensure that he would escape detection. His evidence of disposal of the body could not be tested since the body has never been recovered. That it was not found when Kevin Gall took police to the area of State Forest where he said he buried the deceased is not determinative of whether he did bury the body. As I have said above, I do not accept his evidence as to this matter. He admitted in evidence that neither the deceased nor Mr Fox was armed, which accorded with Mr Fox's evidence.

103In the circumstances of the instant case, I am not disposed to impose a lesser penalty on Kevin Gall by reason of these matters.

Bruce Gall

Accessory after the fact to murder

104The maximum penalty for accessory after the fact to murder is 25 years' imprisonment. There is no SNPP.

105Bruce Gall's act of hosing down the carport is the only act relied upon by the Crown in relation to the offence of accessory after the fact. Its effect was to assist his son to escape detection at least for a period since, had it remained in place, it would probably have led the neighbours or other visitors to report it to the police.

106Bruce Gall submitted that this offence, together with the offence of perverting the course of justice, which is considered further below, was one which, although not excusable, was an understandable act by a father who was devoted to, and concerned about this son, whom he knew to have just killed someone. This explanation can more readily be accepted as a ""heat of the moment"" instinctive act by a loyal father in respect of being an accessory than with respect to the offence of perverting the course of justice, which occurred two months later.

107Bruce Gall also submitted that the gravamen of the principal offence, whether it be murder or manslaughter, was not within the control of the accessory, and therefore he ought not be punished more severely by reason of his conviction for accessory after the fact to murder, than he would have been had Kevin Gall been convicted of manslaughter, notwithstanding that the maximum sentence for the former is 25 years and the maximum sentence for the latter is 5 years.

108Bruce Gall placed particular reliance on R v Rodriguez [2012] NSWSC 663 in which a father was convicted after trial of being an accessory after the fact to a manslaughter committed by his eldest son, who was never brought to trial because he left Australia a month after the events. The relevant assistance given by the offender was to collect the weapon that had been used to kill the victim from the person with whom it had been left after the killing. The offender then disposed of the knife, knowing that it had been used in the killing and intending to prevent his son from being brought to justice for that offence. Hidden J, who was satisfied of the offender's good character, imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years which was wholly suspended. The offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 5 years.

109Cases involving accessories after the fact to murder embrace a wide range of offending. In some cases, the offender's conduct may be viewed as the product of any one or more of the following: fear, threats, emotional attachment, or dependence, or a misguided sense of loyalty. In the instant case, the factors motivating Bruce Gall were emotional attachment and a misguided sense of loyalty. I am not satisfied that he was fearful of his son, or that he was in any way dependent on his son, whether emotionally or otherwise.

110The maximum penalty is an indication of the relative seriousness with which the public, through Parliament, views this offence: R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253, at [19] per Howie J. It would, in my view, be erroneous to disregard the distinction in maximum penalties, notwithstanding that the acts of the accessory are the same whether the principal offender is guilty of murder or manslaughter. 

111Further, there are strong policy reasons for regarding the offence as a serious one. As Thomas JA observed in R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32, at 38:

""...it is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes are not covered up.""

112Nonetheless, Bruce Gall's act of hosing down the carport to remove what must have been substantial quantities of the deceased's blood was an act which was done shortly after he witnessed his son shoot the deceased. It was an isolated act in the context of this offence and the motivation, though misguided, was understandable.

113I take into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company: s 21A(2)(e).

114As mitigating factors, I take into account that the acts of Bruce Gall in hosing down the carport did not, to the extent that he was responding in a relatively short period of time to an event that was both violent and, as far as he was concerned, unexpected, form part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s 21A(3)(b)). 

Perverting the course of justice

115The underlying facts for this offence, which are set out above, are, in my view, in a different category, as far as Bruce Gall is concerned, than those associated with his being an accessory after the fact to murder. Whereas his hosing of blood from the carport may be understood as an impulsive, emotional act borne of paternal devotion, the act of encouraging Mr Lapich to give false evidence cannot be viewed in the same way.

116The state of Bruce Gall's knowledge at the time of the conversation was relevantly the same as Kevin's and has been addressed above by reference to Kevin Gall.

117As with Kevin Gall, I apply a 10% reduction in respect of this count to take into account the utilitarian value of Bruce Gall's plea of guilty, which was entered on the first day of the trial: s 22 of the Act.

118I take into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company: s 21A(2)(e). I reject Bruce Gall's submission that the damage caused by the offence was not substantial for the same reasons already given in relation to Kevin Gall. 
Possession of illegal firearm

119Bruce Gall submitted that he armed himself after his son had killed the deceased in an inexcusable, but understandable, attempt to protect himself and his son, from reprisals by the Nomads. 

120I do not accept either that Bruce Gall acquired the gun after the killing of the deceased or that he acquired it because of fear of reprisals from the Nomads for the death of the deceased. Fear of reprisals is neither an excuse, much less a justification, for possessing a gun.

121Bruce Gall also submitted that I ought take into account his co-operation with police since, when the police executed a warrant at the premises at 8 Wiltona Place on 16 November 2010, he showed them where the gun was, rather than attempting to conceal it or, indeed, use it. I do not consider that this alleged co-operation ought have the effect of lessening the sentence since it amounted, in my view, to no more than bowing to the inevitable.

122The sentence I impose must be apt to mark the community's disapproval of the serious crime of possession of an unlawful firearm to which the applicant had pleaded guilty. It is important to denounce firearms offences by way of general and personal deterrence. Both those factors have particular resonance in this case because it was the possession of an unlawful firearm by Kevin Gall which led to his murder of the deceased, who was unarmed. Far from deterring Bruce Gall from arming himself, he submitted, through his counsel, that the fear of reprisals was the reason he acquired a gun.

123I take into account as aggravating factors that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s 23A(2)(n)) and, to the extent that it involved keeping a loaded firearm unsecured in a domestic dwelling, was committed, in a broad sense, without regard to public safety (s 23A(2)(i)).

124In respect of each of the offences for which Bruce Gall is to be sentenced, I take into account as mitigating factors lack of substantial criminal record (s 21A(3)(e)), the unlikelihood of re-offending (s 21A(3)(g)) and Bruce Gall's good prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)). In respect of the firearms and pervert the course of justice offences, I am not satisfied that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b).

125As referred to above, Bruce Gall has already spent a period of time in custody, most of which, he says, and the Crown accepts, was spent in protective custody. I am not persuaded that this matter ought lead to a reduction in the sentence that I would otherwise impose, nor that special circumstances have been established.

126The offences for which I must sentence Bruce Gall involve his thwarting the investigation by police of a serious crime (in the case of being an accessory after the fact to murder); subverting the administration of justice (in the case of the perverting the course of justice offence); and taking the law into his own hands and reserving to himself the right to attack and kill others by having to hand an unlawful firearm which was loaded and ready to be used.

127Although there is a common theme to these offences, the sentences ought not be wholly concurrent since this would fail to reflect the discrete criminality of each, which requires a substantial measure of accumulation.

Loss of the deceased

128Under the law, the loss suffered by the deceased and his loved ones cannot be reflected by any sentence I impose. However, before I impose a sentence, I wish to pause to acknowledge the loss of Neil Green to his family and to his friends. I take this opportunity to extend my personal sympathies to all those to whom Mr Green was dear.

129I am conscious of the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 87-88. It is the approach that I adopt in relation to the sentencing of each of the offenders.

		26 November 2012",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760532,Regina v XHR [2012] NSWCCA 247,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales) (the DPP) against a directed verdict of acquittal ordered by Keleman DCJ pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, s 107. The DPP, on the appeal, seeks an order quashing the acquittal and an order that there be a new trial.

2It should be noted, at the commencement of these reasons, that pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 111(b), the name of an acquitted person is not to be published unless publication has been authorised, inter alia, by this Court. No authorisation for publication was sought and none has been given. Accordingly, the proceedings will be entitled by using ""XHR"" as the name of the respondent. 

3The respondent was a massage therapist whom the Crown alleged digitally penetrated the complainant's genitalia without her consent in the course of providing a massage service to her on 28 April 2011. He was charged with an offence under the Crimes Act 1900, s 61I. Digital penetration constitutes sexual intercourse for the purposes of s 61I: see s 61H(1)(a). In an ERISP conducted by New South Wales Police on 28 April 2011, the respondent denied that sexual intercourse had occurred. 

4Section 61I provides:

""61ISexual assault

Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.""

5An offence under s 61I requires proof of the following elements: first, that the accused person had sexual intercourse with the complainant; secondly, that sexual intercourse occurred without the complainant's consent; and thirdly, that the accused person knew the complainant was not consenting. The question in issue on the appeal was in respect of the third element only.

6For the purpose of establishing the third element of the offence the Crimes Act, s 61HA(3) provides that the accused person must know that the complainant does not consent:

""(3)Knowledge about consent

A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if: 

(a)the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or
(b)the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or
(c)the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case: 

(d)including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but
(e)not including any self-induced intoxication of the person.""

7The Crown contended at trial that the third element of s 61I was established on any one of the bases specified in s 61HA(3)(a), (b) or (c). 

8The Crown case was a circumstantial one relying upon the following factors: the relationship between the respondent and the complainant, namely, that of service provider and client; the service requested by the complainant was for a massage only; there was no overt or express permission given for any sexual touching or penetration; and that the respondent never asked for permission to do so or took any steps to ascertain whether she was consenting. 

9The Crown contended that the respondent's denial that any touching had taken place was capable of constituting an admission that he had not sought consent or taken steps to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting. In addition, there were facts showing that the sexual touching was not accidental. First, there were two incidents of touching close together. Secondly, the manipulation of the complainant's clitoris was indicative of an intentional act, as was the removal of the complainant's underwear. Thirdly, the respondent's action in moving his head towards the complainant's groin was indicative of an intention to further the sexual act.

10At the conclusion of the Crown case, the respondent made an application to the trial judge for a directed verdict of acquittal. Such an application usually attracts the legal vernacular of a 'no case to answer' submission. I will adopt that language for convenience. The trial judge upheld the application on the basis he was satisfied that:

""... the evidence in the Crown case is not capable of proving the necessary inference to found the requisite guilty knowledge on the part of the accused, in any of its three forms, in respect of the third element of the offence charged

'No case' application: legal principles

11In R v Bilick and Starke (1984) 36 SASR 322; 11 A Crim R 452 the Court was concerned with a no case application in respect of a circumstantial case. King CJ, at 337, stated:

""The case against the appellant Starke was circumstantial in character. The same test is to be applied to deciding a submission of no case to answer in a case depending upon circumstantial evidence as in a case depending upon direct evidence, although the manner of its application will be different. The question to be answered by the trial judge is whether there is evidence with respect to every element of the offence charged which, if accepted, could prove that element beyond reasonable doubt."" (emphasis added)

12His Honour continued: 

""Where there is direct evidence of the actus reus and that evidence is capable of supporting an inference of mens rea, there is a case to answer except in the extreme case, as perhaps of testimony which is manifestly self-contradictory or the product of a disorderly mind, envisaged by the Privy Council, in which the direct 'evidence' is so incredible as to amount to no evidence. Where the case is a circumstantial or partly circumstantial case and therefore depends on inferences, the question may be expanded so that it becomes: On the assumption that all the evidence of primary fact considered at its strongest from the point of view of the case for the prosecution, is accurate, and on the further assumption that all inferences most favourable to the prosecution which are reasonably open, are drawn, is the evidence capable of producing in the mind of a reasonable person satisfaction, beyond reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused? That, as it seems to me, was the question which the learned trial Judge was required to answer in deciding on the submission of no case to answer."" (emphasis added) 

13In Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 the Court observed, at 212, that there was:

""... no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct [a verdict of acquittal] if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict.""

14Doney involved the question whether a trial judge has power to direct the jury to enter a verdict of acquittal on the ground that, although there was evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction, a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. In answering that question, the Court stated, at 214-215:

""... if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty."" (emphasis added)

15The Court added, at 215, that neither the power of a criminal appellate court to set aside a verdict that was unsafe or unsatisfactory, nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process, provided a basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge on such an application at the expense of the traditional jury function. Doney was accepted as established principled in R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177 at [29] per French CJ. 

16In R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74, Gleeson CJ approved the following statement of principle in Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1983] 2 VR 410 at 415-416:

""The question whether the Crown has ultimately excluded every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence is a question of fact for the jury and therefore, if the Crown has led evidence upon which the accused could be convicted, a trial judge should not rule that there is no case to answer or direct the jury to acquit simply because he thinks that there could be formulated a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused which the Crown has failed to exclude. Similarly a trial judge should not rule that there is no case for the accused to answer because he has formed the view that, if the decision on the facts were his and not the jury's, he would entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. It is always a question for the jury whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of the accused and as Menzies, J. explained in Plomp's Case, in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the necessity to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence is no more than an application to that class of case of the requirement that the case be proved beyond reasonable doubt.""

17In JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39, at 44, Lee CJ at CL (Carruthers and Finlay JJ agreeing) accepted that R was authority for the proposition that a judge may not direct an acquittal in a case dependent upon circumstantial evidence:

""... if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused can be convicted, even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated ...""

18These authorities establish that in considering a 'no case' application, the trial judge is required to determine ""whether there is evidence in respect of every element of the offence"": Bilick and Starke at 337 (emphasis added). Further, and of particular relevance to this case, the actus reus of the offence, which here was the alleged act or acts of sexual intercourse, may form the basis to establish, by inference, the third element of the offence, namely, absence of consent. It was necessary for the trial judge to draw that inference in this case unless he was satisfied of some exceptional or extreme circumstance: Bilick and Starke at 337. The examples of exceptional or extreme circumstances given in Bilick and Starke were where the allegation was the product of a disorderly mind or the evidence was manifestly self-contradictory. 

Crown appeal from directed verdict: the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 107

19The Crown through either the Attorney General or the DPP may appeal against a directed acquittal in the circumstances provided for in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 107. 

20Section 107 provides, relevantly:

""107Directed jury acquittals or acquittals in trials without juries

(1)This section applies to the acquittal of a person: 
(a)by a jury at the direction of the trial Judge, or

...

(2)The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any such acquittal on any ground that involves a question of law alone. 

...

(5)The Court of Criminal Appeal may affirm or quash the acquittal appealed against.

(6)If the acquittal is quashed, the Court of Criminal Appeal may order a new trial in such manner as the Court thinks fit. For that purpose, the Court may (subject to the Bail Act 1978) order the detention or return to custody of the accused person in connection with the new trial ..."" (emphasis added)

21It has been held that the right of appeal, conferred by s 107 on a ground that ""involves a question of law alone"", is narrower than an appeal ""on a question of law"" and that neither of those phrases is equivalent to ""error of law"": R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272; 175 A Crim R 108 at [74]. There will, however, be some overlapping of matters that fall within each description. Thus, although s 107(2) does not speak in terms of ""error of law"", an appellate court is not entitled, upon the identification of a ""question of law alone"" to embark upon a review of the trial judge's reasons and substitute its own determination. Error in the identified question of law must be demonstrated. 

22The legal concepts that either fall within s 107(2) or which are outside its reach are relatively well settled. The construction of a provision of a statute ""involves a question of law alone"" for the purposes of s 107(2): JS at [74], [83]. A statement by the trial judge of the elements of an offence also falls within s 107(2). In R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A Crim R 199, the Court of Criminal Appeal (per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL and R A Hulme J agreeing) held that the statement by the trial judge, that on a charge of homicide it was necessary for the Crown to prove a particular act that brought about the injury which caused death, involved a question of law alone and was erroneous. See also Williams v R [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278. 

23An appeal on a mixed question of fact and law does not fall within s 107(2). In PL the Court also held, at [25], that no appeal lay pursuant to s 107(2) where the question in issue was whether the trial judge had correctly applied the relevant legal principles to the facts. As Spigelman CJ explained, at [26], the determination of whether the trial judge had correctly applied the principles of law to the facts necessarily required an assessment of those facts. In other words, the process of ""applying"" a principle of law to the facts involved a mixed question of fact and law and thus did not fall within s 107(2). However, ""if the question of law can be stated and considered separately from the facts with which it may be connected"", there is a ""question of law alone"": Williams at 287 per Gibbs CJ. 

24In Williams, the relevant statute conferred a right of appeal, with leave, on the Attorney General against an acquittal ""on a question of law alone"". It was held that the wrongful rejection of evidence by the trial judge in the exercise of a discretion was not an appeal on a question of law alone: see at 287, 301-302 and 314. The excluded evidence comprised a number of records of interview which had been obtained after the time that the trial judge held it had been practicable to bring the accused person before a justice to be charged. The records of interview were admissible in the usual course but were rejected in the exercise of the trial judge's discretion. As Mason and Brennan JJ observed, at 302, ""[t]he manner in which a discretion is exercised depends upon the judge's appreciation of all the facts of the case"". However, notwithstanding the different terms of the statute in Williams, these particular propositions apply to s 107(2). The extent of overlap in the statutory provisions under consideration in Williams and s 107(2) does not need to be addressed. 

25Before leaving these introductory remarks, one further comment needs to be made. In JS, Spigelman CJ stated, at [74]-[75], that for the purposes of an appeal under s 107, it was necessary for the notice of appeal to particularise, with some precision, the ""question of law alone"" said to be involved in each specific ground of appeal. In observing that direction, the Crown in this case did not seek, by way of an independent ground of appeal, to rely upon an argument that the trial judge failed to properly apply the principles relating to a directed verdict. The Crown's grounds of appeal were those identified in the notice of appeal. 

The grounds of appeal

26The Crown identified four matters in the trial judge's determination which, it contended, ""involved questions of law alone"". Those matters were:

(1)His Honour's implicit finding that it was necessary for the Crown, in order to establish the mental element for the offence, to prove the complainant communicated her lack of consent to the respondent prior to the act constituting sexual intercourse;

(2)His Honour's failure to have regard to the requirements of s 61HA(3)(d);

(3)His Honour's taking into account that there was no evidence of threats, force, coercion or pressure in determining whether there was sufficient evidence to establish the mental element of the offence;

(4)His Honour's rejection of the Crown's reliance upon the respondent's answers in his interview with police as part of its circumstantial case on the mental element of the offence. 

27The Crown approached the task of demonstrating that each of these grounds ""involved a question of law alone"" by identifying the legal proposition at the heart of each matter: see PL at [46]. In order to do so, the Crown first identified the circumstantial evidence upon which it relied to establish the third element of s 61I, namely, that the respondent knew the complainant was not consenting to the act of sexual intercourse. 

Ground 1: was it necessary for the Crown to prove that the complainant had communicated her lack of consent to the act of sexual intercourse?

28The Crown submitted that it was not necessary, for the purpose of establishing that the accused person knew that the complainant was not consenting, for the Crown to prove that, prior to the act of intercourse taking place, the complainant communicated her lack of consent to the act of intercourse: see Salmond v R [2010] NSWCCA 141; R v Porteous [2003] NSWCCA 18; s 61HA(3). The Crown submitted that it was apparent from the remarks in the trial judge's reasons that his Honour considered that this was part of the requisite proof of the third element of the s 61I offence. 

29The structure of his Honour's reasons is relevant to this submission. The trial judge commenced his reasons with a reference to the charge, the elements of the charge and the evidence, which his Honour accepted as being sufficient to satisfy the first and second elements of the charge. His Honour also observed that the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence arising from the complainant's evidence and certain statements of the respondent in his ERISP. His Honour correctly identified the principles and case law governing a 'no case' application where the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence to establish the third element of the offence. His Honour then commenced his review of the complainant's evidence. His Honour noted, at 6, that part of the complainant's evidence in which she said she did not consent to the respondent touching her on the outside of her vagina and her clitoris. His Honour then stated, at 7: 

""However, she agreed that at no stage when he was touching the outside of her vagina or her clitoris did she say or do anything which may have indicated to him that she did not want him to do what he was doing."" 

His Honour then continued with his review of the complainant's evidence. 

30His Honour next noted that the respondent was subsequently arrested and interviewed by police by way of an ERISP and that in the ERISP the respondent admitted that he had performed a massage but denied sexual intercourse. 

31Next, at 9, his Honour noted that the DPP, in proof of the third element of the offence, relied upon the complainant's evidence, together with the following statements in the respondent's ERISP: that a full body massage never included a massage of the genital area; that he did not touch the complainant on the vagina; and that she did not give him permission to do so. His Honour did not particularise the complainant's evidence that he understood was relied upon by the Crown. The relevance of this last observation is explained below. His Honour next rejected the Crown's reliance on the respondent's answers in the ERISP as admissions. 

32His Honour then stated, at 9-10:

""It is abundantly clear from the complainant's evidence that at no stage did she say or indicate to [the respondent] in any way that she did not consent to the various things he did to her, and in particular the touching or massaging of her vagina and clitoris. Indeed the only occasion that the complainant indicated that she did not want [the respondent] to do something was after he had touched her clitoris when she opened her eyes and saw [the respondent's] head leaning towards her groin area, when she then held up hand in a 'Stop' sign and told [the respondent] 'No' or 'No, thank you', to which [the respondent] had replied 'Oh okay, no worries' and then proceeded to massage her lower legs and feet."" 

33His Honour next noted it was abundantly clear that no threat had been made to or coercion exerted upon the complainant. His Honour concluded that ""[h]aving reviewed the totality of the evidence"" and having considered the applicable principles governing a 'no case' application, he was satisfied that the Crown case was not capable of proving the third element of the offence. 

34The Crown acknowledged that there was no express statement by his Honour to the effect that the Crown was required to establish communication of an absence of consent prior to the intercourse occurring. The Crown submitted, nonetheless, that his Honour's remarks revealed that he had approached his determination on that basis and thus had determined the application on a wrong principle of law. His Honour's determination thus involved a question of law alone: see PL especially at [52]. 

35In PL, the trial judge had correctly stated the legal principles that applied to the determination of a directed verdict of acquittal. In particular, the trial judge had noted that it was not sufficient, in a circumstantial case, for a trial judge to conclude that there was a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. In PL, the Crown had submitted that the trial judge made statements, in the course of considering whether to direct a verdict of acquittal, that were inconsistent with principle. Spigelman CJ observed that if the trial judge had proceeded upon the basis that the Crown had to establish the particular act of the accused that caused death his Honour would have erred. Such error would have involved a question of law alone within the meaning of s 107(2). 

36The trial judge in PL had not made any express statement to that effect. The respondent argued that the trial judge had merely made a finding that on the whole of the evidence, taken at its highest, guilt could not be established and thus the challenged reasons involved conclusions of fact. 

37Spigelman CJ embarked upon a careful and extensive analysis of the trial judge's reasons, including the language used, to determine whether his Honour had proceeded on an incorrect principle of law or whether he was explaining his conclusion as to the facts. The Chief Justice, at [67], observed that in the impugned paragraphs, there was no indication given by the trial judge that any fact, other than the difficulty in identifying the cause of death, was pertinent to his determination. His Honour concluded, at [68], that:

""By expressly giving determinative significance to the inability to establish a particular cause of death [his Honour] did not pay regard to the other facts to which the jury could have had regard on the issue of both the actus reus and mens rea of the offence charged ...""

38Accordingly, the trial judge's reasoning involved a question of law alone and was erroneous.

39In the present case, the DPP submitted that in circumstances where the only specific evidence to which the trial judge referred on the question of consent was the complainant's omission or failure to convey to the respondent that she was not consenting, it was plain that the trial judge considered that was a necessary element of the Crown case. 

40The respondent acknowledged that had his Honour held it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the complainant communicated her lack of consent prior to the act or acts of sexual intercourse, that would ""involve a question of law alone"". The respondent submitted, however, that his Honour neither expressly nor impliedly held that it was necessary for the Crown to do so for the purposes of establishing the third element of the offence. Rather, the respondent contended that the passage of his Honour's reasons upon which the DPP relied involved findings of fact and could not be converted into the legal proposition for which the DPP contended. In this regard he submitted that on a fair reading of the judgment, all his Honour was saying was that ""on the facts [the complainant] did not communicate a lack of consent"". 

41The respondent also contended that evidence that the respondent knew that the complainant did not consent would be relevant to the third element of the offence as would evidence that indicated absence of protest or complaint. The respondent further argued that it could not be said, on a proper understanding of his Honour's reasons, that this was the determinative reason the third element had not been established. This was clear, it was said, from his Honour's express statement that he had ""reviewed the totality of the evidence"". 

42The first passage relied upon by the DPP, set out above at [29], did not merely involve a recitation of the fact of lack of protest. The statement was introduced by the word ""However"", indicating something contrary to that which preceded it. The matter which preceded it was the complainant's evidence that she had not consented. Considered as a matter of contrast, the observation that she had not communicated lack of consent indicated that his Honour considered this to be a relevant matter. The question is whether his Honour considered it to be relevant only to an assessment of the immediately preceding evidence to which he had referred, or whether he considered it was relevant because there was a legal requirement on the Crown to prove communication of absence of consent. 

43In the second passage, set out above, at [32], the trial judge used emphatic language, viz, ""[i]t is abundantly clear"", in making his observation that the complainant had not communicated her lack of consent to sexual intercourse during the course of the massage. 

44The question of lack of communication was thus referred to twice by the trial judge. There was the initial reference to the complainant's evidence that she did not consent: see at [29] above. That evidence was marked out by the contrasting reference to the evidence that the complainant had not communicated her consent. There was then the emphatic reiteration of the absence of communication of consent: see at [32] above. 

45Almost immediately after the second reference to the lack of communication of consent, his Honour posited the test he was required to apply on the 'no case' application, that is, that he was required to accept the evidence in the Crown case at its highest and that he was to apply the principles in, inter alia, Doney and JMR. It should be assumed, therefore, that his Honour correctly approached his determination of the 'no case' application. In reaching his conclusion that there was no case to answer, it is also apparent from the evidence to which I have referred and the prominence he gave it, that he took into account that the complainant had not communicated her lack of consent to any sexual intercourse.

46For the reasons already explained, the complainant's evidence could sustain a verdict of guilty. She gave evidence of the acts of sexual intercourse and that she had not consented to those acts. This was evidence of the first and second elements of the offence. There was an available inference as to the third element to be drawn from the evidence of the actus reus, namely, that the respondent knew that the complainant was not consenting: see Bilick and Starke. The evidence that the complainant did not communicate her lack of consent prior to the sexual acts taking place did not negative her evidence that she did not consent. 

47Accordingly, on the assumption that the trial judge applied correct principle to the determination of the 'no case' application, being an assumption I consider should be made, his Honour must have determined the application on the basis that the Crown was required to establish communication of absence of consent prior to the acts of sexual intercourse occurring. Otherwise, his Honour's reference to there being no communication of absence of consent would have been entirely irrelevant. In my opinion, it was only the absence of that communication that could have led to his Honour's ultimate conclusion that the Crown case was not capable of proving the necessary inference to found guilty knowledge for the purpose of the third element of the offence. As that was incorrect as a matter of principle, s 107(2) has been satisfied.

48Accordingly, I consider that ground 1 of the appeal has been made out by the Crown. That is sufficient for the determination of the appeal, other than for the question whether the Court should nonetheless affirm the acquittal. I deal with that question later. In deference to the careful arguments of the parties in respect of the remaining grounds of appeal, it is appropriate that I consider the remaining grounds of appeal. 

Ground 2: failing to have regard to the requirements of s 61HA(3)(d)

49Section 61HA(3)(d) provides that, for the purpose of determining whether an accused person has knowledge within the meaning of s 61HA(3)(c) that a complainant is not consenting to sexual intercourse, the court must have regard to, inter alia, ""any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse"". 

50Although he did not do so by reference to the section number or paragraphs, the trial judge referred to the provisions of ss 61HA(3)(a), (b) and (c) by a statement of what each of ss 61HA(3)(a), (b) and (c) encompassed. By contrast, his Honour made no reference to s 61HA(3)(d), either in express terms or inferentially. His Honour neither stated any facts that might have been relevant to para (d) nor engaged in any legal reasoning that indicated he had considered its requirements. 

51The DPP submitted that the complete absence of any reference to s 61HA(3)(d) or to anything that could be construed as a reference to that provision, demonstrated that his Honour failed to have regard to the provision, as he was required to do. The DPP sought to demonstrate its point by reference to what occurs at a trial when knowledge of consent is in issue. Given the terms in which s 61HA(3)(d) is cast, when the trial judge is directing a jury as to the third element of the offence, a direction must be given that the jury is to consider the reasonable steps taken by the accused person to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting. 

52The absence of any reference to s 61HA(3)(d) in determining the 'no case' application led, on the DPP's submission, to the conclusion that his Honour failed to have regard to it, as he was required to do. Another way of expressing this was that his Honour misdirected himself in law on this question. The DPP submitted that even if the trial judge had regard to s 61HA(3)(d), he could not have directed a verdict of acquittal in this case. This was not a case where there was no evidence. It was a case where there was evidence which, even if the trial judge considered it to be weak, was required to be left to the jury. 

53The DPP further submitted that an examination of the transcript of argument before the trial judge supported the submission that his Honour failed to have regard to s 61HA(3)(d), which, the DPP contended, involved an objective test. In the course of argument on the hearing of the 'no case' application, the trial judge stated that the test for determining the question of knowledge, in any of its three forms specified in s 61HA(3), was not an objective one. Rather, it was a subjective test. His Honour repeated his view in emphatic terms, when he said ""[i]t's not an objective test at all"". His Honour later reiterated, ""[w]e're concerned here with a subjective test"" and continued:

""... it's a question of whether or not the evidence is capable of establishing, accepting her evidence, that the relevant elements can be established, because that's really the only evidence ..."" 

54His Honour made the following further remark: 

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: But one of the issues in relation to the third element is what would be a reasonable basis upon which to--

HIS HONOUR: That's the third part of the test. Well it's not reasonable basis, it's not quite in those terms ... It's whether the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, that's the element."" 

His Honour's reference to the ""third part of the test"" was clearly a reference to s 61HA(3)(c). 

55The respondent submitted that the Crown bore the onus of establishing a matter or issue involving a question of law. He contended that notwithstanding that there was no express reference to s 61HA(3)(d) in his Honour's reasons, it could not be inferred that the trial judge failed to take s 61HA(3)(d) into account. The respondent argued that whilst s 61HA(3)(d) was a mandatory consideration, the absence of a reference to it in the reasons of a trial judge was not sufficient to establish that regard was not had to that matter. It was possible that in this case his Honour had regard to it, as required, but did not refer to any steps that the respondent had taken in circumstances where there was no issue that he had not taken any steps to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting. The respondent's defence was that no sexual intercourse occurred. 

56The respondent further submitted that it was unlikely his Honour did not have regard to the consideration mandated by s 61HA(3)(d) in circumstances where his Honour clearly had the terms of the section before him. This, he contended, was apparent from his Honour's reference to the terms of ss 61HA(3)(a), (b) and (c). 

57In his written submissions, the respondent submitted that even if the trial judge failed to have regard to s 61HA(3)(d), this Court should undertake that task and arrive at its own conclusion as to whether there was evidence capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt the necessary element of guilty knowledge in any of its three forms. In my opinion, that task is not given to this Court by s 107. Whilst there may be similar considerations involved in the Court's disposal of the appeal under s 107(5), that provision involves a judicial task of a different nature altogether. Section 107(5) involves the Court in a discretionary determination as to whether the trial judge's verdict of acquittal should be affirmed or quashed: see LK at [11] per French CJ. 

58The respondent's submission raises a question as to how an appellate court should read a trial judge's reasons. The respondent submitted the appellate court should not infer the trial judge had failed to refer to or have regard to a specific matter simply because there was no express reference to it. He directed the Court's attention to the comments of Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [88]. In that case, the trial judge, in the course of sentencing, had stated ""I see no reason to find special circumstances in this case"". The question arose whether the trial judge had failed to give reasons for refusing to find special circumstances. The Chief Justice stated that in view of the wide ranging considerations capable of constituting special circumstances, a failure to explain why the statutory proportion was not varied would not readily be accepted as a basis for an inference that the sentencing judge did not turn his or her mind to the issue. This was particularly so in circumstances where the trial judge had expressly made reference to the matter of special circumstances.

59A failure to have regard to a statutory provision which governs the determination of a matter is, unquestionably, a matter that ""involves a question of law alone"". The only question for determination, therefore, is whether the reasons reveal that his Honour failed to have regard to s 61HA(3)(d). 

60A review of the trial judge's reasons indicates that his Honour set out the matters that he considered to be relevant, albeit in brief terms. Thus, at 1, his Honour set out the elements of the offence that the Crown was required to prove. Next, at 1-2, his Honour referred to the evidence relied upon to prove the first and second elements of the offence. His Honour observed that, in proof of the third element, the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence based on the evidence of the complainant and statements made by the respondent in his ERISP. His Honour, at 2 and again at 10, referred to the principles that governed a 'no case' application. His Honour observed that there was evidence to establish the first and second elements of the offence and that the question in issue was whether there was evidence to establish the third element of the offence. His Honour next stated the three aspects of knowledge specified in s 61HA(3)(a)-(c) in the manner to which I have referred and then embarked upon a review of the evidence. As I have said, his Honour made no reference to s 61HA(3)(d) either expressly or inferentially.

61His Honour may have considered that the stark difference between the complainant's evidence of the assault and the respondent's denial in the ERISP simply meant there was no issue that no steps were taken by the respondent to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting and that there was, therefore, no reason to refer to it. However, even if that was his Honour's approach, s 61HA(3)(d) does not involve a mechanical approach to its application. If the evidence discloses that the accused person took no steps to ascertain whether the person consented, any further consideration of that matter can not merely be put to one side. 

62The relevance of whether an accused person took any steps to ascertain consent is inextricably bound up with all the other factors in the case. The words of the section expressly indicate this is so, but it must follow as a matter of ordinary human experience. Thus, if the accused and complainant are in an ongoing relationship, the failure to take steps to ascertain consent may not be surprising and so may not be of any or much assistance in the fact finding task posited by s 61HA(3). If the accused and complainant are in a relationship of service provider and client, the failure to take steps to ascertain consent may be and would likely be very relevant to the question of the accused person's knowledge. There are many factual situations in between these two, some much more nuanced than others. 

63Accordingly, it would not have been sufficient for his Honour to have simply put para (d) to one side as not being relevant because, on the evidence, the respondent took no steps to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting. His Honour was required to consider that matter as part of the determination of whether there was evidence that could prove beyond a reasonable doubt the third element of the offence. The observations of King CJ in Bilick and Starke at 337, referred to above at [11]-[12], are of particular relevance in this regard, as are the comments of the High Court in Doney. Given that his Honour was required to consider the steps taken by the respondent to ascertain whether there was consent, I am of the opinion that it should not be assumed, in what appeared otherwise to be a comprehensive, albeit economical review of fact and law, that his Honour considered something, dismissed it as not relevant and thus did not mention it in his judgment. 

64I would only add that even if it was appropriate to have regard to the transcript, I did not find it of assistance in determining this question. 

65Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that his Honour failed to have regard to para (d) and that failure involved a question of law alone. Ground 2 of the notice of appeal has therefore been made out. 

Ground 3: the trial judge's reference to there being no evidence of threats

66I have referred above to the outline of his Honour's judgment as well as to the passages relating to his Honour's references to the complainant's failure to communicate her lack of consent. Immediately following the second of those references, set out at [32] above, the trial judge stated, at 10:

""It is also abundantly clear from the evidence of the complainant that at no stage did [the respondent] threaten her in any way or force, coerce or pressure her to let him do anything."" 

67It is apparent that his Honour's reference to the absence of threats or coercion was a reference to s 61HA(4) which provides: 

""(4)Negation of consent

A person does not consent to sexual intercourse: 

...
(c)if the person consents to the sexual intercourse because of threats of force or terror ...""

68His Honour may also have had in mind s 61HA(6):

""(6)The grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse include: 

...
(b)if the person has sexual intercourse because of intimidatory or coercive conduct, or other threat, that does not involve a threat of force ...""

69Sections 61HA(4) and 61HA(6) are only relevant where there is apparent consent to sexual intercourse but the consent is negatived because, relevantly, it was induced by force or intimidatory conduct. The DPP submitted, therefore, that it was an irrelevant consideration to have regard to this question in circumstances where there was no issue, on either the Crown or defence case, that the complainant had not consented. The matter in issue on the third element was whether the respondent had knowledge of the complainant's lack of consent. The DPP submitted, therefore, that his Honour's reference to this factor, in circumstances where it was not relevant, involved a fundamental misunderstanding of the statutory provision and was thus an error involving a question of law alone.

70The respondent acknowledged that if absence of threats, force, coercion, or pressure was not relevant to the third element of the offence, the test in s 107(2) would have been satisfied. He submitted, however, that whilst the question of threats, force, coercion, or pressure was undoubtedly relevant to the second element of the offence, such matters were not irrelevant to the third element. The respondent advanced the following arguments as to why this was so. First, he contended that the question of threats, force, coercion, or pressure was relevant because if there was evidence that the respondent had pressured the complainant in any way, that could rationally affect, even if indirectly, the assessment of the probability of whether he knew that she was not consenting: see Evidence Act 1995, s 55. Secondly, the respondent submitted that such evidence was relevant having regard to the terms of s 61HA(6)(b). Thus, if the respondent threatened or coerced the complainant, that would lead to the inference that the respondent had some knowledge that the complainant did not consent. This would be relevant to his state of mind as to whether the complainant was consenting or not. It followed, on the respondent's submission, that a finding of fact on the relevant evidence did not demonstrate error on a matter involving a question of law alone.

71The question for determination, therefore, is whether, in referring to the absence of evidence of threats, his Honour considered that to be relevant to the determination of whether the respondent had knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. In my opinion, the evidence does not bear the relevance for which the respondent contended. The point of s 61HA(4) and s 61HA(6) is to specify the circumstances in which apparent consent will be treated as no consent in law. Here, the question of consent was not in issue, as his Honour recognised in his judgment. The only issue was the respondent's knowledge. The question of threats or coercion or the absence thereof was not relevant to the determination of that question. His Honour must have considered it relevant to the third element, otherwise there was no point in his reference to it. There was, therefore, in my opinion, a finding by his Honour involving a question of law alone.

72The respondent also submitted that his Honour's finding that no threat or force had been used was a finding that was open on the evidence and did not involve any legal proposition. For the reasons I have given, I do not consider that to be correct. 

73The respondent further relied upon the terms of s 61HA(7), which provides:

""(7)A person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse.""

74I do not consider that his Honour's statement bears any relationship to s 61HA(7). The respondent's reliance on s 61HA(7) is to invert his Honour's reasoning. 

75Accordingly, for the reasons I have given, I consider that ground 3 of the notice of appeal has been made out. 

Ground 4: prohibiting the Crown from relying upon the respondent's answers in the ERISP in support of its circumstantial case

76The respondent participated in an ERISP on 28 April 2011. The interview was conducted with the assistance of an interpreter. The respondent was asked, at Q 67, to describe what happened when the complainant arrived and was given a massage. He said through the interpreter:

""A (Int):The lady came in asking for a massage service. She asked me to do a massage on her back. I then asked whether she need the massage with oil or not. She said, 'Yes, with oil.' And then I handed a towel to her and closed the curtain. I then ask her to, you know, take the pants off the bottom because for that service we have to start from that part and then I did massage and also I did massage on her neck as well.

INTERPRETER

He's just saying, you know, definition for back in massage service it include shoulders and also the neck.

ASometime not but sometime people come in - - -"" 

77The respondent said that a half hour back massage service normally included the shoulders and neck. He said that the complainant had been there before, so that he ""reckoned she knew ... what that mean by saying the back"".

78The respondent said that having provided the service on the complainant's back, he asked whether she needed a massage on her chest and she said ""Yes"". After he had done that he asked her whether she needed a massage on her stomach and she again agreed. He next asked whether she needed a massage on her legs, to which she also agreed. At that point, he said ""Can I take off your pants"", to which she said ""Yes"". He said that he began working on the complainant's legs and feet. He said that by the time he had finished one foot, she looked at her watch and said that she didn't have any time left. He told her, ""I just balance a little bit"". This appears to have been a reference to massaging her other foot. He then went out and waited for the complainant to dress.

79When the complainant emerged, the respondent said he asked her, ""How do you feel, is that is it O.K.?"" She asked how much and he told her $40. The complainant replied ""Look, I have told you ... I only need back massage, that would be twenty five dollars"". The respondent said he tried to explain to her that he had provided a full body massage with oil and that he normally charged $50 for that service. He said that he added ""Look, forty dollars, that's really, you know, good price"". The complainant said that she would only pay for the back massage to which he agreed, saying ""It's O.K., you know, twenty five dollars"".

80He said that his staff told him that he should have charged the complainant the correct rate and that they reminded him that ""'It looks like this lady came before', and also owes her money"". This last comment seemed to be a reference to a female staff member alleging that she was owed money for additional services provided to the complainant on a prior occasion and for which the complainant refused to pay.

81The respondent said that when the complainant was in his shop:

""... she appeared very happy ... nothing unusual happened and also every when I start doing every part of her body I did ask her, you know, whether she need it just as a rule. Yeah, she smiled, you know, all the time."" 

82Later in the ERISP, the respondent was asked more particular questions about various parts of the massage. In relation to his request as to whether he could remove the complainant's pants in respect of the leg massage, he said ""I then take off the pants starting from the bottom, take it off"". He said that when he took the pants off the complainant was wearing underwear. He said that he did not take her underwear off, but when he was working on her stomach he ""pulled her underwear down a little bit"". In respect of the leg massage, he said that normally he would ""put a towel on the location"".

83The respondent's attention was drawn to the complainant's allegation that when the respondent pulled her pants down, ""her underpants came with [them] so she was lying there with nothing on"". The respondent denied that occurred, stating that when he was ""pulling her pants off she was holding her underwear that moment"". The following question was then asked:

""Q110.... The female also alleges that when you were massaging her leg ... you have moved your hands up and touched the outside of her vagina, her, actually the outer lips of her vagina."" 

The respondent, through the interpreter answered:

""A.O.K. Exact answer was, the exact answer was, I believe I didn't but sometime when we do this movement I might, his answer. Whether what she believes I don't know but absolutely I didn't."" 

84He said that sometimes he might ""touch that"" because he had to massage that part of the muscle. The ERISP records that he indicated the part of the body to which he was referring. He said that when he was at 'school' he was told ""it was an important part but they do, they contact that groin. Yeah"". He said, however that the complainant did not agree to have ""that part done"", so he ""didn't do it"". The question followed: 

""Q116The lady also alleges in her statement that while you were massaging her vagina you were massaging her clitoris.""

The respondent, through the interpreter, stated ""No"". The transcript of the ERISP records that the respondent also answered ""No"" in English. 

85The respondent, at Q and A117, expressly denied that the complainant at any time had her underpants down. At Q and A121, the respondent, through the interpreter, said that the complainant had expressly said ""No, no"", meaning that she did not want her groin area to be massaged. The respondent reiterated, at A122, that when he was massaging the complainant's legs she had her underpants on. He said that in a massage ""you have to keep your underwear on"", but that some men and women prefer to be completely naked. However, he said that at no stage was the complainant completely naked. 

86The trial judge rejected the Crown's submission that these answers in the ERISP, considered together with the surrounding circumstances were capable of giving rise to an inference that the respondent had no reasonable grounds for believing the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse. His Honour, at 9, considered the Crown's intended reliance upon these answers overlooked that they constituted a complete denial that the respondent had massaged the complainant's vagina intentionally or touched her clitoris. In those circumstances, his Honour said he was not satisfied that the respondent's answers were:

""... capable of amounting to admissions to the requisite guilty knowledge for the third element of the offence charged when either considered alone or in combination with the complainant's evidence ..."" 

Nor was his Honour satisfied that the evidence was:

""... capable of being used to infer, together with the complainant's evidence, the requisite guilty knowledge or state of mind on the part of [the respondent] for which the Crown contends.""

87The DPP submitted that in determining whether the evidence was ""capable"" of constituting the admissions for which it contended, his Honour was making a conclusion of law. The DPP contended that, as part of the jury's determination as to whether the third element of the offence had been established, it would have been open to a jury to consider the respondent's answers in the record of interview that no sexual intercourse had occurred, as constituting an admission that the complainant had not consented to any touching of her genitalia and that a full body massage would never involve doing so. 

88During the course of the argument before the trial judge, the Crown expressly disavowed that it was relying upon the respondent's denials in the ERISP as lies. However, the DPP contended that these answers were relevant to the Crown's circumstantial case, namely, that the relationship between the respondent and the complainant was one of service provider and client, and that on the respondent's case, sexual intercourse was never a part of the practice in which he engaged in the provision of massage services. If the jury accepted the complainant's allegation that sexual intercourse occurred, it would be relevant for the jury to consider why, on this occasion, the respondent departed from his usual practice. In other words, it was a relevant aspect of the circumstantial case that the Crown was advancing.

89The DPP relied upon the principles stated in Mule v The Queen [2005] HCA 49; 221 ALR 85. In Mule, the appellant had been charged and convicted by a jury of possession of a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply to another. The evidence before the jury included a videotaped interview with police, where the appellant had admitted that ecstasy tablets found on his property had been in his possession but had been for his ""personal use"".

90The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. The prosecution sought to rely upon the admissions made by the appellant concerning possession and the appellant sought to rely upon his denials. The trial judge instructed the jury that a video cassette tendered by the prosecution and admitted into evidence was evidence ""for the [appellant] as well as against him"" and ""could be used for all legitimate purposes"". The High Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) stated, at [14]:

""...the proposition that the whole of the recorded matter was available as evidence for the consideration of the jury was not in contest in this appeal. It reflects the accepted view of the law in this country, and it accords with the current state of the law in the United Kingdom.""

See also: Lopes v Taylor (1970) 44 ALJR 412; R v Cox [1986] 2 Qd R 55; Spence v Demasi (1988) 48 SASR 536; R v Aziz [1996] AC 41; [1995] 3 All ER 149.

91The Court further stated:

""[20]... The judge was bound to instruct [the jury] (as he did, in orthodox fashion) about the appellant's right to silence. He also instructed them that the whole of the contents of the interview amounted to evidence to which they could pay regard. It was legally correct for him to tell them that they were not obliged to give the same weight to everything that was said in the interview. Indeed, if he had not told them that, it is possible that they might have assumed the contrary, or at least they might have been left uncertain as to their capacity to discriminate between different parts of the evidence.

[21]Jurors are commonly told that they may approach the evidence selectively and in a discriminating fashion, that it is for them to decide what evidence they accept and what evidence they reject, and that the law does not require them to give all evidence the same weight."" (emphasis added)

92The Court held, at [22], that such a direction was correct as a matter of law. 

93The DPP submitted that Mule demonstrated that the trial judge had erred in preventing the Crown from relying on ""the inculpatory portions"" of the ERISP, namely that the respondent stated a massage would never involve digital penetration and that the complainant did not consent to such penetration, because the respondent had denied that any act involving penetration had occurred. The DPP further submitted that in determining whether the third element of the offence had been proved, it would have been open to the jury to consider the respondent's admission that the complainant had not consented to any touching of her genitalia and that a massage would never involve digital penetration.

94The respondent accepted that if an accused person stated in a record of interview words to the effect ""I did not get any permission or consent from the complainant"", such evidence would be relevant. However, the respondent submitted that in finding that the Crown was not entitled to rely upon the statements in the ERISP, his Honour approached the issue on the basis that he was required to accept the complainant's evidence at its highest. As this involved disregarding the respondent's denials that no sexual intercourse occurred, his Honour was also entitled to disregard the respondent's consequential evidence that he did not obtain the complainant's consent.

95His Honour considered the question of the capacity of the evidence to establish the respondent's state of mind. In doing so, he stated that he was not satisfied that the evidence had that capacity. However, that was not the question for his Honour's determination on the 'no case' application. Rather, his Honour was required to determine whether: 

""... the evidence [is] capable of producing in the mind of a reasonable person satisfaction, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused?"": Bilick at 337 per King CJ. 

96In making his determination, the trial judge was required to assume that the evidence of primary fact upon which the prosecution relied was accurate. His Honour was further required to draw all inferences from that evidence that were most favourable to the prosecution's case. As those principles were to be applied to this case, his Honour was required to accept the complainant's evidence that sexual intercourse had occurred and that she had not consented to it. 

97In my opinion, his Honour was also required to accept the answer the respondent had given in the ERISP at A132, that a full body massage never included a massage to the genital area. This evidence was of a different nature to his evidence of denial that any sexual intercourse occurred. It was evidence of the invariable manner in which he conducted his practice. It was not evidence of a denial of sexual intercourse on this occasion. It was evidence that sexual intercourse would not have occurred because it never occurred in the provision of a body massage in his business. In my opinion, this evidence was relevant to the Crown's circumstantial case. 

98It follows that ground 4 of the notice of appeal has also been established. 

Should this Court exercise its discretion and not make an order under s 107?

99The respondent submitted that even if this Court upheld any one of the grounds of appeal, it should not make an order under s 107(5) quashing the acquittal. He submitted that the evidence was such that on an appeal, after a trial, an appellate court would quash a conviction as being unreasonable: see PL at [90]. Underpinning the approach referred to in PL was the important consideration that s 107 is a statutory incursion into the principle of double jeopardy, but the legislature had nonetheless recognised that even if the court's jurisdiction under s 107(2) was enlivened, the court retained a discretion pursuant to s 107(5) to either confirm or quash the acquittal against which the appeal was brought. As Spigelman CJ also said in PL, at [87]:

""... the abrogation of the double jeopardy principle is a powerful consideration indicating that the Court was intended to be able to exercise its discretionary powers so as to minimise the injustice associated with a new trial after an acquittal.""

100The respondent submitted that should this case go to trial, there were two bases upon which an appeal from a conviction would be overturned as unreasonable. 

101First, the evidence in support of the third element of the offence would be so flimsy that a conviction based on that evidence would be unreasonable. Further, there was no evidence indicating that, during the course of the massage, the respondent had been acting in a ""sexual sleazy manner"". For example, he did not engage in any sexual banter. The respondent also relied upon that part of the complainant's evidence in which she said that when she observed the respondent leaning his face towards her groin area, he desisted immediately when she said ""no"". 

102Secondly, the respondent submitted that given the very short period of time involved in the act of sexual penetration (on the complainant's evidence this was between 2 and 10 seconds) the Crown could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual penetration was not accidental. In this regard, the respondent relied upon that part of the complainant's evidence in which she said that when the respondent touched her vaginal area, ""[t]he movements he made were exactly the same as the movements he'd use for a massage"". 

103The respondent submitted that it was apparent from this evidence that the ""massage clearly resulted in ambiguous signals being sent to the complainant"". Thus, although the complainant said she thought, when the respondent commenced to massage her vagina, that it was ""weird"", she did not say anything because she was wondering whether she was overreacting and whether what was occurring was normal. The respondent submitted that this case was different from Porteous, where the sexual intercourse ""was not momentary and was totally outside the ordinary course of a massage and could not be regarded as mistaken sexual penetration"". The respondent also submitted that this case was to be distinguished from Salmond where it was clear on the evidence that the penetration was both intentional and sexual in nature.

104The DPP submitted that the Court would not, in the exercise of its discretion under s 107(5), affirm the acquittal. The DPP argued that this was a strong circumstantial case. It submitted that in determining this question, it was necessary for the Court to have regard to the principles to be applied in setting aside a conviction as unreasonable: see M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, including the regard which an appellate court was required to have to the role of the jury and the special position a jury is in when assessing the evidence of witnesses. 

105In my opinion, the respondent's submissions should be rejected. I agree with the DPP that this was a strong circumstantial case. In those circumstances, the orders I propose are:

(1)Verdict of acquittal quashed;

(2)Remit the matter to the District Court for trial. 

106HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA for the reasons set out in her Honour's judgment.

107S G CAMPBELL J: I agree with Beazley JA.

		15 December 2014",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760537,Simpson v R [2012] NSWCCA 246,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  On 8 March 2011, the applicant entered pleas of guilty to the following charges:
Count 1:  aggravated act of indecency contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61O(2);
Count 2:  aggravated indecent assault contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2);
Count 3:  sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years of age contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 66A.
2The offences occurred between 1 May 1997 and 30 January 1998.  The applicant was sentenced in the District Court at Wollongong on 25 November 2011.  
3The offence charged under count 1 carried a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment.  The applicant was sentenced in respect of that offence to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to date from 25 May 2011 and expiring on 24 November 2011.
4The offence charged under count 2 carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  The applicant was sentenced in respect of that offence to a fixed term of 9 months to date from 25 August 2011 and expiring on 24 May 2012.
5The offence charged under count 3 carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  The applicant was sentenced in respect of that offence to a term of 6 years imprisonment to date from 25 February 2012 and expiring on 24 February 2018.  A non-parole period of 3 years was specified.
6The applicant was thus sentenced to a total effective sentence of imprisonment of 6 years and 9 months and a total effective non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months.  In imposing those sentences, her Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount for early pleas of guilty.
7The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds:
(1)The sentencing judge erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness and gravity of the offences by failing to have proper regard to the principles of sentencing and the proper range of sentencing at the time of each of the offences.
(2)The sentences were manifestly excessive having regard to the principles of sentencing and the proper range of sentences imposed at the time that the offences were committed.
(3)The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account delay and the applicant's rehabilitation to mitigate the sentences imposed.
8The matter proceeded before the trial judge on the basis of a statement of agreed facts.  The offences occurred when the complainant was aged between 8 and 9 years, between 1 May 1997 and 30 January 1998.  The applicant had known the complainant all her life.  Her family had lived next door to the applicant and the two families were close.  The complainant spent a great deal of time at the applicant's house.  The complainant regarded the applicant's wife as a second mother and the sentencing judge accepted that both the complainant and the applicant would describe the applicant as a father figure to the complainant.  
9In late 1996, the complainant's family changed addresses.  However, the complainant continued to visit the applicant's home frequently and would often sleep over on Saturday nights.  Initially, she would do so as she would attend church on a Sunday morning with the applicant's wife.  She lost interest in going to church but nonetheless continued to stay at the applicant's home on Saturday night and would remain with the applicant on Sunday morning whilst the applicant's wife went to church.  
10The circumstances of the first count, being an aggravated act of indecency contrary to s 61O(2), were as follows.  On a Sunday morning in about May 1997, the complainant was at the applicant's home.  When she woke up, she saw the applicant watching a video depicting explicit sexual acts.  Whilst the video was playing, the applicant was seated and playing with his penis in her presence.  The complainant said to him ""I don't like it"" and walked away.  The complainant recalled that there were a number of other occasions when the same conduct occurred.  
11The conduct giving rise to the second count, being an act of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2), occurred not long after the complainant's ninth birthday.  On that occasion, the complainant was in the rear garden of the applicant's home when the applicant ""grabbed"" her hand and placed it between his legs on top of his trousers and rubbed her hand over his unexposed erect penis.
12As to the third count, being the offence of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years of age contrary to s 66A, the complainant woke up one Sunday morning when she and the applicant were the only persons at home.  The applicant was naked from the waist down.  He guided her head towards his penis and placed his penis inside her mouth, causing her to ""gag"".  
13The conduct charged in both the second and third counts occurred on 30 December 1997.  The conduct charged in the third count was not an isolated incident.
14Not long after the conduct constituting the third count, the complainant told the applicant that she did not want him to touch her any more.  There was no further offending conduct. 
15The complainant continued to visit and stay at the applicant's home until she was approximately 18 years old.  She first reported these matters to the police and to her family on 11 January 2010.
16In two telephone calls between the complainant and the applicant in June 2010, both of which were recorded pursuant to a surveillance device warrant, the applicant made a number of admissions relating to the offences.  He made further limited admissions to the police on 15 June 2010.  Later, in an electronically recorded interview, the applicant adopted some of the admissions made to the complainant in the telephone conversations.  
Sentencing judge's remarks on sentence
17At the outset of her remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge noted that the penalties for these offences were already high at the time that the applicant had engaged in his offending conduct and had since been increased substantially.  She noted, however, that the applicant was to be sentenced having regard to the range of penalties imposed for these offences in 1997 and 1998 when the offences were committed.
18Her Honour stated that the offences were serious both for victims of such offending conduct and for the community at large.  Her Honour also noted the offences were of the type that were difficult to detect and prove.  She stated that such offences attracted the principles relating to general and personal deterrence and the protection of the community.  
19Her Honour expressed the view that the harm to the victim was a significant factor in considering the appropriate penalty to apply.  She noted that the complainant in this case had been severely affected by the applicant's conduct, which had impacted upon her ability to work, study and sleep, had adversely affected her relationships and friendships.  The complainant had also developed eating disorders and experienced feelings of guilt and worthlessness, flashbacks and panic attacks.
20In dealing with the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour noted that the offences were not isolated and were part of an escalating pattern of offending over a period of about six months.  Her Honour considered the offending was essentially opportunistic, but that there was some limited planning. 
21Her Honour dealt separately with the objective seriousness of the offence of sexual intercourse, observing that the type of penetration was a relevant factor, but of itself did not indicate the seriousness of the particular offence:  see R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434;  150 A Crim R 575;  R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20;  194 A Crim R 1;  R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117.  Her Honour noted that there was no actual bodily harm to the complainant and no overt force or coercion.  Nor were there any threats.  Rather, the applicant had relied upon his authority over the complainant and compliance was achieved through her acceptance of his authority.  
22Her Honour found that there was a breach of trust in that the applicant and the complainant had a very close relationship.  Her Honour noted that the applicant's conduct had no immediately apparent effect on the complainant and she had continued to stay at the applicant's house for a period of years after the offending ceased.  She considered that this had some, although not much, relevance to the applicant's limited understanding of the damage that he was doing.
23Her Honour next dealt with the applicant's subjective circumstances.  At the time of sentencing, the applicant was 70 years of age.  He had a steady work history from the time he was 16 years of age.  He had previous offences of a minor nature, including two of a sexual nature and some minor stealing offences.  All the offences were very old and her Honour considered that they did not bear upon the matters in respect of which he was to be sentenced.  Her Honour noted, however, that the fact of these offences did not assist the applicant in comparison to an offender with no convictions.  
24Her Honour had regard to a report from the Sex and the Violent Offender Therapeutic Program which had assessed the applicant as falling in the low to moderate risk category of re-offending relevant to other male sexual offenders.  That report also revealed that the applicant had a history of sexual abuse as a child.   
25Her Honour ignored references in the pre-sentence report to a history of ""inappropriate and sexually deviant behaviour towards his immediate and extended family as well as towards the general community"", as there was no evidence to support the allegations.  Her Honour also disregarded that part of the pre-sentence report, which indicated Dr Nielssen's opinion, that the applicant had a low risk of recidivism, needed to be qualified because of the applicant's prior history of sexual offending.  Her Honour had already rejected those earlier offences as being relevant to the sentencing task except to the extent indicated at [23] above. 
26Her Honour then considered the applicant's personal circumstances.  As an adult, the applicant had been gainfully employed since he left school at the age of 16 and for the duration of his adult life.  He had established and stable friendships and was known in his immediate community as a person who donated his time assisting local residents, including the young, the elderly and those who had suffered hardships.
27The applicant married at the age of 24 and has four children.  Three are aged in their 40s and the youngest in her mid-30s.  He has maintained a relationship with three of these children but the relationship with the youngest child appears to have broken down.  His wife is a devoutly religious person  Their sexual relationship ceased at about the time his wife became more devout.  He told the psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen, that he had become sexually frustrated as a result. 
28Both Dr Nielssen and the psychologist, Ms Sinclair, expressed the opinion that the applicant's early exposure to repeated inappropriate and abusive sexual experiences would have influenced his attitude to sex and relationships with women.  Ms Sinclair reported that the applicant claimed not to remember the alleged incidents with the complainant.  She attributed this to being a dissociative response and said that this was a familiar coping strategy for the applicant.  Her Honour observed that the applicant had exhibited the same response when giving evidence in court.  For example, in relation to the offence of sexual intercourse, the respondent gave evidence that he was not even sure that it happened.  He added ""if she said it happened I'll go along with it"".  Likewise, when it was suggested to the applicant that this ""intimate behaviour"" had occurred over ""a period of quite a few months"", he responded, ""[s]o she claims"".
29Her Honour commented upon the evidence later in her remarks, first noting that the psychiatric and psychological reports recorded that the applicant lacked insight into the damage the offences had caused the complainant.  Her Honour remarked that this was also apparent from his sworn evidence.  Her Honour considered that the applicant's sense of remorse was ""equivocal"".  Although the applicant had, in various reports and in evidence, expressed some ""limited empathy"" with the victim, he also questioned her motives and behaviour, such as to suggest that she was in some way responsible for his offending behaviour.  His statement to the probation and parole officer, ""I never did anything she did not want to do"", was emblematic of this attitude.  Her Honour accepted, however, that the pleas of guilty were indicative of some limited remorse, although they were entered in the face of a strong Crown case.  
30In dealing with the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, her Honour again noted that in the report from the Sexual and Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program the applicant had been assessed as at a ""low to moderate risk"" of re-offending.  Her Honour referred to the absence of similar offences committed against young children and observed the applicant had the support of friends and that his life had been one of full-time employment and positive engagement in the community.  Accordingly, her Honour considered that the applicant was ""unlikely or less likely than most offenders to re-offend"".
31Her Honour was aware of the necessity to sentence the applicant in accordance with the penalties imposed for these offences at the time they were committed.  In this regard, her Honour had regard to the following decisions:  R v H (1994) 74 A Crim R 41;  R v Moore (1995) 77 A Crim R 577;  R v Boyd (1995) 81 A Crim R 260;  R v Brooker (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 21 February 1996);  R v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15;  R v Maher [2000] NSWCCA 147.  
32Her Honour considered these cases assisted in formulating the appropriate penalties to be imposed upon the applicant.  In referring to them, her Honour was aware the sentences imposed in other cases were of assistance to the extent that they suggested an appropriate range, but not the sentence to be imposed.Applicant's submissions
Grounds 1 and 2
33In her helpful submissions, counsel for the applicant outlined the legislative history relating to the sentences prescribed for the offences concerned.  The purpose of these submissions was to emphasise the significantly different sentencing principles now in force as compared to the time when the offences were committed and the care that was needed to ensure that present sentencing principles did not creep into the considerations relevant to sentencing had the applicant been brought to account at about the time of the offending conduct.  
34At the time that these offences were committed, sentences were governed by the Sentencing Act 1989.  That Act was concerned to promote ""truth in sentencing"" and, in particular, to provide that offenders who had served the minimum period of imprisonment were to be considered for release on parole for the residue of their sentence.   
35The applicant submitted that at the time of his offending conduct, the underlying philosophy of sentencing was that imprisonment was a last resort:  see R v James (1985) 14  A Crim R 364;  R v O'Connor (1986) 23 A Crim R 50.  That philosophy was replicated in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 5(1).  However, that Act also introduced other significant sentencing requirements including a statement of the objects of sentencing and provisions specifying the aggravating and mitigating circumstances that were to be taken into account in sentencing:  s 21A.  
36Further, at the time these offences were committed, standard non-parole periods had not been introduced.  The statutory regime for standard non-parole periods was not introduced until February 2003.  This was important as it was recognised, at least until the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39;  244 CLR 120, that the effect of standard non-parole periods had been to increase sentences generally.  The standard non-parole period introduced for an offence contrary to s 66A was 15 years:  see the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, Sch 2[1], Sch 1[4].  The same Act increased the maximum penalty for an offence under s 66A from 20 years to 25 years.  A standard non-parole period of 5 years was introduced for an offence under s 61M(2).  The standard non-parole period was later increased to 8 years:  the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007, Sch 1[10].  The maximum penalties for offences under s 61M(2) and s 61O(2) remained the same.  
37Counsel for the applicant contended that although her Honour expressed her awareness of the need to sentence in accordance with the principles that applied at the time that the offences were committed, her Honour's reasons were based upon legal principles and notions developed subsequent to the occurrence of the offending conduct.  
38Two such matters were identified.  First, counsel submitted that her Honour's comment that the type of penetration could not by itself indicate the seriousness of the offence and the authorities she relied on to support that proposition, represented principles developed later than the time at which the offences occurred.  Counsel submitted that the relevant law was as stated in R v O'Donnell (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 1 July 1994), that ""[f]ellatio ... is clearly less criminal than, say, anal or vaginal penetration"".  
39Secondly, counsel submitted that in using the language of ""mid-range of objective seriousness"" in respect of the offence under s 66A, her Honour had engaged in the type of reasoning that, until the decision of the High Court in Muldrock represented the approach in New South Wales to sentencing where a standard non-parole period was prescribed.
40Counsel submitted that this approach was reflected in sentencing statistics for 1994 where 65 per cent of offenders received a full-time custodial sentence where the sexual intercourse involved was fellatio, whereas  the total for all offenders sentenced for an offence contrary to s 66A was 83 per cent.  Counsel also referred to the sentencing statistics in respect of the other two offences.  In the case of an offence contrary to s 61M(2), only 25 per cent of offenders received a custodial sentence.  The medium full term was 3 years and the medium minimum term was 1 year.  
41Further, in R v Baxter (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 26 May 1994), the Court declined to lay down a requirement that a custodial sentence should ordinarily be imposed in relation to a charge of an act of indecency.
42Counsel next referred to the Judicial Commission statistics for the period 2000-2002.  Those statistics revealed that for offences contrary to s 66A, 83 per cent of offenders received a full-time custodial sentence.  The sentences ranged from 12 months to 15 years, with a median term of 5 years.  A median term of 5 years also applied to consecutive sentences.  In relation to non-consecutive sentences, the median term of imprisonment was 48 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.  The statistics further revealed that less than 15 per cent of the offenders were over the age of 60 years at the time of sentencing and of that group of offenders, over half of the offenders received full-time custodial sentences.  
43Counsel for the applicant submitted that the cases relied upon by her Honour for the purposes of determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed:  see above at [31], should not have been used, as they did not represent a true range of sentences imposed at the relevant time.  Further, the facts in those cases demonstrated criminal conduct of much greater gravity than was involved in the applicant's offending conduct.  Counsel referred to a series of cases as providing a more balanced and appropriate overview of the range of sentences that were being imposed in respect of similar offending at the time of the applicant's offending conduct.  An examination of those cases follows. Comparable case studies
(a)  Cases relied upon by the trial judge
44There was no dispute that the applicant is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with sentencing standards current at the time of his offending:  see R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129;  PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84.  Her Honour acknowledged the applicability of that principle.  However, the applicant challenged the cases relied upon by her Honour in determining the appropriate penalties to be imposed on the basis that those cases were not sufficiently comparable to the factual circumstances involved in the applicant's offending.  Counsel for the applicant advanced a number of authorities, which she contended more appropriately reflected the range of sentences applicable at the time of his offending conduct.  
45The authorities relied upon by her Honour are identified above at [31].  A short analysis of those cases follows.
46In Davis, the offender was convicted in April 1997, after a trial by jury, of three separate offences, namely, one offence contrary to the Crimes Act, s 66A being an act of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age;  one offence contrary to s 61M(2) being an indecent assault on a child under 10 years of age;  and one offence contrary to s 61O(2) being the incitement of a child under the age of 10 years to commit an act of indecency.  
47The offences were committed in 1996 against the same child and were part of conduct committed on the one occasion.  The s 66A offence involved anal and vaginal penetration of a child aged 9 years.  The offender, a friend of the victim's stepfather, had been in a position of responsibility looking after the victim.  The s 61M(2) offence involved masturbation in front of the victim whilst watching a pornographic film.  
48The trial judge imposed a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 2 years in respect of the s 66A offence, which carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  As to the s 61M(2) and s 61O offences, his Honour imposed fixed terms of 2 years to be served concurrently.  
49It is not apparent from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal whether the latter two offences were to be served concurrently with the s 66A offence or only with each other.  The Court's concern in the judgment was with the s 66A offence.  It considered a number of comparable cases so as to determine whether the sentence imposed was excessive.  
50Although the Court considered that the sentence imposed was at the top of the range, it declined to reduce the sentence imposed.  In coming to that conclusion, Wood CJ at CL, at [61], described the offence with which he was dealing as having involved an ""abuse of trust"" in respect of a child of tender years.  His Honour also noted that it was a ""continuing event without any element of premeditation"".  
51In Maher, the offender was sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment for an offence under the Crimes Act, s 61I which involved vaginal penetration and forcible rape of the victim.  The maximum penalty for the offence was 14 years imprisonment.  The offender was also sentenced to a minimum term of 5 years and an additional term of 3 years, cumulative on the first sentence, in respect of an offence against the Crimes Act, s 61J which also involved forcible rape and vaginal penetration.  The appeal against sentence was dismissed by the Court.
52In H, the offender pleaded guilty to 10 sexual offences committed on his daughter and one sexual offence against another young girl.  The offender's daughter was 12 months old at the time of the first offence, and 12 years old at the time of the last offence.  Two of the charges involved sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 10 and 16 and under the authority of the accused in contravention of s 66C(2).  The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years.  The two offences involved penile penetration of the victim's vagina when the victim was over the age of 10.  The other eight offences against the daughter, and the one offence against the daughter's friend, consisted of various acts of indecency in contravention of ss 76 and 61E.  The maximum penalty for these offences ranged from 2 to 6 years respectively.  
53The offender was sentenced to 11 years and 6 months imprisonment with an additional term of 5 years.  The appeal against sentence was allowed on the basis of a detailed comparison with sentences imposed in similar cases.  He was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years with an additional term of 3 years.  
54In Boyd, the offender was convicted, after a trial by jury, of having sexual intercourse with a child of the age of 5 years contrary to s 66A.  The offence occurred sometime between 1990 to 1991 and consisted of anal intercourse for a period of approximately 25 minutes.  The victim was the offender's son.  The offender was sentenced to a minimum term of 3 years imprisonment and an additional term of 2 years.  
55In Brooker, the offender pleaded guilty in relation to the offence of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years.  The offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  The victim was 4 years of age at the time of the offence, which occurred in 1994.  The offence involved the offender digitally penetrating the victim causing serious physical injury.  The offender had a lengthy criminal history.  The offender was sentenced by the trial judge to a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 2 years.  The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was deemed manifestly inadequate by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
56The offender was re-sentenced on appeal to a minimum term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months.  Gleeson CJ (Ireland J agreeing) considered that some allowance was required to be given for the plea of guilty, albeit that the Crown case against the offender was overwhelming.  The Chief Justice also took into account the principle of ""double jeopardy"" which, at that time, operated in an offender's favour in respect of a successful Crown appeal.  There was also evidence that the offender suffered from a physical ailment and his condition was such that he would suffer from incarceration to a greater degree than would ordinarily be the case.  Meagher JA dissented.  His Honour would have imposed close to the maximum sentence, given the savagery of the attack, the offender's criminal history and his propensity to commit this sort of offence. 
57In Moore, the offender was sentenced in respect of three counts of indecent assault in circumstances of aggravation:  Crimes Act, s 61M(1);  attempted sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation:  s 61J(1) and sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation:  s 61J(1).  Four further offences were taken into account when the offender was being sentenced for the third offence.  The offences occurred in the period 1991 to 1992.  The three counts occurred in circumstances where the offender had been placed on recognizance for sexual interference with the same victim, his stepdaughter, and in respect of whom he was in a position of authority.  
58The trial judge had imposed concurrent sentences, the longest of which involved a minimum sentence of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years in respect of the s 61J(1) (aggravated sexual intercourse) offence.  On appeal, this was held to be manifestly excessive having regard to sentencing trends at that time.  The offender was re-sentenced for the s 61J(1) offence to a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 3 years imprisonment.  The sentence in respect of the attempted sexual intercourse offence was reduced from 8 years to 4 years.  The three sentences were imposed with concurrent effect notwithstanding that they occurred on separate occasions.  That approach would now be seen to be erroneous given the principles stated in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57;  194 CLR 610.  
(b)  Cases relied upon by the applicant on the appeal
59The applicant's written submissions contended that the following cases depicted a more balanced and appropriate sentencing range. 
60In R v ELW (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 17 December 1993), the offender was sentenced to a minimum term of 3 years imprisonment with an additional term of 1 year in respect of four offences.  Those offences were an offence against s 66A and three offences of indecent assault.  The relevant acts involved touching the victim's vagina and the offender placing his penis into the victim's mouth.  The victim was the offender's six year old granddaughter.  This sentence was held by this Court to be within ""the range of proper sentencing discretion"".  
61In R v Page (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 25 February 1994), the offender was sentenced in relation to six counts relating to the first victim and one count in relation to the second victim, who was the first victim's sister.  In respect of the first victim, there were three counts of indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years:  s 61E(1A);  two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years:  s 66A;  and one count of indecency towards a person under the age of 16 years and under his authority.  In respect of the second victim, the offender was sentenced on one count of an act of indecency upon a person under the age of 16.
62In relation to the first victim, the offences took place in the period 1988 to 1990, when the victim was between the ages of 8 and 9.  The offences of sexual intercourse included acts of cunnilingus and the offences of indecent assault included touching the victim on the outside of the vagina at various times, committed in circumstances where the victim requested that he not commit the acts, and an act of masturbation in front of the victim leading to ejaculation.  The sentence imposed in respect of all the offences was a minimum term of 3 years imprisonment and an additional term of 1 year.  
63The offender was a close family friend of the victims' family and the offences constituted an abuse of trust.  The Court dismissed the offender's appeal against sentence.  McInerney J (Grove and Sully JJ agreeing) stated, at 3:
""In my view, having regard to the age and background of the applicant and the likelihood of him not transgressing again, an additional term to allow for his rehabilitation in excess of 1 year was not warranted. It is my view that the sentences imposed on the applicant, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences, were well within the range of his Honour's sentencing discretion ...""
64In R v Morrow [1999] NSWCCA 64, the offender pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse with a person 9 years of age and not guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 10 and 16 years, namely 10 years, and one count of aggravated indecent assault.  The plea of guilty was accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment.  The maximum penalty for the offence was 20 years imprisonment.  The court deferred passing sentence and ordered the offender to be released on a recognizance under the Crimes Act, s 558 requiring good behaviour for 5 years and to appear for sentence if and when called upon at any time within the period.  
65The offender was intellectually disabled and suffered from serious depression.  The offence involved penile penetration of the victim.  The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the non-custodial sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.  
66In R v Rapley [1999] NSWCCA 302, the offender pleaded guilty to five charges involving the sexual abuse of his 8 year old granddaughter.  There were two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age contrary to s 66A, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  There were three counts of aggravated indecent assault against a person under 10 years of age contrary to s 61M(2), carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  The sentencing judge deferred passing sentence and ordered the offender's release upon his entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of 5 years.  The Crown appealed against the sentence on the basis that it was manifestly inadequate and did not reflect the objective criminality of the offences.
67The victim's father had caught the offender in the process of the sexual conduct and the offender had admitted guilt and confessed to additional offences against the victim.  The Court held that the sentencing discretion had miscarried in light of the objective seriousness of the offences.  The offender was re-sentenced to minimum terms of imprisonment of 18 months to be served concurrently, with additional terms of 6 months for the offences under s 66A, and fixed terms of 12 months for the offences under s 61M(2) to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the sentences under s 66A.  
68In R v KBM [2004] NSWCCA 123, the offender pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 contrary to s 66A.  The victim was 9 years old and the offender was close to his 14th birthday at the time of the offence.  The offence involved oral intercourse, in the form of fellatio.  The victim and offender attended the same school.  The offender was from an underprivileged background, of Aboriginal descent and had also been the victim of alleged sexual assault.  The offender was initially sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months.  He was re-sentenced by the Court to a non-parole period of 4 months and 29 days to be released on the date of judgment.  
69In my opinion not all these cases were relevantly comparable.  The personal circumstances of the offender in each of KBM and Morrow were such as not to render those cases of any utility when seeking to gauge the appropriate sentencing range for the offences committed here.  Nor is Rapley of assistance, as it involved a Crown appeal.  
Consideration
70Each occasion of criminal offending is individual and unique in its circumstances.  The court's task is to impose a sentence that reflects the objective criminality involved and which appropriately has regard to the personal circumstances of the offender.  Regard must also be had to the other objectives of sentencing.  The purposes of sentencing are now statutorily encoded in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 3A which identifies the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence as follows: 
""(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,(c)to protect the community from the offender,(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender ..."" 
71The offending in the present case was of sexual offences that involved a serious abuse of trust.  General deterrence is of particular importance in respect of such criminal offending.  All individuals are entitled to feel safe from abuse, including sexual abuse, whether they be in their own home, the homes of friends, or on the street.  In particular, young persons of tender years are entitled to be safe and to feel protected when in the company of persons who stand in a position of trust in relation to them.  In the circumstances of the present case, specific deterrence was also of importance, given the applicant's inability to recognise or understand the full nature of his wrongdoing.  
72Although the applicant identified specific aspects of her Honour's sentencing approach as indicative of error, the principal complaint was that the sentences imposed were outside a proper sentencing range, having regard to sentences imposed in cases that were sufficiently comparable to constitute an appropriate guide to the sentence that ought to have been imposed in the present case. 
73The Crown submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated any error of principle in her Honour's approach to the sentence in this case.  In terms of the correct approach to sentencing in respect of stale offences, the Crown relied upon the principles stated by Howie J in Regina v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534;  117 A Crim R 497 at [67]-[71].  In summary and omitting the cases cited, the relevant principles include the following propositions.  The court must sentence having regard to the maximum penalty for the offence, the maximum penalty being intended for the worst category of case.  If there is an available pattern of sentencing discernible from the decided cases, that pattern will indicate an appropriate range of sentence for the particular offending involved in the case before the court.  The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed and the maximum penalty applicable for the offence in respect of which sentences are being imposed are of focal importance.  In particular, his Honour stated, at [70]:
""The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence: Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 549, and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed: Veen v The Queen (1979) 143 CLR 458. Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence.""
74I have omitted from this summary the references Howie J made to the requirement of the court to consider where in the range of seriousness the particular conduct fell.  It is possible the language used by his Honour involved an approach to sentencing that has now been rejected by the High Court in Muldrock.  
75In my opinion, it has not been demonstrated that her Honour erred, as a matter of principle, in her approach to the sentencing task.  In particular, her Honour was aware that the applicant fell to be sentenced having regard to the range of sentences that would have been imposed had the applicant been sentenced at about the time of his offending conduct.  Through her own researches and without any assistance on this point from counsel for the applicant, her Honour considered a number of cases which, as she said: 
""What can be gleaned from considering comparable cases is that they might only suggest an appropriate range and not the appropriate sentence.  Nevertheless, consideration of those cases has assisted in formulating the appropriate penalty for the matters in this particular case.""  
There was no error in this approach nor, having regard to the sentences imposed in those cases, with the sentence imposed by her Honour. 
76Her Honour also expressly referred to the maximum sentence for each offence, thus demonstrating that she understood that the applicant was to be sentenced having regard to the objective seriousness of each offence and the requirement that the sentence imposed was to be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence actually committed:  see Veen v The Queen [1979] HCA 7;  143 CLR 458;  R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349.  
77On the issue of sentencing patterns it has been observed that with 'old' offences there are manifest difficulties in discovering past sentencing patterns and determining if differences are material:  MJR at [61] per Mason P.  However, the principle established by this Court in R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 is that a sentencing judge should have regard to the range of sentences imposed at the time of the commission of the offence or offences in question.
78In Moon, Whealy J applied Shore and additionally referred to the decision of this Court in Regina v Watson [1999] NSWCCA 227 emphasising the difficulty of applying the principle.  His Honour observed, at [23]:
""Although the principle stated in Shore is clear, its application in any particular appeal is often a difficult matter. First, there is a need to have a clear picture as to the range of penalties imposed at the earlier point of time ... Secondly, the perceived difference between the range of sentences disclosed at the earlier point of time and the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge may reveal a discrepancy. Nevertheless it may be one of not so high a kind that the appellate court should interfere (Shore p 43).""
79The principle generally stated is that a sentencing court attempts from information available to it to fashion the type of sentence that might have been imposed at a time proximate to the date of offending:  PH v R [2009] NSWCCA 161 at [27] per Howie J (Grove and R A Hulme JJ agreeing).  His Honour in that case also observed, at [28]:
""This manner in proceeding to sentence for 'old offences' applies both to the head sentence and the non-parole period ...""
80However, on the appeal, for the first time in the applicant's case, the Court was referred to a number of additional authorities.  The additional authorities provide a wider spectrum of factual circumstances and sentences imposed than those considered by her Honour.  I have concluded that ELW and Page assist in establishing a relevant pattern of sentencing from which a trend may be discerned and as such they are instructive in determining the appropriate sentence in this case.
81Two responses of the Crown should be mentioned at this point.  First, the Crown submitted that the applicant's counsel, who was not the counsel representing the applicant on the present application for leave to appeal, did not rely upon this argument in the court below.  Nor did she assist the trial judge by referring to the cases upon which it is now sought to rely.  In this regard, the Crown referred to the remarks of Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, at [81], that an appeal against sentence involves this Court's review of a discretionary judgment where error has been identified.  Adopting the approach taken by the Victorian Court of Appeal, a sentence appeal is not: 
""... the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below.  The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea ... The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence:  Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11];  Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13], [18];  Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].""
82His Honour continued, at [82]:
""This approach reflects the primacy of the rule that appeal grounds should relate to arguments put, and decisions made, at first instance.  At the same time, criminal appellate courts should be able to correct a miscarriage of justice, or serious injustice, in the clear and rare cases where the relevant matter has not been relied upon at first instance.""
83Secondly, the Crown further submitted that, in any event, even if error was identified, no other sentence was warranted in law:  Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3).
84The question for this Court is whether, in accordance with the principles discussed, appealable error has been demonstrated.  As I have said, no error in her Honour's sentencing approach has been identified.  The only question is whether, by a consideration of the wider range of cases now made available to the Court, it has been demonstrated that the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive, having regard to the range of sentences that were imposed for the offences at the time of the offending conduct.  
85Having considered the cases, I have reached the conclusion that her Honour imposed a total sentence for the s 66A offence, which was outside the range of sentences imposed for offences committed at the time of the applicant's offending. In coming to the conclusion that the total sentence imposed for that offence was excessive, I am not satisfied that the non-parole period set by her Honour was excessive.  To the extent that the cases to which the applicant referred are of assistance, the non-parole period was the same as the sentences imposed in ELW and Page.  The non-parole period was not out of range even when regard is had to Rapley, which, as I have said, involved a Crown appeal.  Each of those cases involved pleas of guilty.  The manifestly excessive aspect of her Honour's sentence, in my opinion, lay only in setting the additional term at 3 years and it follows that some other sentence is warranted in law.  Accordingly, it is appropriate for this Court to re-sentence. 
86In approaching the re-sentencing task in respect of the s 66A offence, I adopt the various findings made by the trial judge as to conduct involved, the impact upon the victim, the serious breach of trust involved and the applicant's continuing inability to understand the nature and seriousness of his criminal conduct.  I have already referred to the need for specific deterrence in that regard and to this being an offence for which general deterrence is an important consideration in the sentencing process.  This Court should make a finding of special circumstances, as did her Honour.  
87I also agree with her Honour's assessment as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  The applicant has not established that her Honour erred in failing to take into account the applicant's rehabilitation as a mitigating factor.  I have referred to her Honour's remarks in that regard, including her reference to the applicant's subsequent non-offending and his positive employment history and community involvement.  Nonetheless, she was entitled to take into account the assessment made by the Sexual and Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program that the applicant had a low to moderate risk of re-offending.  The applicant's inability to understand the serious and criminal aspect of his behaviour was relevant to this assessment.
88In my opinion, the sentence that ought to be imposed in respect of the s 66A offence is a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 16 months.
89Insofar as the other two offences are concerned, I am of the opinion that they have not been shown to be excessive.  Nor do I consider there was any error in her Honour having partially accumulated the sentences, as the applicant contended.  That was required by the application of the principles stated by the High Court in Pearce, at [45]-[47], per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ.  
90Counsel for the applicant submitted that at the time of the applicant's offending, Pearce had not been decided.  She submitted that the relevant principle to be applied was that stated by the High Court in Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70;  166 CLR 59.  There, the Court, at 63, had stated:
""... an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred.""
91The Court in Pearce stated the correct approach to sentencing.  Her Honour was required to sentence in accordance with those principles.  In any event, it is at least possible that the applicant would have been sentenced after Pearce was decided.  Accordingly, to the extent that the cases relied upon all involved concurrent sentences, I consider that this Court is not bound to impose concurrent sentences.  However, in re-sentencing the applicant, it will be appropriate to consider the total sentence imposed to determine whether the accumulation ordered by her Honour should be adjusted so as to impose a sentence which in its totality is appropriate, having regard to the range of sentences that applied at the time of the applicant's offending and so as to take account of the finding of special circumstances.  This has resulted in a slight adjustment of the period of accumulation from that ordered by her Honour.
92Taking those factors into account, I would propose the following orders: 
1.Grant leave to appeal against sentence;
2.Appeal allowed in part;
3.Quash the sentence imposed by the trial judge in respect of count 3;
4.Re-sentence the appellant as follows: 
(i)As to the offence charged under count 1, being an offence contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61O(2), a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to date from 25 May 2011 and to expire on 24 November 2011;
(ii)As to the offence charged under count 2, being an offence contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2), a fixed term of 9 months to date from 25 August 2011 and to expire on 24 May 2012;
(iii)As to the offence charged under count 3, being an offence contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 66A, a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 25 October 2011 and to expire on 24 October 2014 and an additional term of 16 months to commence on 25 October 2014 and to expire on 24 February 2016;
5.The first date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released is 24 October 2014;
6.The total effective sentence is 4 years and 9 months imprisonment and the total effective non-parole period is 3 years and 5 months.
93HALL J:  I agree with Beazley JA.
94S G CAMPBELL J:  I agree with Beazley JA.

		23 November 2012",2012-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760538,Jayde FARRELL v R [2012] NSWCCA 245,"Judgment

1HOEBEN JA: I agree with Hidden J and the orders which he proposes.

2HIDDEN J: At a trial in the District Court the applicant, Jayde Farrell, was found guilty of supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy, an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The trial judge, Bennett DCJ, sentenced him to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, to date from 1 May 2010. The sentence was backdated to that day to take account of a discrete period of pre-sentence custody. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.

Facts

3The offence was committed in the course of a criminal enterprise in which the applicant was involved with Blake William Turner. Mr Turner sold ecstasy to an undercover police operative on four occasions between February and March 2007. On three occasions in February 100 tablets were supplied, on each occasion for $2,000. On 1 March, 500 tablets were supplied for $8,500. In all, 229.44 grams of the drug were supplied, the prescribed commercial quantity being 125 grams. 

4It was the Crown case at the trial that the applicant was the source of the drugs which Mr Turner supplied to the undercover officer, and that he was involved in the enterprise for profit. It is unnecessary to detail the body of evidence against him, except to note that it included a number of intercepted telephone conversations and text messages, and the finding of more than half of the money paid by the undercover officer in his possession when he was arrested. 

5In his remarks on sentence, Judge Bennett said that it was not clear whether the applicant's ""status in these transactions was higher than Turner in some sort of hierarchical structure, or whether he was in a partnership with Turner upon an equal footing or a near to equal footing with him, but with access to sources in addition to those that Turner had available."" His Honour found it ""more probable than not that the latter was the case."" He noted that the applicant was not a user of ecstasy, and found that he had ""embarked upon this enterprise with organisation and planning for the sole purpose of making money."" 

Subjective case

6The applicant was 26 years old at the time of the offence and 30 years old when he was sentenced. He is now 32. His criminal history consists of an offence of dishonesty committed when he was a juvenile, which his Honour saw as of little, if any, significance. His upbringing was not free of difficulty, but nothing about it casts any light upon his involvement in the offence. He is married, although without children. His wife and his mother provided statements for the purpose of the sentence proceedings, and they were supportive of him. He attained his Higher School Certificate, and completed a TAFE course in fine arts. He joined the army 3 years before the offence. Mr Turner was also in the army, and they were members of the same unit. 

7Before Judge Bennett was a report of Dr Samson Roberts, psychiatrist. The applicant did not admit the offence, but Dr Roberts expressed the opinion that some explanation for his criminality might be found in his mental state at the time, engendered by personal difficulties and substance abuse. His Honour considered that opinion unreliable, finding that the history provided to Dr Roberts was inconsistent with the evidence in the trial of the applicant's conduct and with material in a pre-sentence report. No complaint about that finding is made in this application. 

8Turning his attention to mitigating factors, his Honour noted that the applicant had maintained his innocence of the offence notwithstanding the jury's verdict. Apparently referring to his account to Dr Roberts of personal difficulties in his life, his Honour noted that he appeared to see those difficulties as ""the product of the attitude of others."" His Honour found that he failed ""to demonstrate any capacity for self-examination for his own deficiencies that might have contributed to his difficulties at work and in his personal life."" His Honour doubted ""his capacity for introspection and realisation that he has done significant wrong,"" and saw a role for specific deterrence, as well as general deterrence, in the sentencing exercise. 

9His Honour considered the question of special circumstances but was not persuaded that they had been established. That conclusion is the subject of complaint.

Turner

10For his part in the criminal enterprise, Blake Turner pleaded guilty to ongoing supply of ecstasy, an offence under s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, which also carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment but not a standard non-parole period. He was sentenced by another judge, Armitage ADCJ, to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. A number of related matters of a minor nature were taken into account on a Form 1, but nothing turns on this for present purposes. He was sentenced before the applicant, and Judge Bennett had the remarks on sentence of Acting Judge Armitage. 

11Mr Turner was aged between 22 and 23 years old at the time of the offence, and was 23 at the time of sentence. Like the applicant, he had a minor criminal history of no significance. Unlike the applicant, however, he had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was accepted to be remorseful. Acting Judge Armitage found that he had ""a genuine desire to improve himself and to succeed in a business career"", and that he was unlikely to re-offend. 

12Mr Turner had not given evidence, but had told a Probation and Parole officer who prepared a report that he had acted alone and that the present applicant was not involved. His Honour found it difficult to determine ""with any certainty, precisely what sort of operation"" he had been engaged in. It was apparent from the statement of facts that it was alleged that he had been in some way assisted by the applicant, but his Honour found that the ""nature of that alleged assistance is not at all clear... ."" His Honour found that Mr Turner had supplied the drugs for profit, but could not determine what the arrangement with the applicant had been. 

The application

13There are two grounds of the present application: that there is unjustified disparity between the sentence passed upon the applicant and that passed upon Mr Turner, and that Judge Bennett should have found special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. As I am satisfied that the ground of disparity is made out, I do not find it necessary to determine the ground concerning special circumstances. Whether there are special circumstances would be a matter for this court to determine, in its own discretion, on re-sentence. 

14The issue of parity of sentence was raised in submissions to Judge Bennett, but in his remarks his Honour did not expressly deal with it. However, I have referred earlier to his finding that the applicant was on an equal or near to equal footing with Mr Turner, albeit with access to sources of the drug additional to those available to Mr Turner. His Honour also referred to evidence in the trial of intercepted telephone calls from which it appeared that the applicant, unlike Mr Turner, ""was a man in control, using care not to make overtly incriminating representations, and strident in his [efforts] to prevent Turner from doing so whilst he was engaging with him in conversation."" As I have said, both offenders were found to have been involved in the enterprise for profit. His Honour also noted that, while both men stood for sentence for offences carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years, the offence to which Mr Turner pleaded guilty did not carry a standard non-parole period. 

15There is no need to restate the principles bearing upon parity of sentence. They were dealt with comprehensively in the decision of this court in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60, 77 NSWLR 540, and revisited by the High Court in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49, 244 CLR 462. The principles continue to apply in cases where participants in the same criminal enterprise have been charged with different crimes although, depending on the circumstances of the case, there may be practical difficulties in their application. No such difficulties arise here. The applicant and Mr Turner were sentenced for offences carrying the same maximum penalty, arising from the same criminal activity.

16The fact that the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy, for which the applicant was sentenced, carries a standard non-parole period conveys that the legislature sees it as more serious than the offence of ongoing supply, for which Mr Turner was sentenced. Judge Bennett sentenced the applicant before the High Court handed down its decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, 244 CLR 120, having regard to the standard non-parole period in accordance with the law as it then stood. However, there is no ground of the application arising from that approach and it does not bear upon the issue of parity.

17Acting Judge Armitage allowed Mr Turner a 25% discount of sentence for his plea of guilty. The sentenced imposed being 4 years, the starting point must have been 5 years and 4 months. The applicant's sentence is 9 years. The disparity is marked. The sentence passed upon Mr Turner was undoubtedly lenient, but the Crown prosecutor in this court did not submit that it was inadequate. 

18True it is that there were differences in the cases of the two men which warranted a heavier sentence for the applicant. Although Judge Bennett saw the roles of the two men in the offending as much the same, the applicant might fairly be seen as somewhat more in control of the enterprise than Mr Turner. Mr Turner is younger than the applicant and, unlike the applicant, had the benefit of positive findings that he was remorseful and unlikely to re-offend. Nevertheless, making due allowance for those matters and for the fact that the applicant's offence carried a standard non-parole period, I am of a view that the difference in the sentences passed upon the two men is excessive and is such as to engender in the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance. I am satisfied that this court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant.

Re-sentence

19On the question of re-sentence there is another matter properly to be taken into account. The applicant was arrested on 1 March 2007, but the trial at which he was found guilty did not come to hearing until October 2010. Apparently there was an earlier trial which aborted, and there were unexpected difficulties in re-listing the matter for trial. None of these developments was the fault of the applicant or his legal representatives. 

20The statements of his wife and his mother attested to the stress he underwent during this lengthy period and the deleterious effects it had on his relationship with them. After a period in custody following his arrest, he was released on bail. He developed something of an obsession with bodybuilding and began to use steroids to excess, a matter about which both his mother and Dr Roberts expressed concern. He obtained employment with a company supplying vitamin supplements for fitness and bodybuilding and his employer, aware of the charge which he was facing, supplied a favourable testimonial. 

21He has an artistic bent and in this court, for the purpose of re-sentence, we received a recent statement by the acting co-ordinator of the Malabar Art Unit within the Long Bay Correctional Complex. The unit provides education in art, and the statement attests to his exemplary behaviour and his assistance of others in that course. Moreover, the display of some of his works in the Boom Gate Gallery at that prison have attracted the interest of a well known art dealer.

22Taking into account all the circumstances, and seeking to achieve an appropriate relativity with the sentence passed upon Mr Turner, I consider that the proper sentence is imprisonment for 6 ½ years. I would find special circumstances, not because such a finding was made in Mr Turner's case but because of the applicant's subjective circumstances. He must serve a substantial period in custody before being eligible for release on parole. He has the capacity and the skills to rehabilitate himself, but I am satisfied that that process would be assisted by a lengthy period of conditional liberty subject to supervision and the sanction of parole. I would fix a non-parole period of 4 years.

23Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and quash the sentence passed in the District Court. I would re-sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 6 ½ years, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing on 1 May 2010 and expiring on 30 April 2014, and a balance of term of 2 ½ years, commencing on 1 May 2014 and expiring on 31 October 2016.

2760541,Somba v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 214,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Hall J.

2HALL J: The applicant, Hans Christian Somba, seeks leave to appeal from three sentences imposed on him by the District Court, her Honour Hock DCJ on 4 March 2011. He was charged with three offences under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act"") as follows:
Count 1: Aggravated armed robbery in company, namely being armed with a dangerous weapon on 16 August 2008; s 97(2) of the Act.
Count 2:Aggravated assault with intent to rob, namely being armed with a dangerous weapon on 27 August 2008; s 97(2) of the Act.
Count 3: Aggravated assault with intent to rob, namely being armed with a dangerous weapon on 27 August 2008; s 97(2) of the Act.

3The above offences were committed on the dates and at the branches of the Bank of Queensland as follows:
(i) Kensington branch on 16 August 2008 (Count 1).
(ii)The Rocks branch on 22 August 2008 (Count 2).
(iii)The Newtown branch on 27 August 2008 (Count 3).

4In respect of the counts:
(i)Count 1 was particularised as robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon and being in company (with co-offender Carlo Dizon). 
(ii)Counts 2 and 3 were each particularised as assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to rob, in company with Dizon and another co-offender, John Birch.
5The applicant asked for offences under ss 154A(1)(a)/ 117 of the Act (relating to Take and Drive Conveyance without the consent of the owner, maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment) to be taken into account on a Form 1. The first offence was attached to a Form 1 in relation to Count 1. The second was attached to a Form 1 in respect of Count 3.

The sentences
6The particulars of the sentences imposed are as follows:
(i) Sentence in respect of Count 1: Taking into account the first matter on the Form 1, a term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months to commence on 1 September 2008 and to expire on 28 February 2014.

(ii) Sentence in respect of Count 2: A term of imprisonment of 5 years to commence on 1 September 2010 and expire on 31 August 2015. 

(iii) Sentence in respect of Count 3: Taking into account the second matter on the Form 1, a total term of imprisonment of 8 years comprising a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 1 September 2011 and to expire on 31 August 2016. A parole period of 3 years to commence on 1 September 2016 and to expire on 31 August 2019.

7The total effective sentence of imprisonment imposed for the three counts was a non-parole period of 8 years to date from 1 September 2008 to 31 August 2016 and a balance of 3 years to expire on 31 August 2019.

8A statement of agreed facts was tendered on sentence (Exhibit C). 

9In her Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge set out in summary the relevant facts concerning each offence as follows:

""Count 1

On Saturday 16 August 2008 the offenders entered the Bank of Queensland located at Anzac Parade, Kensington. Dizon was armed with a single barrel shot gun. He demanded money and access to the inner area of the bank. Bank staff then let both offenders into the area restricted to staff where they stole in excess of $21,870. The event was captured on closed circuit television, although Dizon wore a cap and sunglasses. The offenders made their escape in a dark coloured hatchback, the first matter on the Form 1 and to be taken into account on this count. Only $500 of the money stolen was ever recovered. 

Count 2

On Wednesday 27 August 2008 both offenders entered the Bank of Queensland situated at The Rocks in Sydney. A co-offender John Birch, after initially entering the bank, kept watch outside. A staff member observed Dizon remove a pistol from the backpack he was carrying. He rushed to the service area and pointed the firearm at an employee and demanded money. At this point, the security screens were activated blocking the staff only area. Dizon and Somba left the premises, met up with Birch and were later seen to enter a Toyota Starlet hatchback bearing stolen plates ... That event was captured on CCTV, however, the offenders wore sunglasses and hats.

Count 3

Later the same day these two offenders and the co-offender Birch entered the Bank of Queensland situated in Newtown. The manager ... observed them to be wearing gloves. Having been alerted to the offence committed at The Rocks branch, he immediately activated the security screens. Dizon then discharged the automatic pistol he was carrying firing into a door in an attempt to gain entry to this service area. Projectiles lodged in the door and the wall. This is the third matter on the Form 1 and relates to Dizon only. The discharge of the weapon is a serious matter which must be reflected in a greater penalty being imposed on Dizon on this Count."" (Emphasis added)

10The Crown at the hearing of the proceedings in this Court produced an ""Amended table of comparative sentences imposed"" which conveniently sets out the details of the sentences imposed on the applicant by Hock DCJ and by her Honour in respect of the co-offender Carlo Dizon on 4 March 2011 and the sentence imposed by his Honour Norrish DCJ on 11 June 2010.

Remarks on the sentence

11The sentencing judge observed in the Remarks on Sentence (at page 3):

""These three offences are objectively very serious. Employees at financial institutions are entitled to conduct their business without being terrorised by offenders who confront them with a weapon. No victim impact statement has been tendered but none is required to comprehend the terrifying experience that staff of these banks must have undergone. It is an aggravating circumstance in respect of Count 1 that a large sum of money was taken and not recovered. As to Count 3 it is an aggravating feature that the weapon was actually loaded. I have not treated the fact that the offenders were in company as an aggravating factor of any of the offences as it is averred, unnecessarily in the indictment and therefore has become an element of the offence. 

The sentences to be imposed must deter not only these offenders but those of like mind from committing or being tempted to commit offences such as these. I find that Dizon played a slightly greater role in the offences on the basis that it was he who brandished a weapon and indeed discharged it on the last occasion.""

12Her Honour noted that in addition to the three counts referred to above that the co-offender Dizon stood trial for an offence of robbery under s 96 of the Act at which time he intentionally inflicted actual bodily harm and wounded the victim of that offence. He had been found guilty by a jury. The offence took place between the occurrence of Counts 1 and 2. The maximum penalty for such an offence is a term of imprisonment of 25 years. The offence occurred on 25 August 2008 in the course of a drug deal in which the co-offender, Birch, was a purchaser. Birch had arrived at the premises in question at Ingleburn in the company of Dizon.

13In relation to the applicant's subjective factors, her Honour noted that, at the time of sentence, he was 32 years of age. His criminal history as an adult included an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug and, significantly, three convictions for robbery in company in 2003 for which he was imprisoned for 6 years. His non-parole period concluded in April 2008, only four months before the first of the three offences in question. Her Honour noted ""his record does not entitle him to leniency"": Remarks on Sentence at p 5.

14Her Honour also noted that it was difficult to assess his prospects for rehabilitation.

15The co-offender, Birch, was sentenced separately from both the applicant and Dizon. On 11 June 2010 he was sentenced by his Honour Norrish QC DCJ in respect of three offences, two of which were:
(i) An offence relating to a ""drug rip-off"" committed with Dizon (and not with the applicant). The applicant was sentenced for an offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months.
(ii) The offence under s 97(2) of the Act which he committed at the Newtown branch of the Bank of Queensland on 27 August 2008, together with the applicant and Dizon.

16In relation to the offence under s 97(2) of the Act, committed at the Newtown branch, Birch also requested his Honour Judge Norrish to take into account on a Form 1, the further s 97(2) offence which he committed with the applicant and Dizon at The Rocks on 27 August 2008. It is to be noted that Judge Norrish observed that the s 97(2) offence contained in the Form 1, was ""of equal seriousness"" to the primary offence under s 97(2) and ""really should have been a committal for sentence matter:"" Remarks on Sentence at p 1.

17On 11 June 2010, Birch was sentenced to a (partially cumulative) sentence of 6 years 9 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months, in respect of the Newtown offence (and the Form 1 offence at The Rocks). The sentencing judge (Norrish DCJ) allowed Birch a discount of 25 per cent for his guilty plea.

18It was noted in the applicant's written submissions that a copy of Judge Norrish's Remarks on Sentence in Birch's matter were not available to her Honour, Judge Hock, at the time the sentencing submissions were made on 15 October 2010. The Crown did, however, tender a copy of Birch's criminal history (Exhibit D). The Crown had indicated that it would obtain Judge Norrish's remarks and provide them to her Honour. The applicant's submissions noted that it is apparent that her Honour had access to Judge Norrish's remarks prior to sentence.

Grounds of appeal
19In the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal dated 14 February 2012, the applicant relied upon the following ground of appeal:

Ground 1:The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance at the disparity between the sentence imposed upon him in respect of the ""Newtown Offence"" and the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders Dizon and Birch.
Ground 2: Her Honour erred in her application of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.
Ground 3: The total sentence imposed upon the applicant in respect of the ""Newtown Offence"" was excessive.
Ground 4: The total effective sentence imposed upon the applicant was ""manifestly excessive"". 

20In the written submissions for the applicant in this Court it was noted that during the sentence proceedings before her Honour on 15 October 2010, the applicant's counsel had submitted that the roles of the applicant and Birch were similar, and lesser than the role of Dizon. The basis for that submission was that it was Dizon who carried the firearm and discharged it during the course of the Newtown offence.

21The sentencing judge referred to the applicant's prior convictions in 1999 and 2003 for robbery in company offences which distinguished his position from that of Birch. (Her Honour also noted that Norrish DCJ, allowed Birch a 25 per cent discount for his guilty pleas.) 

22The sentencing judge allowed 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty in respect of Counts 1, 2 and 3.

Ground 1
Submissions for Applicant on the parity issue
23The written submissions for the applicant summarised the sentences imposed in respect of the three offenders as follows:
(i) The applicant; 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years.
(ii) Dizon; 6 years imprisonment (no non-parole period specified).
(iii) Birch; 6 years 9 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months.

24The submissions included a comparison of the sentences imposed on the applicant with particular attention being given to the sentences imposed for the Newtown offence on the applicant and on Dizon. 

25It was noted in the submissions to this Court that the sentencing judge found that the offender Dizon had the greatest culpability in respect of the Newtown offence because it was he who carried and discharged the firearm during the commission of the offence. 

26Additionally it was noted that Dizon was separately charged in respect of his discharge of the firearm at the Newtown branch. It was this latter offence that he asked be taken into account on the sentence but to be separately assessed. On the proper application of principle, the effect of the Form 1 matter, it was submitted, must have been to increase the sentence imposed on Dizon, so that it was greater than the sentence imposed on the applicant (all other things being equal).

27Despite this, however, Ms Manuell SC, who appeared in this Court for the applicant, noted that the total sentence imposed on her client for the Newtown offence was one of 8 years imprisonment, whereas the total sentence imposed on Dizon was one of 6 years imprisonment.

28In written submissions it was submitted that there were no relevant differences to warrant the imposition of a higher sentence on the applicant for the Newtown offence. It was contended that a more severe sentence should have been imposed on Dizon for four reasons:
(i) The offence under s 93G(1)(b) of the Act, must have properly had the effect of increasing Dizon's sentence;
(ii) Dizon was the instigator of the offence;
(iii) Dizon's record of prior convictions was more serious than the applicant's. 
(iv) Dizon was on bail at the time of the offence.

29It was contended that the more severe sentence imposed on the applicant for the Newtown offence gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on his part.

30The submissions for the applicant also included a comparison of the sentence imposed on him and Birch in respect of the Newtown offence. In that respect it was noted that his Honour, Judge Norrish, had also found that Dizon had the greatest culpability in respect of the Newtown offence. He allowed a 25 per cent discount for his guilty plea. His Honour observed that, but for Dizon's guilty plea, he would have imposed a total sentence of 9 years imprisonment.

31It was observed that, in respect of the applicant, the sentencing judge imposed a total sentence of 8 years, after allowing a discount of 15 per cent. On that basis the nominal starting point for the sentence was about 9 years 5 months. Accordingly the submission was that, for comparative purposes, the nominal sentence imposed on the applicant for the Newtown offence was one of 9 years 5 months and the nominal sentence imposed on Birch was 9 years.

32It was noted in the submissions for the applicant that although the objective circumstances of the applicant's and Birch's Newtown offences were all but identical, there were two relevant differences in their subjective circumstances. These differences, it was observed, militated for both a greater and a lesser sentence to be imposed on the applicant than Birch, in that:
(i) The imposition of a higher sentence on the applicant was warranted by reason of the applicant's more serious record of convictions, including a previous term of imprisonment for a similar offence. This was to be Birch's first lengthy prison term; 
(ii) The imposition of a lower sentence on the applicant was warranted by the inclusion of the s 97(2) offence on Birch's Form 1. The s 97(2) offence was the offence committed by Birch at The Rocks together with the applicant and Dizon; in respect of that offence, both the applicant and Dizon received a sentence of 5 years imprisonment (no non-parole period specified). The Form 1 offence, it was contended, had to be, and was, reflected in Birch's sentence for the primary (Newtown) offence, consistently with the principles expressed in Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146.

33It was submitted for the applicant that given the seriousness of the offence committed at The Rocks branch of the Bank, greater weight had to be given to the Form 1 offence in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Birch. The more severe sentence imposed on the applicant than Birch, it was submitted, also gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on his part.

Crown submissions on parity
34The Crown observed that the factual basis for the Newtown offence clearly showed that the applicant, Dizon and Birch were part of a criminal enterprise to rob the Bank of Queensland at its Newtown branch whilst armed with a dangerous weapon.

35It was noted that Dizon carried the firearm and that it was he who ultimately discharged it. As between the applicant and Birch there was little to distinguish between their roles.

36The Crown also noted that despite each party to a joint criminal enterprise being equally liable, it will often not be appropriate to give each party the same sentence: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 609.

37The Crown also noted that it is important to keep in mind in relation to the four grounds of appeal that ""a fixed term represents the equivalent of a non-parole period""; McIvor v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 7 per Howie J at [23]. It was submitted that the applicant's written submissions, in the criticism of the sentencing judge's sentence, appeared to ignore that reality.

38The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was uniquely positioned to consider the question of the appropriate sentence for each offender given that she dealt with both the applicant and Dizon at the same time when determining the appropriate sentence for each and the appropriate parity for each offender.

39It was also submitted that the sentencing judge had clearly outlined her approach in dealing with the respective co-offenders differently. In such circumstances it was contended that this Court would be reluctant to come to the view that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance because of the differing outcomes.

40The Crown noted:

That the sentencing judge made a finding that Dizon played a greater role in the offences for reasons that were identified. 
The findings made by the sentencing judge indicated that Dizon, if all other circumstances were equal, should receive a higher sentence than the applicant but that not all circumstances were equal. 

41The Crown relied upon the following matters;
(i) The applicant's prior criminal history was more significant than that of Dizon. He had only just completed his parole period for three robbery in company offences for which he had been sentenced on 6 March 2003.
(ii) It is apparent that the sentencing judge, in real terms, imposed a higher sentence on Dizon as opposed to the applicant.
(iii) Hock DCJ was involved in a different kind of sentencing exercise for the applicant than for Dizon. The latter's conviction on the offence under s 96 of the Act, on which he went to trial, did not involve the applicant. This, the Crown noted, was an important additional matter that her Honour was dealing with in relation to Dizon.
(iv) The issue of totality, in taking into account Dizon's other criminal activity, loomed large in her Honour's approach in determining the sentences to be imposed. This, the Crown submitted, was always going to make the comparison ""when looking at the overall structure of the sentence, complex"".
(v) It was submitted that the approach taken by the applicant in comparing the ultimate sentences and making the conclusion that the applicant's sentence was actually longer than that of Dizon was misleading. In this respect it was observed that the applicant's sentence for the Newtown offence involved a non-parole period of 5 years. Dizon's effective ""non-parole period"" (that is, the fixed term) was 6 years, given that the fixed term was the type of sentence imposed. The imposition of one extra year to Dizon on the effective ""non-parole period"" on him was, the Crown submitted, an appropriate reflection of the greater involvement in the offence by Dizon, whilst balancing all other circumstances.

42The Crown additionally submitted that it was misleading to compare the 8 year total term imposed on the applicant for the Newtown offence with the 6 year fixed term imposed on Dizon and suggest that the difference created a disparity in the sense of one which gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.

43The Crown observed that the reality was that in the manner in which her Honour dealt with Dizon, including in particular the s 96 offence, for which the Applicant was not involved, it was ""redundant"" for her Honour to fix a balance of term for the Newtown offence upon Dizon (as her Honour had acknowledged at p11 of the Remarks on Sentence). 

44It was submitted that no basis for a justifiable sense of grievance exists when: 
(i)the sentence imposed on Dizon is fully analysed in context, and 
(ii) the totality comparison with the Birch sentence (imposed by Judge Norrish) is properly considered.

Consideration
45In reviewing the sentencing of an offender in a joint criminal enterprise it is necessary to take into account that:
(i) It is not the case that the participants in such a joint criminal enterprise are necessarily to be regarded as having had the same objective criminality: Johnson v R [2010] NSWCCA 124 per James J at [4].
(ii) The objective of such an enterprise cannot be achieved unless each participant plays his or her assigned role. It would be unfair to treat one offender, who happens to have an assigned role that involves his participation in the actual crime, more leniently than those whose task it was, for example, to carry out the essential act constituting the crime: Johnson, (supra) per Simpson J.
(iii) It will be inappropriate in some such cases to attempt to assess with any degree of precision the role which each played in achieving the objective of the criminal enterprise: R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 per Carruthers AJ; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 per Spigelman CJ.
(iv) It remains necessary to refer to and take into account the particular conduct of each participant with a view to determining the level of culpability to which each must be sentenced: R v JW, (supra) at [161].

46The matters that were required to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant and Dizon included the following:

(i) The applicant's prior convictions
The sentencing judge was required, as earlier noted, to consider and take into account the applicant's prior convictions, in particular his three prior convictions for robbery in company in 2003. In respect of one of those offences he had been sentenced on (6 March 2003) to an overall term of imprisonment of 6 years imprisonment (non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months). 

(ii)Recent expiration of the non-parole period 
The non-parole period in respect of those sentences had expired only four months before the subject offence.

(iii)The criminal history of the co-offender (Dizon)
The criminal history of the co-offender Dizon was not as significant as that of the applicant, though it is noted that in 2003 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years for an offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon in 2002.

(iv)The Form 1 matters
The overall sentence of 8 years imprisonment imposed on the applicant took into account two Form 1 matters - Take and Drive Conveyance without the consent of the owner. A proper application of principle meant that the effect of the Form 1 matters would increase the sentence imposed: Attorney General's Application under s 37 (supra) at [42]. 

The co-offender Dizon, on the other hand, requested that three matters on a Form 1 be taken into account (two under ss 154A(1)(a)/117 and one under s 93G(1)(b) (firing a firearm in a public place), (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment.)

In respect of the latter, the co-offender Dizon discharged an automatic pistol he was carrying by firing into a door in an attempt to gain entry into the secure area of the bank (the third matter on the Form 1 in relation to Count 3). This was a serious matter which was reflected in a greater penalty being imposed with respect to Count 3.

47The co-offender Dizon was accordingly found to have the greater culpability in respect of the Newtown offence by reason of his having carried and discharged the firearm during the commission of the offence. If this had been the only material issue and all other circumstances were equal, then a higher sentence in respect of Dizon's offending than that of the applicant would have been appropriate. However other circumstances needed to be considered in order to determine how they operated with respect to the applicant and Dizon. 

48The co-offender Dizon, as noted above, went to trial in relation to an offence of robbery with wounding under s 96 of the Act. His conviction for that offence (which did not involve the applicant) was a significant matter to be considered when he was sentenced in respect of Count 3. Dizon was accordingly being sentenced by Hock DCJ for that offence as well as the offence under s 97(2). The s 96 offence was a serious offence for which Dizon was sentenced to a 10-year term of imprisonment (with a 6-year non-parole period). Additionally, the sentencing judge was also required to consider and give effect to the principle of totality, which required her to consider what would constitute an appropriate adjustment in the sentences to be imposed.

49A comparative analysis of the sentences imposed on the applicant and on the co-offender Dizon must also bring into account the fact of the non-parole period of 5 years as part of the sentence imposed on the applicant in respect of Count 3 as against the fixed term of 6 years imposed on Dizon.

50A comparison between the 8 year total term of imprisonment imposed on the applicant and the 6 year fixed period imposed on the co-offender does not, in itself or taken in isolation, create the basis for a justifiable sense of grievance. In respect of the 6 year fixed term imposed on the co-offender, Dizon, the sentencing judge stated at page 11:

""No parole period will attach to those three sentences as to do so would serve no useful purpose."" 

51That 6 year term was expressed as commencing on 27 July 2012 and expiring on 26 July 2018. The 10 year term of imprisonment in respect of the s 96 offence commenced 12 months into the sentence in respect of Count 3 (namely on 27 July 2013) will expire on 26 July 2023. 

52The approach taken by the sentencing judge, based upon the agreed facts, does not, in my opinion, demonstrate error. Her Honour:
(i) Identified the material facts with respect to Counts 1, 2 and 3 including in particular the role and conduct of the three offenders in relation to each.
(ii) Evaluated the objective criminality characterising the three offences as ""objectively very serious"" taking into account the relevant aggravating factors (including the fact that a large sum of money was taken in respect of Count 1 and, in respect of Count 3, that a loaded weapon was carried by Dizon).
(iii) Took into account the circumstances in which the weapon was discharged.
(iv) Compared the roles of Dizon and the applicant before finding that Dizon had played ""a slightly greater role in the offences on the basis that it was he who brandished the weapon and indeed discharged it on one occasion:"" Remarks on Sentence at page 3.

53Her Honour as the sentencing judge in respect of both the applicant and Dizon was in a position to determine the culpability of both offenders. No error was identified in the factual findings made and upon which the comparable criminality of the offenders could be determined.

54The sentencing exercise in relation to Dizon was significantly different to that involving the applicant. Firstly, Dizon stood for sentence in respect of both Count 3 under s 93G(1)(b) and, after trial, for the offence of robbery with wounding under s 96. That meant, as discussed above, that in determining the sentences for both offences committed by Dizon, her Honour was required to consider and apply the principle of totality.

55The sentence structure involving Dizon differed from that involving the applicant. Firstly, a fixed term of 6 years was imposed on Dizon whilst a sentence involving a non-parole period of 5 years was imposed on the applicant. Secondly, the longer period of 6 years in the case of Dizon may be considered as appropriately reflecting the finding as to his role. Thirdly, as noted above, the sentences in respect of Dizon were structured upon the basis that the 10 year term of imprisonment for Dizon's offence under s 96 commenced 12 months into the term of imprisonment imposed with respect to the s 97(2) offence for Count 3.

56Where the same judge sentences two offenders at the same time, gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences, and takes into account the differing criminality of each, as well as other differing circumstances, an appellate court will be cautious and not overly willing to conclude that one of the offenders has a justifiable grievance, simply because there are differing sentencing outcomes: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]. 

57The criminal histories of the applicant and Dizon, which appropriately were taken into account, weighed against the applicant more so than Dizon. Dizon's history of offending did not entitle him to leniency. However, the applicant's criminal history carried even greater significance than that of Dizon. His history as an adult offender, as previously noted, consisted of one offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug and more significantly three convictions for robbery in company in 2003 for which he was imprisoned for 6 years. The fact that his non-parole period had concluded only a short while before Counts 1, 2 and 3 (namely April 2008) was a further matter that operated adversely to him. 

58On examination the applicant's subjective factors were, in my opinion, of greater significance from a sentencing point of view than those of Dizon.

59The submissions for the applicant, with respect, placed undue emphasis on the total term of 8 years imposed with respect to the applicant and the fixed term of 6 years imposed on Dizon. Given that Dizon had also to be sentenced for the s 96 offence involving a head sentence of 10 years, the more appropriate comparison is between the 5 year non-parole period imposed on the applicant and the 6 year fixed term imposed on Dizon. There was no point in the sentencing judge imposing a balance of term in respect of Count 3 as the Crown submitted. 

60In relation to the question of parity with the sentence imposed on Birch (by his Honour Judge Norrish) an evaluation of all relevant matters, including countervailing factors, fails, in my opinion, to reveal sentencing error. The written submissions for the applicant noted that Birch was allowed a discount of 25 per cent for his guilty plea. The applicant was allowed a discount of 15 per cent for his plea of guilty. The nominal starting point for the sentences for Count 3 for the applicant, was one of 9 years 5 months whilst for Birch it was 9 years. 

61The comparison with Birch brings into account the fact that he was aged 23 years at the time of the offences whereas the applicant was 30 years, that Birch had no prior offences involving dishonesty or violence and had not served time in custody. The applicant's prior offending, as discussed was significant and attracted substantial sentences. 

62It is accordingly clear that a number of factors weighed against the applicant in the comparison with Birch. The pre-discounted starting points for the sentences ultimately imposed on the applicant and Birch, after allowing for their discounts for their guilty pleas, were close to being the same. This was against the background of the submission made on behalf of the applicant to the effect that he was objectively equally liable for his role in the offence with Birch. This, as the Crown observed, was a generous approach given the applicant's past criminal history. 

63In this case it is clear that the sentencing judge was aware of and took into account the levels of culpability and antecedents of each offender and the Form 1 matters involving, as they did, disparate considerations. The evaluation required the sentencing judge to balance and give such weight to each relevant factor as she considered appropriate, there being no fixed rule that determines what weight is to be given to one over the other. Upon consideration of the detailed submissions made on behalf of the applicant I have concluded that no error has been demonstrated in the sentencing process. 

64When all relevant sentencing matters are taken into account there is, in my opinion, no basis for the Ground 1. That Ground should, in my opinion, be dismissed.

Grounds 2, 3 and 4
65These grounds were addressed in the applicant's submissions together. It is convenient to proceed on that basis.

66At paragraph [42] of the applicant's written submissions the structure of the applicant's sentences were set out as follows:





Count

Sentence

Dates


1 (+ 1 x Form 1 offence - ss.154A(1)(a)/117, max penalty 5y) - ""Kensington offence""

5 years 6 months

Commencing 
1 September 2008, expiring 28 February 2014 (no NPP)


2""The Rocks offence""

5 years

Commencing 
1 September 2010, expiring 31 August 2015 (no NPP)


3(+ 1 x Form 1 offence - ss.154A(1)(a)/117, max penalty 5y) - ""Newtown offence""

8 years, NPP 5 years

Commencing 
1 September 2011, expiring 31 August 2019, NPP expiring 31 August 2016.

67It was submitted by the applicant that the seriousness of the applicant's conduct was essentially the same in each offence, except that money was stolen during the offence constituting Count 1. It was accepted that the stealing of the money may explain why the sentence for that offence was 6 months higher than the offence constituting Count 2 (where no money was stolen).

68It was submitted that there was no apparent reason for as to why the sentence imposed on the applicant for the offence constituting Count 3 was so significantly greater than the sentences imposed in respect of the other two offences. It was noted that although two shots were fired during the offence at the Newtown branch, it was Dizon who fired the shots for which he was separately charged. It was submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant knew that the firearm was loaded in any of the three offences (other than his knowledge after the event constituting Count 3).

69In submissions for the applicant it was observed that the sentencing judge did not expressly find that a more severe sentence was warranted by reason of the fact that Count 3 demonstrated an ""accelerating criminality"": R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292; 115 A Crim R 152 at [37], [50]. It was submitted that it was apparent that her Honour did not make such a finding because it was not applied in the sentencing of Dizon. 

70In the absence of any other explanation, it was submitted that it appeared that her Honour had inflated the applicant's sentence for Count 3 in order to structure the applicant's parole period, rather than to identify the appropriate period to be imposed and then consider the question of totality.

71The submissions for the applicant referred to other cases in which consideration had been given to the issues of totality and manifest excess in respect of sentences imposed for multiple armed robbery offences: Qing An v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 53 (per Beazley JA at [102]-[105]); McIvor v Regina per Howie J at [21]-[22].

72On the issue of totality it was noted that the offences were committed within a period of 11 days, with the last two offences being committed on the same day. The applicant's objective circumstances, it was noted, had not substantially changed over that period. Additionally, the offences were said to be very similar in their commission and the finding of accelerating criminality was not warranted.

73Finally, it was submitted that although each of the applicant's offences were serious, none were particularly serious examples of s 97(2) offences. In terms of the applicant's objective criminality (as opposed to Dizon's), the first offence was the most serious because money was actually stolen.

74It was noted that with partial accumulation there was a period of 3 years between the commencement date of the first and third of the applicant's sentences. It was submitted that the degree of accumulation was too great in all of the objective and subjective circumstances of the applicant's offending.

75The Crown, in respect of Grounds 2 and 3, submitted that those grounds were misconceived. The Crown contended that the sentencing judge did not give a ""more severe sentence"" for the Newtown offence when compared to the Kensington and Rocks offences. Her Honour had imposed fixed terms in respect of the latter two offences which may be regarded as equating to the non-parole period of the Newtown offence. It was submitted that the sentencing judge clearly had not regarded any of the three offences as more serious as the other. The reason for not imposing a parole period in respect of the Kensington and Rocks offences arose by reason of the approach taken to structuring the sentences.

76The difference of an additional 6 months imposed in respect of the Kensington offence was said to be accounted for by reason of the Form 1 attached to it.

77The Crown submitted that no error in terms of Pearce v the Queen (supra) existed.

78In this regard it was argued that her Honour had considered each offence and appropriately determined to impose fixed sentences in respect of the first two offences and for sentencing in respect of the third, that her Honour had expressly considered the issue of totality.

79Furthermore, it was observed that no contention was made on the appeal that the sentences imposed in respect of what are referred as the Kensington and the Rocks offences were excessive.

80The Crown further submitted that a sentence of ""8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years"" for an offence as serious as the Newtown offence could hardly be described as an excessive sentence having regard, in particular, to the applicant's background.

81I have concluded that no error has been demonstrated in respect of the sentences imposed and I do not consider that any of the sentences were manifestly excessive. Furthermore, her Honour expressly considered and applied the principles of totality. 

82It may be accepted that whilst more serious offences under s 97(2) may be envisaged, it cannot be said that any of the three offences were other than objectively serious offences. 

83No challenge has been made to the above stated factual conclusion arrived at by the sentencing judge nor, in my opinion, could there have been a basis for doing so. In particular, the three offences were planned and the particular branches of the Bank were targeted with a view to demanding, with the use of a weapon, the handing over of considerable amounts of money. Staff members at the individual banks and potentially members of the public were put at risk. Once again, the applicant's history of prior convictions for similar matters evidenced a complete disregard for the law.

84In the circumstances, I do not consider that either the individual sentences or the overall sentence has been demonstrated as being unreasonable or unjust. 

85I have concluded that Grounds 2, 3 and 4 are without merit and should be dismissed. 

Orders
86I propose the following orders:
1)Leave to appeal be granted
2)The appeal be dismissed.

87SG CAMPBELL J: I agree with Hall J.

2760559,R v McCann [2012] NSWSC 1462,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender, John Charles McCann, has been found guilty by the jury of the manslaughter of Craig Alan Morgan and is to be sentenced. 

2On 12 March 2011 the offender was living in a house in Springwood. Originally it was his family house but unfortunately the family had ceased living together in circumstances of which I will say something later in these remarks. The offender had no regular substantial source of income and his financial affairs were being managed by another as authorised by the Guardianship Tribunal. He used to take in lodgers to help him make ends meet. One of the lodgers was the deceased, Craig Alan Morgan. He had resided at the house previously, most recently early in 2011. Also lodging there were Michael Vickers and Tara Hain. They both knew the deceased and were friends with him. 

3The deceased had family and connections in the Northern Territory and had lived and worked there. Early in 2011 he left the house and returned to the Northern Territory to work. Shortly before 8 March 2011 he telephoned Mr Vickers and said that he was returning to Springwood, where he would call in before continuing to the Central Coast of New South Wales to take up a job caring for a person there. Mr Vickers told the offender. 

4On or about 8 March 2011 the deceased arrived at the offender's house and the offender agreed that he could stay the night. The deceased did so. He continued to stay and was still resident there on 12 March 2011. On that day he and Mr Vickers were seated on the verandah at the front of the offender's house. They were drinking. The deceased was an alcoholic. The offender resented the deceased's presence and wanted him out of the house. A number of things about the deceased were irritating him, not least that he had been smoking in his room, which was a fire hazard, and that he had overstayed his welcome. 

5I shall say more about the mental condition of the offender later in these remarks, but for the moment I should say that he was beset by an illness or condition that led him to be afraid in circumstances where a well person would not be afraid. He was apt to misinterpret the intentions and motives of others. 

6During his time in the Northern Territory the deceased had been in trouble for drink drinking. On one occasion his car had struck and killed a pedestrian. It turned out that the pedestrian had deliberately run into the deceased's car in order to commit suicide, but the story got around that he had killed a man. As well, he was wanted in the Northern Territory for a minor offence, and it got around that he was wanted by the police. Things were misinterpreted. Ms Hain believed that the deceased was wanted in the Northern Territory for killing a man, something far from the truth. The deceased had taken boxing lessons and had apparently mentioned the matter to the offender. These things seemed to have combined in the mind of the offender to make him afraid of the deceased.

7While Mr Vickers and the deceased were on the verandah words were exchanged between the offender and the deceased. According to Mr Vickers, the offender became ""pushy"", officiously going about the repair of a piece of furniture on the verandah, making the deceased move out of the way. The offender told the court that on an earlier occasion the deceased had threatened him with violence. He also said that during their exchange on 12 March the deceased told him that he was prepared to do time, which he took to mean that the deceased was threatening to do to him something which would warrant his being convicted and sent to gaol.

8The offender left the house and crossed the road to speak to a neighbour. He talked about the matter, mulled things over and decided to seek the services of the police to have the deceased evicted. He went to the police station and asked for help. He told officers that the deceased was in the house and would not leave, that he was dangerous when drunk and was wanted on a warrant issued in the Northern Territory. The police responded, visited the house, arrested the deceased, who was hiding in the kitchen, and took him to the police station. The deceased denied having been asked to leave. The police made enquiries about the reported warrant and ascertained that it concerned a minor matter over which the Northern Territory police would not seek extradition. Accordingly, the police had no reason to hold the deceased and told him that he was free to leave. They offered to find him accommodation but he declined the offer. They gave him some advice about where he might go. 

9Some time later the deceased arrived back at the offender's residence. The offender was absent from the premises or perhaps in his room. At any rate, he did not see the deceased. Mr Vickers did and reminded the deceased that he was unwelcome. He suggested that he stay in his, Vickers', room, only for that night and stay out of sight. The deceased entered Mr Vickers' room. 

10In the middle of the night, Mr Vickers, who had fallen asleep, heard the deceased leaving his room. The offender was in the rear portion of the house using his computer which was set up there on a desk. The two men came together and fought. As they grappled with one another the offender put a nylon cord around the deceased's neck and pulled it tight. He strangled him to death. 

11When the deceased was dead the offender took a blanket and covered him. He went to Mr Vickers' room and woke him. He said that he had just killed the deceased. Mr Vickers went to the back of the house and saw the deceased. He picked up the sheet and saw that the deceased's face was blue and purple and that there was a cord around the deceased's neck. He replaced the sheet. He did not touch the cord. He called the emergency number and spoke to the operator. He said that there was a dead man and that the man who had killed him was present. He handed the telephone to the offender who told the operator that police had evicted the tenant and that he had returned about 10 minutes before to kill him, so he had had to kill him in self-defence. He said that he had strangled him.

12The police were informed and Constable Pavy attended. He was one of the officers who had attended on the eviction of the deceased. He saw the deceased lying face down on the floor. There was a white rope around the deceased's neck. It was a single loop, tied at the back. There was no pulse. The face was bluish. The rope was quite tight, pulling the skin in. There was a bundle of rope at the back of the neck resting on the neck and Constable Pavy pulled it away. Then he saw that there was a single knot, right in the centre of the back of the neck. He pulled at the knot and loosened it. He lifted the rope over the deceased's head.

13The offender was arrested and taken to the police station. He was invited to take part in an interview and did so. For the most part he declined to answer questions and asked for the services of a lawyer. He made extensive complaints about an injury or injuries he had suffered and was taken to hospital for attention. One thing he did say was that the deceased punched him very severely when he broke through the curtain and attacked him. There were marks on his face consistent with such an attack. 

14The offender was born on 30 May 1945 and is now 67 years old. He is highly intelligent. He did well at school. He entered a seminary after leaving school but left in 1965 or 1966, having decided that he did not wish to be ordained. He suffered his first episode of depression in 1966. He was admitted to hospital and treated with an anti-depressant drug. He took up a Commonwealth scholarship and completed 2 years of a science degree at Sydney University. His interest was forestry and in 1968 he took up a cadetship with the Forestry Commission. He transferred to the Australian National University and took his degree there in 1970. His job in Forestry took him to various parts of New South Wales and his wife and family accompanied him. Eventually he persuaded his reluctant wife to agree to sell up and move to the Northern Territory to follow a religious teacher. I assume that that required him to leave his job at the Forestry Commission. Eventually, having lost everything, he came to his senses and brought his family back to New South Wales. He obtained casual work. He entered the building trade and did work as a groundsman. 

15In 1993 he was treated in hospital for 3 months for depression. He became property manager of a school. In 1996 he consulted a psychiatrist, Dr Thiering, and remained under his treatment for 11 years. Various medicines were prescribed, and it is not clear what degree of success was achieved. The offender thought there was none. He was admitted to hospital a number of times for short periods. He was prescribed lithium. They parted company because the offender did not accept the advice he was offered. He spoke contemptuously of the circumstances. 

16I have not dealt with all the many events that took place over the years the offender was suffering from these conditions. It is worth noting that he was generally unprepared to accept diagnoses or follow medical advice. In 2002 he was apparently advised to take fish oil and aspirin, and seems to have done so over several subsequent years despite advice to the contrary. His bipolar condition came to be referred to as untreated or resistant to treatment. 

17In 2007 he was referred by Dr Thiering to the Springwood Mental Health Team. Ms Sian Harris, clinical psychologist, was his case manager from August 2007 until November 2010, not long before he killed the deceased. Ms Harris noted that there had previously been diagnoses of major depression and bipolar depressive disorder. She said that cognitive impairment consistent with frontal lobe involvement was evident - disorganisation, poor planning and evaluation of behavioural responses, poor insight into his impairments and their effect on others, impairment of social judgments and mental inflexibility. He reported sadness and episodic anxiety attacks in the context of conflict with family members and neighbours, over his marriage breakdown, property disputes and other matters, for example animals. 

18During 2009 the offender and his wife separated. They have remained married. 

19In February 2010 his daughter applied to the Guardianship Tribunal for a Financial Management order. The Tribunal appointed the Public Trustee and Guardian Financial Manager. 

20Ms Harris considers that the offender experienced significant stress at the breakdown of his marriage and his estrangement from his children and extended family and what he perceived as threats to his occupation of the house he had lived in for many years. His responses included high anxiety, anger, hurt and sadness. There were somatic symptoms as well. 

21Ms Corinne Roberts, clinical and consulting neuropsychologist, wrote a report for the Court. She reviewed many documents and reports, particularly a number of brain scan reports which had been made between 2007 and 2011. As a result of these it appeared to Ms Roberts that there was moderate generalised atrophy of the brain and atrophy of the frontal lobes. Ms Roberts expressed this opinion - 

Mr John McCann, is a 66 year old man with a well documented history of treatment resistant depression and bipolar disorder. As far as I am aware he has no criminal record prior to the incident of 13.3.11 which has resulted in him being charged with murder. However, the available evidence suggests that over the past few years his behaviour has become increasingly erratic and disorganized to the extent that there were concerns that he might have impaired brain functioning, specifically impaired frontal lobe functioning.

The frontal lobes of the brain are considered to be integral to executive functioning, and although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, this is inaccurate. The frontal lobes are an anatomical region of the brain with multiple connections to other brain regions, whereas executive functioning refers to a complex array of cognitive and behavioural skills which may be disrupted by damage to the frontal lobes. These skills include conceptual/abstract thinking, judgement and problem- solving, planning and organizing, the ability to generate ideas and solutions when confronted with novel situations or problems, the ability to shift flexibly from one idea to another, the ability to hold ideas or information in the mind in order to consider it. The term executive functioning also encompasses behavioural skills such as the ability to regulate behaviour, adapt to changing circumstances, consider the impact of one's behaviour on others, as well as self-awareness and insight.

Whilst impaired executive functioning can occur as a result of focal damage to the frontal regions of the brain, psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, can also adversely affect executive functioning. Whilst individuals with impaired executive functioning can sometimes function quite well with adequate external support or in very routine and predictable situations, they are likely to struggle if left to deal with more complex day to day activities alone or when confronted with unfamiliar or unexpected problems. 

The behaviours reportedly exhibited by Mr McCann over the past few years, especially since his wife left the family home, are consistent with impaired executive functioning. Brain MRI in 2007 was reported to show some small focal abnormalities in the frontal lobes, but there has been disagreement as to the significance of these. However, neuroimaging (CT scans and MRI) since 2007 has consistently been reported to show significant cerebral atrophy.

Previous assessment of Mr McCann's cognitive functioning indicated him to be a man of superior intellectual ability whose results on tests of memory and executive functioning suggested some problems with attention, and mildly reduced efficiency of problem-solving, mental flexibility and working memory.

Current neuropsychological assessment indicated mild problems with auditory attention, fluctuating working memory (complex mental tracking), difficulties with learning and retention of more complex new information, and impaired ability to generate novel ideas in a man of superior intellectual ability. In general the results were consistent with those obtained by Ms Harris in 2009, although improvement was evident on some memory and problem-solving tests which Mr McCann had completed on at least two previous occasions of testing and which were likely to have been prone to practice effects.

Although the problems revealed on neuropsychological assessment were relatively mild, they were consistent with impairment of executive functioning in a man whose general intellectual ability is well preserved. They were also consistent with the available evidence regarding Mr McCann's day to day functional problems and the reported behavioural changes in daily life.

22Three psychiatrists gave evidence at the trial, Dr Martin, called by the Crown, Dr Nielssen and Dr Furst, called by the Defence. All had seen Ms Roberts' report, or at least were aware of her opinion, as well as the scan reports on which Ms Roberts based her opinion. All Psychiatrists were of much the same opinion, namely that at the time of the act causing death the offender had atrophy of the frontal lobes and general brain shrinkage. These led to cognitive deficits, being an impairment of the executive function of the brain, bringing with it an increased risk of misconception of events, of poor decision-making and of impulsive behaviour. 

23As well, there was a well-established diagnosis of major depression and, later, bipolar disorder. The bipolar disorder had as a feature a tendency in the manic phase to produce grandiose ideas and actions based on them.

24The risk that the conditions from which the offender was suffering might lead him to misinterpret events and make poor decisions, acting impulsively, is exemplified by an event that happened about a month before this offence was committed. The unfortunate disintegration of the offender's family had led to all members but himself leaving the house. There had been a time when two daughters with their husbands, and then one daughter with her husband were staying there for the benefit of the offender and the house, but he had called the police and had had them evicted. The time arrived at which the family had to come and collect their belongings. On the appointed day things did not go smoothly. The offender had arranged for some belongings to be placed on the front verandah for collection but resisted the entry of his wife and members of the family. He barricaded himself in the house, then called the police and asked them to remove the unwelcome visitors. He described this reasonable visit as a home invasion. 

25The offender was charged with murder. As the issues were left to the jury there was only one question for them to answer on murder, for in the way the trial was conducted there was no question that the offender had done the act which caused the death of the deceased with the intention of killing him. The remaining issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that when he did the act causing death the offender did not believe it necessary to do the act in order to defend himself. If the jury were satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt they were instructed to consider whether the accused had proved on the balance of probabilities the ingredients of the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. I will not go into what that entailed, for I have come to a firm view that the evidence is not capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not believe it necessary to act as he did in order to defend himself. 

26When the offender encountered the deceased he was, as I have said, in the computer room at the back of the house. The room itself was on the far side from the point of view of the house generally, of a curtained arch. The curtains were not drawn, I think, but hanging loose. The offender's account had the deceased suddenly approaching from the other side of the curtain. There seems to be no reason not to accept that something like that happened, for the deceased must have come from that direction, the direction in which Mr Vickers' room was situated almost at the front of the house. There was a rope there, a thin nylon cord of a kind used in bodily exercises. It hung on a hook on the wall of the arch or it may have been on the floor nearby. 

27The offender said that the deceased said ""You didn't expect me to come back did you, John? I am here to kill you. Prepare to die. This is your last day on earth"". The deceased then punched him twice in the face and the two men fell to the floor and grappled. There was this evidence - 

Q. And can you say what position you were in relation to each other when you were on the floor? 

A. Well we were wrestling each other, and then I ended up with my head sort of under the arch almost, and his head under the arch beside me, and he had the rope around his neck, and he was obviously having trouble breathing. 

Q. How did the rope get round his neck Mr McCann? 
A. I'm not sure, it just happened somehow within the course of the struggle

...

Q. You say you saw him with the rope around his neck? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Whilst you were both lying on the floor? 
A. Yes. He was lying face down. I was lying face down beside him. 

Q. You don't know how the rope got there?
A. I presume it happened during the struggle. 

Q. Did you put it there? 
A. No. It just got twisted up. We both got twisted in the rope. 

Q. You got twisted in the rope? 
A. My arm and hand and wrists were twisted in the rope. 

Q. What were you doing with your hand and the rope? 
A. Well, I did apply pressure to keep him from killing me. 

Q. What sort of pressure were you applying? 
A. Just my hands, sort of keeping the pressure on the rope because I knew if he got up he would finish me off. 

Q. Do you recall pulling on the rope? 
A. I probably did apply some pressure, yeah. 

Q. What was he doing? 
A. He was just struggling to get away from the rope and to continue his attack on me. 

Q. Did you say anything to him to ask him to calm down or stop? 
A. No. I said, ""You came here to kill me, but it looks like you're going to die.""

...

Q. When you were on the ground pulling the rope, did you tie a knot in any way? 
A. No, no, no. 

28I find that immediately before the offender took the rope and killed the deceased the following happened:

1. The offender had had the deceased removed from the house and did not expect to see him again.

2. The offender was alone at the back of the house.

3. The deceased approached him without warning, coming through the curtain, and said to him threatening words which may have been those given in evidence by the offender.

4. The deceased punched the offender twice in the face. 

5. The offender believed that the deceased intended to kill him.

6. The two grappled and fell to the floor.

7. The rope was within the offender's reach.

8. The offender seized the rope. 

29I bear in mind the risk that the condition from which the offender was suffering might have led him to misinterpret events. But in my view one does not need to go so far. It seems to me that a person with ordinary powers and not suffering the conditions from which the offender was suffering would be likely in the circumstances the offender described to believe that he was about to be killed. The Psychiatrists said so and I think that they were right. I think the question whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not think it necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself can be answered on the simple facts alone of what happened without consideration of the offender's mental condition. I am not satisfied on the evidence that there is no reasonable possibility that the offender acted in self-defence. It follows that the only factual basis upon which the offender ought to be sentenced is that the act he performed in self-defence was unreasonable. Consistently with the jury's verdict, I am satisfied about that beyond reasonable doubt. I shall explain why.

30I do not accept everything the offender has said about the way things happened. There is a remarkable contrast between the detail that he recounts of circumstances he might understand as favourable to his case and his failure to recount the detail of matters he might not. I have referred to his precise and detailed recollection of the things the deceased said and I have accepted them. When the offender was speaking to the emergency operator on the telephone he was clear that the evicted tenant had come back to kill him, so he had to kill him in self-defence. 

31On the other hand, I do not think that the offender was making a genuine attempt to tell the Court what happened when he took the rope and put it around the deceased's neck, for that is what I think he did. I can accept that he may have come across the rope opportunistically. This is not a matter in which he had any warning or would have had an occasion to have any weapon ready. The rope must have been somewhere at hand. Even so, it is difficult in view of the particularity of the offender's account in some respects to accept his evidence that he had the rope in his hands merely because his arm and hand and wrists became twisted in it and that the rope somehow came to be around the deceased's neck.

32Only three people saw the rope around the deceased's neck: the offender, Mr Vickers and Constable Pavy. Mr Vickers lifted the blanket and saw the rope but did not touch it. All he said about the rope was this - 

""I picked up the sheet and his face was all blue and purple and there was a cord around his neck"".

33Mr Vickers said that he did not touch the neck. He did not otherwise describe the rope.

34Constable Pavy answered the emergency call in the company of Constable Campbell. Constable Pavy attended to the body and attempted cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Constable Campbell was at the house but was attending to other duties. It was only Constable Pavy who was able to describe the condition of the rope. He removed it but before he did so he saw that there was a single strand of rope around the neck tied in a knot at the back of the neck and drawn tight so as to pull the skin in. On top of the knot was a bundle or coil of rope. He removed the loose rope, saw the knot and undid it to loosen the rope. This evidence shows that the rope was held tight by a knot, so as to strangle the deceased. The rope could not be removed until the knot was loosened. The offender must have tied the knot. 

35The deceased was a bigger man than the offender but he was well under the influence of alcohol. He was well used to alcohol but even so his motor functions must have been substantially impaired. He was unarmed. In my view, taking full account of any effect the offender's condition had on him, it was unreasonable for him to go so far, having wrapped the rope around the deceased's neck, as to tie it tight and kill him. The act causing death was not only an unreasonable response to the threat he faced. It was a particularly cruel thing to do. 

36The well-attested mental illness of the offender makes it inappropriate in sentencing him to place much emphasis on retribution or general deterrence. However, the fact of his condition, particularly the irreversible condition of the frontal lobes and the brain generally, raises the question of his dangerousness in the future. Dr Martin, Psychiatrist, gave evidence on sentence. He said that when a person has a dementing process, as the offender does, he can easily become paranoid and can interpret non-threatening behaviour in a hostile way. Dr Martin has observed an association between brain atrophy and bipolar disorder. He says that a person with many years of bipolar disorder, especially when it is untreated or unresponsive to treatment, is at high risk of developing cognitive deficits. That does not mean that the offender's bipolar disorder cannot be treated, of course, but his condition has been described as resistant to treatment. 

37The offender lacks insight into his condition and cannot be expected to follow medical advice about taking drugs, particularly advice he does not agree with. Dr Martin thinks that the offender will need close, intensive observation in custody. If he does not comply with advice about medicine he will need to be managed in an in-patient unit under the Mental Health Act 2007. Dr Martin thinks that it might be necessary to invoke the Mental Health Act 2007 in any event, given the offender's lack of insight. He considers that a person with untreated bipolar disorder presents a modest increased risk of violence, even allowing that the killing of the deceased is the first recorded instance of any violent act of the offender and that the offender is not suffering from any personality disorder. 

38Dr Furst's report was tendered on sentence. He points out that the killing of the deceased was the offender's only violent act. He thinks that mania does not appear to confer much greater absolute risk of violence at an individual level. He thinks that the circumstances in which the offender was violent are unlikely to occur again and that the offender poses a low risk to others of re-offending. He thinks that there are good prospects of successful rehabilitation despite the offender's age and lack of insight. 

39Dr Nielssen sees no risk of violence from mania. He points out that the offender has not used alcohol or other drugs and has no other psychiatric condition. He has no history of violence. Dr Nielssen does not consider the offender dangerous. 

40I take into account that this is the first recorded occasion of violence by the offender, but it has happened and in particularly brutal circumstances. I take into account the features Dr Furst and Dr Nielssen think important. I agree that it seems unlikely that the offender will come under attack again but the difficulty is to know how he may misinterpret unthreatening circumstances or overreact to any innocent confrontation. In view of Dr Martin's opinion I think that the offender presents a risk of violence. The risk is modest but will increase if he ceases to be properly treated with drugs. 

41The offender intended to kill. He is not prepared fully to acknowledge his deliberate use of the rope. 

42There are mitigating circumstances. The offender is a person of prior good character. The offence was not planned. There is no expression of regret, however. 

43The offender is held in high regard by family and friends and will have support when he needs it on his release. 

44In view of the uncertainties about the offender's further treatment I cannot conclude that he will not re-offend. The question of rehabilitation has to be deferred for the same reason and because he has not fully come to terms with what he did. There are prospects, but there is the countervailing risk of further violence.

45The offender is now 67 years old. I take account of his age and the conditions in which he will have to be kept in custody to promote his proper treatment and the reduction of risk. The offender will in consequence serve his sentence hard, and this justifies lowering the non-parole period of his sentence with a corresponding increase in the period for which he will be eligible for release to parole.

46I have considered whether the need to supervise and treat the offender after his release to parole itself justifies a longer parole period and a correspondingly shorter non-parole period, but I do not think that it can. This is not a case in which supervision on parole can be expected to achieve a final, settled and satisfactory state of affairs which might be attained after a period of parole appropriately extended. The offender will have to be supervised and medicated for the rest of his life. That is a matter that parole cannot be expected to deal with. 

47The mother of the deceased, Rewa Joan Wallace, prepared a victim impact statement and read it to the Court. Mrs Wallace's statement shows how much the deceased was loved and how great his loss has been to her and her family. The Court cannot take these matters into account in fixing sentence, but it is right to acknowledge, and the court does acknowledge the hurt and suffering that this offence has occasioned to Mrs Wallace and her family and to those who knew and loved the deceased. The sympathy of the Court goes out to Mrs Wallace and to all who have been touched by these tragic events. It is to be hoped that now that these proceedings have finished they will have comfort and healing. 

48John Charles McCann, for the manslaughter of Craig Alan Morgan I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months which will be taken to have commenced on 13 March 2011 and which will expire on 12 September 2014. The balance of the term of your sentence will be 3 years and 6 months expiring on 12 March 2018. The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 12 September 2014.

2760566,R v Raven EDWARDS [2012] NSWDC 289,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1This morning I am sentencing a young man named Raven Edwards. One night whilst he was very drunk and affected by drugs as well, he - with some others - attacked a man on a train and robbed him. I have to sentence him for the crime of robbery in company. 

2A judge in sentencing an offender has to take into account things such as how serious an example of the particular crime this offence was, as well as things personal to the offender such as his or her criminal record and personal background. 

3It is important to start with an appreciation of how serious the crime is, and a description of the offence. 

4The crime is called robbery in company. It is made into a crime by s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the offence. 

5What happened in this case is contained in a description in Exhibit A. As often happens these days, the movements of the offenders were detected by CCTV cameras before and after the crimes, so the summary which I have in front of me includes coloured photographs. One of the photographs was in fact taken by a bystander who knew that Mr Edwards had robbed the man on the train. 

6It all happened at about 8 o'clock on a Wednesday night 6 June earlier this year. Raven Edwards, who had just become an adult by turning 18 about 2 months earlier, went to the Kogarah Railway Station with two other young men. One of the young men was in fact under 18 and, therefore, regarded at law as a child rather than an adult. They got onto a train and found a man called Yi Zhang sitting in one of the vestibule areas. He was near the guard's compartment. The three young men stood in the middle of the vestibule area. There were no other passengers around. Raven Edwards sat down next to Mr Zhang, who was reading articles in Chinese on his mobile phone, which was an iPhone 4. The other two sat nearby. After some unsuccessful attempts at conversation Raven Edwards said ""Give me your phone"". Understandably, Mr Zhang said that he would not, but then what happened is that Raven Edwards became a criminal. 

7He grabbed the man's arm and tried to pull the phone away. The victim resisted, so Mr Edwards stood up and punched him in the head at least twice. Mr Zhang tried to get away but Mr Edwards grabbed him. The victim fell to the floor where Raven Edwards kicked him in the stomach. One of the others kicked him in the head and the neck. They grabbed his phone and his bag and ran out of the train at Hurstville. The CCTV footage shows one of them running up the stairs. Mr Edwards left the station but came back to see what was going on. He hid behind a ticket vending machine. He saw police speaking to one of the co-offenders. Someone took a photograph of him trying to hide. 

8He was not arrested on that day but 2 days later. Police obviously found out about his involvement and they turned up at his home and arrested him. He was interviewed by the police and frankly owned up to what he had done. There is a picture of Mr Zhang in Exhibit A which shows the grazing to his face and neck that he received from the assault. That is the crime that I am sentencing Mr Edwards for. 

9Mr Edwards does have a criminal record. It looks as though there are some offences which were dealt with in the Children's Court and he did not start offending until he was about 16. He has received good behaviour bonds for affray and trespass, but there are a number of serious break and enter offences on his record including aggravated break and enters. At first he got a probation order from the Children's Court, but he obviously breached that order and was called up and given a control order, which involves the young person being in custody. He has offences for shoplifting, possessing drugs and equipment needed to use or to take drugs. 

10Mr Edwards turned 18 on 31 March this year. He has been in an adult gaol since then. When he committed this crime he was still on a probation order which had been issued by the Children's Court. This is very relevant when a judge sentences a person because it means that they have used liberty which another court granted them instead of putting them in custody to commit a further crime. 

11There is a presentence report about Raven Edwards prepared by a Probation and Parole Officer with the Probation and Parole Service. The officer reviews his background. He came from New Zealand with his family when he was 4. Was suspended from school at the start of Year 9. He decided to go to TAFE to continue with Year 10 but discontinued after 6 weeks. He has had some work on and off. He started smoking cannabis on a daily basis and would drink regularly. The author of the report summarises the conclusion saying this - 

""Mr Edwards has committed an act of violence against a member of the community whilst claiming to be heavily affected by alcohol. Whilst in custody he claimed he has had time to reflect on his behaviour and how it impacts on others. While it appears that his associates may be a contributing factor to his offending, it is considered that Mr Edwards must also develop greater control of his behaviour and substance use."" 

12Ms S McLaughlin, who appeared for Raven Edwards, tendered a report from the consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst. He saw Mr Edwards in custody where Dr Furst works. Apparently he has been drinking regularly since he was 15 and started on cannabis at the same age. He started off on one gram a week but increased it to about three grams a week and then started using it daily. He said he was bored and had nothing else to do. He started drinking a lot more as well. 

13Dr Furst noted that Mr Edwards was remorseful for what he has done, which is an important factor for a judge to take into account. Dr Furst saw that he was a young man with low intellectual function, and he diagnosed him with what he called a substance use disorder related to his use of cannabis and alcohol. He thought that he possibly had a borderline intellectual functioning. He was affected by negative aspects of those he mixed with and by periods out of work. Dr Furst thought that it was likely ""that his judgment was impaired to some degree by his level of intoxication and his substance dependence"" when he committed the offence that I am sentencing him for. He recommended that he be referred to his local community health centre to help him work out his substance abuse issues and he also thought that a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre may be able to assist and named a couple of those centres. 

14Ms McLaughlin also tendered a letter written by Raven Edwards to the victim of his assault in which he accepted full responsibility and expressed his sorrow for what had he done. 

15I should add that when I am sentencing Mr Edwards I have been asked by Mr Edwards and the prosecution to take into account in the sentence which I impose upon him for the robbery two other crimes that he has admitted committing. One is an attempted break and enter of a neighbour's house, and the other is possessing housebreaking instruments which is related to that crime. I will take those offences into account and I sign the form accordingly. 

16Ms McLaughlin called her client to give evidence yesterday. He had been living with his family - his parents and his mother at home. In fact his mother - the person he regards as his mother - is his aunt, but she has effectively brought him up since he was a child. He confirmed that everything he told Dr Furst was truthful and confirmed that he has been drinking since he was 15. When he drinks, he drinks a large amount of beer and was on about two or three grams of cannabis a day. 

17Being in an adult gaol, he said, was not a good place. It was horrible. He feels the restrictions on his movements. He is the youngest in the area where he is housed, but finds the other prisoners are good towards him. He has had no alcohol or drugs in custody and has had time to think about what he has done. He now realises that his use of alcohol and cannabis was a real problem in his life and brought about him being in gaol and committing the crime that he did against Mr Zhang. 

18Mr Edwards is using the time in custody to study. He is doing maths and history and science at Year 10 level. He would like to complete his School Certificate and then go back to TAFE. He is interested in studying science. He is putting a lot of effort into his studies. 

19His time in custody has changed his attitude and he realises he must not, as he says, ""hang around people who cause trouble and dramas"". He receives regular visits from his family and has also been doing some work in the metal shop in gaol. 

20Cross examined by Ms D Paterson for the Director of Public Prosecutions, he acknowledged the effect which drink has on his brain cells, and how dangerous it is for him physically, as well as affecting his bad behaviour. He also acknowledged the bad influence of the friends he was mixing with. He said that he needed good role models. He said now is the time for him to ""grow up, mature, and look after"" his family. 

21Ms McLaughlin provided me with some helpful written submissions. She acknowledged what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said about sentencing for cases of robbery in its guideline judgment in R v Henry (1992) 28 NSWLR 348. She pointed out that many of the factors which the Court of Criminal Appeal had in mind in Henry as representing a typical offender applied in her client's case, such as youth and no weapon and a limited degree of planning. She described the offence, in my opinion correctly, as being a spontaneous and dynamic incident. It involved actual violence and there was some minor injuries to the victim. 

22The victim was vulnerable, not in the sense of particular classes of victims such as those who operate service stations at night or convenience stores or taxi drivers, but he was vulnerable in the sense that he was a passenger alone in a particular part of the train travelling at night-time. The amount taken was relatively small. 

23Ms McLaughlin acknowledged the significance of the fact that her client was on conditional liberty under probation at the time. Her client had plead guilty at what Ms Paterson agreed was the earliest available opportunity, so that the effect of that - because of its assistance to the administration of justice - is that he will receive a discount of 25 per cent from the sentence which he would otherwise have received. 

24As Ms McLaughlin pointed out, his previous convictions do not involve matters of violence. She submitted that his prospects of rehabilitation were good and I would regard them as reasonably good. She provided some helpful statistics from the Judicial Commission about sentencing for these kinds of offences. 

25The seriousness of the break and enter and possess housebreaking implements was fairly low, and I accept that submission. Ms McLaughlin correctly conceded that there was no alternative but a full-time custodial sentence, but that there were circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between the time spent in custody and the time spent on parole. Normally a person spends three quarters of an overall sentence in custody during what is called a non-parole period, and a quarter of the sentence on parole. Ms McLaughlin pointed out that there is reason in this case because of the client's youth and the first time that he is in an adult gaol and his needs for supervision and employment for adjusting that ratio in his favour. I agree with those submissions. She pointed out that her client has been in custody for five and a half months to date but part of that custody, if not all of it, has been bail refused, or serving of other sentences, including the control order. 

26Ms Paterson acknowledged the fact that the break and enter offence which I will take into account was not very serious, and that it seemed that Raven Edwards had embarked on something of a criminal spree since he was 16. All his other crimes have been dealt with by the Children's Court. 

27He was a young man who was vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and drugs and bad company in his life, but showed some insight into his situation. I agree with that submission. To my mind he did show some insight. She agreed that he is entitled to a discount of 25 per cent from the sentence he would otherwise receive. 

28Taking all these matters into account, I regard it an appropriate overall sentence of one of 4 years imprisonment this crime. One has to bear in mind that the maximum fixed by Parliament is 20 years. However because he has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and saved the justice system a lot of time and trouble, I will discount that to 3 years imprisonment. 

29Although I appreciate that I may be doing this calculation in the wrong order, I propose to reduce the sentence further because of his age to two and a half years in prison. That will be the sentence that I will finally impose: two and a half years imprisonment. 

30I regard an appropriate non-parole period as being one of 12 months. That means that the balance will be one and a half years. That is a very significant adjustment. Normally for a two and a half year sentence, the non-parole period should be about 22 months. In this case I have reduced it to 12 months. That is to allow him a lot of time on parole for the reasons that Ms McLaughlin has pointed out. It will enable him to continue his rehabilitation and to continue with his study and get employment. I also take into account that, given his age, the less time he spends in adult custody the better. 

31Although the sentence should really date from today, I am in fact going to date it from 6 June 2012, when he went into custody. This is another generous allowance in his favour. I should really date the sentencing back from today or at least 8 June last, because the time he has spent in custody since June has been because of other matters. But I am going to make that allowance because of his age. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now, Raven Edwards.

32I set a non-parole period for your sentence of 1 year, commencing on 8 June 2012 and expiring on 7 June 2013. The balance of the term is 18 months from 8 June 2013 to 7 December 2014. Under section 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing your release on parole on 7 June 2013. The conditions of his parole are these: 

(1)That he be of good behaviour; 
(2)That he notify the Probation & Parole Service of any change in his residential address; 
(3)That he attend court if summoned to do so; and
(4)That he accept supervision from the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and comply with all their reasonable recommendations and directions, particularly regarding drug and alcohol treatment and anger management.

33I direct compensation be paid to the victim of the offence by the offender in the sum of $160.

HIS HONOUR: You have got a two and a half year gaol sentence for what you did, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: I have given the reasons. That is why judges have to give reasons for sending people to gaol. Normally if someone gets a two and a half year gaol sentence, they spend nearly 2 years of that in gaol and then they are out on parole. So normally you could expect to be in gaol for nearly another 12 months, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: I have reduced that a lot in your case, but you are going to spend 12 months in gaol. I have dropped it by 10 months and that is to allow extra time for you to get on with your life and get some help, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: I back-dated that to 8 June to when you were arrested and so it finally expires on 7 December 2014. That is when your sentence finishes. You will be released on 7 June, 2013. That is on parole. When you are on parole, you probably know from your probation - you have been on probation? 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: You have got to stay out of the trouble. If you get into trouble any trouble again, you will be back before me, do you understand? 

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: If you change your residential address you have got to let Probation & Parole know and if you get a notice to attend court, you attend court. Do not get the police to be chasing you. The most important thing is to allow Probation and Parole to supervise you. Because you have been a child at law up to a few months ago and now you are a young adult, they know what they are doing. As I have said, you have got to comply with their recommendations and directions. In other words, you do as they say because they know what they are doing and particularly your drug and alcohol, and I know what you said yesterday, you are going stay away. When you get back in the community you will be tempted by that all again and you will be exposed to alcohol and drugs and you will need their help to stay away, do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: The other thing is anger management, because it sounds as though you go off the rails when you are drinking and you get angry and go and bash people up. They have courses to help you get your life back together, so you do not have to try to do that alone. You will let them help you, do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: It is up to you now. I think your chances are pretty good. So, finish your sentence and get on with your life.

2760570,Blazai Pty Limited v Maley & Ors (trading as Maclarens Solicitors) [2012] NSWSC 1444,"Judgment
Introduction
1The plaintiff seeks damages in negligence and for breach of contract of retainer from the first to fourth defendants (Maclarens), who are a firm of solicitors which it retained to act in relation to a real estate transaction in the second half of 2001.
2The plaintiff's claim against John Palasty, the fifth defendant, was dismissed because Mr Palasty became bankrupt and leave to proceed against him was not sought. While he was still a party to these proceedings, he swore an affidavit on which Maclarens relied in their defence of the plaintiff's claim.
3The essence of the plaintiff's claim is that Maclarens acted negligently by failing to properly advise, act on instructions and undertake investigations both before and after the exchange of contracts on 3 August 2001.  
4The plaintiff alleges the following breaches prior to exchange:
(1)failure to discover or advise that both of the proposed purchasers were recently incorporated and were companies of which John and Judith Palasty were not office holders;
(2)failure to obtain personal guarantees from John and Judith Palasty despite express instructions to do so; and
(3)failure to enquire so as to ensure that the agent, Nexus Realty, would receive $1.1m in accordance with the contract.
5The plaintiff alleges the following breaches post-exchange:
(1)failure to check that the $1.1m was received by Nexus Realty;
(2)failure to advise the plaintiff regarding that non-payment;
(3)failure to properly advise regarding the failure of Gateway to pay the extra consideration of $18,000.00 per month due under special clause 41 of the contract; and
(4)failure to properly advise in respect of the plaintiff's rights and remedies under the contract.
6Maclarens admits the retainer but disputes its extent and denies any breach.
7The central issue in the case turns on the authenticity and provenance of certain documents. The plaintiff's case is based on its having given, through its principal, Mario Loiero, certain instructions to Maclarens, including by way of written correspondence. There are numerous pieces of correspondence which, on their face, support the plaintiff's case. However, Christopher Maley, the solicitor with carriage of the transaction, gave evidence that several letters, which were apparently sent by the plaintiff to Maclarens, were not in fact sent on the dates they bear or at any time before he terminated his retainer with the plaintiff.
8The resolution of this issue turns not only on my assessment of Mr Loiero and Mr Maley, and to a lesser extent, Mrs Loiero but also on an examination of the documents themselves which, in some cases, betray their dubious provenance and the expert evidence of Ms Novotny as to an audit conducted on 25% of the open files of Maclarens randomly selected.
9As the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ) said in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at 129, the best guide on which to reason to my conclusions is to do so:
""...on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events.""
The facts
Before exchange on 3 August 2001
10Mr Loiero, the plaintiff's principal, consulted Mr Maley on 3 July 2001 and retained him to act on the plaintiff's behalf with respect to the sale by the plaintiff of a commercial site located on the Great Western Highway at St Marys (the St Marys Property) and an adjoining property which the plaintiff was in the process of purchasing (the Adjoining Property) (together the Property), which would form part of the sale. Mr Loiero had previously retained a solicitor from Maclarens with respect to a separate transaction, but had not previously retained Mr Maley.
11In the course of the conference on 3 July 2001, Mr Loiero instructed Mr Maley that the purchaser would be a company associated with John Palasty, for whom Mr Harley, solicitor, was acting but that the identity of the company had not yet been determined. Mr Loiero told Mr Maley that the sale price was to be $5.3m; there would be a deposit of 10% and that monthly payments would be made by the purchaser between exchange and completion.
12Mr Maley instructed Marlene Sweeney, a paralegal employed by Maclarens, to carry out title searches. When these title searches were received, they were stamped by Maclarens, in accordance with their usual practice to record the date of receipt of every piece of correspondence received by post or DX. The stamp generally used was distinguished by a row of 24 points at the base of the imprint.
13The following day, 4 July 2001, Mr Maley started drafting the special conditions of contract. On 5 July 2001, Mr Loiero sent a facsimile concerning the Adjoining Property to Maclarens for Ms Sweeney's attention.
14On 5 July 2001, Mr Maley prepared an engrossed version of the front page of the standard contract for sale. At that time, the purchaser's identity was not filled in because Mr Maley's instructions at that time were that it was to be a company associated with Mr Palasty. Mr Maley understood that there was to be no vendor's agent which is why there was no reference to such a person on the draft front page.
15On 9 July 2001, Joseph D'Agostino, solicitor for the vendors of the Adjoining Property, caused letters to be hand delivered to Maclarens, which contained contracts for the various pieces of land which comprised the Adjoining Property. These letters were not stamped as having been received. I accept that it was not the usual practice of Maclarens to stamp hand-delivered documents, as distinct from documents that had been received in the DX or by post, which were stamped.
16On 10 July 2001 Mr Maley sent a draft contract for sale of the Property to Mr Harley. 
17In a conversation with Mr Maley on 13 July 2001, Mr Harley proposed terms which he understood the clients to have negotiated between themselves:
(1)the purchase price was to comprise the following amounts:
(a)$10,000, which was to be released to the plaintiff;
(b)$360,000, to be released to Philip Leslie Bangel, the vendor of one of the properties that comprised the Adjoining Property;
(c)$1.1m, to be paid to the plaintiff;
(d)a further, $100,000 30 days from exchange;
(e)a further, $250,000 9 weeks from exchange; and 
(f)the balance on settlement.
(2)the purchaser would pay a monthly amount of $15,000 until settlement;
(3)to secure the return of the deposit, the plaintiff will grant a mortgage over one of the properties comprising the Adjoining Property in favour of the purchaser but that the purchaser can only exercise the power of sale if the purchaser validly terminates the contract as a result of the plaintiff's default.
18At the conclusion of this conversation, Mr Maley told Mr Harley that he would obtained the plaintiff's instructions on those terms. On 13 July 2001, Mr Maley sent a facsimile of the Special Conditions to Mr Loiero. On 16 July 2001, Mr Maley sent a facsimile to Mr Harley confirming certain terms of the contract ""subject to our client's agreement"". Mr Loiero was copied into this facsimile.
19On 20 July 2001, Mr Loiero sent a facsimile to Mr Maley in which he reported that he had met with the purchasers that day. He instructed Mr Maley to make changes to the draft conditions in accordance with handwritten changes he had made to the facsimile which Mr Maley had sent to Mr Harley. The changes included that the balance of the deposit, $1.1m, would be held in trust and an amendment recording that the purchaser would pay its own agent. The facsimile said, in part:
""Please make all final changes as attached as they will be exchanging by 12 am Monday 23 July 2001.
I should point out that if this does not occur then I will withdraw the sale from them.""
20When Mr Maley received the facsimile, he appreciated that there might be significant work in drafting and settling the Special Conditions. Accordingly, he wrote to the plaintiff on 23 July 2001, setting out the hourly rates that Maclarens proposed to charge for acting on the conveyance.
21Further versions of the draft front page of the contract at about this time show that there was to be a vendor's agent, who was to be Nexus Realty, and that the purchaser was to be Cerza Pty Limited. They also show an increase in the amount of the deposit to $1.025m.
22By letter dated 24 July 2001, Mr Maley wrote to Mr Harley enclosing an amended front page of the contract, amended special conditions and a drainage diagram. The front page recorded Nexus Realty as the vendor's agent; the purchaser as Cerza Pty Limited and the deposit as $1.025m. As in previous drafts of the front page it was provided that the deposit was not to be invested.
23By facsimile sent on 25 July 2001, Mr Loiero wrote by hand on the facsimile sent by Mr Maley to Mr Harley to provide his further instructions on behalf of the plaintiff to Mr Maley. A few minutes later he sent a further handwritten special condition to Mr Maley. Both facsimiles were sent from a business known as Jet Global Travel.
24Mr Maley's file contains a photocopy of a bank cheque in favour of the plaintiff dated 27 July 2001 in the sum of $50,000. Although Mr Maley has some recollection of the plaintiff receiving some monies from the purchaser prior to exchange I am not satisfied that this cheque came from the purchaser or was in any way associated with this transaction. Nor do I accept, for reasons set out in more detail below, Mr Loiero's evidence that it was on the file before he collected it from Maclarens on 17 December 2001.
25On 30 July 2001, Mr Maley sent a facsimile to Mr Harley, which was also copied to Mr Loiero, setting out final amendments to the front page and the special conditions. The new draft front page nominated ""Gateway Developments Pty Limited"" as the purchaser. Later that day, Mr Loiero sent a facsimile with handwritten endorsements of what he described in the coversheet as being ""final changes"". Mr Maley made changes to the contract in accordance with these instructions and despatched a further draft to Mr Harley, which was copied to Mr Loiero. Mr Maley's facsimile was sent at 12.48 pm.
26On Friday 3 August 2001, Mr Loiero and his wife went to the offices of Maclarens. Mr Loiero executed the contract for sale of the Property on behalf of the plaintiff.
27Later that day, but before exchange, Mr Loiero asked Mr Palasty to meet him downstairs at Mr Harley's office. Mr Palasty handed Mr Loiero a cheque drawn on Gateway's account with the St George Bank in the sum of $1.1m, which Mr Palasty assumed would be handed over to Nexus Realty. The basis on which the cheque was handed over by Mr Palasty to Mr Loiero was that it would not be presented. It would have been inevitable that the cheque would have bounced had it been presented because neither Gateway, nor Mr Palasty, had access to funds of that magnitude. At this time, Mr Palasty's assets had been frozen by the ANZ Bank.
28It was put by the plaintiff's counsel to Mr Palasty in cross-examination that it would be ""extremely uncommon"" for such an arrangement to be made. Mr Palasty disagreed. He said:
""There are many transactions in that way.  We, as property developers, rely on in a transaction like this where it was a very complicated site we rely on, there were certain works that needed to occur, improvements.  Mr Loiero was aware of that and it is not an unusual transaction to do that in these circumstances in this deal.
... the site was what we call a sterile site.  It had very, very serious issues associated with it.  I was always concerned that if Mr Loiero did not do certain works and did not complete certain things then we would never get the money back from him and that we needed to improve the value of that site to be able to settle at that time.
... it was always the intent to settle the transaction by basically getting the, uplifting the valuation and then getting the 70 per cent or 80 per cent on it.  That is why the cheque was done that way, Mr Loiero and myself agreed on that, that it wouldn't be banked.  Because we had to do certain works to liven the DA up that was to lapse in October ...
In this situation... the position was this, that the site had major, major earthworks associated with trying to, to make the site live for October otherwise the DA was going to lapse.  There was a major creek running through the site and the only thing that we could do was carry out work to ensure that the DA wouldn't lapse.  If the DA lapsed then your client's land would have been worth nothing.  There was no DA on it and wouldn't have got another application through, through DLAWC, the Department of Land and Water Conservation.  We were the ones that were prejudiced because we were putting money into the project to get that done and in the end we lost some money on that as well.""
29The side-deal between the plaintiff and the purchaser which had been negotiated by Mr Loiero and Mr Palasty, the reasons for which are apparent from the passages quoted above from Mr Palasty's cross-examination, was concealed from Mr Maley.
30I am satisfied that Mr Loiero's intention, throughout the period of his dealings with Mr Maley, was that, irrespective of what the contract provided on its face, the payment of deposit and other monies would be sorted out directly between the parties and no substantial cheque which could be drawn on cleared funds would be available on exchange. The contract was, in respect at least of the provision for the deposit, effectively a ruse to be provided to Mr Loiero's bank in order to give it false ""comfort"".
Exchange on 3 August 2001
31Later that day, Mr Maley went to Mr Harley's office to exchange contracts. When Mr Maley arrived, Mr Harley told him that the purchaser was not paying any money on exchange ""because it is being sorted out between the parties direct with the agent"".
32Mr Maley was very concerned about this turn of events since he had expected to receive three cheques on exchange: $150,000 which was to be released to the plaintiff; $1.1m, being the balance of the deposit, payable to the agent and $18,000 being the first monthly payment. It was, in his experience, unheard of for an exchange to occur without a deposit being received. Mr Harley then explained other, unrelated amendments to the contract.
33Mr Maley rang Mr Loiero to obtain instructions on the proposed amendments and, most importantly, on the fact that no cheques were to be provided on exchange. In the course of the conversation, Mr Loiero instructed Mr Maley that all amendments were acceptable. In relation to the issue of the deposit the following exchange occurred:
""Mr Maley: They don't have the cheques for the exchange. There is no money being paid on this exchange. They say it is being sorted out between you, the purchaser and the agent.
Mr Loiero: That's ok. That's under control. Just exchange it.
Mr Maley: Are you sure?
Mr Loiero: Yes, yes.""
34The amendments to the contract were made by hand. The contracts were then exchanged. No amendments were made to the written contract in relation to the deposit.
35That evening, Mr Maley rang Mr Loiero to tell him that exchange had occurred and no money had been received. Mr Loiero responded by saying: ""That's OK.""
Events post-exchange
36At 8.30 am on 6 August 2001, Mr Loiero rang Mr Maley and asked him to send a copy of the contract to a named person at Westpac. Mr Maley refused on the basis that the contract stipulated that a $1.25m deposit would be paid on exchange, which was contrary to the fact. Mr Loiero became agitated and insisted that it be done but Mr Maley again refused. Mr Loiero then instructed Mr Maley to send a copy of the contract to him, which Mr Maley agreed to do.
37Mr Maley gave evidence, which I accept, about the reasons for his refusal to comply with Mr Loiero's instructions, which included the following:
""I was also concerned, having attended an exchange at which no deposit was paid over, and having received a telephone call from Mr Loiero at 8.30 am the next business day demanding that a copy of the Contract be sent to Westpac, that Mr Loiero had done a side deal with the Palastys that no deposit would be paid, either immediately or at all, but that Mr Loiero wanted to represent to Westpac that the deposit had been received.""
38Mr Maley's suspicions, which were unconfirmed until Mr Palasty gave evidence of the side deal, were well-founded.
39Following this conversation Mr Maley sent a letter to Mr Loiero in which he enclosed a copy of the contract. The letter read in part:
""I confirm my telephone advice to you on exchange that I did not receive any deposit and you confirmed that you were arranging the deposit direct with the Purchaser.""
40As a result of these communications, Mr Maley had formed a dim view of Mr Loiero's conduct. His communications with Mr Loiero after 6 August 2001 were few and far between. Mr Maley diarised the need to follow up the transaction but before he did so Mr Harley visited him in his office and asked him what was happening with the settlement of the Adjoining Property and the primary application for consolidation of the lots.
41By letter dated 24 August 2001, Mr Maley wrote to Mr Loiero informing him of the purchaser's request for information and seeking instructions in order to respond. Mr Loiero did not respond. Mr Maley was not particularly troubled by his client's silence. He knew Mr Loiero to be an experienced property developer who did not require a solicitor to oversee matters such as a primary application, which principally involves surveyors.
42The matter next came up in October 2001 when Mr Harley visited Maclarens. Mr Maley asked him how the matter was going, to which Mr Harley responded that he understood their clients to be talking and working everything out, including the primary application, between themselves.
43In November 2001, when the two solicitors saw each other again, Mr Harley told Mr Maley that he believed that neither the primary application nor the plan of consolidation had been registered. Mr Maley assured him that he would find out what was happening.
44On 7 November 2001 Mr Maley wrote to Mr Loiero in the following terms:
""We refer to the above matter which we note is due to settle on 15 December 2001. Please confirm that you have attended to the warranties undertaken in the special condition of the Contract for Sale regarding in particular obtaining registration of Primary Application and a Plan of Consolidation.""
45Mr Maley received no reply. The next time he heard about the transaction was on 13 December 2001 when Greg Nash, solicitor of Nash O'Neill Tomko, rang him to tell him that he was acting for Mr Loiero in relation to the purchase of a tavern at Enfield and that Mr Loiero was blaming, amongst others, Mr Maley for the delay in the sale of the Property. 
46Mr Nash then wrote to Mr Maley by letter dated 14 December 2001 I the following terms:
""I refer to our conversation yesterday. My client does not agree that the delayed land settlement should have any bearing as to tavern completion, by our client's bank.
I also cannot see any document that gives rise for the bank to behave in this manner and in my opinion, does constitute a contractual breach.
Notwithstanding this, and bearing in mind my client's position, I have tentatively organised an urgent appointment to discuss this issue with counsel.""
47Mr Maley then asked Ms Sweeney to arrange for Mr Loiero to come to Maclarens to discuss matters. Mr Loiero attended Maclarens on 17 December 2001. Although Mr Loiero insisted that Mr Maley was in some way to blame for the delay, he did not challenge Mr Maley's statements to the following effect:
(1)Mr Loiero and Mr Palasty were dealing with the matter between themselves and Mr Maley was not involved; and
(2)Mr Loiero had at no time instructed Mr Maley that the plaintiff was purchasing a tavern, much less that the settlement of the tavern was conditional on the completion of the Property.
48The conference concluded with Mr Maley suggesting that they part company, informing Mr Loiero he would not seek payment for his services and handing the file to Mr Loiero. Mr Maley did not arrange for his file to be copied before this conference. Accordingly when he handed his file over to Mr Loiero, the arrangement of documents, the contents of the file and its integrity were no longer within his control.
Events post-termination of Mr Maley's retainer: the tampering with the file
49Mr Loiero instructed R J Thomas to act for the plaintiff in connection with the transaction.
50Mr Maley noticed, as he read through, for the purposes of these proceedings, the documents that were exhibited to Mr Loiero's affidavit and which Mr Loiero had deposed had been sent to Mr Maley, that several letters were not only inconsistent with his recollection of what had occurred, but each of them bore a ""received"" stamp which did not correspond with the ""received"" stamp which had been applied to other documents in the file. The suspicious stamp (the Blazai stamp) had 16 dashes at the bottom, whereas the stamp on undisputed documents (the Maclarens stamp) had 24.
51Mr Maley, alerted by the appearance of the Blazai stamp on the disputed documents and the Maclarens stamp on documents which were indisputably part of the file, caused his son to do a random search of files in the offices of Maclarens to see if the Blazai stamp appeared on any other document. His son selected, at random, 38 files that were open at the relevant period and inspected them. None of those files contained the Blazai stamp.
52Subsequently, Maclarens, through their solicitors retained Michelle Novotny, a document examiner, to conduct a random sample of 25% open files at Maclarens to investigate whether the Blazai stamp appeared on any documents other than the documents thought to have been added to the Maclarens file after it was delivered up by Mr Maley to Mr Loiero.
53Ms Novotny was provided with a list of open files by Maclarens. She selected files by name at random from the list. There was no indication on the list as to the nature of the matter. She requested a total of 782 files, of which 681 were provided, the balance being either not available, because the file had gone with a solicitor to another firm or had been destroyed, or not relevant because there were no documents within the file from the relevant period (mid to late 2001).
54Within these 681 files, 3,258 date stamp impressions were found and compared with the Blazai stamp and the Maclarens stamp. No stamps that corresponded with the Blazai stamp was found but 2,974 impressions that corresponded with the Maclarens stamp were found. Of the remaining 284 date stamp impressions, some were impressions on copy documents of files from other entities; others indicated that Maclarens used stamps other than the Maclarens stamp during that period.
55The evidence that every one of the suspected documents bore the Blazai stamp and that not a single document other than these documents was found in the random search described above is sufficient to establish that the documents bearing the Blazai stamp were not on the file when it left the custody of Maclarens and must have been added subsequently. 
56There are other matters which indicate that the suspicious documents were not sent on the dates they bear. As the narrative set out above indicates, Mr Loiero tended to communicate with Mr Maley by endorsing correspondence from others with his own handwriting and faxing the endorsed letter back to Mr Maley. It is contrary to his usual practice that he would send a typewritten letter of any length to Mr Maley.
57Furthermore, each of the letters from the plaintiff to which the Blazai stamp had been applied supported, in an entirely self-serving way, the case that the plaintiff now brings in these proceedings. 
58As far as the suspicious correspondence dated prior to 3 August 2001 is concerned, it is wholly at odds with the undisputed correspondence. For example, in one of the disputed letters, dated 17 July 2001, Mr Loiero seeks confirmation that the guarantees given by the Palastys were satisfactory. There was no discussion about guarantees and no reference to them in undisputed documents. Further, I do not accept that if Mr Maley had actually received such a letter, he would have done nothing.
59As appears from the narrative set out above, Mr Maley's utility as far as Mr Loiero was concerned, was to prepare a contract for sale of the Property in a form which could be exchanged and a copy despatched to Westpac, presumably with a view to obtaining further finance for the tavern purchase or to incline the bank to grant an extension on monies already due. This, together with Mr Maley's refusal to send the contract to Westpac, explain the almost total cessation of communication between Mr Loiero and Mr Maley after 6 August 2001 and up to and mid-December 2001 when Mr Maley convened the conference with Mr Loiero which resulted in the termination of his retainer.
60However, many of the suspicious documents bear dates in August, September, October and November 2001. Another noteworthy matter is that there are no responses by Mr Maley to these suspicious documents. I am satisfied that Mr Maley would not have disregarded correspondence from Mr Loiero had it been sent. His non-response is a further indication that the suspicious documents were not sent at all. 
61It is also inconceivable that Mr Loiero would have been content to keep writing detailed correspondence into the ether, without any response from Mr Maley. Mr Loiero impressed me as the type of person who would not hesitate to complain or terminate a retainer if he thought that he was not getting timely service. There are references to the monthly payments of $18,000 and the purchase of the tavern in the suspicious correspondence, which, I am satisfied, had they been sent, would have elicited a timely response from Mr Maley.
62There is another odd feature of the file in that it contains a letter from R J Thomas, solicitor, dated 19 December 2001 which has apparently been signed by Mr Thomas. It bears the Blazai stamp and represents that the letter was received on 20 December 2001. However it contains a typographical error which appears to have been corrected on a subsequent version. It was put to Mr Thomas that he may have given Mr Loiero a signed version of what he proposed to send to Mr Maley but not in fact sent it. Subsequently he might have realised that there were errors in the letter which needed to be corrected and sent a corrected version to Mr Maley. That the uncorrected version is on the Maclarens file, with the Blazai stamp, leads to the inference that this document, too, was placed on the file after Mr Loiero had collected it from Mr Maley.
63It was put on behalf of the plaintiff that it was glaringly improbable that the suspicious documents could have been prepared in the four days between 17 December 2001, when Mr Loiero collected the file from Maclarens, and 21 December 2001, which was the latest date on which he could have delivered it to his new solicitors, R J Thomas, since that was the day their offices closed for Christmas.
64First, I do not consider it to be particularly unlikely that this correspondence, voluminous as it was, could be prepared in four days. Even if the file was delivered and reviewed by Mr Thomas on 19 December 2001, as he asserted in a letter of that date to Mr Harley, this would have been sufficient time to prepare the correspondence.
65Secondly, I do not accept that the file was necessarily delivered to R J Thomas on 21 December 2001, or that if it was, it was not uplifted by Mr Loiero subsequently. Mr Thomas had no documentary record of when the file had been received or what had been done with it on receipt. He was particularly vague in his oral evidence about when the file had come into his possession.
66Thirdly, I do not accept that preparation of these false documents did not commence prior to 17 December 2001. Mr Loiero impressed me as someone who would prefer to find a financial remedy for his own misadventures and is unconcerned, as these proceedings amply demonstrate, about the means he employs to further his ends. Once it appeared that the sale of the Property would not proceed as envisaged, he may well have begun preparing his case against Mr Maley and this may have occurred prior to the meeting of 17 December 2001. After all, he had been telling others, including Mr Nash, that Mr Maley was at fault prior to that day, although there was no justification for such an allegation.
67Whether the documents were added and the Blazai stamp applied by Mr Loiero or by someone else on his behalf does not emerge from the evidence. However, Mr Loiero is the only person with any apparent interest in the matter. I am satisfied either that he tampered with the file by adding the suspected documents or that he directed someone else to do it.
68He also removed salient documents, including Mr Maley's letter of 6 August 2001, and added pink documents, which were not on the file when it was in Mr Maley's possession.
69The plaintiff sought to fortify its case that certain documents had been sent by reference to facsimile records which showed, in some instances, that letters had been sent by facsimile on the dates which corresponded with the dates on suspicious documents. In the normal course, such records could reasonably be regarded as corroboration that certain documents were sent by facsimile at certain times. However, I have no confidence that the letters that correspond with the facsimile records were the letters identified by Mr Loiero. 
70I find that after Mr Loiero obtained the file from Mr Maley he set about fabricating documents with a view to constructing a case against Mr Maley. He realised that the transaction had gone sour, and that he would not make the money he hoped to make from it. He therefore, in a dishonest and opportunistic way, sought to take advantage of Mr Maley's precipitate return of the file without making a photocopy.
71Not only did Mr Loiero fabricate correspondence from the plaintiff to Mr Maley but, in an attempt to give verisimilitude to his version, he also applied a ""received"" stamp to the correspondence before inserting it in apparent chronological sequence on the file. To this end he procured a stamp which resembled, at least to an eye not particularly attuned to deceit, the Maclarens stamp that appeared on actual correspondence within the file. 
72But he did not stop there. He also added documents in pink paper to the file. He may have seen such copy documents on other solicitors' files and thought that they, too, would fortify his assertion that the file that he had tampered with was authentic. I accept Mr Maley's evidence that Maclarens did not use pink paper.
73However, in both these endeavours, he showed a lack of appreciation of the investigation that would be conducted on behalf of Maclarens to resist what Mr Maley knew to be a false claim.
74It was for the plaintiff to establish on the balance of probabilities that the suspicious documents were in fact sent to Maclarens on or about the dates they bear: s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995. The plaintiff has not discharged that onus. Had I considered the probabilities to be equal, or less than equal, the defendants would have been entitled to succeed, even if I had not been persuaded that Mr Loiero had tampered with the file: Hammoud Bros Pty Limited v Insurance Australia Limited [2004] NSWCA 366 at [31]-[33]. In establishing the findings of fact that I have made above, Maclarens has discharged an onus which is greater than the one it bears. Nonetheless, since Maclarens has discharged that onus it is appropriate that I record the findings I have set out above.
The termination of the contract for sale of the Property
75Gateway purported to terminate the contract for sale of the Property on 23 January 2002. The plaintiff was unable to complete the purchase of the Enfield Tavern and incurred expenses arising from interest charges on facilities which it had obtained on the basis that the sale would go through. It attempted to sell the Property unsuccessfully. The plaintiff went into administration. Its administrator eventually sold the Property to an entity controlled by Mr and Mrs Palasty for $2.5m pursuant to a contract entered into on 8 July 2003 and which settled on 14 October 2003.
76Colliers valued the Property for the eventual purchaser as at 8 August 2003 for $5m on an ""as is with Development Approval"" basis.
77Laing & Simmons valued the Property as at 18 February 2004 on an ""as is with Development Approval"" to be $6.6m.
Credibility of witnesses
Mr Maley
78It is apparent from the findings of fact set out above that I accept the evidence of Mr Maley. He did not overstate his recollection. He was careful in giving evidence about a transaction that occurred more than eleven years ago. Most importantly, his evidence is consistent with the objective facts and the logic of events.
Mr Palasty
79I accept Mr Palasty's evidence generally. I accept his evidence about the side deal which had been reached between him and Mr Loiero prior to exchange of contracts and the commercial logic which underpinned the arrangement itself and the need to conceal it from persons such as Mr Maley.
80The plaintiff endeavoured to make a substantial attack on Mr Palasty's credit and insinuated, in the course of cross-examination, that he was an unscrupulous and reprehensible character who could not be believed. Furthermore it was put that his evidence about the side deal did not appear in the affidavit which was filed on Mr Palasty's behalf when he was a party to the proceedings, as fifth defendant, and that it ought be inferred accordingly that it was a recent invention. I do not accept this submission.
81In my view, Mr Palasty was understandably circumspect about deposing to the side deal in his affidavit of 4 November 2009. It was an arrangement which, although apposite to the commercial interests of the plaintiff and Gateway and their principals, Mr Loiero and Mr Palasty, at the time, tended to place both participants in a poor light. Furthermore, at the time he swore the affidavit, Mr Palasty was a party to the proceedings and therefore exposed to the risk of a judgment against him.
82Since swearing the affidavit, Mr Palasty has lost any financial or other interest he might have had in the outcome of these proceedings because he was made bankrupt. The plaintiff indicated on the first day of the hearing that he no longer proceeded against Mr Palasty. Since he is now relevantly disinterested in the proceedings, Mr Palasty's evidence is no longer affected by motive and is, in my view, credible.
Mr Loiero
83It is apparent from the findings I have already made that I found Mr Loiero's evidence to be untruthful. He was evasive about his dealings with Mr Palasty and denied that he spoke to Mr Palasty on an earlier occasion about the sale of the Property. He said, unconvincingly, ""I'm a very private guy."" He blamed his solicitors for what was, and was not, in his affidavit. He sought to minimise the role he played in the transaction and the extent to which the contract was negotiated by him with Mr Palasty.
84The following passage provides an illustration of this:
""Q. I thought you agreed with me a moment ago that you were dealing directly with Mr Palasty about these matters? A. No, sir.  I said to you that when he put the proposal to me and I was considering his proposals, and but again, I needed to be at all times - no matter who I discussed things with, I needed to go to a lawyer, the lawyer has to prepare a contract.  The lawyer has to be comfortable that whatever the person is putting to me, that I'm protected, and then I leave it in the lawyer's hands from that point.""
85Mr Loiero denied that he knew anything about the financial difficulties that Mr Palasty was experiencing and also that he was keen to have the contracts exchanged so that he could provide the contract to his bank. His hyperbole in the following passage was inherently incredible, in the circumstances of the transaction as I have found it to be:
""Q. And what I am suggesting is that you told him on being told of that issue that he had, that is, that he couldn't provide a straight forward exchange at ten per cent, that your bank was only interested in exchange? A. No, sir.  If Mr Palasty would have told me about the, anything to do with ANZ bank drama or seizing of funds and stuff, I would have heard those words.  I would have run for the hills.""
86When he was cross-examined about the suspicious documents and the inconsistencies between them and the objective probabilities, he sought to excuse the discrepancies with such excuses as:
""I am not the greatest letter writer.""
And:
""Yeah, there is a lot to hold in my head.  Yes, I am not real sure.""
87His evidence that he did not know that the deposit had not been paid was false to his knowledge. He admitted that he had received Mr Maley's letter of 6 August 2001.
88I do not accept Mr Loiero's evidence except where it is corroborated or amounts to a statement against interest.
Conclusions
89I am satisfied that Mr Maley's version of events and his recollection as to which documents were on his file when he terminated the plaintiff's retainer is correct. It is corroborated by the objective circumstances and also by indications on the ""added"" documents that they were not received by him. I consider that there was no want of reasonable care on his part in the course of his retainer, having regard to his instructions and to the surrounding circumstances.
90Further, any loss suffered by the plaintiff through the circumstance that the sale of the relevant property was not ultimately settled at the agreed price was not as a result of anything Maclarens did, or failed to do. I am not satisfied that the contract for sale of the property was a bona fide transaction; rather, it was a document prepared and executed for the purposes of misleading others, including financial institutions, into believing that the plaintiff's property had a certain value and that certain funds would be realised from its imminent sale.
91Accordingly, for the reasons given in more detail below, there will be judgment for the defendant.
Alleged negligence or breach of contract of retainer
92Although the acts giving rise to the alleged breach of contract of retainer and negligence occurred before the commencement of Part 1A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (on 6 December 2002), those provisions have application to civil liability arising before their commencement: Sch 1, cl 6(1). Part 1A applies to any claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, regardless of whether the claim is brought in tort or in contract: s 5A.
93The contract of retainer is sufficient to provide completely and exclusively for the legal rights and obligations of the parties in relation to their contractual dealings: Astley v Austrust Limited [1999] HCA 6; 197 CLR 1 at [47], per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.  Mr Maley had no duty to advise on matters going beyond the limits of his retainer: Heydon v NRMA Limited [2000] NSWCA 374; 51 NSWLR 1 at [364]. Accordingly the scope of the retainer is the principal matter that delineates the scope of the duty of care.
94The retainer is to be viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, including that the plaintiff, through Mr Loiero, not only reserved the right to conduct negotiations in the absence of Mr Maley but also negotiated a side deal which was at odds with the documents which he had instructed Mr Maley to draft and exchange.
95Mr Maley's retainer, for reasons given above, was limited to documenting the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the purchaser of the Property in accordance with his instructions and arranging for and effecting exchange of contracts if and when conditions for exchange had either been fulfilled or he had been instructed to exchange notwithstanding their non-fulfilment. He was obliged to exercise reasonable care and skill and to act in accordance with his instructions as long as he was reasonably satisfied that the client understood the implications of giving such instructions. 
96The commercial experience of the client is of significance in determining whether the solicitor's conduct in assessing whether the client understands the implications of particular instructions. Mr Loeiro was an experienced property developer who well knew the value of a contract that had apparently been exchanged and which recorded that a deposit had been paid. He was also attuned to the need to conceal from a solicitor matters which were at odds with a written agreement, lest the solicitor's professional obligations lead him or her to disclose that which the client wishes to keep secret.
97Mr Moses gave expert evidence in the plaintiff's case. The authorities establish that while expert evidence as to the duties of solicitors is admissible, it is not necessary either to establish negligence or refute it: Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne (1989) 18 NSWLR 642 at 654, per Kirby P.
98Mr Moses gave opinion evidence that even if the facts were as Mr Maley deposed them to be, as I have found, Mr Maley was nonetheless negligent in some respects.
99In the course of Mr Moses' evidence, it was apparent that he was confounded by the transaction and could not understand why any client could sensibly instruct his solicitor to exchange in the absence of a deposit and in the absence of guarantees. The commercial logic of the transaction, as I have set out above, escaped him, in part because the basis of his evidence did not include the side deal which was established by Mr Palasty's evidence.
100I formed the view that because Mr Moses found the transaction so unusual as to be inexplicable, he was unable to accept that any solicitor advising the plaintiff could reasonably be satisfied that his client understood the implications of giving the instructions to exchange although no deposit was paid. Nonetheless Mr Moses accepted that had Mr Maley refused to exchange in the face of Mr Loiero's unambiguous instructions he might have exposed himself to a claim on that basis alone.
101Mr Moses gave evidence as to what he considered to be standard practice. However in circumstances where the transaction was, in his experience, unique, recourse to standard practice was unhelpful. Nonetheless Mr Moses accepted that a deposit of the size provided for under the contract would, if paid, have been sufficient to protect the plaintiff's interests in the event of default by the purchaser. In these circumstances, it was not necessary for Mr Maley to concern himself with the value of the purchaser, or whether there were personal guarantees of performance. 
102I accept Mr Maley's evidence that  it is not unusual in a transaction like the subject transaction for the company entity intended to purchase the property to change prior to exchange. I also accept Mr Maley's evidence that he placed significant weight on the size of the deposit which he understood, until specifically instructed to the contrary, was to be paid.
103I do not consider that Mr Moses' evidence adequately took into account the experience of the plaintiff as a property developer and the degree to which the plaintiff and Mr Palasty chose to negotiate important terms of the contract directly between themselves, without recourse to Mr Maley. It was not necessary, in my view, for Mr Maley to point out matters to Mr Loeiro which would have been perfectly obvious to Mr Loeiro. Duties are imposed on solicitors to protect clients, not to protect solicitors against clients who neither want, nor require, such protection.
104I do not consider that Mr Maley had any duty to advise the plaintiff that Cerza and Gateway had been recently incorporated or that they were companies of which John and Judith Palasty were not office holders. Mr Loiero was apparently untroubled by the identity of the corporate vehicle nominated by Mr Palasty to be the purchaser. Since Mr Loiero was aware of Mr Palasty's financial difficulties he would have known that there was little, or no, point in obtaining personal guarantees, even in the unlikely event that they had been forthcoming. Both the plaintiff and Mr Palasty were engaged in a speculative venture; for a time they shared an interest in executing transaction documents which said one thing, while at the same time, having an antecedent agreement between them which they regarded as binding. Guarantees formed no part of this.
105Nor do I accept that it showed any want of reasonable care on the part of Mr Maley that he did not ensure that Nexus Realty received $1.1m in accordance with the contract. He had been specifically instructed to exchange although he did not receive any money on exchange. In all the circumstances he was bound by his instructions since they came from Mr Loiero whose commercial sophistication entitled him to subject the plaintiff to such risks as he considered worth taking for the chance of financial gain.
106I reject the proposition that Mr Maley owed a duty to advise the plaintiff concerning the alleged failure of Gateway to pay the extra consideration of $18,000 per month due under special condition 41 of the contract. Mr Loiero had washed his hands of Mr Maley after 6 August 2001. He did not need Mr Maley to tell him what the contract said, since he had instructed him as to its terms.
107The plaintiff has not established that Mr Maley was negligent or in breach of the contract of retainer. In my view, Mr Maley took all reasonable precautions to protect the plaintiff from the foreseeable risk of harm that a reasonable solicitor in his position would have taken.
108Although it is not necessary that I determine causation or damage, I shall proceed to make findings in respect of these matters: Wolfenden v International Theme Park Pty Ltd (Trading As Wonderland) and Anor [2008] NSWCA 78 at [6], per Giles JA.
Causation of loss
109The plaintiff bears the onus of proving causation on the balance of probabilities; in other words, that had the ""correct"" advice been given he would have done something different: s 5D and s 5E of the Civil Liability Act and Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4; 179 CLR 332 at 355, per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.
110The plaintiff's case is, in substance, that Maclarens' negligence caused him to lose the chance of selling the Property for $5.3m. In order to determine whether the plaintiff has suffered any loss as a result of Maclarens' (assumed) default it is necessary to determine, on the balance of probabilities, first: what the plaintiff would have done but for Maclarens' default: Heenan v Di Sisto [2008] NSWCA 25, at [30]-[31] (Heenan).
111The second step is to determine what the third party, in this case, Gateway/Mr Palasty would have done in the event that, for instance guarantees were insisted upon or steps were taken to ensure payment of the deposit monies, including the $1.1m component due to held by Nexus Realty.
112I am satisfied that, if Mr Loeiro had been advised to obtain guarantees before exchanging without a deposit, he would have rejected that advice. If he had been advised not to exchange without a deposit, he would have rejected that advice. He would not have provided instructions to do anything in respect of the deposit monies, including the $1.1m to be paid to Nexus Realty, since he knew that there were no cleared funds available and that the matters were to be worked out directly between the parties).
113Mr Loiero would not have avoided entering into the contract or terminated it had he known of the true state of affairs since he did know the true state of affairs: namely that Mr Palasty had no access to funds to provide a deposit and was only prepared to have Gateway execute a contract which stipulated the purchase price of $5.3m because Gateway was not at risk of losing a deposit and no guarantees had been given. It was only when Mr Palasty indicated his intention not to settle and threatened to sue in December 2001, at a time Mr Loiero was not providing instructions to Mr Maley, that Mr Loiero's position changed.
114There is no evidence that establishes that even if Mr Loiero had caused the plaintiff to terminate the contract and pursued its rights and remedies under the Gateway contract, he would have been in a position to recover anything against Gateway. It is common ground that Gateway was a $2 company.
115Furthermore, I do not accept that the Property was, as at August 2001 when contracts for its transfer were exchanged, worth $5.3m. The contract did not represent the true agreement between the parties, at least as to the deposit. I am not satisfied that the consideration of $5.3m was not subject to a side deal as well as the deposit. It suited Mr Loiero's purposes for the contract to stipulate $5.3m as consideration, so that he could mislead Westpac as to the value of the Property.
116The valuations that were tendered by the plaintiff in support of the value of the Property are dated at around the time or subsequent to its eventual sale for $2.5m. The price which the plaintiff's administrator was able to obtain for the Property on the open market is a more reliable indication of its value than the valuations obtained for the purposes of applications for finance.
117For these reasons I am not satisfied that the plaintiff ever had a real chance of selling the Property for $5.3m.
118In any event, the plaintiff is not entitled to damages with respect to monies paid to Westpac in respect of the facility entered into for the purposes of the Enfield Tavern purchase. Mr Maley was not made aware of the tavern purchase and there is no reason why he should have realised that such a loss might result from the failure of the St Marys transaction to settle. The damages are, accordingly, too remote to be recoverable even if the plaintiff were otherwise entitled to damages.
Orders
119For the foregoing reasons, I make the following orders:
(1)Judgment for the first to fourth defendants.
(2)Subject to order (3) below, order the plaintiff to pay the first to fourth defendants' costs of these proceedings.
(3)Direct that any party who, or which, seeks a costs order different from that set out in (2) make such application in writing to my chambers within seven days of these reasons.

		29 November 2012",2012-11-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760584,LA v Commissioner for Children and Young People [2012] NSWSC 1454,"Judgment

1In 2008 the plaintiff, LA, made an application under s 33I of the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998, seeking an order declaring that Division 2 of Part 7, Prohibitions on child-related employment, did not apply to him in respect of a specified offence, which had been dealt with in 1985 under s556A of the Crimes Act 1900. In February 2012, the Administrative Decisions Appeal Tribunal refused his application. 

2Under s 33I(7), LA has the right to bring an appeal on a question of law to this Court, in respect of that refusal. 

3LA is an 84 year old unrepresented litigant. At the hearing he explained that he was impecunious, but had at one time undertaken some legal studies. He drew the summons initiating these proceedings on the basis of an all grounds appeal, but finally directed his submissions to various matters of law which he sought to pursue. He particularly drew attention to his complaints about the retrospective operation of the Act; an alleged error in his criminal record; and charges he claimed had been wrongly laid against him, which had resulted in him becoming the victim of a conspiracy in which he had been wrongly identified to be a murderer and a paedophile. 

4LA submitted that he had wrongly been dealt with on the basis of hearsay, assumption and innuendo, on circumstantial and coincidental evidence, without direct evidence of anything. From the outset there had been an error of law when he was first identified as a prohibited person, because the offence he was originally charged with in 1984 had been 'downgraded', with the result that he had been dealt with for a lesser offence than that with which he was originally charged. In the result, he was not a prohibited person for the purposes of this legislative scheme. 

La's first application 

5In order to understand the issues lying between the parties, it is necessary to appreciate that in 2003, LA first made a similar application under predecessor legislation, the Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998. That application followed upon LA becoming a prohibited person, by operation of that Act. 

6That LA was a prohibited person only came to his attention after a working with children check was made under the Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act, after LA sought 'child-related employment'. That was then defined to include work as a volunteer. On his account, LA had to that point been involved in volunteer work with children for very many years, including as a coach for his children and grandchildren's sporting teams. It was then that advice was first given by the Commissioner, that he was a prohibited person. That led to his 2003 application to the Tribunal.

7A prohibited person was then defined in s 5 of the Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act to include a person who had been 'convicted of a serious sex offence, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection'. The word 'convicted' was not defined, but the word 'conviction' was, the definition in s 3 providing:

""conviction includes a finding that the charge for an offence is proven, or that a person is guilty of an offence, even though the court does not proceed to a conviction.""


8LA's position had to be understood in the context of the then provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, which included s 556A, which relevantly provided:
""556A Power to permit release of offenders
(1) Where any person is charged before any court with an offence punishable by such court, and the court thinks that the charge is proved, but is of opinion that, having regard to the character, antecedents, age, health, or mental condition of the person charged, or to the trivial nature of the offence, or to the extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed, or to any other matter which the court thinks it proper to consider, it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, or any other than a nominal punishment, or that it is expedient to release the offender on probation, the court may, without proceeding to conviction, make an order either:
(a) dismissing the charge, or
(b) discharging the offender conditionally on his or her entering into a recognizance, with or without sureties, to be of good behaviour and to appear for conviction and sentence when called on at any time during such period, not exceeding three years, as may be specified in the order.
....""


9A 'serious sex offence' was defined in s 5(3)(a) to include an offence involving sexual activity or acts of indecency committed in New South Wales, that was punishable by penal servitude or imprisonment for 12 months or more. 

10In 1984, LA was charged with an offence under s 78Q(1) of the Crimes Act, of an act of gross indecency with a male person under the age of 18 years. The maximum penalty for that offence was 2 years imprisonment. In proceedings in the then Magistrates Court, in which both the victim and LA gave evidence, he was dealt with under s 556A. That appeared on his record.

11In the result, even though he was dealt with under s 556A of the Crimes Act, LA understanding as a result that he had no criminal record, the Commissioner took the view that LA fell within the statutory definition of a prohibited person under the Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act, which was later enacted. So it was that he eventually came to make his 2003 application, which failed on its merits. LA then appealed to this Court. That appeal was refused. 

12On this appeal in relation to his 2008 application under the current provisions of the Commission for Children and Young People Act, despite the conclusions reached in relation to his 2003 application, it was LA's submission that from the outset, he had incorrectly been identified as a prohibited person. This submission rested on his claim that while in 1984 he had initially been charged with an offence under s 78Q, at the hearing in the Magistrate's Court in 1985, he had in fact then been dealt with for a lesser offence. 

The alleged conspiracy

13LA also gave an extensive account of later events which have occurred over the course of the very many intervening years, which have left him with the view that he has become the victim of a very serious conspiracy, designed to cover up other people's responsibility for criminal offences of the most serious kind, including sexual assaults of male children and the murder of a young man. On his account, this murder eventually became the subject of Coronial proceedings, which finally delayed the hearing of his second application to the Tribunal. 

14I do not propose to detail his views about this conspiracy, which he believes needs to be the subject of a Royal Commission. Neither the proceedings before the Tribunal nor this appeal are concerned with his views about these matters, no matter how strongly held. 

The nature of these proceedings

15The Tribunal's jurisdiction was to hear and determine LA's application for a declaration under the current Act. In considering that application, it was bound by s 32 of the Act, which provides:

""32 Safety and welfare of children to be paramount consideration

The safety and welfare of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration in the operation of this Part.""


16On this appeal both the parties and the Court must restrict themselves to dealing with the issues of law which lie between the parties, which LA is entitled to pursue under s 33I(7). That is the subject of this appeal, not LA's other wide ranging concerns, nor even the merits of the Tribunal's decision.

The proceedings before the Tribunal

17The proceedings were commenced in 2008. In 2009 a preliminary question was determined as to whether LA's 1984 offence fell within the legislative scheme. The hearing of his application was then delayed while LA was involved in certain Coronial proceedings. They concerned the alleged victim of offences with which he had been charged in 1996, but of which he was acquitted, after the victim disappeared. 

18When the proceedings resumed before Deputy President Higgins in March 2011, the position was that LA had not provided any statement on which he wished to rely in support of his application, but he had filed written submissions, which explained his wide ranging purposes in bringing the application. The Commissioner relied on material which included LA's criminal history and evidence which had been received in the 2003 proceedings. It was tendered without objection.

19LA's application that various people be summonsed was then considered. The parties had filed written submissions, which they addressed. 

20LA explained that he wished to summons Professor Greenberg, because his case was that evidence which Professor Greenberg had given in the 2003 proceedings had been the fundamental and only reason his first application had failed. There was no objection to Professor Greenberg being called and he later gave evidence. 

21As to the other summonses, LA explained that he wanted to call the other witnesses because his main object was not to let a number of murders be covered up and that he proposed to try and build the Tribunal proceedings into a Royal Commission. The Deputy President warned that this was not the Tribunal's role, but the issue of the summonses was pressed. 

22The Deputy President took the view that only two of the proposed witnesses could conceivably provide evidence relevant to LA's application. It was explained to LA that the Tribunal could not look behind the conviction in respect of which his application was made; that it had no power to investigate his allegations of corruption; and that it had to determine the question which arose on his application under the legislative scheme, which depended on the question of whether he posed a risk to children. 

23In the result LA's application was refused, although he was given leave to renew his application, in relation to one other person, who LA had explained in his submissions would be the main witness, if there was ever a Royal Commission. A record of interview by that person was in evidence, it was explained for the Commissioner, in order to establish that LA had been seen in the company of the alleged victim of the offences he had been charged with in 1996. That statement had been given in the course of a police investigation into his disappearance. As it later transpired, LA himself put in evidence material concerning these charges and made submissions about them. That he knew the alleged victim was finally not in issue. 

24Because LA had not filed any statement in support of his application, the proceedings were then adjourned, so that he could file any statement on which he wished to rely. 

25LA later filed a document, which was largely a further submission, to which was annexed various documents, including extracts from transcript of the 1996 proceedings, correspondence he had sent to members of Parliament and various authorities, explaining his complaints about failures to investigate various alleged corruption; newspaper and other media reports; Professor Greenberg's 2003 report; statements made by various persons, including police officers, in relation to the charges which he faced in 1996; as well as parts of the transcript of Coronial proceedings. 

26He relied on this material at the further hearing in May 2011, when the parties advanced their respective cases. Because LA had made a statement in the 2003 proceedings on which he was then cross examined, he was not required for cross-examination on this application. Professor Greenberg was then called and cross-examined by LA. After the Professor was re-examined, LA was given the opportunity to cross examine him further. The parties later put on written submissions. 

The Tribunal's decision

27The Deputy President approached her consideration of LA's application in the light of binding authority as to the nature of the proceedings and the onus which fell on LA under the legislative scheme. She observed at [19] - [21]: 
""19 The Court of Appeal has recently confirmed that the exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under section 33I of the Commission Act is protective and not punitive in nature: see Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111 per Young JA at [61]. That is, the purpose of this Act is not to impose additional punishment on a person, but to eliminate possible risks to children. The Repealed Act had a similar purpose: see R v Commission for Children and Young People [2002] NSWIR Comm 101 at [130]. 


20 The word 'risk' in the context of prohibited persons working in child-related employment was considered by Young CJ (in Equity) in Commission for Children and Young People v V [2002] NSWSC 949; 56 NSWLR 476, at [42]. His Honour said that in the context of subsection 9(4) of the Repealed Act, 'risk' did not mean 'minimal risk', 'fanciful, or theoretical risk' to children. His Honour went on to say: 

'...[what] one is looking for is whether, in all the circumstances, there is a real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk that is greater than the risk of any adult preying on a child. One, however, must link the word ""risk"" with the words that follow, namely, ""to the safety of children ''. 

21 In making these remarks His Honour adopted the analyses that had been given by Haylen J in R v Commission for Children and Young People [2002] NSWIR Comm 101, at [104]. Some care must be taken in applying the entirety of this analysis, as the provisions of the Commission Act are not in exactly the same terms as the Repealed Act. However, the above remarks of Young CJ (Equity), have been followed by the Tribunal since the Commission Act has come into force.""


28The Deputy President referred to the procedural history, noting the decision given by Deputy President Britton in March 2009, as to the preliminary issue of whether LA's 1984 offence fell within the terms of the Act and to the 2011 decision on the issue of the summonses LA had sought to have issued. 

29The Deputy President noted that much of the material on which LA relied, related to his concerns and objections as to the manner in which other proceedings in which he had been involved had been conducted. She noted that LA had objected to certain evidence on which the Commissioner had relied, because his request for summonses addressed to people who had given evidence in those proceedings had been refused. The Deputy President said that in the result, she had determined LA's application without regard to that material, even though she did not accept his grounds of objection.

30The Deputy President concluded that LA had not met the onus falling upon him to establish that he was not a risk to children. She explained that she had considered the evidence about the 1984 offence and LA's written submissions, in which he still contended that he had been found guilty of a lesser offence than that which appeared on his criminal record. She concluded that the evidence showed that the offence was objectively serious.

31The Deputy President noted the time which had passed since that offence, but concluded that LA continued to lack insight into his behaviour towards the victim. She considered LA's criminal record, including the 1992 restricted substance offence. She also dealt with the alleged offences with which LA was charged in 1996. It had been dealt with in the 2003 proceedings, where LA had given evidence, to which she referred. She also dealt with a 1993 fraud offence and Professor Greenberg's evidence.

32The Deputy President observed that while LA continued to challenge the findings made against him in these other proceedings, the proceedings before the Tribunal were not the forum in which such challenges could be pursued. 

33The Deputy President considered that although it had been 8 years since LA had made his first application, he had advanced no new material relevant to the issues arising on his application under the Commission for Children and Young People Act. In the result the Deputy President concluded that LA's application should be dismissed, because he had not discharged his onus under the Act, to establish that he was not a risk to children. She observed that his approach remained that identified by Professor Greenberg in his 2003 report, of continuing to challenge findings which had been made against him, even though the proceedings before the Tribunal were not the forum for such an exercise

34The Deputy President was of the view that the question LA had to address was the steps he had taken to address his 1984 offending conduct, to which his application related. The evidence was that LA had not taken any, but had continued to develop and maintain inappropriate relationships with young boys, as evidenced by his 1992 conviction for supplying a prohibited drug and the relationship which gave rise to the 1996 charges laid against him. The fact that he had not been convicted of those charges did not mean that he posed no risk to children. His own evidence as to the nature of the relationship with the alleged victim of those alleged offences, gave rise to ongoing concerns as to whether LA posed a risk to children. 

35The safety and welfare of children being paramount, the Deputy President was not satisfied that evidence which showed only that no new allegations of offending conduct had been made, discharged LA's onus. The fact that the 1984 offence had occurred many years ago and that LA is now an elderly man who has not since been convicted of any further offences involving children, was in the Deputy President's view not a sufficient basis upon which to make the order sought. 

Is LA a 'prohibited person'?

36Child related employment is now regulated by Part 7 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act. A 'prohibited person' is there relevantly defined in s 33B as:

"" (a) a person convicted of a serious sex offence, the murder of a child or a child-related personal violence offence, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, or

...""


37It may not be overlooked that the definition is concerned with convictions 'before or after the commencement of this subsection'. That the offence to which LA's application relates is an offence committed in 1984, plainly does not bring him beyond the scope of this statutory scheme. 

38A person 'convicted' of an offence is a person who has a 'conviction'. While the word 'convicted' is also not defined in this Act, 'conviction' is defined in broad terms in s 33 as:

""conviction includes a finding that the charge for an offence is proven, or that a person is guilty of an offence, even though the court does not proceed to a conviction.""



39In the result, notwithstanding LA's long held belief that because the 1985 offence was dealt with under s 556A of the Crimes Act, he had no criminal record, given these provisions of the current Commission for Children and Young People Act, he is 'a person convicted of an offence', for the purposes of s 33B. 

40That is because the 1984 offence was dealt with under the now repealed s 556A. Orders made under s 556A are such that under this legislative scheme, a person found guilty, but dealt with under s 556A, nevertheless has a 'conviction' for the purposes of this Act. 

41If such a 'conviction' is for a 'serious sex offence' as defined in s 33B, then such a person is a 'prohibited person' as defined. ""Serious sex offence"" is defined in s 33B relevantly to mean:

""(a) an offence involving sexual activity or acts of indecency that was committed in New South Wales and that was punishable by penal servitude or imprisonment for 12 months or more, or...""


LA's 1984 offence is a 'serious sex offence' as defined

42What offence LA was dealt with under s 556A in 1985 was a question of fact to be determined on the evidence led before the Tribunal.

43LA contended on appeal that his criminal record was wrong and that the charge brought against him under s 78Q of the Crimes Act was not finally the charge pressed against him in the 1985 proceedings. His case was that it was a lesser offence of indecency, in respect of which the findings under s 556A were made. LA also contended that at the hearing in 1985, he had admitted the lesser offence and that was what was found proven and dealt with under s 556A. 

44He also explained that in 1985 his case was that he had acted in self defence when he was attacked. It was during that attack that he had grabbed the victim's testacles. That was an act of indecency, which he had admitted at the trial in 1985. He complained about the inadequacy of the evidence available about the 1985 proceedings, submitting that:

""it is wrong that I can be convicted of a crime with no transcript evidence other than assumption and I think it is a disgrace""


45It was common ground that there was no transcript of the 1985 proceedings available to be tendered before the Tribunal. What was tendered included LA's NSW Police Criminal History record; the bench sheet which recorded the offence with which LA was then charged and how it was disposed of by the presiding magistrate; as well as a record of the 'master tape' of those proceedings; and a statement which LA had made to the police. 

46The bench sheet records that in 1985 it was a charge under s 78Q(1) of the Crimes Act, which was dealt with under s 556A. The bench sheet has recorded on it in handwriting: ""Offence proven, dismissed section 556A CA"". It is signed by the Magistrate, Mr Wooldridge. 

47The Master tape document is a written record about what the audio tape kept of the proceedings contains. It reveals by reference to counter references, the points of the recording at which both the victim of the offence and LA gave evidence, amongst other things. It also indicates that 'result Dismissed s 556A'. It does not indicate that LA was dealt with for some other offence than that referred to in the bench sheet. 

48It follows that the Master tape document does not establish that LA was dealt with for some offence other than the s 78Q(1) offence he was charged with. Nor does the bench sheet which the presiding Magistrate maintained. It refers only to an offence under s 78Q(1) having been dealt with in those proceedings. The orders made in the 1985 proceedings were valid until set aside. There is no suggestion that any such application has ever been made. In the result, they could not be challenged in the proceedings before the Tribunal, as LA sought to do.

49Also to be considered is that at the time, the Crimes Act does not appear to have included a lesser offence of indecency, as opposed to the s 78Q(1) offence of gross indecency, as LA claimed. The maximum penalty for a s 78Q(1) offence was 2 years imprisonment. That brings LA's offence within the definition of 'serious sex offence'.

50To establish his case LA relied on observations made in 1992 by a District Court judge, Flannery J, in remarks on sentence at a later criminal trial, that he had no previous convictions. On LA's approach, it followed that the conclusions reached by the Tribunal as to his record were wrong. 

51Whether or not LA fell within the definition of a 'prohibited person' depends on his criminal record and whether it brings him within the relevant statutory definitions. It does not depend on how that record was later treated, for different purposes, under another statutory scheme. 

52In any event, the remarks LA relied on do not establish any error of law on the Tribunal's part. There is no suggestion that in 1992 LA disputed that his record included a conviction for a 'gross act of indecency', the s 78Q(1) offence. To the contrary, what Flannery J then said was:

""He has only one prior entry which was for committing a gross act of indecency for which he got a s556A for I am entitled to and do infer that it was a relatively minor matter...Apart from his good record ..."" 



53Those remarks rather suggests that at that time, LA did not consider that there was any error in his criminal record.

54In the result there was no error shown in the Tribunal's conclusion that LA was a prohibited person under the Commission for Children and Young People Act.

The onus in the ADT proceedings lay on LA

55The way in which the s 78Q charge was dealt with in 1985 had the result that LA had the right, as a prohibited person, to make an application to the Tribunal for the orders which he sought below and it had jurisdiction to determine that application, on its merits. 

56One of the complaints which LA pressed on appeal was the inadequacy of the evidence before the Tribunal. This complaint had three aspects, the first, the inadequacy of the evidence about the 1985 proceedings; the second, the Tribunal's refusal to permit him to issue summonses to a number of people, including the victim who gave evidence in the 1985 proceedings; and the third, his complaint about the evidence led from Professor Greenberg.

57All of these matters have to be considered in the context of the nature of the proceedings before the Tribunal and the onus imposed by the legislative scheme under which LA's application was brought.

58 LA made his application to the Tribunal under the Commission for Children and Young People Act, once he was permitted to do so, after a 5 year interval from the refusal of his 2003 application. Part 7 Child Related Employment of this Act has as its objects:

""31 Object of Part
The object of this Part is to protect children:
(a) by prohibiting certain persons from being involved in child-related employment, and
(b) by means of background checking administered by the Commission and other agencies""


59Section 33I applied to the application. It provides:
""33I IRC and ADT may make declarations concerning prohibited persons
(1) On the application of a prohibited person, a relevant tribunal may make an order declaring that this Division is not to apply to the person in respect of a specified offence.
(2) A relevant tribunal is:
(a) the Industrial Relations Commission, or
(b) the Administrative Decisions Tribunal.
(3) The Commission for Children and Young People is to be a party to any proceedings for an order under this section. The Commission may make submissions in opposition to or support of the making of the order.
(4) An applicant must fully disclose to the relevant tribunal any matters relevant to the application.
(5) If a relevant tribunal refuses to make an order under this section, the prohibited person is not entitled to make an application for an order under this section or section 33H in respect of that offence until after the period of 5 years from the date of the tribunal's refusal, unless the tribunal otherwise orders at the time of refusal.
(6) Orders under this section may be made subject to conditions.
(7) The following applies to proceedings before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal under this section:
(a) the Tribunal may not award costs,
(b) an appeal lies on a question of law to the Supreme Court by any party to the proceedings.""


60The Commissioner opposed LA's application. The application for the issue of the subpoenas which he sought was also opposed, other than in the case of Professor Greenberg, who had given evidence in the 2003 proceedings. 

61LA's application had to be dealt with by the Tribunal in accordance with the requirements of s 33J, which imposed an onus on LA to establish that he did not pose a risk to the safety of children. Under s 33J(2) there is a presumption that until he proved to the contrary, he did pose such a risk. The section provides:

""33J Matters to be considered in determining review applications
(1) The Commission or a relevant tribunal is not to make an order on a review application unless it is satisfied that the person the subject of the application does not pose a risk to the safety of children.
(2) In any proceedings for a review application, it is to be presumed, unless the applicant proves to the contrary, that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
(3) In deciding whether or not to make an order in relation to a person, the Commission or a relevant tribunal is to take into account the following:
(a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a prohibited person,
(b) the period of time since those offences were committed,
(c) the age of the person at the time those offences were committed,
(d) the age of each victim of the offences at the time they were committed,
(e) the difference in age between the prohibited person and each such victim,
(f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child,
(g) the prohibited person's present age,
(h) the seriousness of the prohibited person's total criminal record,
(i) such other matters as the Commission or tribunal considers relevant.""


62In the result it was LA who had to bring evidence which discharged the onus which fell upon him in the proceedings, to establish that he did not pose a risk to the safety of children. As I have explained, in doing so he could not challenge his criminal record, as he sought to do.

63There was no issue that the Tribunal had the power to issue the summonses LA sought to have issued. The conduct of the proceedings was governed by the provisions of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997. 

64By s 73 of that Act, the Tribunal was not bound by the rules of evidence. It could inquire into and inform itself on any matter, in such manner as it thought fit, subject to the rules of natural justice. It also had to act with as little formality as the circumstances of the case permitted and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms. This obliged the Tribunal to act fairly in the particular circumstances before it and 'to avoid practical injustice', as discussed in a different statutory context by Gleeson CJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [37] - [38].

65It is in that context that LA's complaints about the evidence have to be considered. The Tribunal's conclusions on the merits of the application do not arise for consideration on this appeal.

Should LA have been permitted to issue a summons to the victim of the 1984 offence given the available evidence about that offence?

66LA had sought a direction under s 84(1)(b) of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act, for some 16 summonses to be issued to witnesses. The Commission opposed the application, except in the case of Professor Greenberg. It was refused.

67In her final decision Deputy President Higgins returned to the refusal of this application. She noted that LA had provided comprehensive written submissions as to the reasons why those summonses should be issued to various people, including the victim of the 1985 offence. The Deputy President observed that LA had not established that the victim could give relevant evidence, LA having disclosed that he sought to call him, so that he could attack the evidence the victim had given in the 1985 proceedings. The Deputy President was of the view that this was an improper purpose for calling the victim.

68On appeal, while the 1985 bench sheet indicates that LA entered a plea of not guilty, LA submitted that he had admitted the allegations at the hearing. That was inconsistent with another of his submissions, that he had acted in self defence. That account was consistent with the statement he made at the time to police, but it is an account which cannot have been accepted by the Magistrate, given his conclusion. 

69There was various evidence led as to what had occurred in the 1985 proceedings before the Tribunal, as I have explained, but the evidence which the victim had given in 1985 was not able to be tendered. The tape recording of those proceedings is no longer available, only the outcome of the proceedings. The outcome, having the matter dealt with under s556A, was clearly favourable to LA, particularly given his submission on appeal, that at the 1985 hearing he had confessed to the offence then dealt with. 

70The Deputy President considered LA's statement, in order to determine 'the essence of the conduct' involved in the matters which became the subject of the1984 charge. She noted that in his written submissions, 'LA asserted that his actions were an act of self-defence (i.e. 'LA ended the conflict by grabbing the attacker by the testicles to avoid further injury to his younger opponent') and not an act of 'self sexual gratification' as asserted by the Commissioner'. 

71The Deputy President did not accept this submission, given LA's police statement and the evidence LA had given. She concluded that it was clear from the Magistrate's finding of guilt of the offence of gross indecency, that to a large extent, the victim's account was accepted and LA's explanation, as contained in his record of interview, rejected. 

72The offence was concerned with LA grabbing the victim's testicles. Consistently with the finding of guilt, the Deputy President did not accept that LA had done this in self defence. The Deputy President was of the view that LA could reasonably have then known that the victim was under the age of 18 and thus a child. 

73The Deputy President concluded that the s 78Q offence the subject of LA's application was objectively serious, notwithstanding that it had been dealt with under s 556A. She also found that LA continued to lack any insight into his own behaviour and unlawful conduct as a 55 year old man, towards his victim, who was then aged 16.

74It is in those circumstances that LA complains that it was procedurally unfair for him to have been refused leave to issue the summonses he had sought. He argued that he ought to have been entitled to demonstrate that his original charge related to an indisputable liar, a drug addict who in 1984/85 had a long criminal record as a 16 year old, while 'at that time and since I have been proved as a respectable citizen, character wise, irrespective of my criminal [case]"". 

75It seems to me that no error in the Deputy President's approach to LA's application to issue a summons to his victim has been established. 

76Under both this statutory scheme and its predecessor, there is a presumption that the applicant is a risk to the safety of children, until such time as he satisfies the Tribunal that he does not present such a risk. 

77On appeal, LA explained that the evidence which he gave at the 1985 hearing was different to what he had earlier said in his statement. His concern was that the transcript or recording of the 1985 proceedings was not available to be tendered before the Tribunal. 

78It is apparent from the case which LA advanced below, however, that what LA sought to do by calling his victim before the Tribunal, was to support his evidence that he had acted in self defence in 1985. He wanted to advance a case that his evidence about that matter should be preferred over that of his victim, given their respective characters. Thereby he sought to challenge the conclusions reached in the 1985 trial.

79Proceedings in the ADT under s 33I are not proceedings in which conclusions reached in such criminal proceedings can be so challenged. Such a challenge to the presiding Magistrate's conclusions on the evidence led at the 1985 hearing would require an appeal to be brought against that decision. There has never been such an appeal.

80LA leading evidence as to the result of the 1985 proceedings and giving evidence as to what had then occurred, was certainly consistent with the obligation imposed upon him by s 33I(4) of the Commission for Children and Young People Act, to fully disclose to the Tribunal any matters relevant to his application. The tender of the statement which he had made to the police in 1985 about his offence, was also in accordance with that obligation. 

81What LA was not entitled to do in the proceedings before the Tribunal was to summons his victim, in order to challenge the conclusions which were reached in those criminal proceedings, as he sought to do. In making its decision the Tribunal was required by s 33J to have regard to his criminal record. He was not entitled to challenge it, before the Tribunal.

82In the result, there was no procedural unfairness or other error of law in the Deputy President's refusal to issue a summons to the victim of the offence. 

Should LA have been permitted to issue other summonses?

83LA complains that he was denied procedural fairness by the refusal of his request to issue other summonses to other people, such as police officers and others he claims were involved in the matters with which he was charged in 1996 and matters which became the subject of the Coronial proceedings. 

84The Deputy President was of the view that LA had not established the relevance of the evidence which such persons could give, noting that what he sought to do was to attack the statements and evidence they had given in other proceedings. 

85In the 2003 proceedings LA gave evidence and made submissions about his criminal record after 1985, as well as the charges which he faced in 1996 and the circumstances in which he was acquitted of those charges. He made further submissions about these matters in the proceedings below. Given the nature of his record, the nature of the 1996 charges and the circumstances in which he was acquitted, it is apparent that these matters were all relevant to the application which the Tribunal had to determine. They were matters which LA was obliged to disclose to the Tribunal, in accordance with s 33I(4). 

86LA's criminal record included a 1992 conviction for supplying a restricted substance, rophynol and a conviction in 1993 for defrauding the Commonwealth in relation to unemployment benefits, over a period of some 10 years. LA's evidence and submissions before the Tribunal were that he had supplied such tablets to two boys, but he contended that he had done so in order to help them; that his conviction was obtained by corrupt police; and that he had not pressed an appeal against this conviction to the District Court, when informed that he could face a higher penalty. 

87The Deputy President also dealt with the 18 counts of sexual assault and 23 counts of aggravated indecent assault involving a young male victim aged between 15 and 16 years, with which LA was charged. They were offences alleged to have occurred in 1994 and 1995, after LA was released from custody in relation to the fraud charges. Because of his objections to the material on which the Commissioner relied, the Deputy President rested her conclusions on the evidence and submissions which LA made about these matters.

88The Deputy President noted the account given by LA in his evidence, of how he came to be involved with the victim. He said that he knew the victim to be a street kid and a prostitute and that he had tried to help him. The Deputy President noted his denial of any sexual involvement with the victim and his denial of the offences with which he was charged. She also noted that while the victim had initially appeared at the hearing, a finding of not guilty to the charges was entered in favour of LA, by direction, after the victim failed to attend and could not be found. The victim was later the subject of the Coronial proceedings.

89In his submissions on appeal, LA explained that he wanted to further examine witnesses and persons of interest in the Coronial proceedings in which he had been involved. He explained that he sought to call these people in order, through cross-examination, to bring 'closure' in relation to the victim's murder 'and others'. 

90So understood it is apparent that there was no error in the Deputy President's refusal of the application to issue these summonses. The proceedings before the Tribunal were not concerned with either a rehearing of evidence given by witnesses in other proceedings, or a murder investigation, or an investigation into the conspiracy LA believes others have perpetrated against him. 

91An application under s 33I does not involve a rehearing of criminal or other proceedings, so that evidence which witness in such proceedings have given can either be reheard or retested. LA gave evidence and made submissions about the 1996 charges, the evidence led in those proceedings and his acquittal. He made submissions and tendered documents about the Coronial proceedings. What he was not entitled to do was to further challenge the evidence the witnesses had given in those proceedings, by calling them to give evidence before the Tribunal, or to conduct the investigations he explained both before the Tribunal and on appeal, he considers requires a Royal Commission.

92There was no error of law or denial of procedural fairness in the Tribunal's refusal to direct the issue of summonses to police officers and other witnesses involved in these various proceedings. The approach adopted accorded with the obligations imposed on the Tribunal by s 73 of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act. The Deputy President explained her approach to these matters, which seems to have been a fair one in the circumstances. In the result LA has not established that the refusal of his application resulted in any practical injustice.

Should evidence have been received from Professor Greenberg?

93It was LA who sought to have Professor Greenberg summonsed. He had given evidence in the 2003 proceedings, having then undertaken a psychiatric risk assessment of LA, albeit without having then examined him. That was not opposed and so he was called before the Tribunal and gave evidence about LA's further application. 

94In those circumstances it is difficult to see the basis of LA's complaint as to any procedural unfairness in Professor Greenberg being called. The conclusions which the Deputy President reached about his evidence, do not arise for consideration on this appeal.

95In oral submissions LA explained that his concerns related to the 2003 proceedings, where Professor Greenberg's report had not been served on him within the required timeframe. The difficulty with this complaint was that the Professor's 2003 report was dealt with in the 2003 proceedings, where LA's application was refused. That decision was appealed and LA there advanced his concerns about Professor Greenberg's report, but the appeal also failed. In those circumstances, no complaint is available to be advanced in these proceedings, in relation to how Professor Greenberg's 2003 report was served and dealt with in the 2003 proceedings. 

96LA could not identify any other concern about Professor Greenberg's evidence. It was clearly relevant to his further application. He had sought to have Professor Greenberg called, in order to establish the problems he considered existed in relation to his report. LA plainly did not succeed in that endeavour. Even so, in the circumstances, there was no error of law or procedural unfairness in the receipt of Professor Greenberg's evidence.

Costs

97In the result, LA's appeal must be dismissed. The usual order is that costs follow the event, with the result in this case, an order that LA bear the Commissioner's costs, as agreed or assessed. Unless the parties approach to be heard within 14 days of this judgment, that will be the Court's order.

Orders

98 For these reasons, I order that:

1. The appeal be dismissed.

2. Exhibits may be returned forthwith; any exhibits returned must be retained intact by the party or person that produced the material until the expiry of the time to file an appeal, or until any appeal has been determined.

2760585,Christos PODARAS v R [2012] NSWCCA 256,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:  I agree with Hidden J.
2HIDDEN J:  At a trial in the District Court the appellant was found guilty of specially aggravated kidnapping and recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm.  He was later sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  He appeals against conviction only.  He requires leave to proceed with the appeal as it is well out of time.  However, adequate reasons for the delay have been furnished and, there being no opposition by the Crown, leave should be granted.
3Given the limited scope of the only ground of appeal, it is unnecessary to examine the evidence in any detail.  The charges arose out of the same incident.  The victim, Satyendra Midya, had been in a relationship with Roslyne Singh, but the relationship had soured and come to an end.  It was the Crown case that on the day of the offences, 19 April 2008, Ms Singh procured the appellant and another man, David Hoey, to assault the victim.  In the evening the three travelled to the victim's home in Ms Singh's car.  There he was assaulted and dragged to the car.  The car was driven off and he was further assaulted during the journey.  The car stopped near the home of Ms Singh's mother, and the victim managed to escape and seek assistance.
4The victim did not know the appellant or Mr Hoey.  Ms Singh and Mr Hoey pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping and were dealt with by another judge.  Ms Singh gave evidence against the appellant at his trial.  Her evidence, of course, was vital but there was other evidence of a circumstantial nature tending to link the appellant to the incident.  Among this was evidence that he was in the company of Ms Singh and Mr Hoey at a hotel earlier in the evening when the offences were committed.  It was this evidence which was the focus of the appeal.  The appellant did not give evidence, but through cross-examination he put in issue whether he was involved in the offences at all and, in particular, whether he was at the hotel on that occasion.
5Ms Singh gave evidence that the three of them were together at the hotel.  In addition, CCTV footage from the hotel was admitted into evidence.  It was the Crown case that the three of them could be seen in the footage.  Ms Singh identified herself and Mr Hoey, but was not asked to identify the appellant.  There was another man in the footage, and the Crown invited the jury to accept that it was the appellant from their own observations of him, and also by comparing the appearance of the man with photos taken of the appellant at the time of his arrest and the clothing worn by the man with items of the appellant's clothing seized or photographed by police.  
6The footage was admitted over objection, but that decision is not challenged in the appeal.  Police had sought footage from the hotel in connection with an allegation that earlier in the evening the appellant had assaulted a man who had said something which could be taken as disparaging of Ms Singh.  However, no such assault was depicted in the footage admitted into evidence.  It depicted the man said to be the appellant walking to and from the bar area, and very shortly thereafter leaving the hotel.  Of course, the Crown did not lead evidence of the assault and the footage was tendered only as evidence that the appellant was present at the hotel.  
7However, in the evidence of Ms Singh's mother, Ms Ninjula Kumari, there was an oblique reference to the incident.  In answer to a question in cross-examination about what Ms Singh had later told her about the events of the relevant day, Ms Kumari responded (among other things) that she had told her that ""they got fight"" in the hotel.  More importantly, one of the investigating police, Senior Constable Bronwyn Clarke, was asked in examination-in-chief whether she had contacted staff at the hotel.  She said that she did.  She was asked for what purpose she did so, the Crown prosecutor then appearing no doubt expecting her to say no more than that it was to obtain CCTV footage.  Her answer, however, was that her purpose was to ""obtain CCTV footage of an assault that had happened earlier on ... .""  She did not say that the appellant was alleged to have been involved in that assault.
8This led to an application to discharge the jury, which the trial judge refused.  It is that decision which is challenged in this appeal, the only ground being that his Honour's decision not to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
9Trial counsel for the appellant, who did not appear in this court, had argued that the footage could convey that the appellant had been involved in some kind of incident not captured by the relevant camera, whereupon he had left the hotel.  It was argued that there was a danger that the jury might speculate that he had been involved in the assault referred to by the police officer and, given the nature of the charge he faced, this would be seriously prejudicial to him.  
10His Honour rejected the application for discharge after determining that the risk of prejudice would be removed by a carefully worded direction to the jury after an exchange, in their presence, with the Crown prosecutor.  After referring to the evidence of Ms Kumari and of Senior Constable Clarke, he asked the Crown prosecutor whether it was any part of her case that the accused was involved in any fight or assault at the hotel, including any verbal or physical altercation either as aggressor or as victim.  The Crown prosecutor responded that it was not.  His Honour went on to ask whether there was ""any evidence in the trial"" that the accused was involved in any way at all in any fight or assault at the hotel, and the Crown prosecutor responded that there was not.  His Honour then gave this direction to the jury:
""That's what I expected the answer would be and I was concerned because of those answers that we should clear that up, that was just one of the things that we wanted to settle, a number of things that we just sorted out.  It's important that I say that to you because having heard these answers from the Crown Prosecutor which I expected her to say I direct you as a matter of law that you must not speculate about this matter.  You must not use the evidence that was given yesterday by Ms Kumari or the police officer in any way that's adverse to Mr Podaras in the trial.  The footage was tendered, that is the DVD, as part of the prosecution case as to who was at the hotel and it is very important and it's a legal direction that you don't speculate about what was going on in the footage, nor do you use it in any way adverse [to] the accused.""
11Counsel for the appellant in this court, Mr Barrow, submitted that the evidence of Senior Constable Clarke, together with that of Ms Kumari, created a prejudice which could not have been cured by his Honour's questions of the Crown prosecutor and his direction to the jury or, indeed, by any direction.  Put shortly, he argued that the evidence that the footage was obtained because of an alleged assault, together with the fact that it was presented at the appellant's trial and focused upon his movements within the hotel and in leaving it, would inevitably have conveyed to the jury that it was he who was said to have been involved in that assault.  The exchange between the trial judge and the Crown prosecutor and the direction then given, he said, would not have been effective to remove that impression.
12A succinct summary of the principles governing an appeal on this ground is to be found in the judgment of this court in GAR v R (No. 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164, at [59]:
""The failure to discharge a jury is not a ground of appeal in itself. The appeal is against conviction: Maric v The Queen (1978) 52 ALJR 631 at 634. The question on appeal is whether there was such a high degree of necessity for the discharge of the jury that the failure to order such a discharge has resulted in a mistrial. Much leeway must be allowed for the trial Judge to evaluate considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the Judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the events complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading a transcript: Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440-441. Nevertheless, the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. This Court must decide for itself whether in the circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice: Crofts v The Queen at 441; Qoro v R [2008] NSWCCA 220 at [29].""
13At the hearing of the appeal the CCTV exhibit could not be found, but we received a copy of it.  I have viewed it.  Nothing that can be seen suggests that the man said to be the appellant was involved in an assault, let alone the assault of a man because of a perceived slight to Ms Singh.  It was put that the appellant appears to be striding when he is seen in the bar area, and that a woman said to be Ms Singh puts her hands to her face.  These features are not clear to me but, in any event, they would not have conveyed to the jury that there had been some incident involving Ms Singh.  As the Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out, it is important to avoid reading into what is depicted background circumstances of which the judge and the parties are aware, but of which the members of the jury know nothing.
14In my view, the way in which the trial judge dealt with the problem was appropriate.  I am not persuaded that in refusing to discharge the jury his Honour's discretion miscarried, nor does it appear to me that that decision occasioned a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  I would dismiss the appeal.
15BEECH-JONES J:  I have had the benefit of reading a draft of the judgment of Hidden J and viewing the CCTV footage referred to in [13] a number of times.  I agree with his Honour's reasons and the proposed orders.

		30 November 2012",2012-11-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760588,May v R [2012] NSWCCA 250,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The appellant was convicted after trial of one count of possessing an unauthorised firearm contrary to s 7(1)of the Firearms Act 1996 (""the Act""). The trial proceeded without a jury. There is no application for leave to appeal the sentence.
2There are two grounds of appeal against the conviction:
Ground 1: the trial judge failed to give reasons that complied with s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
Ground 2: the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
Facts
3In December 2009 the appellant was the lessee of a three bedroom house where she lived with three of her children aged 9, 16 and 18 respectively. Another son had been in custody since 2006.
4The appellant's home was a two storey townhouse. Entry to the living area was from the street. The appellant's bedroom was located upstairs at the front of the house.
5On 20 December 2009 police attended the appellant's home in relation to a stabbing incident. After the appellant (who was charged in relation to that matter) had been removed from the premises, the police established a crime scene and the property was searched. During the search the police located a blue box containing a 12 gauge Mossberg pump action repeating shotgun in the appellant's bedroom and under her bed.
6Neither the appellant's fingerprints nor DNA were located on the gun or the box.
7The appellant participated in a very brief record of interview and the following exchange occurred:
""Q: OK I am going to ask you a number of questions about a firearms offence. My questions and any answer you give ..A. Firearms.
Q: ... will be recorded on this machine as they're asked and ...A: Oh well, I've got nothing to say about that, cause I ain't got no firearms.
Q: No dramas. Your rights were explained to you by the custody manager again.A: Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep.
Q: YepA: Yep. Yep.
Q: And you were given a copy of those rights?A: Yeah. I think they're in there or in the other, yeah, yeah.
Q: Do you want to exercise any of your rights right now?A: Yeah I want to ring me son to get a lawyer, to get a lawyer here.
Q: You want a lawyer here?A: Yep.""
8Other evidence was tendered at the trial that established that the appellant had lived at her property for many years. 
9The weapon was a prohibited firearm and the appellant was not authorised to possess or use it. 
10There was evidence that the appellant's son was a dangerous criminal who used guns and associated with other dangerous criminals who used guns, including a man named Mirko Coffen who was seen outside the appellant's premises on the day of the offence.
11The appellant did not give evidence at her trial.
12There was also evidence given by the appellant's daughter that although her mother's belongings were in the main bedroom, her mother usually slept on the sofa in the sitting room and one of the children slept in the main bedroom. There was also evidence that the appellant had been away from home for four days between 3 December 2009 and 7 December 2009 when she was hospitalised with a broken arm. The daughter gave evidence that various people had keys to the house and sometimes her brother's friends would come to the house. The witness said that she did not see any associates of her brother's go into her mother's bedroom. She never saw the gun case and had never looked under the bed.
The reasons of the trial judge
13The trial judge recited the evidence led in the Crown case and referred to the appellant's hospitalisation and her absence from the premises. His Honour observed that there was a lack of dust on the gun case, which supported an inference that the gun had not been under the appellant's bed for very long.
14His Honour referred to the evidence of the daughter that various people came to the house sometimes and that she vacuumed the appellant's bedroom but had never seen the gun. His Honour found that due to the age of the appellant's children who lived at the premises it was extremely improbable that they were in possession of the gun. His Honour also noticed that the appellant's eldest son was in gaol at the time but also that the known criminal Coffen was seen by the police near the house on the day the appellant was arrested.
15The trial judge referred to the lack of the appellant's, or any known person's, fingerprints or DNA on the gun case. His Honour also referred to the appellant's denial of any knowledge of the firearm when she was interviewed by the police and noted that the investigating policeman gave evidence that he could not remember where he obtained information about the presence of the gun. His Honour said:
""It is clear the information did not come from the accused. She did not say to him, there is a firearm under the bed. Regardless of what the source was, a firearm was found. Subsequent to its finding she was confronted about its presence, and I have seen a short video extract of an interview in which she indignantly denies and appears to be quite surprised that there was a firearm, indignantly denies that she had anything to do with a firearm, and demanded that they call a lawyer.""
16The trial judge found that the appellant was the tenant of the premises and was, in the relevant sense, the occupier. His Honour noted that the only evidence led in the defence case was that of the daughter and documentary evidence relating to the appellant's hospitalisation. 
17It is apparent from his Honour's reasons that he directed himself in accordance with s 89 of the Evidence Act 1995. His Honour also referred to the elements of the offence as provided by s 7 of the Act and the definition of possession set out in sections 4 and 4A of the Act. His Honour referred to the burden of proof carried by the appellant under s 4A and the standard of proof required to discharge that burden.
18Section 7 provides as follows:
""(1) A person must not possess or use a prohibited firearm or pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit. 
Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years.
(2) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a person who is the holder of a licence is guilty of an offence under this section if the person: 
(a) uses a prohibited firearm or pistol for any purpose otherwise than in connection with the purpose established by the person as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the prohibited firearm or pistol, or(b) contravenes any condition of the licence.
(3) If, on the trial for an offence under this section, the jury is not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence but is satisfied on the evidence that the person is guilty of an offence under section 7A, it may find the person not guilty of the offence but guilty of an offence under section 7A, and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly.""
19Sections 4 the Act relevantly provides:
""(1) In this Act: 
...
possession of a firearm includes any case in which a person knowingly: (a) has custody of the firearm, or(b) has the firearm in the custody of another person, or(c) has the firearm in or on any premises, place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, whether or not belonging to or occupied by the person.
Note. See also section 4A.""
20Section 4 A further provides that:
""(1) Without restricting the meaning of the word possession, for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, a firearm is taken to be in the possession of a person so long as it is in or on any premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of, the person, unless the court is satisfied that: 
(a) the firearm was placed in or on, or brought into or on to, the premises by or on behalf of a person who was lawfully authorised by or under this Act to possess the firearm, or(b) the person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises, or(c) on the evidence before it, the person was not in possession of the firearm.
(2) In this section, premises means any place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft.""
21His Honour ultimately resolved the matter after considering the burden of proof carried by the appellant. His Honour said:
""Nobody has given any evidence to show that and I cannot be satisfied that she did not know and could not be reasonably expected to have known the firearm was in or on the premises.
The fact that she was not there for four days is not to the point. It is improbable in the extreme in my opinion even though she gave keys to her children, and perhaps to the man who was her companion, that someone could bring a firearm into the premises without her knowing. If it be said she might have known there was a blue case, but she did not know anything about a firearm being in it, that might be, but there is no evidence that she knew there was a blue case, nor is there any evidence that she turned her mind to anything about the contents of anything. The evidence establishes that the firearm was in her premises, the premises were leased and occupied by her and under her control and I am not satisfied that she did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises and therefore I find her guilty.""
Ground 1
22Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for a trial by judge alone. Subsection 2 provides that the judge must include in his or her judgment the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact on which the judge relied.
23The requirements of a trial judge sitting alone as to the giving of reasons were recently considered by the High Court in AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438. A trial judge is required to summarise the crucial arguments of the parties, formulate the issues for decision and resolve any issues of law and fact that need to be determined [85].
24In Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 Kirby P discussed the obligations of a trial judge in the following terms at 259:
""This decision does not require of trial judges a tedious examination of detailed evidence or a minute explanation of every step in the reasoning process that leads to the judge's conclusion. But the judicial obligation to give reasons, and not to frustrate the legislative facility of appeal on questions of law, at least obliges a judge to state generally and briefly the grounds which have led him or her to the conclusions reached concerning disputed factual questions and to list the findings on the principal contested issues.""
See also Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 385-386.
25Section 4A of the Act places an onus on an accused person to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities of the matters enumerated in s 4A(1): R v Gardiner [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 at [109]. Otherwise the firearm ""is taken to be in the possession of a person in occupation of the relevant premises.""
26In Gardiner at [106] I said of these provisions:
""Section 4A(1)(b) of the Firearms Act is clearly aimed at the situation where the Crown could not prove knowledge to the requisite standard but the accused cannot adequately explain his alleged lack of knowledge of the presence of the weapons.""
27It was submitted by the appellant that notwithstanding the fact that she did not give evidence, the lack of knowledge on her part was explained in the evidence admitted at the trial but the trial judge failed to address the evidence of that explanation in his reasons. It was submitted that the trial judge should have directed his mind to whether there was evidence to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities that the appellant did not know, nor could reasonably be expected to know, of the presence of the weapon. It was submitted that ""there was no consideration of the question of the defence of the appellant not being in possession [sic].""
28It was further submitted that the evidence that the appellant sought to rely on was both direct and circumstantial. Direct evidence was said to be found in the denials of knowledge made to the investigating police officer when he interviewed the appellant. The circumstantial evidence was said to be the absence of the appellant from the premises for a period of time, the fact that she did not sleep in the bedroom and the presence of a known criminal outside the premises on the relevant day.
29I reject these submissions. Consideration of his Honour's reasons reveals that each of these matters was identified by his Honour and considered. His Honour concluded that the evidence did not show, and his Honour could not be satisfied, that the appellant did not know or could not be reasonably expected to have known the firearm was on the premises. Although his Honour appreciated that the appellant had denied knowledge of the firearm in her interview with the police (evidence which his Honour did not accept to the relevant standard) his Honour emphasised that there was no evidence in relation to the question of whether the appellant could be reasonably expected to have known of the presence of the weapon. His Honour had identified all of the significant evidence and the issues that were raised in the proceedings and expressed a conclusion in relation to them. To my mind there is nothing more that could have been asked of his reasons.
30Ground 1 must fail.
Ground 2
31It will be apparent from my earlier remarks that I am not persuaded that the verdict was unreasonable. Indeed, to the contrary. If it had been necessary I would have concluded that the proviso should be applied, there being no miscarriage of justice. 
32The legislature has framed an offence in respect of which a person in occupation of premises where an unauthorised firearm is located will be criminally liable unless they can, on the balance of probabilities, discharge the burden provided in s 4A(1) of the Act. That subsection requires the occupier to establish on the balance of probabilities that they did not know or could not be reasonably expected to know of the presence of the weapon. This requires more than evidence from which a possible inference could be drawn. The accused must satisfy the trial court that he or she either did not know or could not be reasonably expected to know of the presence of the weapon.
33I have reviewed the entirety of the evidence in the present case. If I had myself been required to determine the matter I would have reached the same conclusion as the trial judge. The verdict was not unreasonable and no miscarriage of justice has occurred.
34In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.
35JOHNSON J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
36BELLEW J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		29 January 2013",2012-11-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760589,EJDG v R [2012] NSWCCA 251,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The applicant was tried for three offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the NSW Crimes Act 1900. Count 1 alleged that he assaulted RC between 1 May 2003 and 1 September 2003 and that at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on RC in circumstances of aggravation, namely that RC was under his authority. Count 2 was pleaded in similar terms and was alleged to have been committed between 1 July 2003 and 4 April 2004. Count 3, in respect of which the applicant was acquitted, was alleged to have been committed some five years after the time in which count 2 was alleged to have occurred.
2RC was the applicant's step-daughter. At the relevant time she was ten years of age. 
3The maximum penalty for each of counts 1 and 2 is seven years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of five years in respect of the offence.
4The applicant was sentenced as follows:
Count 1: a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment dating from 3 May 2011 with an additional term of 2 years dating from 3 May 2014. 
Count 2: a non-parole period of 2 years six months dating from 3 August 2011 with an additional period of 18 months dating from 3 February 2014. Accordingly the total sentence was comprised of a non-parole period of 3 years with a further term of 2 years.
5Accordingly, the sentence for count 2 was made wholly concurrent with the sentence for count 1.
6The sentencing judge made factual findings.
7The victim's mother, who had formed a relationship with the offender some years previously, moved into his house on a permanent basis as his de facto partner around the middle of 2003 together with her two young children, the victim, then aged about ten, and her younger brother, then aged about nine. The victim was in Year 5 at primary school.
8Initially the victim slept in the front bedroom, which she shared with her brother, in a bunk bed. She slept on the top bunk. One evening, not too long after they had moved in, the victim had gone to bed and was asleep. She was wearing a nightie and underpants.
9Later that night she woke up to find the offender touching her inner thigh with his hand which he then moved up and stroked her vagina. He next put his hand inside of her underwear and felt around, touching her on the outside of the vagina.
10She stated that she felt him touching her thigh for at least a couple of minutes, but the touching of her vagina, skin on skin, could have lasted only a matter of seconds although it felt to her like a really long time. The victim deliberately made a noise pretending to wake up and the offender then left the room.
11The victim said she felt shaky, sick, disgusted and shocked. She had never been touched on that part of her body before.
12Those are the facts as they relate to the first count on which the offender was found guilty.
13The second event occurred a few months after when one night the victim left her bed after she had had a nightmare and was scared. She went to her mothers' bed, which she was sharing with the offender, and got in.
14The victim lay on her left side between her mother and the offender facing her mother's back. She was wearing a nightie and underpants. Her mother went to sleep but the victim could not get to sleep straight away due to the nightmare.
15The offender who was lying behind her, rolled over and put his arm around her placing his hand inside her underwear and held it against her vagina, cupping it, skin on skin. After some ten minutes the victim was able to shift her body down so that the offender's hand was on her stomach. Eventually she fell asleep.
16When the victim got out of the bed the next morning she told her mother about the incident.
17The applicant relies on 2 grounds of appeal:
Ground 1: that the sentencing judge erred by misdirecting himself as to the correct maximum penalty for the offences and so fell into error in arriving at an appropriate sentence for the offences;
Ground 2: that his Honour erred in his application of s 54A - 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in the manner in which he had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offences.
18The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. However, the sentencing judge had the benefit of a pre-sentence report and a psychological pre-sentence assessment conducted by Forensic Psychology Services within the Corrective Services Department. The applicant also tendered the report of a clinical psychologist.
19His Honour found that each of the offences was objectively serious and concluded that general deterrence was of major significance. His Honour identified the fact that the offences carried a standard non-parole period and said that ""it is intended for middle range offences where the offender is convicted after trial. Even if not applicable that period acts as a guide post."" His Honour referred to the decision of this Court in R v Ivimy [2008] NSWCCA 25 where an offender who touched the outside of the victim's vagina when she was using the shower was described as committing an offence ""close to the worst class of case"" for this offence.
20His Honour determined that both offences fell within the middle range of objective seriousness having regard to the nature and degree of physical contact involved. His Honour then said that ""the standard non-parole period is to be set unless the court determines that there are reasons for not doing so: s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999"". This was, of course, a reflection of the approach required of the sentencing judge when sentencing in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 168; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 rather than the approach later determined to be appropriate by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
21However, his Honour determined that because the applicant was well below average intelligence, will spend a significant portion of his sentence in protective custody and has been in regular employment since leaving school with good prospects of rehabilitation ""the standard non-parole period was not appropriate.""
22His Honour observed that because the offences were two separate and distinct acts, the criminality of one was not comprised in the criminality of the other and, accordingly, wholly concurrent sentences would not be appropriate. However, this finding was not reflected in the ultimate sentences, the sentence for count 2 being wholly concurrent with the sentence for count 1.
23The respondent conceded that his Honour was mistaken when identifying the maximum penalty for each offences as ten years imprisonment. It would seem that his Honour was led into this mistake by the submissions of the Crown prosecutor. The maximum penalty is in fact seven years imprisonment. 
24Notwithstanding that his Honour stated the incorrect maximum penalty it does not follow that the sentence should automatically be reduced. An error by a sentencing juge in relation to the maximum penalty for an offence will not necessarily require this Court to uphold an appeal and resentence: Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 138 at [34] per James J (Campbell JA and Smart AJ agreeing); Newton v R [2009] NSWCCA 128 at [21] per RA Hulme J (Grove and Howie JJ agreeing); Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140 (2010) 201 A Crim R 243 at 255-256 [70] per RA Hulme J (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing); see also R v Zakaria [2002] NSWCCA 450 at [15] per Bell J (Wood CJ at CL and Dowd J agreeing); Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16; (2006) 159 A Crim R 549 at 554 [20] per Latham J (McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreeing).
25Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act still requires this Court to be satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.
26Before this Court the Crown acknowledged that his Honour had referred to the wrong maximum penalty and had erred by following the sentencing approach provided by the decision in Way. The Crown also accepted that it was not necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive in order for the error to have materially affected the sentence. However, it was submitted that notwithstanding the errors made by the sentencing judge, having regard to relevant matters no lesser sentence was warranted.
27I am in no doubt that the sentencing judge was correct when he described the first count as a serious offence. The applicant, in a deliberate and premeditated way, entered the complainant's bedroom and assaulted her while she was asleep. This Court has previously said that an act of this character may come within the worst class of case of an offence of aggravated indecent assault: see Ivimy at [42]. 
28To my mind this offence warranted characterisation as being at the upper end of the range of objective seriousness. I am also satisfied that the sentencing judge was correct to determine that the second count was also a serious offence notwithstanding its opportunistic character. The fact that the applicant committed the offence on 2 separate occasions required a sentence which adequately reflected his overall criminality.
29There are a number of favourable features in the applicant's subjective circumstances. He had no relevant previous convictions and, although of below average intelligence, he has maintained regular employment since leaving school. The sentencing judge found that notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has not demonstrated remorse or contrition he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend. His Honour found that the applicant had made significant contributions to the welfare of the Aboriginal community. His Honour recognised that the applicant had received support from members of the community who provided testimonials to the court.
30Notwithstanding these favourable subjective matters to my mind having regard to the serious nature of the offences a total sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years was appropriate in all the circumstances. The offences were two separate acts of serious criminality, one a deliberate and calculated act and the other more opportunistic. Notwithstanding that the sentencing judge appears to have made a slip when imposing the sentences, his Honour was correct to identify that the separate nature of the offences warranted a period of accumulation. Having regard to the sentences which his Honour thought appropriate for each offence this could only have been achieved by commencing the sentence for the second count before the sentence for the first count commenced.
31Although this error would have justified this Court in resentencing it would be of no practical utility to do so. In my judgment the sentence for the individual offences was appropriate. However, more importantly, I am satisfied that no other overall sentence was in all the circumstances required.
32I have not overlooked the fact that his Honour misstated the maximum penalty for the offences. However, I am not persuaded that this error has materially affected the sentences which his Honour imposed. Although the correct maximum sentence was a term of imprisonment of 7 years, the standard non-parole period provided by the legislature is 5 years. As I have indicated given the serious nature of these offences the guidance provided by both the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period confirm my opinion that the individual sentences and the overall sentence is appropriate.
33Although I would grant leave to appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.
34LATHAM J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
35FULLERTON J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

2760591,Baghdadi v R [2012] NSWCCA 212,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Davies J.

2JOHNSON J: I agree with Davies J.

3DAVIES J: On 15 February 2010 the Applicant pleaded guilty to five offences as follows:
Count 1: Aggravated assault with intent to take or drive a motor vehicle on 18 August 2006 contrary to s 154C(2) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

Count 2: Fire a firearm in a public place on 18 August 2006 contrary to s 93G(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

Count 3: Aggravated assault with intent to take or drive a motor vehicle on 22 August 2006.

Count 4: Fire a firearm in a public place on 22 August 2006.

Count 5: Aggravated assault with intent to take or drive a motor vehicle on 23 August 2006. 

4On 29 June 2010 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Finnane as follows:

Count 1: A non-parole period of five years to commence on 8 March 2014 and expiring on 7 March 2019 with a balance of term of three years to expire on 7 March 2022.

Count 2: Fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence 8 March 2014 and expire 7 March 2016. 

Count 3: Non-parole period of five years to commence 8 March 2016 and expire 7 March 2021 with a balance of term of three years to expire on 7 March 2024.
Count 4: Fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence 8 March 2016 and expire 7 March 2018. 

Count 5: Non-parole period of five years to commence 8 March 2018 and expire 7 March 2023 with a balance of term of three years to expire on 7 March 2026.

5There was therefore a total period of imprisonment of 12 years consisting of a non-parole period of nine years commencing 8 March 2014.

6The reason for the commencement of the first of the sentences on 8 March 2014 was that the applicant was then serving sentences imposed by Judge Ellis in the District Court and, later, by Judge Armitage. The history in relation to the prior offences is of relevance to the determination of the present appeal.

7On 18 December 2007 the Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Ellis at the Parramatta District Court following pleas of guilty to two counts of armed robbery, aggravated carjacking (armed with an offensive weapon), aggravated armed robbery and specially aggravated break, enter and steal. The Crown appealed against the sentences imposed. On 14 October 2008 this Court upheld the appeal and imposed an aggregate sentence of 13 years with an effective non-parole period of nine years. The eligible parole date was 8 March 2015: R v Baghdadi [2008] NSWCCA 239.

8On 21 August 2009 Judge Armitage sentenced the Applicant after trial for one count of assault with intent to rob while armed with a dangerous weapon, and robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. In respect of the first count he was sentenced to a fixed term of 4 years to commence on 9 March 2011. In respect of the second count he was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years to commence on 9 March 2012 and expire 8 March 2017 with a balance of term to expire on 8 March 2020.

9The Applicant was also sentenced in respect of a third charge of armed robbery on a separate indictment to which he had pleaded guilty. He was sentenced in relation to that count to a non-parole period of five years to commence on 9 March 2013 and expire 8 March 2018 with a balance of term of four years to expire on 8 March 2022.

10The Applicant appealed against the convictions after trial for which he was sentenced by Judge Armitage. On 26 October 2011 this Court ordered that the appeal be allowed, that the convictions be set aside and that the matter be remitted to the District Court for a new trial: Baghdadi v R [2011] NSWCCA 234. 

11Thereafter, on 3 May 2012, this Court delivered judgment on an application by the Applicant under r 50C Criminal Appeal Rules in respect of the judgment delivered on 26 October 2011. The Court set aside some of the orders it had earlier made and in lieu thereof entered a verdict of acquittal on each of the charges: Baghdadi v R (No. 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77. 

12The effect of that judgment was that the only remaining sentence of Judge Armitage was in relation to the armed robbery count to which the Applicant had pleaded guilty. For that offence he had been sentenced to a non-parole period of five years commencing on 9 March 2013 with a balance of term of three years expiring in 8 Mar 2021. The relevance of this is that the non-parole period was commenced on that date because Judge Armitage had commenced the non-parole periods for the two other offences, on which the Applicant was ultimately acquitted, on two earlier dates.

13The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Finnane was filed on 27 April 2012. There were six grounds of appeal five of which complained of the approach of the Sentencing Judge to the standard non-parole period and to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, of his failure to deal with special circumstances, and of his approach to subjective features and prospects for rehabilitation. There was an additional ground complaining that the sentences both individually and in their total effect were manifestly excessive. 

14In the week before the present appeal came to be heard the Applicant filed further submissions abandoning all of the these grounds of appeal and seeking leave to replace them with one ground of appeal as follows:

The Sentencing Judge erred in failing properly to take into account the impact of cumulation of sentence on the relationship between the overall non-parole period and the overall term. 

15In short, the Applicant submitted that there should be a parole period of six years whereas the Crown submitted it should be three years. 

The facts of the offences

16The first count relates to an offence on 18 August 2006. The victim was driving his Subaru WRX into Bankstown to do some banking. As he drove into South Terrace he was followed very closely by another vehicle in which the Applicant was seated with two other people. The Applicant's vehicle cut him off. 

17The Applicant alighted from the rear driver's side of that vehicle, produced a black coloured hand gun, ordered the victim to get out of the car and invited him to consider whether he wanted to die. He then fired the gun that he was holding into the ground. That was the second count on the indictment. 

18The Applicant then went to the driver's side of the vehicle, pointed the gun at the victim's head and demanded to know the PIN to operate the car. The victim gave a random number. The victim got out of the vehicle and the Applicant drove away. Because the wrong PIN was entered the vehicle stopped a short distance later and the Applicant disappeared. 

19The third count occurred on 22 August 2006. Two men, who had finished work at a cinema complex at Auburn, walked to their car which parked in an underground car park in the complex. It was also a high performance car. One of them started the car. At that point the Applicant appeared with a handgun which he pointed at the driver and then fired a number of shots at the bonnet of the vehicle. That action constituted the fourth count. The driver managed to drive away in the vehicle and call the police. 

20The fifth count occurred at a carwash on 23 August 2006. A Ford Ghia was being cleaned by an employee of the carwash. The Applicant and another man walked up to an employee who was cleaning and drying the car. The Applicant ordered him to get out of it otherwise he would blow his head off. The other man with the applicant was holding a gun. The other man also threatened the owner of the carwash with this gun. The Applicant and the other man then got into the car and drove it away.

Remarks on Sentence

21His Honour first characterised the sentences as mid-range offences but at a later point in his Remarks described them as worse than mid-range offences.

22His Honour made reference to the Applicant's subjective circumstances including the fact that he had been in trouble with the law since 2001. At some point he became involved with drugs as a teenager. That led to his involvement in robberies and other serious offences.

23His Honour made reference to evidence from the Applicant's brother who his Honour thought was genuine and would do his best to assist the Applicant. He made reference to two reports from psychologists which demonstrated some motivation for changing his behaviour and also some remorse. In relation to rehabilitation his Honour said:

There has to be some hope for rehabilitation as there is for anybody, I cannot say that I could quantify that.

24He also said that because the Applicant was a relatively young there was a need to ensure that he did not serve too long a sentence. Accordingly, his Honour decided to impose a non-parole period of 5 years for each of the aggravated assaults. In doing so he said that he would have imposed a significantly longer non-parole period had the Applicant been convicted after a trial. As the firearm offences were committed whilst the other offences were being committed his Honour made those entirely concurrent with the more serious offences in each case.

25His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences I have set out earlier.

The Applicant's submissions

26The Applicant submitted that the overall sentence imposed by Judge Finnane was a non-parole period of nine years with an additional term of three years. The ratio between those is 75%. However, in relation to the individual offences his Honour had achieved a ratio of 62.5%. The Sentencing Judge did not advert to the impact of accumulation of the sentences on the ratio he had thought appropriate to the individual sentences and the Applicant submitted that this supported an inference of error. 

27The Applicant further submitted that the pre-existing overall sentence at the time the Sentencing Judge sentenced the Applicant was 12 years non-parole with an additional term of four years. The ratio in relation to that pre-existing overall sentence was therefore 75%. 

28The Applicant further submitted that as a result of the successful appeal by the Applicant against the convictions in the trial heard before Judge Armitage the commencement date of the third sentence imposed by Judge Armitage would have to be adjusted from 9 March 2013 to 9 March 2011. Due to the need to adjust the commencement date of the sentence imposed by Judge Armitage it was necessary for the Applicant to file a further Application for Leave to Appeal in relation to that sentence. Such leave was granted at the hearing.

29The Applicant submitted that if and when the commencement date was adjusted it would mean that the pre-existing sentence would then be 10 years non-parole with an additional term of four years producing a ratio of 71%. The Applicant submitted that if the current overall sentences were then adjusted the overall sentence would then be 15 years non-parole with an additional term of three years producing a ratio of 83%. 

30The Applicant pointed to what was said by the Crown Prosecutor at the sentencing hearing before Judge Finnane that the period on parole should be increased from the four years established by the existing sentences. In fact, it appears that by reason of his existing sentences at that time the period on parole was fixed at 5 years. Nothing in particular turns on that error apart from the support it provides to the Applicant for a longer parole period for the present sentences.

31There is no challenge to the overall head sentence imposed by Judge Finnane. 

Is error shown?

32This Court has said on a number of occasions that where the effect of accumulating the sentences results in an increase in the statutory ratio a failure of the Sentencing Judge to advert to the matter in his Remarks on Sentence will lead to an inference that the matter has been overlooked: Wakefield v R [2010] NSWCCA 12 at [26]; Arnold v R [2011] NSWCCA 150 at [32]-[33] and Connelly v R [2012] NSWCCA 144 at [32].

33Further, Judge Finnane had made reference to the fact of the Applicant's rehabilitation, to what he had told the psychologist about being prepared to engage in illicit drug intervention and to the assistance that his Honour thought that his brother would be able to provide. It seems likely from those matters and the variation to the statutory ratio his Honour imposed in respect of the individual offences that his Honour overlooked the arithmetical effect of accumulation. In doing so, there has been an error in the way the sentences have been accumulated. 

Is any lesser sentence warranted?

34The abandonment of all but one of the grounds of appeal means that there are now only two matters for consideration by this Court. First, whether an order should be made to bring forward the one remaining sentence imposed by Judge Armitage by reason of the acquittal of the Applicant on the other two counts of which he had been found guilty at trial. Flowing from that determination is whether the sentences imposed by Judge Finnane should similarly be brought forward. Secondly, whether there should be a reduction in the overall non-parole period imposed by Judge Finnane.

35Judge Armitage must have had regard to the totality principle when sentencing the applicant for all three offences. The Applicant was, at the time those sentences were directed, already serving sentences imposed by this Court on 14 October 2008. Judge Armitage structured his sentences so that the first of them, a fixed term, commenced one year after the last sentence imposed by this Court. The second commenced a year later and the third a year after the second commenced. 

36It seems plain, therefore, that if he had been sentencing only for the third offence that sentence would have commenced one year after the last offence in respect of which this Court had earlier sentenced.

37Similarly, Judge Finnane commenced his sentence for Counts 1 and 2 one year after the commencement of Judge Armitage's third sentence.

38Where there has been a subsequent acquittal on two charges, and the sentences in respect of those charges occupied a middle period in a long succession of sentences, it will ordinarily be appropriate as a proper application of the totality principle to advance the commencement date for the following sentences for a period equal to the effective period of imprisonment represented by those offences. That effective period here was two years.

39Accordingly, the sentence for the third count before Judge Armitage will be varied to commence 9 March 2011 and expire 8 March 2016 with a balance of term of four years to expire 8 March 2020.

40Similarly, each of the sentences imposed by Judge Finnane will be varied to commence two years earlier.

41The effect of that variation is that the Applicant's overall non-parole period will now expire 8 March 2021 with a balance of term to expire 8 March 2024.

42It is in those circumstances that consideration must be given to the issue of the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence.

43In R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [15] - [18] the Court identified two matters that are considered under the totality principle. First, severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of the sentence. Secondly, the principle is designed to avoid a crushing sentence. However, the Court warned also against giving the impression that ""there is some kind of discount for multiple offending"" (at [18]).

44The Applicant is a relatively young man being now aged 26 years. As noted earlier he has a wife and a young child. There are, and were before Judge Finnane, two reports from psychologists which, as his Honour noted, demonstrated some motivation for changing the Applicant's behaviour. Both of those psychologists encouraged a maximising of opportunity for the Applicant to be supervised in the community to ensure his rehabilitation. 

45Under the existing sentencing regime the Applicant will be under supervision for three years. Ordinarily, there is a practical limit of three years' parole supervision which the Applicant may receive: Clause 228 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008; Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217 at [107]. However, the position is otherwise if the Applicant is a serious offender. Section 3(1) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 defines ""serious offender"" relevantly as:

(c) an offender who is serving a sentence (or one of a series of sentences of imprisonment) where the term of the sentence (or the combined terms of all of the sentences in the series) is such that the offender will not become eligible for release from custody, including release on parole, until he or she has spent at least 12 years in custody,

46The Applicant entered custody on 9 March 2006. Even with the bringing forward by two years of the sentences imposed by Judge Finnane he will not be released until 8 March 2021. Indeed, he becomes a serious offender if not released by 8 March 2018. Clause 228(2) provides: 

In the case of a serious offender, the Parole Authority may while the parole order is in force extend the period of supervision by, or impose a further period of supervision of, up to 3 years at a time.

47Accordingly, a shortening of the non-parole period would not be futile in terms of supervision to assist the Applicant's rehabilitation.

48The offences were very serious ones involving firearms which were fired at two of the incidents. The offences involved threats of violence which, given the firearms, are likely to have caused considerable fear in the victims. They were committed in company. They were part of a series of criminal acts committed over a two year period. Some offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Ellis and Judge Armitage involved carjacking using a similar modus operandi. Firearms were often involved.

49A reduction of the non-parole period by three years, which the Applicant seeks, would mean that Counts 3,4 and 5 would be served concurrently. There can be no justification for such a course. Count 5 was a separate offence. Its only ameliorating feature was that on that occasion the gun held by the co-offender was not fired. Such a reduction of the non-parole period would give a clear impression of discounting for multiple offending.

50In my opinion, it would be appropriate to reduce the non-parole period by one year in order to have regard to the first of the matters referred to in R v MAK concerning the increase in severity of the length of the sentence. That will result in an overall non-parole period of 8 years with the head sentence remaining at 12 years. When all sentences are considered together the Applicant will serve a non-parole period of 14 years with a head sentence of 18 years.

51This variation will enable an extra year's supervision to aid the Applicant's rehabilitation. Rehabilitation and adjustment may take time. The Applicant will be aged 33 at the expiry of his non-parole period having spent 14 years in custody. He is likely to be institutionalised. 

52Matters of both general and personal deterrence are adequately accommodated in such a varied sentence. That is reinforced when the totality of the sentences imposed on the three separate occasions are regarded.

2760592,"R v MEYN, John Michael (No 5) [2012] NSWSC 1590","Judgment

1On the fourth day of this trial, 3 December 2012, objection was taken by Senior Counsel for the accused, Mr Chapple SC, to the Crown leading certain evidence from Ms Angela Walkerden which I will describe. After argument, I indicated that I rejected the evidence and stated I would provide my reasons later. These are my reasons for that ruling.

2In brief summary, the Crown case is that on the morning of 8 April 2011 the accused hit and strangled his ex-partner. This is said to have occurred after she attended at a ""granny flat"" at the back of his parents' home in which the accused resided. She attended with their infant son. The Crown alleges that while their son was asleep they had sex and that the accused then killed her. The Crown alleges that the accused was possessive of the deceased and jealous of any suggestion that she could see anyone else. In opening the Crown Prosecutor stated:
""The Crown case will be that the accused was driven by his jealousy over the fact that the deceased was using this internet dating site. He asked her questions about it, that she got angry, he got angry, and that as a result of that scenario, he then hit her a number of times to the head and strangled her. It is my understanding that the accused will be saying that he was acting in self defence.""

3There has been evidence tendered indicating that the relationship between the accused and the deceased commenced sometime around 2006 to 2007 and that they commenced living together soon after. They have two sons together. They ceased living together in February 2011. As I have stated part of the Crown case is that the accused was possessive of the deceased and jealous of the possibility of her seeing other men even after they ceased living together. Evidence has been adduced indicating that on the afternoon of the day that the deceased died the accused twice contacted a male friend of hers and asked if he and the deceased were seeing each other.

4Ms Angela Walkerden gave evidence that on the evening of 11 March 2011 she was at the deceased's home having drinks with the deceased and some of the deceased's neighbours. She returned to her home for a period of time and then came back to the deceased's premises. When she returned she noticed that the deceased was sitting in a car outside the front of her home and that the guests had all left. The deceased's infant son was in the car. The deceased asked Ms Walkerden to drive her to the accused's premises. The deceased told Ms Walkerden that the accused was alleging that she was ""having guys over at her house"" and that the deceased wanted to prove to him that this was not true. Ms Walkerden then drove the deceased to the accused's home. She waited while the deceased went inside. She said that when the deceased returned she appeared ""shaken and upset"". At this point objection was taken by Mr Chapple SC. I heard argument on the objection in the absence of the jury.

5Absent any objection, the Crown was intending to lead evidence from Ms Walkerden that the deceased had told her that she was assaulted by the accused. 

6In her statement to the police Ms Walkerden stated that when the deceased returned to her car she asked the deceased ""Did he believe you?"" Ms Walkerden's statement continues:
""Yvette seemed to be shaken up and upset, to the point where she looked like she was about to cry but she didn't. I said, 'What happened?' She told me, 'John hit me in the head and I fell to the floor. He kept hitting me and kicking me in front of Taylor'. I said, 'You should call the police and have him charged with assault because you can't let him get away with hitting you, especially in front of Taylor'. Yvette said, 'I don't want to'. ... I tried to convince her to do something about what had happened to her, but she didn't tell me anymore. I drove her home. Once we got home I tried to look for injuries without Yvette seeing me, but I couldn't see anything... .""

7In argument the Crown Prosecutor explained the relevance of this evidence was that it was ""part of the relationship that if he was driven by jealousy then he would assault [the deceased]"". The Crown sought to characterise this evidence as ""relationship evidence"". ""Relationship evidence"" is an elastic term that can sometimes confuse rather than clarify the task of determining admissibility. In my view, properly analysed, the evidence of the accused assaulting the deceased was tendency evidence and consequently was required to satisfy s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 before it could be adduced. 

8In this case the evidence which suggests that the accused asserted a form of proprietary control over the deceased and was jealous of her seeing other men does not appear to need to pass the threshold in s 97. I say ""appear"" because to the extent that Ms Walkerden and other witnesses gave evidence to this effect it was not objected to. In the absence of argument on this it seems to me that evidence that merely showed that in the immediate period prior to her death the accused was possessive of the deceased and jealous of her seeing other men was relevant to proving the events leading to her death, and was not subject to the requirements imposed on tendency evidence (see R v Serratore [2001] NSWCCA 123 at [37] and [42] per Beazley JA with whom Grove and Whealey JJ agreed). 

9However, to take the next step and lead evidence suggesting that on a previous occasion this feeling had led him to assault her in my view did involve adducing evidence of the ""conduct of"" the accused in order to prove he acted in a particular way, namely violently (see s 97(1)). The explanation given by the Crown Prosecutor meant that the only basis upon which this alleged earlier assault could be relevant to the case against the accused is by the application of tendency reasoning, namely by seeking to prove:
""... (by inference), that, because, on a particular occasion, a person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind), that person, on an occasion relevant to the proceeding, acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind).""

(R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492 at [23] per Simpson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed.)

10I addressed the requirements for the admission of such evidence in a judgment I gave earlier in these proceedings (R v Meyn (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1449 at [14] to [20]). I will not repeat that discussion.

11In this case I was not satisfied that, if adduced, Ms Walkerden's evidence of complaint of a previous assault on the part of the accused towards the deceased would have significant probative value. Taking her evidence at its highest, not much is known about what precipitated the aggression. Was the accused acting out his possessive instincts or did something else trigger the assault? The form of the assault did not appear to be similar to that which killed the deceased namely blows to the head and strangulation.

12In the end the Court is left with a single instance of domestic violence prior to the killing. In this case, for a single prior instance of domestic violence to be admissible as tendency evidence, as opposed to some other basis, there would need to be strong similarities between that occasion and the killing to warrant a conclusion that it has significant probative value (see R v Meyn (No 2) at [20]). In my view there do not appear to be sufficiently common features between this single incident of violence towards the deceased and the events of her death to conclude that the former had significant probative value to prove the Crown's case on the latter. 

13Accordingly I rejected the evidence.

		04 March 2013",2012-12-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760594,R v Fostis COSTI [2012] NSWDC 288,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1Fostis Costi was a retailer of heroin. Over a period of time he regularly supplied heroin from his home to a number of regular customers. The police became aware of his activities and he was arrested and charged with two crimes. I am sentencing him today for those two crimes as well as some associated offences. 

2The two crimes that I am sentencing him for are both offences against s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The first crime charges that between 11 July and 9 August 2011 Mr Costi, on 3 or more separate occasions over a period of 30 consecutive days, supplied heroin for financial gain. 

3The second charge is the same offence but specified to be between 8 August and 24 August 2011. 

4Mr Costi has pleaded guilty to both of those crimes and, if I have not done so yet, I convict him of both of those offences. 

5Each of the offences is regarded as very serious by Parliament which has imposed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment for the crime. 

6Mr Costi has asked me to take into account, when I am sentencing him for these 2 offences, 4 other crimes. I mistakenly said ""when I am sentencing him for these 2 offences"". In fact I will take them into account when I am sentencing him for the first offence, namely the one between 11 July and 9 August 2011, four other offences. One is exposing a child to drugs which is an offence against s 36Y(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The second is possessing a prohibited drug which is an offence against s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The third is obstructing and hindering a law enforcement officer executing a warrant which is an offence against s 52 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. The fourth is supplying a prohibited drug which is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

7When in due course I sentence him for the first offence on the indictment, I will take those offences into account and I sign a form to that effect signed by Mr Costi and by a representative of the prosecutor which has been prepared under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

8Over the period of time that the police were monitoring Mr Costi's activity, there were a large number of individual transactions. There is a convenient summary on page 9 of an account of his criminal activity which is contained in exhibit A. The summary is as follows, which I adopt and find accordingly:

""As of the date of the offender's arrest, there were 193 recorded purchases of heroin with a cumulative weight calculated at 48.5 grams. The weights calculation has only been based on information when the weight was specified. The full quantity of heroin supplied is unknown, as it is sometimes referred to by weight and on other occasions by cash value, and on other occasions the quantity or cash value was not specified. The full quantity of heroin supplied by Costi is larger than 48.5 grams. An estimate of the amount Costi was paid for the 48.5 grams at $500 per gram is $26,040.""

9The first offence covers 93 individual sales of amounts of heroin ranging from 0.1 gram to 3 grams. The sales were made to regular customers who attended Mr Costi's home to buy the drug. On two other occasions Mr Costi supplied 2 grams of heroin by post to buyers in Tasmania who had paid $1,000 into a bank account. 

10Over the period of the second offence Mr Costi engaged in 61 transactions over a period of just over 2 weeks. The cost ranged from $500 to $400. Once again, as a rule they were regular customers who came to his home to buy the drug. On one occasion in that period he supplied 2 grams by post to the same buyers in Tasmania who paid $1,000 into an account.

11The transactions occurred, as I said, at Mr Costi's home which is an address in Seven Hills. He was living there with his partner, Sarie Nillson and their 4 children who attended a local public school. Hence one of the offences which I take into account is exposing those children to prohibited drug activity. 

12Before police arrested Mr Costi he ran into his home and locked the door behind him. He ran to a sink in the kitchen and emptied a brown powder down the sink. The police forced their way into his home and arrested him in the kitchen but he resisted them and had to be taken down to the ground and handcuffed. Hence I am taking into account the offence of obstructing or hindering a person who was trying to execute a warrant. 

13When the police searched his home they found 30 grams of cannabis. That formed the basis of the offence of possessing a prohibited drug. In addition they found 18 grams of methylamphetamine. The amount of that methylamphetamine was such that it formed the basis of a charge of a deemed supply of a prohibited drug. 

14Ms C. Summerfield who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions acknowledged that Mr Costi had pleaded guilty to the charges at the earliest available opportunity. That means, in due course when I sentence him, I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 25 per cent because of the advantage to the administration of justice that Mr Costi has provided by pleading guilty and avoiding the expense of a trial. 

15He was arrested on 23 August 2011 and has been in custody since that date on these charges alone. Accordingly the sentence will date from 23 August 2011. 

16Ms Summerfield submitted that Mr Costi's role was ""that of a street-level dealer operating a commercial enterprise from his own home"". That submission is not opposed and I accept it. Ms Summerfield also submitted that ""the objective criminality of this offence falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, where the offender was supplying heroin in the community to a substantial degree, for his own material benefit and to support his drug use."" That submission is also accepted.

17A judge needs to also take into account circumstances personal to an offender when the judge is sentencing the person. That will always include any criminal record which the offender has. In this case Mr Costi has a criminal record. He has offences ranging from 1980 through to and including 1990 which involved the possession and use of cannabis. In 2009 there is on his record an offence involving a prohibited weapon. He also has traffic offences. These offences do not add to the seriousness of his criminal activity this time but it means that he does not available to him the lenient approach which a judge may take to sentencing someone who has committed offences for the very first time. 

18In addition there has been prepared in this case a pre-sentence report about Mr Costi by the Probation and Parole Service. It contains useful information about him and his drug-taking history. It notes that Mr Costi started using cannabis casually when he was about 23 years old but his use increased when his older brother died from a heroin overdose in 1986. He apparently found it very difficult to cope at the time. He has continued using cannabis since, apart from being drug-free for some 12 months between 2009 and 2010. The report notes that in 2004 he began to use heroin when it was laced in the cannabis that he was smoking. He has continued to use heroin until he was arrested.

19He has been in a relationship with his current partner for some 12 years and has 4 children aged 12, 10, 8 and 7. He completed year 10 at school and worked for many years in the family retail fish business. He was securing drugs for his own use as well as financing his own use by the supply activity which I am sentencing him for. There is a summary contained in the pre-sentence report which says this:

""Mr Costi described a lifestyle entrenched with illicit drug use since he was twenty-three years old. It is a concern that he has rationalised his behaviour and seemingly not taken into consideration the seriousness of his actions. Mr Costi claimed that when released, it is his intention to remain drug free, secure employment and eventually relocate to an area where he will not have contact with his prior adverse associations. It is positive, that at this time Mr Costi has the support of his partner and family to assist him in achieving his goals.""

20In fact, Mr M Ainsworth of counsel who appeared for Mr Costi called his brother Andrew Costi, who runs a successful business, to give evidence before me. Mr Andrew Costi confirmed that he and other members of his family will all support Fostis Costi including seeing if he, subject to his health, can secure work. Mr Andrew Costi confirmed the history which was noted in the pre sentence report about the affect of their brother's death on Fostis Costi's drug taking habits. Mr Andrew Costi has noted an improvement in his brother's health since he has been in custody and off drugs. He has also seen an improvement in his brother's attitude to himself.

21Mr Ainsworth tendered as exhibit 2 an affidavit by his client which contained a lot of his personal history. He did not put his client into the witness box but it seems that much of what is contained in the affidavit is uncontroversial. He has a serious health issue brought about by a hernia in his abdomen. He is no longer being medicated for his drug use and is now, as Mr Ainsworth put it, no longer pharmaceutically supported. 

22He has other children apart from the children that he has with Ms Nillson and has a good relationship with all his children. There was also a report from a forensic psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro, who recorded much of the history that I have referred to. A psychometric assessment performed by Mr Watson Munro confirmed, he said, ""a diagnosis of major depression"". Apparently he expressed considerable remorse for his actions to Mr Watson Munro in the context of detoxifying from what Mr Watson Munro described as ""a long standing drug addiction problem which has enabled him to develop clearer insight to his behaviour, wrongdoing and the dynamics surrounding his addiction.""

23Mr Watson Munro referred to the obvious connection between Mr Costi's drug addiction and the crimes that I am sentencing him for. He recommended ongoing treatment as a matter of urgency and thought that given Mr Costi's ""age, his attitude towards his offending and the fact that he has now been drug free since his arrest, I believe that with continuing support, supervision and treatment, his prognosis will remain on a positive trajectory.""

HIS HONOUR: I will just depart from my remarks on sentence at this stage. Mr Sayad those that will classify your client in Corrective Services indicate generally that any psychological or psychiatric material can be very helpful to them in that classification process. I cannot remember whether I mentioned this to Mr Ainsworth, perhaps not. What my associate will do in cases where she has, well I have been given permission, is that she will send by fax a copy of Mr Watson Munro's report this afternoon to those that classify him and they find it very helpful. But she will not do that without your instructions and so you might take the opportunity to get those instructions in the next few minutes. Some people do not like that sort of material circulating within Corrective Services or within the gaol but I can say that those that classify prisoners say that it is very helpful so it is a matter entirely for you. You let me know in due course.

SAYAD: Thank you your Honour I'll obtain those instructions. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. I will return to my remarks on sentence.

24Mr Ainsworth tendered some character references which speak well of Mr Costi as having values such as strength, intelligence and compassion. He is obviously regarded as a family man. 

25Ms Summerfield pointed out in her helpful written submissions that the intention of s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act was to target dealers who organised their affairs in such a way as to limit the full effect of drug legislation ""by dealing in only small quantities at a time. Accordingly s 25A offences are considered more serious than s 25 offences as reflected by an increase in the maximum penalty."" 

26Ms Summerfield also drew my attention to the guideline judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal relevant to sentencing persons where I am taking into account other sentences [sic]. She submitted that there is no other choice but a full-time custodial sentence and Mr Ainsworth did not suggest otherwise. 

27Ms Summerfield submitted that it has been recognised for a long time ""that supplying drugs to the community has long-term and devastating consequences for individuals, families and the community generally and the sentencing process must accordingly pay strong regard to the protection of the community."" I accept her submissions in that regard and also so far as taking matters into account and the purposes of enacting s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.

28I have had regard to the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission on sentencing for these kinds of offences and which became MFI 2 in these proceedings. Shortly I will impose an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 but I would indicate that in the meantime I would regard an appropriate sentence in respect of count 1 including the matters I have taken into account as being one of 5 years imprisonment. In respect of count 2 I would regard an appropriate overall sentence as one being of 4 years imprisonment.

29Count 1 I would have discounted by 25 per cent because of Mr Costi's plea of guilty and would therefore have reduced the sentence to one of 3 years and 9 months. In respect of count 2, I would have reduced that 4 year sentence by 25 cent to a sentence of 3 years imprisonment. I would have partially accumulated the 2 sentences so that the total to be served by Mr Costi under both sentences would have been one of 4 years imprisonment. The partial accumulation would be to the extent of 3 months. 

30Normally for a 4 year sentence, the non-parole period that it would be compulsory for a prisoner to be kept in prison would be 3 years but Mr Ainsworth argued that there are special circumstances for adjusting the ratio to one of 50 per cent so that he serves 2 years in prison. I accept that submission. This is Mr Costi's first time in full-time custody and he has made significant progress in detoxifying himself from drugs. I would think that he would benefit from a longer period on parole to address his drug addiction and to get his health back into order and get himself into employment. I would therefore propose to fix the non-parole period as one of 2 years imprisonment. 

HIS HONOUR: I will now sentence you Mr Costi if you would stand up.

31I am imposing an aggregate sentence in respect of the two offences. The aggregate sentence will be 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. I fix a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 23 August 2011 and to expire on 22 August 2013. The balance of the term will be 2 years commencing on 23 August 2013 and expiring on 22 August 2015. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat Mr Costi. Now in a moment I will explain that to your client although it is fairly straight forward. Now I think the mathematics are correct are they? Yes. Ms Blizard, Mr Sayad.

SAYAD: That's correct your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now do you have instructions or do you want to get them. Take your time.

SAYAD: If your Honour excuses me for a moment.

HIS HONOUR: Yes you go ahead, take your time.

SAYAD: That's fine your Honour, there's no objection to the report being tendered.

HIS HONOUR: All right my associate will - I'll make it available to her now, exhibit 1 and she will send that to Corrective Services this afternoon. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Costi, although convicted of two offences, you have one sentence of 4 years. It started back on 23 August last year when you are arrested and therefore the sentence expires on 22 August 2015. I have fixed a non-parole period of 2 years and that will come up on 22 August next year 2013. Whether or not you get parole depends upon the Parole Authority, not me because of the length of the sentence. So a little before that date you will begin the process of being assessed for being released on parole. The earliest date that you can be released on parole by the Parole Authority is 22 August 2013. Do you understand that? Okay have a seat Mr Costi.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Blizard, Mr Sayad there was a MFI 3 is the application under the Confiscation Of Proceeds Of Crime Act and I just can remember but Mr Sayad were you here on Friday.

SAYAD: Your Honour I wasn't appearing on Friday. It was Mr Kyriacou with Mr Ainsworth.

HIS HONOUR: With Mr Ainsworth and I remember Mr Ainsworth wanted a little bit of time and I just can't remember what we were going to do with it.

SAYAD: I'd ask that time be granted. Your Honour I don't have instructions--

HIS HONOUR: Yes it will.

SAYAD: --in relation to the order. 

HIS HONOUR: No well I'm not going to rush it because I remember Mr Ainsworth wanted time to think about it so I am not sure what I sure do. What do you think? I am here tomorrow and Wednesday. It is probably desirable that we sort it out in the next couple of days.

BLIZARD: Does your Honour have a copy of the paperwork? 

HIS HONOUR: Yes I will pass it down. It is MFI 3.

BLIZARD: I was going to suggest if Mr Ainsworth made contact with your associate we could, by consent, perhaps it could be done in chambers.

HIS HONOUR: Well that is what he was not sure about but would be--

BLIZARD: And if it's to be defended then it will need to get another listing. 

HIS HONOUR: That makes sense Mr Sayad, what Ms Blizard says.

SAYAD: I agree with my friend your Honour.

BLIZARD: I hand that back up then.

HIS HONOUR: All right would you ask Mr Ainsworth whether it's a contested matter or whether it's by consent.

SAYAD: Ainsworth, sure. Yes your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: And if he contacts my associate and by email is best or you, I don't mind or you or Mr Kyriacou.

SAYAD: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: By email is best copying in the Crown indicating what your attitude is, either that it's contested or that it's consent. If it's consent I'll sign the orders in chambers.

SAYAD: Yes your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: And if it's contested then we'll fix a date next year and if that could be done in the next 48 hours, I'd appreciate that.

SAYAD: Yes your Honour. That will be no problem. Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right now there is - my associate thinks one backup offence is and perhaps they are ones which I took into account.

BLIZARD: There's two backup offences your Honour. Sequences 2 and 5. So they're to be withdrawn.

HIS HONOUR: What are they for or have I taken those into account.

BLIZARD: The sequence 2 is supply prohibited drug and sequence 5 is possession of 18 grams of methylamphetamine. My instructions are to withdraw those.

HIS HONOUR: Ok well they're the ones I took into account aren't they?

BLIZARD: No they're four matters on the form 1.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. 

BLIZARD: That's sequences 3, 4, 6 and 15. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

BLIZARD: And the backup offences are sequences 2 and 5.

HIS HONOUR: So what do you want me to do to the backup?

BLIZARD: They're to be withdrawn. I'd ask you to dismiss them. 

32I dismiss them. 

BLIZARD: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: And they're both backup.

BLIZARD: They are.

HIS HONOUR: The two backup offences of--

BLIZARD: Supply prohibited drug.

HIS HONOUR: --supply prohibited drug--

BLIZARD: And possession of methylamphetamine.

HIS HONOUR: --and possession of methylamphetamine are both dismissed. 

BLIZARD: Thank you your Honour. Did your Honour make an order for destruction of the drugs?

HIS HONOUR: No but I will now.

BLIZARD: Thank you.

33I order that the drugs be destroyed under section whatever it is - which my associate will put in the formal orders - of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Okay so I think that's it am I right? Okay thanks Mr Sayad, thanks. 

SAYAD: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Did you want to see your client before he's taken down?

SAYAD: If I may be excused your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes you can. Thanks Ms Blizard.

BLIZARD: Thank you your Honour.

4The complaints Mr Yousaf brings before the Court of Appeal by means of his amended summons arise from the outcome of his appeal to the District Court from a decision of the Local Court adverse to him. He had been adjudged guilty of stalking and intimidation of his wife (or former wife) - a statutory offence created by s 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 - and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seven months, with the sentence to be served by way of intensive correction in the community in accordance with the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. The appeal from the Local Court to the District Court was pursuant to Division 1 of Part 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.

5The appeal was heard on 15 March 2012. The appeal on conviction was dismissed. The appeal on sentence was ultimately withdrawn (in circumstances to be mentioned presently) and the order of the magistrate that the sentence of seven months imprisonment be served by way of intensive correction order was confirmed by the District Court. The formal orders were made on 25 May 2012.

6In addition to his amended summons, Mr Yousaf has filed in this Court a notice of motion seeking an order for the return to him of a document tendered by him in the District Court proceedings, received as an exhibit and retained by the District Court. For the moment, I put the notice of motion to one side and concentrate on the claims in the amended summons.

7Mr Yousaf appeared in person before this Court. He participated through an Urdu interpreter, as he had in the District Court. Ms Webster SC appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

The basis for Mr Yousaf's proceedings 

8Mr Yousaf did not articulate in any clear or concise way the legal basis for the claims advanced by the amended summons or for the proposition that it is open to this Court to make the orders he seeks, being principally an order setting aside his conviction and sentence on the charge of stalking and intimidation.

9It is obvious, however, that the principal claim is one for prerogative relief in the nature of certiorari. Having regard to s 9(2) and s 166 of the District Court Act 1973, the appeal function that the District Court performed was undertaken in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction of that court. Section 176 of the District Court Act therefore applies. That section is within Part 4 of the Act headed ""The Criminal Jurisdiction of the Court"" and is in these terms:

""No adjudication on appeal of the District Court is to be removed by any order into the Supreme Court.""

10The effect of s 176 was described by Basten JA (with the concurrence of Giles JA and McColl JA) in Garde v Dowd [2011] NSWCA 115 as follows (at [10]):


""It is accepted that the effect of this provision is not to exclude proceedings by way of judicial review by this Court, but to limit their availability to cases involving jurisdictional error: see, eg, Downey v Acting District Court Judge Boulton (No 5) [2010] NSWCA 240; 272 ALR 705 at [133]-[134]. No greater intrusion on the powers of this Court would be constitutionally valid: Kirk v Industrial Relations Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at [54]-[55].""

11Reference may also be made, in that connection to other cases, including Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 at [15], Director of Public Prosecutions v Emanuel [2009] NSWCA 42; 193 A Crim R 552 at [18] and [45] and, more recently, Elias v Director of Public Prosecutions [2012] NSWCA 302 at [5].

12It is thus clear that the only question that may be agitated in this Court on the matters raised by the amended summons is whether the decision of the District Court on appeal from the Local Court is affected by jurisdictional error. This Court's power of review is limited and constrained accordingly. 

Mr Yousaf's complaints

13Mr Yousaf's complaints about the District Court decision focus on three matters. 

14First and principally, Mr Yousaf complains about the District Court's refusal to receive and consider further evidence on the hearing of the appeal and, in that respect, to exercise the power conferred by s 18(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 

15Second, Mr Yousaf says that the judge was biased against him or, at least, that there were grounds for a reasonable apprehension of bias. 

16Third, there are several complaints the substance of which is that the decision of the magistrate was unsupported by the evidence and that the District Court should therefore have allowed the appeal.

Circumstances giving rise to the first complaint

17I address first the refusal to receive further evidence. That evidence was contained in what was said by Mr Yousaf to be an affidavit of his wife or former wife (who was the victim of the alleged offence) prepared for the purposes of the Local Court proceedings but not placed before that court. The primary judge concluded, on the basis of evidence given by the purported deponent and the solicitor before whom the affidavit was purportedly sworn (together with a letter the solicitor had written concerning the possibility of the signature's being his), that neither of them had signed the document. There was, the judge said, evidence from Mr Yousaf that he had received the document ""in the post unsolicited and essentially anonymously"". Mr Yousaf was thus unable to give any evidence about the circumstances in which any signing of the document occurred; nor did he seek to adduce evidence from any other person on that matter. 

18On the basis of the evidence before him, the judge found that the purported affidavit of the wife was ""a false affidavit that was never sworn by the complainant"". That being so, his Honour held that it was not, in terms of s 18(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, in the interests of justice that the content of the supposed affidavit be admitted into evidence on the appeal. He therefore declined to receive it.

Circumstances giving rise to the second complaint

19The allegation of actual or apprehended bias on the part of the District Court judge is based on two things. The first is an exchange between his Honour and the parties' representatives before the hearing of the appeal began. Two appeals by Mr Yousaf were listed for hearing. The other concerned an apprehended violence order. Mr Yousaf had instructed different lawyers for the two matters. The judge made an observation about this as follows:

""How bizarre, I don't think I've ever had that situation arise, ever in now almost thirty years of doing this sort of work. It's always interesting to see what happens. But it's extremely unusual. Apart from being extremely expensive I would have thought. All right and then there's the other matter.""

20Mr Yousaf saw this as an attempt by the judge to ""dishearten my lawyers"".

21The second basis for the bias complaint comes from a particular approach the judge took to both the sentence appeal and the separate appeal concerning the apprehended violence order.

22After stating reasons for dismissal of the appeal against conviction, the judge asked Mr Yousaf's lawyer, Ms Paraska, whether she was proceeding with the sentence appeal. An affirmative answer was given. The following exchange then took place:

""HIS HONOUR: What was the outcome in relation to the severity? Or in relation to the sentence I should say.

PARASKA: The sentence was a seven month intensive correction order, I have referred your Honour to the matter of Owen Cameron which is really the only authority on what the purpose of ICO is--

HIS HONOUR: Your client is lucky he didn't go to gaol full time, having regard to this material.

PARASKA: Is that a form of warning your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I'm happy to give it to you in the circumstances, yes. I am giving you a Parker warning.

PARASKA: Then the appeal against the severity is withdrawn.

HIS HONOUR: Do you oppose the granting of leave to withdraw the severity appeal?

PROWSE: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I just note the conviction appeal is dismissed and the conviction confirmed, in relation to the severity appeal I will just note that leave is granted to withdraw the severity appeal.""

23The District Court then heard argument on the separate appeal concerning the apprehended violence order upon which a different lawyer appeared for Mr Yousaf. At the conclusion of submissions on that appeal, the judge said, in relation to the magistrate's decision on extension of the apprehended violence order:

""I think he did very well before the magistrate, because quite frankly if the matter proceeds before me I am minded to impose a much longer period in respect of which he will be subject to an AVO.""

24And later:

""And the only thing I disagree with is the length of time that he granted the extension for, in my view it should have been considerably longer in order to provide the complainant with the appropriate protection.""

25At that point, Mr Yousaf's lawyer sought instructions and informed that court that Mr Yousaf did not wish to proceed with the appeal, whereupon the judge granted leave to withdraw the appeal and confirmed the orders made by the magistrate.

Circumstances giving rise to the third complaint

26As to Mr Yousaf's third complaint (that the District Court failed to address and deal with alleged factual errors on the part of the magistrate), it is sufficient to note that no further evidence was before the District Court, that the judge, in his reasons, summarised the evidence that had been given in the Local Court (including, in particular, evidence of the wife of various instances of ill-treatment of her by Mr Yousaf and Mr Yousaf's denial of any such conduct) and the magistrate's observations and findings on the questions of credibility that loomed large in the case. 

27The judge then said:

""In a case such as this, where one is looking at oath on oath, particularly in appeal proceedings such as these, the findings of the magistrate in relation to credit are of particular importance. From my perusal of the transcript the findings of the magistrate in relation to credit, in my view, are indeed more than supported.

Having regard to the totality of the evidence adduced in the Local Court and the findings of the magistrate in relation to credit, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has committed the offence with which he has been charged and, accordingly, I find him guilty. Accordingly the conviction appeal is dismissed.""

The jurisdictional error concept 

28As I have said, this Court may review the decision of the District Court only if it is shown that that decision is affected by jurisdictional error. The relevant concept of jurisdictional error has been explored in a number of key cases. In Craig v v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR 163, the High Court gave a broad description of jurisdictional error as follows (at 177):

""An inferior court falls into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that jurisdiction does exist. Such jurisdictional error can infect either a positive act or a refusal or failure to act. Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of the writ where it makes an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise, jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits of jurisdiction."" 

29The court then (at 177-8) gave examples:

""Jurisdictional error is at its most obvious where the inferior court purports to act wholly or partly outside the general area of its jurisdiction in the sense of entertaining a matter or making a decision or order of a kind which wholly or partly lies outside the theoretical limits of its functions and powers.""

""Less obviously, an inferior court can, while acting wholly within the general area of its jurisdiction, fall into jurisdictional error by doing something which it lacks authority to do.""

""Similarly, jurisdictional error will occur where an inferior court disregards or takes account of some matter in circumstances where the statute or other instrument establishing it and conferring its jurisdiction requires that that particular matter be taken into account or ignored as a pre-condition of the existence of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of the particular case.""

""Again, an inferior court will exceed its authority and fall into jurisdictional error if it misconstrues that statute or other instrument and thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case.""

30Significantly, for present purposes, in Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531, French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ recognised (at [60]) as one form of jurisdictional error ""a failure to accord procedural fairness during a hearing"". Lack of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice in the form of apprehended or ostensible bias on the part of a decision-maker is therefore susceptible to correction as jurisdictional error: see, for example, Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte HB [2001] HCA 34; (2001) 179 ALR 513 at [10].

Assessment of the first and third complaints

31Neither the first nor the third of the complaints advanced by Mr Yousaf (that is, the complaint about refusal to receive further evidence and the complaint going to factual matters) can possibly on the basis on which it is put come within any category of jurisdictional error. 

32The position in relation to those matters may be summarised briefly. The District Court judge had before him appeals that were clearly within the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court. His Honour addressed the matter of the additional evidence in the way the relevant statutory provision required it to be addressed and made a decision of the kind that provision envisaged. He then determined the appeal on conviction by reference to the submissions he had received and the evidence that had been before the Local Court, relying on the Local Court transcript for that purpose and taking into account all relevant factual matters arising from that evidence. That was precisely the course his Honour was required by the applicable legislation to take. Under s 18(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, an appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings. The stated conclusion was that his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Yousaf had committed the offence. 

33In relation to the further evidence issue and the consistency of the decision with the evidence, his Honour proceeded in due and proper exercise of the relevant jurisdiction. There is no room for any finding that, as regards either of those matters, he acted in excess of jurisdiction or in any other way amounting to or entailing jurisdictional error. If there was any error in relation to either of those matters (and I hasten to say that I do not think that any has been shown), it was an error within jurisdiction.

Assessment of the second complaint

34The allegation of bias or apprehended bias raises different issues since such an allegation, if made good, entails lack of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice which is an established category of jurisdictional error.

35The governing principle is that a judge must not hear and determine a case if a fair minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge will not bring an impartial mind to resolution of the questions the judge is required to determine. A recent statement of the principles may be found in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Laurie [2011] HCA 2; (2011) 242 CLR 283 particularly at [32] and following (French CJ), [78] and following (Gummow J) and [139] and following (Heydon, Kiefel and Bell JJ). This makes it necessary to assess the two aspects of the judge's conduct about which Mr Yousaf complains under this heading.

36The first such aspect concerns the judge's comments on the fact that Mr Yousaf had instructed different lawyers to deal with the two appeals. The comments are set out at [19] above. Those comments cannot be the source of any reasonable apprehension of the relevant kind. The judge did no more than to observe that the situation was, in his long experience, very unusual - even ""bizarre"" - and that it involved additional expense for Mr Yousaf. Those observations did not indicate in any way that the judge had formed views adverse to Mr Yousaf and his case or had (or might have) compromised his ability to approach the case before him fairly and impartially. Nor did they have any capacity to deflect either lawyer from the due performance of the lawyer's duties. A judge who is of the opinion that the procedural course a litigant has taken is unusual and productive of unwarranted expense for the litigant does not, by expressing that opinion, say or imply anything at all about the ultimate determination of the litigant's case. In particular, the judge does not thereby show that he or she will not or may not decide the case otherwise than according to its merits.

37The second aspect of the apprehended bias complaint concerns the judge's ""Parker warnings"" - that is, the indication by the judge at the end of argument with respect to both sentence and the extension of the apprehended violence order that he considered the decision of the magistrate to be unduly favourable to Mr Yousaf, the clear message being that he was minded to substitute an order more burdensome from Mr Yousaf's viewpoint. The giving by the judge of those indications did not bespeak bias or constitute grounds for any apprehension of bias. Having formed the relevant opinion after hearing both parties, the judge was ensuring that the aspect of procedural fairness and natural justice discussed by this Court in Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 was afforded to Mr Yousaf. It would have been irregular for the judge to order a result more burdensome to Mr Yousaf than that against which he appealed without first indicating an intention of doing so, so that Mr Yousaf might decide whether he preferred to settle for the status quo. It was an unexceptionable exercise of the judge's functions for him to state the position he had reached on the questions of sentence and duration of the apprehended violence order and to give Mr Yousaf an opportunity to decide whether, in the light of that, he wished to press his appeals. 

38It may be that when Mr Yousaf heard, through the interpreter, words of the judge indicating a ""warning"" (as in ""Parker warning"") to him or his lawyer, he thought that some form of threat had been made by the judge and that such a threat was intended to deflect Mr Yousaf from the due pursuit of his rights or the lawyer from the due protection of those rights. But there was, in reality, no ""warning"" in any such threatening sense. The word ""warning"" was used in a purely non-intimidatory sense as part of the terminology employed by lawyers in connection with the effectuation of a particular aspect of natural justice and procedural fairness.

Conclusion on the principal claims 

39Mr Yousaf has not shown that any aspect of the decision of the District Court was affected by jurisdictional error. Since jurisdictional error is the only basis on which this Court could intervene, the amended summons should be dismissed.

The notice of motion

40It remains to consider Mr Yousaf's notice of motion by which he seeks an order of the Court of Appeal for the return of an exhibit tendered by him and marked upon the hearing of motion for the reception of further evidence in the District Court. 

41The exhibit included the original of the purported affidavit of the wife that the judge refused to receive into evidence and the envelope in which, according to Mr Yousaf, he received it through the post. 

42After the appeal had been fully dealt with, Mr Yousaf's lawyer sought the return of the exhibit. The judge did not accede to that application. He said:

""No. All of that is staying with the court file. It may well be that the authorities will want to pursue that further, but none of that material is going to leave the court file."" 

43Ms Webster SC has assisted the Court by providing submissions on the provisions concerning exhibits in District Court proceedings of the type under discussion. The central provision is Part 53 rule 9 of the District Court Rules 1973. Part 53 is headed ""Criminal Procedure Rules""; and Part 53 rule 1(1) states that Part 53 applies to proceedings in the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court. As I have said, the appeal function that the District Court performed on the application of Mr Yousaf was undertaken in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction. Part 53 rule 9 is in these terms:

""(1) Exhibits in any proceedings, whether produced on subpoena or otherwise, may be returned to the person who produced them to the Court or registrar: 
(a) where the Court makes an order for the return of the exhibits, forthwith, and
(b) where, within a period of 90 days after sentence is passed or deferred or a final order is made, the Court makes no order for the return or retention of the exhibits, and no notice is given to the registrar of any appeal in the proceedings, forthwith after the expiration of that period.

(2) A person to whom exhibits may be returned under subrule (1) shall obtain the return of, and give to the registrar a receipt for, the exhibits as soon as practicable, and the registrar shall be responsible for the safe custody of any exhibits in his keeping for a period only of 14 days after the first day on which the exhibits may be so returned.""

44The terms in which the District Court judge dealt with the application for return of the exhibit (set out at [42] above) make it clear that there was an order that the exhibit should be retained by the court. In those circumstances, rule 9(1)(a) does not allow the exhibit to be returned; nor, since there was an order ""for the . . . retention of"" the exhibit, does rule 9(1)(b) allow the exhibit to be returned.

45Furthermore, it is by no means clear that, if this Court were to set aside the judge's order concerning retention of the exhibit, the situation would become one in which return was permitted by rule 9(1)(b). I say this because, for the purpose of computing time, the order subsequently set aside might be regarded as having been in force at the end of the period of ninety days to which rule 9(1)(b) refers. It is not necessary to express any view about this.

46There is, in any event, a question as to this Court's power to set aside or countermand the District Court's order and, in that way, to direct return of the exhibit. There is no right of appeal in that respect under s 127 of the District Court Act since the appeal proceedings before the primary judge did not constitute an ""action"" as referred to in s 127(1) (the definition of ""action"" in s 4(1) excludes proceedings under Part 4 which is concerned with the District Court's criminal jurisdiction). The order concerning the exhibit is no doubt susceptible to the exercise of this Court's discretion to grant prerogative relief, but whether the privative provision in s 176 of the District Court Act applies depends on whether the particular order is within the description ""adjudication on appeal of the District Court"". If the essentially procedural order were such an ""adjudication"", relief in this Court would be available only to correct jurisdictional error; while if it were not, relief would be available also to deal with error of law on the face of the record.

47It is not necessary to determine the question just mentioned. There is no conceivable basis on which the order of the District Court judge concerning retention of the exhibit involved either jurisdictional error or error of law on the face of the record. The order was made after a hearing which, although brief, was sufficient for the purpose. It clearly lay within the court's power to make the order which entailed due exercise of a plainly available discretion.

48No ground has been shown for review by this Court of the order concerning the exhibit. But even if such a ground did exist and certiorari lay, the fact that the order was made with a stated possibility in view, that more than seven months have now passed and that there is no barrier to Mr Yousaf's going back to the District Court to argue for the return of the exhibit in the light of circumstances now prevailing would be relevant to the question whether this Court should exercise the discretion to intervene.

Sentence

49There is one final matter. It concerns s 69C and s 69D of the Supreme Court Act 1970, both of which, by virtue of s 69C(1), apply to proceedings in the Supreme Court for judicial review of a determination made by the District Court in appeal proceedings relating to a conviction or order made by the Local Court or a sentence imposed by the Local Court. These present proceedings are of that description

50It may be that, by operation of s 69C(2), the sentence imposed on Mr Yousaf by the Local Court and confirmed by the District Court was stayed when the proceedings in this Court were commenced by the summons filed on 31 May 2012. Whether such a stay came into operation depends, in part at least, on whether Mr Yousaf was, as referred to in s 69C(3), ""in custody"" at the time of commencement of these proceedings. As to that, it is relevant to note that, on the evidence before this Court (in the form of a report from Corrective Services NSW dated 23 October 2012), Mr Yousaf has not yet commenced to serve his sentence or to be dealt with under any intensive correction order.

51This last-mentioned circumstance makes it unnecessary, in my view, to come to any view about whether s 69C(2) created a stay. Section 69D is in these terms:

""(1) The Supreme Court may order that a conviction, order or sentence that is the subject of proceedings, or any part of it: 
(a) is to take effect on and from a day specified in the order, or 
(b) in the case of a sentence that has been served in part, is to recommence on and from a day specified in the order, 
being the day the order is made or an earlier day. 

(2) The order has effect even though a stay of execution may have been in force in respect of the sentence that is the subject of the proceedings.""

52Guidance concerning s 69D is provided by the joint judgment of Mason P, Handley and Stein JJA in Whiteside v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWCA 454 at [35]:

""The power conferred by s69D necessarily requires this Court to assess the real impact of the sentence served or not served pending the application. . . . While it is not exercising an appellate jurisdiction as on a rehearing, its power under s69D is obviously available to be used in a way that addresses the substantive issue as regards the reinstatement of the penalty that properly should have been served. The limit is that this power is only available to be exercised in the manner contemplated by s 69D(1). 

53The circumstance that Mr Yousaf has not served any part of his sentence (a sentence of imprisonment for a term of seven months commencing on 4 June 2012 and expiring on 3 January 2013, to be served by way of intensive correction in the community), coupled with the results in both the District Court and this Court, makes it wholly appropriate that this Court should make an order under s 69D(1) that reinstates the sentence and, as it were, causes it to recommence. Having regard to the closing words of s 69D(1), the date of recommencement specified in such an order must coincide with, or be earlier than, the day on which the order is made. Since no part of the sentence has yet been served, recommencement should be from the date of the order. The Corrective Services report of 23 October 2012 states that Mr Yousaf has been re-assessed as suitable for an intensive correction order.

Disposition

54The orders that I propose are:

1. Order that the amended summons filed on 24 September 2012 and the notice of motion filed on 18 October 2012 be dismissed.

2. Order that the sentence imposed on Kamal Yousaf by the Local Court and confirmed by the District Court by order made on 25 May 2012 take effect on and from today, 6 December 2012.

3. Order that Kamal Yousaf pay the costs of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the proceedings in this Court.

		06 December 2012",2012-12-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2760600,R v Tan [2012] NSWDC 277,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Chun Yap Tan appears for sentence today. He is twenty-six years of age and has never been sentenced for a criminal offence before, but he has begun his criminal history in a rather spectacular and serious way. Of course I do not mean to suggest that he will necessarily commit a further offence in the future, but I do mean to suggest that Mr Tan's first offence is one of such seriousness that despite his prior good character he must necessarily serve a lengthy time in gaol.

2He went to the Campsie RSL Club in the early hours of 3 February 2012. He hung around for a while until he noticed Ms Li Ting Chen come into the club. Ms Chen was gambling on the poker machines in the early hours of 3 February, and as she did so she was watched by the offender. At some stage he clearly formed a plan to rob her. He either had a knife with him or went and bought one, and so when Ms Chen got into her car about 3.45am in order to go home the offender got in beside her and was able to threaten her with a dangerous weapon. The weapon was not only capable of inflicting serious injury but the offender used it to do precisely that. 

3Ms Chen was starting to drive away slowly - one can only imagine the fear which she was experiencing at the time - the offender explained to her that he was short of money, but we now know that he was working at the time so he cannot have been that poor. In any case Ms Chen very sensibly handed over her handbag. It had a number of things of value to her including some cash, a phone, and a number of cards. One might have thought that this would be the end of the matter, the offender had got what he came for, he had succeeded in robbing Ms Chen of her property, but the offender was not finished. 

4He put the knife inside Ms Chen's mouth. Ms Chen, quite understandably, tried to get the knife out. As she did so she suffered a significant laceration to her lip. That laceration was about 1.3 centimetres long and required about ten stitches when it was later treated. One can expect some scarring on the face of Ms Chen to result. The offender still was not finished. He turned to face Ms Chen and pulled her hair back. As this was happening he put the knife of the blade across her neck. Fortunately she was not cut at this particular time, but no doubt she was afraid at an extreme level. She took her hands off the steering wheel and grabbed the knife blade in an attempt to snap it. As she did this she suffered injuries, significant ones, to her hands which have required extensive treatment. She also suffered another cut to her chin, this one about 1.5 centimetres long and requiring eight stitches. 

5Still the offender was not finished. By this time the car had stopped and Ms Chen tried to get out of the car but she could not because of the injuries that she had suffered to her hands. Instead of simply getting out and running away, the offender grabbed Ms Chen's hair and pushed her head down cutting her once more, this time across the back of her head just above her neck. That 2.5 centimetre laceration also required suturing later in hospital. Finally the offender left having inflicted a number of serious and separate wounds upon the unfortunate Ms Chen.

6She ran back to the club. An ambulance was called. She was taken to hospital. She underwent surgery to repair her facial lacerations and t0 repair the injuries to her tendons, nerves and an artery in her hands. She was in hospital for three days but has required extensive treatment since then. She continues to suffer both physically and psychologically. She has suffered great harm, precisely the sort of harm that one would expect if a person did what the offender has done to Ms Chen.

7The offender was arrested a few days later. He said that he had difficulty remembering what occurred that night because he was intoxicated. He was shown CCTV footage from inside the club which did not show him consuming any alcohol. However, the offender told police that he had consumed alcohol elsewhere before going to the club. 

8The offence of robbery with wounding is of course a very serious one. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment, the longest determinate sentence provided for in New South Wales. It also has a standard non-parole period of seven years. I have taken both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period into account in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender.

9The offender was born in Malaysia. He has a good relationship with his parents and was brought up well by them. The family was certainly not flush with money but their needs were provided for. Before he was about twelve when he misbehaved the offender would be physically punished by the use of a cane wielded by his father, but after that date misbehaviour resulted in a verbal reprimand. The suggestion that perhaps the offender's violent behaviour on 3 February 2012 bears some relationship to the physical punishment he received before he turned twelve is somewhat speculative. 

10He has always apparently had a good work ethic. His father was a fisherman and Mr Tan helped from a young age in order to assist the family's finances. He did not enjoy school and avoided studying, preferring to assist his father.

11When he was eighteen he and his wife moved to Japan to seek employment. He was deported after being discovered as an illegal immigrant there. He remained back in Malaysia until he was twenty-one where he again travelled overseas, this time to Korea, again as an illegal immigrant, in order to seek work. He went back to Malaysia at twenty-two and came to Australia on a tourist visa. However, he was working, as I have noted, at the time of this offence. 

12It is important to note that he has no criminal history either in Australia or elsewhere. His wife and children have returned to Malaysia given the uncertainty as regards Mr Tan's future in Australia. There was not much point in them staying here. The relationship seems also to be at an end. 

13Mr Tan will thus do his sentence in Australia much harder than would ordinarily be the case. He is isolated from his family and experiences great difficulty in speaking English. He will not be receiving visits from loved ones. He will find it difficult to access the various support services in prison, and even simple things like understanding instructions given to him by Corrective Services officers will be a problem for him. 

14The psychological report tendered on his behalf goes into some detail in explaining the troubles that the offender has had adjusting to life in prison. Of course not too much can be made of this circumstance. It was the offender's choice to commit this offence knowing that if detected he would be sent to prison in a foreign country. I repeat, the offender will do his time in custody much harder than would ordinarily be the case. I have taken this matter into account in deciding the length of the sentence to impose upon him.

15This was a very serious offence. The offender clearly planned to do what he did well before Ms Chen got in her car, and to continue using the knife on her repeatedly after she had handed over what he came for is a disturbing feature of the present case. In that sense the offender's violence was gratuitous. It was completely unnecessary to do what he did to Ms Chen with the knife once she had handed over her handbag. It is something of a puzzle as to why a twenty-six year old would act in such a violent way apparently for the first time. 

16To the psychologist the offender said that he had taken some pills that night. He was unable to say what they were. From the description given, the psychologist considered that the pills may have been a benzodiazepine, but, as Mr Gordon acknowledges, there is no evidence at all that he can point to to suggest that consumption of drugs of that kind would cause anyone to act out of character. I note also that the offender did not tell the police about any pills that he had taken when he was arrested, and so I am simply unable to find that there is evidence about the consumption of pills, if he did take them, that caused him to act out of character. But that is not to say that he did not. He has clearly acted in a way which is unusual for him. That is important in assessing the prospect of the offender committing further offences in the future. It is likely that this will be an isolated breach of the law. I would have been more comfortable in making that finding if I knew what it was that led him to commit this offence in the first place, but as matters stand I simply do not know why he did what he did. 

17He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I imposed upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than would otherwise have been. I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour as well, this being his first time in custody, and the lack of easy access to support services in prison suggest the desirability of extending the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. 

18But I return to where I started. This is a very serious offence. It has caused enormous harm to Ms Chen and the wider community has of course suffered as well. All of us feel less safe when offences of this kind are committed by those who apparently just want to make an easy dollar, and, thus, there needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence built into the sentence I am about to impose upon the offender.

19The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 7 February 2012 and a head sentence of eight years. The non-parole period will expire on 6 February 2017, upon which date the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		04 April 2013",2012-12-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760603,R v Dadash [2012] NSWSC 1511,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Mahmood Dadash is to be sentenced for an offence of affray that he committed at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""Villawood"") on 20 April 2011.  He pleaded guilty to that offence before me last Friday.  
2The offence is contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.  Using the terms of that section, the offender's plea means that he accepts that he used or threatened unlawful violence towards another person and that his conduct was such that it would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety.  The persons present at the scene included employees of Serco, the organisation contracted by the Australian Government to operate the Villawood facility, amongst others.
Why Mr Dadash was at Villawood
3Mr Dadash was being detained at Villawood as an unauthorised entrant into Australia.  His home country is Iran.  He has a wife and daughter there.  He came into conflict with an Iranian government official there, after becoming frustrated about delays in his daughter being provided with a cochlear implant device to assist with her hearing disability.  He vented his frustration by tearing up a picture of Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran.  He later found out that this was an offence under Iranian law, punishable by death.  He fled Iran in 2009, leaving his wife and daughter behind, and came, via Dubai and Indonesia, to Australia.  He arrived by boat and was taken into immigration detention at Christmas Island on 31 January 2010.  He was transferred to Villawood on 17 July 2010.
Events of 20 April 2011 at Villawood
4The events at Villawood on 20 April 2011 were tumultuous and they commenced early in the day in one of three compounds at the centre.  This compound housed about 150 detainees and was managed by about 20 Serco staff.  Two detainees, Messrs X and Y, were noticed to be on the roof of a building within one of the compounds at between approximately 7 or 8am.  They were threatening to throw roof tiles at staff and yelling at staff to go away.  At about 9am, they were seen to be talking to other detainees who were on an adjacent soccer pitch. At about 9.30am they were seen to throw four roof tiles which landed some distance from staff members. They did the same at around noon and on this occasion the tiles dented the walls and a door of the nearby mess hall.
5Around midday the ""activities officer"" tried to commence a game of soccer for the detainees.  X and Y remonstrated with the officer and threw roof tiles onto the soccer field.  Others on the ground were yelling ""no football"".  X called out, ""Stop playing the soccer game as we're making a statement by being up here.  You're mocking us by continuing the daily routines and not paying us any attention.""
6Staff members were creating a human cordon to prevent other detainees getting onto the roof.  Tiles were being thrown in their direction.  It was about this time that Mr Dadash approached the activities officer and made a gesture which was perceived to be a demand that the officer should leave.  He stood close to the officer and yelled, in English, ""Don't play soccer here. Fuck off, fuck off"".  He also tried to snatch the soccer ball.
7A decision was made to move the soccer game further away from the building on top of which were X and Y.  When the game resumed, Mr Dadash again approached the activities officer.  He is said to have gone ""right up to [the officer's] face"", waving his hands and yelling, ""I told you to fuck off, don't play here"".   Another detainee, accompanied by about 40 others ran shouting ""fuck off, fuck off"" and swung his hand in a closed fist towards the officer.  Other detainees had been on the soccer pitch yelling ""no football"".  Someone grabbed the soccer ball and kicked it out of the compound.  The activities officer then left.
8Around midafternoon, an officer attempted to bring drinks to other officers.  X yelled abuse at him and Y threatened to throw a tile at him, saying, ""Fuck off ... we'll kill you"".  The officer with the drinks retreated but Y threw the tile; it crashed on an area of concrete.  Y called out, ""We're up here for a reason, don't drink in front of us ... If you drink or eat in front of us, we're going to throw tiles at you.""  There was a further retreat by officers.
9Bedding and bottled water was thrown up onto the roof by detainees who were on the ground at around 4pm and again at around 6pm.
10It was shortly after 7pm that other detainees started to join X and Y on the roof.  A large group had gathered on the ground yelling at the staff.  At around 7.30pm detainees were yelling ""we want freedom"".  It was estimated that around this time there were about 80 to 90 detainees in the area.  Some were encouraging and helping people to join those on the roof. Staff offered to move detainees who felt at risk out of the compound.
11A couple of hours later a detainee smashed the perspex side of some telephone booths with his clenched fist and his head.  Mr Dadash pulled him away.  
12Another detainee who was on the roof called out, ""Fuck you, fuck immigration. I want to speak with the media. I want to talk about the way we're being treated.""  Another detainee on the roof called out, ""I want to see DIAC.  If I don't see DIAC I'll throw myself off the roof. I'll kill myself.""   (I take ""DIAC"" to be a reference to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship).  This detainee then threatened to hang himself if he wasn't provided with cigarettes. 
13Mr Dadash and another detainee approached a staff member wanting to know why they were not being given cigarettes and why DIAC was taking so long to process their visa applications. 
14By about 11pm, detainees on the roof started gathering roof tiles and putting them in a pile.  There were verbal exchanges between those on the roof and the others on the ground, including ""Fuck Serco"" and ""Freedom"".  Tiles were thrown at staff members, some of them making contact.  The scene was quite chaotic by this stage.
15Some of the detainees, including Mr Dadash, took up fire extinguishers and sprayed them around on the soccer field.  Other detainees were cheering. Mr Dadash sprayed the contents of the fire extinguishers in the direction of staff and he and another detainee were heard to say, ""Fuck you. Fuck you up the arse. Fuck immigration.""  As the extinguishers were emptied they were thrown to the ground or in the direction of staff members.
16Then, Mr Dadash and another detainee were seen pulling a chain which secured wheelie bins to a wall.  They did this until the bricks broke.  They and others then moved the wheelie bins to the soccer field, emptied them of their contents and put the rubbish in a pile.  Somebody then set the pile alight.
17Mr Dadash was not seen to be involved in any of the subsequent events.  Those included buildings being broken into and various fires being set.  Tiles continued to be thrown by those on the roof at staff, police and fire brigade officers. Detainees not involved in the events, as well as staff, were evacuated from the affected areas.  By the early hours of the next morning a number of buildings were destroyed by fire.  The estimated cost of restoring the facility is in the order of $9 million.
18Mr Dadash was removed from Villawood on 22 April 2011 and taken to the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre at Silverwater.  He was charged for his involvement in the incident on 4 May 2011 and was refused bail.  On 5 April 2012 he was granted bail and returned to Villawood.  He has remained in immigration detention since.
19Mr Dadash gave extensive evidence at the sentence hearing which included him recounting his involvement in the events of 20 April 2011.  It became clear in the course of the prosecutor's cross-examination that he was downplaying his role and attempting to justify it, as he had in his account to the author of a psychological report, Dr Peter Ashkar.  For example, he claimed that his actions were prompted by concern that those on the roof might commit suicide and he vehemently denied swearing at staff members.  The statement of facts, which was tendered without objection, provides an account that is inconsistent with such claims. 
Seriousness of the offence
20The involvement of Mr Dadash in the events includes that he remonstrated with staff members who were endeavouring to restore order; he was involved in emptying fire extinguishers which, whether he intended it or not, inhibited the ability of staff to deal with fires that were set; he threw empty fire extinguishers either at the ground or at staff members; and he was involved in stockpiling rubbish on the soccer field that was then set alight.  This activity constitutes the use or threatened use of unlawful violence towards other people and it is certainly activity that would ""cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety"".  The seriousness of his offence must be assessed in the context of the surrounding events.  I infer that by involving himself in the events, Mr Dadash, implicitly at least, encouraged the involvement of others.  It is not apparent whether the actions of the detainees were planned and I am prepared to accept that his involvement was not premeditated.  Another matter that is relevant to the seriousness of the offence is that many people would have been terrified by what occurred and their safety was put at risk.  They include members of staff, targeted because of their occupation, as well as other innocent detainees.  Fortunately, no-one was physically injured.
21An affray can occur in infinitely varied circumstances but it is clear that this one was particularly nasty.  I am satisfied that only a sentence of full-time imprisonment is appropriate to meet the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1900 (NSW) of punishment, deterrence, denunciation, and making Mr Dadash accountable for his actions. 
Mitigating factors
22Notwithstanding what I have just said, there are a number of factors which warrant some amelioration of the sentence to be imposed.  Mr Dadash has pleaded guilty and that must be taken into account in his favour.  The plea was first offered some six months after he was committed for trial, before arraignment (which had been deferred at his request), and after a trial date had been fixed.  I heard competing submissions as to the extent to which this should moderate the sentence.  Having considered those submissions, I propose to reduce the sentence from what I otherwise would have imposed by 12.5 per cent.
23Mr Dadash is 28 years of age and he has no previous convictions.  There is also evidence of prior good character to the extent that it appears that when in his home country he worked and supported his family.  
24I do not accept that he is genuinely remorseful.  He has said that he is sorry, but that is the extent of it; there has been no acknowledgment of the impact that his involvement in the protest had upon staff and other detainees.  Saying sorry does not equate to an acceptance of responsibility, particularly when Mr Dadash has sought to minimise and justify his actions.
25Although there has been no psychiatric diagnosis, Mr Dadash was found by Dr Ashkar to exhibit the signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.  This appears to relate to his experience of having seen the bodies of some detainees in Villawood who had committed suicide.   It was suggested in the evidence Mr Dadash gave at the sentence hearing, and in submissions, that this condition was causally related to his offending behaviour.  Dr Ashkar appears to have been of this opinion.  
26I do not accept that.  In relation to Dr Ashkar's view, it would seem that he relied solely upon the version of events provided to him by Mr Dadash and did not have before him the somewhat different version set out in the undisputed statement of facts.  He also appears to have been influenced by a perception that Mr Dadash had actually witnessed detainees committing suicide, as opposed to having subsequently seen the bodies of such persons.  I do accept that Mr Dadash's involvement in the events of 20 April 2011 was motivated by anger and frustration at having been held so long in immigration detention.  His involvement was also influenced by the actions of his fellow detainees.  I am not satisfied that he was in any way a leader; he followed the lead of others.  
27Aside from the possibility of experiencing post-traumatic stress, there are signs of significant levels of depression and anxiety. I am not persuaded that there should be any moderation of the extent to which general deterrence is factored into the assessment of sentence.  But I do accept that incarceration for Mr Dadash is more onerous than for others on account of his mental state.  Undoubtedly being kept in detention so far from his family and loved ones is a substantial cause of this.  Apparently his wife's family have pressured her to end her relationship with him due to his imprisonment; she has not done so but the possibility that she might is a source of additional anxiety for him.  He has regular telephone and internet contact with her but there was no suggestion that he receives visits from any friends or family as prisoners generally enjoy.  I also take into account the evidence given by Mr Dadash about his experience in gaol when he was bail refused.  He said, in effect, that he found the experience quite terrifying; he was abused and was scared for his safety and, for part of the time, was held in protection.  His opportunities for contact with his wife were severely limited as well.
28Mr Dadash spent almost a year in corrective services custody before he was returned to immigration detention.  I am satisfied, however, that his detention since being returned is referrable to the fact that he was charged with offences arising from the events of 20 April 2011 at Villawood. He had applied to be returned to his home country but the Australian Federal Police advised DIAC that this would be inappropriate whilst the charges were outstanding.  As a consequence, I am prepared to accept that the entire period from 22 April 2011 until now should be taken into account as pre-sentence custody and the sentence I impose will be backdated to then. 
29The offender was committed for trial for offences of riot and affray.  The Crown has now accepted the plea of guilty to affray in full satisfaction of the indictment.  It was submitted that I should take into account the theoretical possibility that an offence of affray can be dealt with summarily in the Local Court, where the most that can be imposed is a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years.  That does not mean I am limited to such a sentencing range but is a matter of some weight.
30It was submitted, albeit faintly, that there should be a finding of special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  Those circumstances were said to be that it was the offender's first time in custody, his isolation in an Australian prison, prior good character and his mental condition.  I have considered the matter, and as sentencing principles require, have excluded consideration of the fact that Mr Dadash is liable to deportation.  I am not persuaded that such a finding should be made.
Sentence
31Convicted.
32Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 5 months.  The sentence is to date from 22 April 2011.  The offender is to be released upon parole forthwith, the parole period having commenced on 22 August 2012.  The total term of the sentence expires on 21 January 2013.
33That is a total term of 1 year 9 months.  If not for the plea of guilty it would have been one of 2 years.

		07 December 2012",2012-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760610,ACP v Munro [2012] NSWSC 1510,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 20 April 2012, a Magistrate made an order authorising three forensic procedures against the plaintiff. He has appealed against that order, pursuant to s 115A of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (""the Act""). In the alternative, and to the extent necessary, he seeks prerogative relief with regard to that order, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. 

2The second defendant entered a submitting appearance. The plaintiff in this Court was the defendant in the Local Court. The first defendant in this Court was the prosecutor in the Local Court. For ease of comprehension, I will refer to them henceforth in accordance with the roles they played in the Local Court. 

3It was agreed between the parties that s 43 of the Act applies to these proceedings. Accordingly, I have anonymised references to the defendant. 

4The proceedings raise a difficult question of statutory construction as to which investigative processes fall within the definition of ""non-intimate forensic procedure"" in s 3 of the Act.

Chronological background

5On 29 July 2010, a girl complained that she had been indecently assaulted on a train station. 

6On 30 July 2010, two other girls complained that they had also been indecently assaulted on a second train station that was near the first. 

7The police obtained CCTV footage of the commission of two of the offences. 

8On 2 August 2010, the police showed the CCTV footage to the manager of a shop. She identified the person depicted in the footage as being the defendant. 

9There was also some circumstantial evidence that supported the proposition that the defendant was the offender. 

10The defendant was charged with three offences of indecent assault on 2 August 2010. He was not photographed pursuant to the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (""LEPRA"") at that stage, seemingly by oversight. 

11On 24 September 2010, Stapleton LCM, sitting in the Local Court at Hornsby, made an order for a forensic procedure. That order permitted the taking of a photograph of the face of the defendant from the front and sides. At that stage the evidence from the manager was not placed before the Court. The only evidence upon which the prosecutor relied in support of the application was an affidavit sworn by the prosecutor on 10 September 2010, which set out the grounds upon which the prosecutor believed the defendant was the offender without any reference to corroborative material. 

12The defendant appealed to this Court against that order. On 27 January 2011, Pembroke J allowed that appeal with the consent of the prosecutor. 

13The matter returned to the Local Court. On 18 April 2011, George LCM refused to permit an application for an identical order to proceed. At that stage, the prosecutor relied upon evidence that had not previously been placed before the Court. That evidence was significantly more detailed and comprised of a six page affidavit sworn by the prosecutor on 4 February 2011. Attached to that affidavit were 29 annexures. It is unnecessary to detail the precise contents of that affidavit and its annexures; it is sufficient to note that the annexures contained statements from civilians including the shopkeeper and complainants, and a number of still photographs extracted from the CCTV footage. 

14The prosecutor appealed to this Court against that refusal. On 22 February 2012, R A Hulme J upheld that appeal: see Munro v ACP [2012] NSWSC 100. 

15The matter returned to the Local Court again. On 20 April 2012, the prosecution sought an order for three forensic procedures. The first was identical to the procedure sought previously, and described by me above. The second and third procedures were new. With regard to the application for the second and third procedures, the prosecution relied on new evidence. That evidence was a further affidavit sworn by the prosecutor on 27 March 2012 and also a statement of Professor Fryer of 27 March 2012. The affidavit also went to whether the prosecutor should be permitted to make a further application for the first procedure. 

16On 20 April 2012, Kok LCM granted the application and made the order sought by the prosecutor in the application. The application that was granted by her Honour was as follows: 

""A final order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure(s) on the [defendant] pursuant to section 24 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000.

The type of forensic procedure sought in relation this application [sic] is as follows:

1. The taking of a photograph of the [defendant's] face (front and sides)
2. The taking of a number of non intimate photographs of the [defendant's] body and body parts (Face / arms / legs)
3. The taking of measurements of the [defendant's body] and body parts (Entire body / arms / legs / torso)"".

17The application provided the following particulars with regard to the second and third procedures:

""With respect to the third procedure, the [prosecutor] seeks a final order authorising the taking of bodily measurements of the [defendant's] body and body parts, specifically:

1. Overall height (with and without shoes)
2. Length of each arm (top of shoulders to wrist and arm pit [sic] to wrist). 
3. Length of each leg. (hip to ankle, knee to ankle)
4. Length of each hand (wrist to fingertip on middle finger)
5. Length of each foot (with and without shoes)
6. Width of shoulders (between top of shoulders)

With respect to the second procedure, the [prosecutor] seeks a final order authorising the taking of a number of non-intimate photographs of the [defendant's] body and body parts for the purposes of recording each bodily measurement sought as part of the third procedure."" 

18It is worth repeating that the first procedure was the one that was originally sought, and the subject of two appeals to this Court by the time it came before her Honour on 20 April 2012. The second and third procedures were fresh applications.

19In short, the first procedure that was authorised was the taking of photographs of the face of the defendant. The second procedure that was authorised was the photographing of the third procedure. The third procedure that was authorised was the taking of various measurements of the defendant. 

Relief sought

20After the making of the order authorising the three procedures, a summons was filed by the defendant pursuant to s 115A of the Act on 20 April 2012. That section is as follows: 

""115A Appeals from forensic procedure orders made by Magistrate

(1) An appeal against an order made by a Magistrate under this Act authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a person may be made to the Supreme Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 as if the order were a sentence arising from a court attendance notice dealt with under Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(2) An appeal against a Magistrate's refusal to make an order under this Act authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a person may be made to the Supreme Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 as if the refusal were an order dismissing a matter under Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(3) The Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 applies to an appeal arising under this section with such modifications as are made by or in accordance with the regulations under that Act.""

21It was not disputed between the parties that that section leads one to ss 52 to 55 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, which are contained in Division 1 of Part 5 of that Act. Those sections are as follows: 

""52 Appeals as of right

(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.

(2) An appeal must be made within such period after the date of the conviction or sentence as may be prescribed by rules of court.


53 Appeals requiring leave

(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves: 

(a) a question of fact, or
(b) a question of mixed law and fact,

but only by leave of the Supreme Court.

...

(4) An application for leave to appeal must be made within such period after the date of the conviction, sentence or order as may be prescribed by rules of court.


54 Determination of applications for leave to appeal

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for leave to appeal by dismissing the application or by granting leave to appeal.

...

(3) If the Supreme Court dismisses an application for leave to appeal, it may make such order as to the costs to be paid by the appellant as it thinks just.

(4) If the Supreme Court grants leave to appeal, it may proceed to hear the appeal immediately or it may adjourn the appeal proceedings.


55 Determination of appeals

...

(2) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against sentence: 

(a) by setting aside the sentence, or
(b) by varying the sentence, or
(c) by setting aside the sentence and remitting the matter to the Local Court sitting at the place at which the original Local Court proceedings were held for redetermination, in relation to sentence, in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions, or
(d) by dismissing the appeal.

...""

22It is not disputed that, in short, in order to succeed on the statutory appeal, the defendant needs to demonstrate an error of law, or obtain leave and demonstrate an error of mixed law and fact. 

23The relief sought by the defendant underwent a process of evolution, culminating in a second further amended summons of 26 July 2012. In quoting from that document, I shall not alter the description of the parties that I have adopted throughout the rest of this judgment. In that document the following orders were sought:

The application under appeal

24In order to understand the orders sought by the defendant, it is necessary for me to give a little more detail about the proceedings before her Honour.

25It will be recalled that an order authorising the first procedure had been sought by the prosecutor twice before. That called for consideration by her Honour of the test in s 26(3) of the Act. That section is as follows: 

""If a Magistrate refuses an application for an order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect, the authorised applicant (or any other person aware of the application) may not make a further application to carry out the same forensic procedure on the suspect unless he or she provides additional information that justifies the making of the further application.""

26With regard to the first procedure, the defendant submitted in the Local Court that that test had not been made out. The Magistrate rejected that submission. That rejection founds the first challenge to the first procedure. 

27With regard to the second and third procedures, as I have indicated, the prosecutor relied upon a report of a Professor Fryer of 27 March 2012. To summarise its contents with great succinctness, the Professor expressed the opinion that measurements and photographs of the defendant could usefully be compared with stills of the offender derived from the CCTV footage. 

28In the Local Court, the defendant applied to cross-examine Professor Fryer. That application was made pursuant to ss 30(6) and 30(7) of the Act. Those provisions are as follows:

""(6) The suspect or his or her representative:

(a) may cross-examine the applicant for the order, and
(b) may, with the leave of the Magistrate, call or cross-examine any other witness, and
(c) may address the Magistrate.

(7) A Magistrate must not give leave under subsection (6) (b) unless the Magistrate is of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should be called or cross-examined.""

29The Magistrate rejected that application, and that rejection founds the first challenge to the second and third procedures. 

30In response to the evidence of Professor Fryer, the defendant sought to tender a report of 15 April 2012 from Dr Kemp. Again, to summarise its effect with great succinctness, the defendant sought thereby to reduce the probative value of the contents of the report of Professor Fryer. The operative statutory provisions were those that I have referred to above. 

31The Magistrate rejected that application, and that rejection constitutes the second challenge to the second and third procedures.

32Having determined those questions with regard to the three procedures, her Honour turned to the test in s 24 of the Act. That section in its entirety is as follows: 

""24 Final order for carrying out forensic procedure

(1) A Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities:

(a) that the circumstances referred to in subsection (2) or (3) exist, and
(b) that the carrying out of such a procedure is justified in all the circumstances.

(2) In the case of an intimate forensic procedure:

(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed a prescribed offence, and
(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).

(3) In the case of a non-intimate forensic procedure:

(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, and
(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).

(4) In determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, the Magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect's physical integrity, having regard to the following:

(a) the gravity of the alleged offence,
(b) the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed,
(c) the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence,
(d) the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known,
(e) in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person,
(f) such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive,
(g) such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned,
(h) in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section,
(i) such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests.""

33Her Honour rejected the submission of the defendant that the test had not been made out. That rejection founds a challenge to all three procedures. 

34Finally, the defendant made a submission in this Court that had not been made to her Honour. He submitted that the third procedure does not fit within the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure contained in the Act. That definition is as follows:

""3 Interpretation

(1) Definitions
In this Act:

...

non-intimate forensic procedure means any of the following: 

(a) an external examination of a part of a person's body, other than the person's private parts, that requires touching of the body or removal of clothing,
(b) the carrying out on a person of a self-administered buccal swab,
(c) the taking from a person of a sample of the person's hair, other than pubic hair,
(d) the taking from a person of a sample (such as a nail clipping) of the person's nails or of matter from under the person's nails,
(e) the taking from a person of a sample of any matter, by swab or washing, from any external part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(f) the taking from a person of a sample of any matter, by vacuum suction, scraping or lifting by tape, from any external part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(g) the taking from a person of the person's hand print, finger print, foot print or toe print,
(h) the taking of a photograph of a part of a person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(i) the taking from a person of an impression or cast of a wound from a part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(j) the taking of a person's physical measurements (whether or not involving marking) for biomechanical analysis of an external part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts.

...""

35If that is the case, he submits, then the third procedure cannot stand. Because the second procedure is merely one that permits the taking of photographs of the third procedure, he submits that the second procedure cannot stand either. That constitutes a further challenge to the second and third procedures.

36Although that submission was not made to her Honour, that was because the defendant was unaware of a very recent decision of this Court with regard to the topic. In the circumstances, the prosecutor did not submit that I should not consider that ground. 

37To summarise, the defendant impugns the order authorising the three procedures in a number of ways. He impugns the first procedure on the basis that her Honour applied a wrong test in permitting a further application, pursuant to s 26(3) of the Act. He impugns the second and third procedures on the basis that her Honour applied a wrong test in refusing to grant leave to the defendant to cross-examine Professor Fryer, pursuant to ss 30(6) and 30(7) of the Act. The second and third procedures are also impugned on the basis that her Honour applied a wrong test in refusing the defendant leave to call Dr Kemp, pursuant to the same provisions. He impugns all three procedures on the basis that her Honour applied a wrong test in determining whether to make final orders, pursuant to s 24 of the Act. Finally, he impugns the second and third procedures on the basis that, in truth, the Act does not permit such procedures because they do not fall within the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure contained in s 3 of the Act.

38It is convenient to deal with the last issue first. 

Second and third procedures outside definition?

Submissions

39There was no dispute between the parties that none of the procedures ordered were intimate forensic procedures as defined by the Act. If they were anything, they were non-intimate forensic procedures. 

40The submission of the defendant was a simple one. He submitted that the taking of measurements of his height and of parts of his body, as described in the third procedure, did not fit within the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure contained in s 3 of the Act. He submitted that the only paragraphs of that definition within which those procedures could conceivably fit are (a) and (j). 

41As for (j), he submitted that there was no evidence that the measurements were undertaken ""for biomechanical analysis"". He submitted that the report of Professor Fryer demonstrated that what was proposed to be undertaken was a comparison of still photographs of the defendant with still photographs of the offender derived from the CCTV footage. He submitted that because biomechanics is ""the study of mechanical movements of biological organisms"" (to quote from the Macquarie Dictionary), what was proposed does not fall within (j).

42Turning to (a), the defendant submitted that taking measurements of the body of a person is not ""an external examination of a part of person's body"". He referred to the recent decision of Fullerton J in Coffen v Goodhart [2013] NSWSC 1018. He also submitted that none of the measurements proposed in the third order would require ""the touching of the body or removal of clothing"" of the defendant. Accordingly, he submitted that the second and the third procedure did not fall within (a) either. 

43He submitted that the second and third procedures did not fall within any other paragraph under the definition of non-intimate forensic procedure. Accordingly, he submitted that they were not non-intimate forensic procedures. Nor were they intimate forensic procedures as defined. Therefore, he submitted, the Magistrate had no power to order them, and they should be quashed. 

44When I queried during submissions whether such a result could be anomalous, the defendant pointed to the nature of the Act as a whole. Constituting as it does an invasion of the person of citizens, the defendant submitted that it must be construed strictly, in accordance with well-established principles of statutory construction. 

45The defendant dealt with the degree to which the decision of Fullerton J binds me. He submitted that single judges of this Court constitute an intermediate appellate court from decisions of magistrates with regard to orders for forensic procedures. He submitted that not only was I bound by the usual principles of comity, but also by the principles that would attach to the consideration by an intermediate appellate court of its previous decisions. He relied upon the discussion by Heydon J in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462. 

46In short, the defendant submitted that I should follow the decision of Fullerton J unless convinced that it is clearly wrong; that the reasoning in that judgment demonstrates that what is proposed here does not fall within any paragraph of the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure; that the Magistrate had no power to make the order with regard to the second and third procedures; and that therefore the parts of the order authorising the second and third procedures should be quashed. 

47The prosecutor accepted that the second and third procedures did not fall within the definition of an intimate forensic procedure. However, it was submitted that they did fall within the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure. 

48With regard to (j), it was accepted that there was no evidence before the Local Court that the measurements were to be undertaken for the purpose of biomechanical analysis. It was also accepted that that kind of analysis must involve some consideration of movement.

49However, the prosecutor submitted that the second and third procedures fall within (a). It was submitted that the facts of Coffen v Goodhart could be distinguished. In that case, it was submitted, what was proposed was merely to measure the height of the defendant. Here, of course, what is proposed is to measure not only the height, but also a number of distances between aspects of parts of the body of the defendant. The prosecutor submitted that, in truth, what was being proposed in the second and third procedures was an external examination of a part of a person's body. It was submitted that the taking of a number of measurements, considered as a whole, could constitute ""an external examination"". The prosecutor submitted that such a process fell within (a). 

50Reliance was also placed upon the judgment of Bell J in Dickson v Commissioner of Police [1999] NSWSC 1100; (1999) 48 NSWLR 156. I will turn to a detailed analysis of the judgment in that case in my determination. 

51The prosecutor also submitted that I should follow the obiter dicta of Fullerton J and ""read into the requirement that the examination under consideration involves touching of the body or removal of clothing, the words 'if necessary'.""

52In short, the prosecutor submitted that the decision of Fullerton J could be distinguished on the facts, at least with regard to particulars (b) - (f) of the third procedure; that the proposed procedures were an ""external examination of part of a person's body""; that removal of ""clothes"" was not essential; that therefore the vast bulk of the third procedure fell within the definition in (a); and that therefore, except for so much of the order as authorises particular (a) of the third procedure, the order should not be quashed. 

Determination

53It is convenient to consider first what was decided in Coffen v Goodhart. The proceedings were an appeal against an order of a magistrate authorising the taking of a measurement of the height of a defendant. The issue was whether such a procedure fell within the definition of a non-forensic intimate procedure. Fullerton J said at [9]:

""I am unable to see how the measurement of a person's height (from the heel of the foot to the crown of the head) can be sensibly understood as involving 'an ... examination of a part of a person's body"". (original emphasis) 

54Furthermore, her Honour said at [9]: 

""I also consider that it impermissibly strains the language of the section for the measurement of a person's height to be characterised as an 'external examination'. The Macquarie dictionary defines 'examination' to include an inquiry, inspection or investigation. The taking of a measurement is not an examination of the body in either of these senses but an assessment or a calculation against a metric standard.""

55In remarks that were obiter dicta, her Honour said at [10]:

""[I]n my view it would do no damage to the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure in (a) of s 3(1) to read into the requirement that the examination under consideration involves touching of the body or removal of clothing, the words 'if necessary'. Self-evidently, if a person presented for a compulsory height measurement barefoot (and without a hat or perhaps a hooded sweater) there would be no need for clothing to be removed for a height measurement to be taken. Simply because a person may present barefoot and bare headed at a police station under compulsion of an order under the Act that their height be measured would not deprive a magistrate of reliance on (a) of s 3(1) assuming it was otherwise open, which in my view it is not.""

56The first step is to determine the degree to which I am bound by those decisions of her Honour. I accept the submission of the defendant about the binding nature of the decision of Fullerton J upon me. Quite apart from considerations of comity between single judges of the same Court, I agree that it would be very undesirable for the determination of appeals from orders of magistrates authorising forensic procedures to depend upon the capricious question of which judge of this Court happens to have the matter listed before him or her. I consider that I should follow the two determinative remarks that Fullerton J made in Coffen v Goodhart, unless I am affirmatively satisfied that either of them is clearly wrong. As for the obiter dicta of her Honour, I consider that I should give those great weight as well, in the circumstances. 

57Applying the first determination of her Honour to the facts of this matter, it follows that particular (a) of the third procedure cannot stand. I respectfully agree with her Honour that it is impossible to construe a measurement of the overall height of the defendant, whether with or without shoes, as ""an external examination of a part of a person's body"". The height of a person is an attribute of the person, not a part of his or her body. 

58As for the rest of the third procedure, I am respectfully unsure whether I agree with the entirety of the portion of the judgment of Fullerton J that I have quoted from [9]. In particular, to the extent that the last two sentences appear to be speaking of measurements in general and not merely the measurement of the height of a person, I consider that alternative views could be held. It could be said that, at least in some circumstances, a measurement of a part of the body of a person could be an external examination of a part of the body of that person. For example, the measurement by a doctor of the width of a possibly pre-cancerous mole on a person's skin could perhaps be characterised as an ""external examination"" of a part of the body of that person. 

59However, I am not satisfied that the reasoning of her Honour is clearly wrong. It follows that I should apply the second proposition that I have extracted to this case. 

60Each of the particulars of the third order other than (a) envisages a measurement of a part of the body of the defendant. They do not envisage, for example, 15 measurements of the left hand of the defendant that could, in their combined effect, be said to constitute ""an external examination of a part"" of the body of the defendant. What is proposed is, rather, a single measurement of a number of individual parts of the body of the defendant. It follows that I reject the submission of the prosecutor that the various measurements compendiously add up to an external examination of a part of the body of the defendant. 

61Applying the second binding proposition of Fullerton J, what is encompassed by the third order in paragraphs (b) - (f) are not external examinations. They are measurements of parts of the body of the defendant, and not external examinations of those parts of his body. It follows that, subject to any illumination of the question provided by the decision in Dickson v Commissioner of Police, the appeal with regard to the second procedure and the third procedure should be allowed. 

62In Dickson v Commissioner of Police, Bell J was called upon to construe s 353A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 as it then was. The subsection has been substantively, but not identically, reproduced in s 138 of LEPRA. In that case, Bell J determined that an examination for the purposes of the subsection was not limited to being a medical examination. Her Honour also applied New South Wales authority, as opposed to contrary South Australian authority, to the effect that such an examination should be limited to an examination ""by eye and touch"". Her Honour therefore rejected the proposition that such an examination could include that taking of a blood sample. Finally, her Honour was of the opinion that the subsection did not permit the placing of ink dots on the person of a defendant in order to assist with a biomechanical analysis.

63The decision in Dickson v Commissioner of Police was an exercise in statutory construction with regard to a different section in a different piece of legislation. Although it was helpful to have been referred to it, I do not find it determinative in this matter.

64It follows that the appeal against the part of the order authorising the second and third procedures will be upheld. 

65Although it is not necessary to determine the question in these proceedings, I also find the obiter dicta of Fullerton J persuasive. In other words, even accepting the strictness with which one should interpret a provision of the kind under consideration, I consider that it is appropriate to import into the very end of (a) of the definition, the phrase ""if necessary"". Not to do so would permit any defendant to defeat an application for such a procedure (that does not require touching of the body) by informing the magistrate that he or she proposes to attend for any such procedure completely naked. It is one thing to interpret such a provision strictly; it is another to interpret it in such a way as to give rise to absurdity: see Broken Hill South Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) [1937] HCA 4; (1937) 56 CLR 337 at 371. 

66It might be thought that the result that I consider appropriate is anomalous, in that only precisely defined examinations or measurements of the bodies of defendants will be permitted, pursuant to (a) and (j) of the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure. For example, it is an odd result that (j) permits the taking of measurements for the purpose of biomechanical analysis but not for other purposes, even though the latter may produce relevant evidence, perhaps more probative than any produced by biomechanical analysis. But so much flows from the decision of Parliament to define with precision the kinds of procedures that will fall within the definition of a non-intimate forensic procedure. It may be the case that, after 12 years of the operation of the Act, Parliament should reconsider whether the definitions of non-intimate forensic procedures remain appropriate.

67Because of my disposition of this challenge to the second and third procedures, it is not strictly necessary for me to deal with the other challenges to the order insofar as it authorises those procedures. However, as against the possibility that I am wrong with regard to the challenge currently under consideration, I shall deal with all of the submissions of the defendant in this Court. I shall consider them not in the order in which they were dealt with in the Local Court, but rather in an order that assists their logical disposition by me. 

Further application justified?

68I turn to consider the challenge made to the first procedure alone that is founded upon s 26(3) of the Act. 

69It is convenient to set out the ex tempore judgment of the Magistrate in full at this stage:

""Yes, unfortunately, that may not be the end of the it [sic] whatever I do, however, there are indeed prior proceedings and there was in fact a series of errors on the part of the prosecution in making the initial application and in the procedures that were undertaken prior to that and it is against that background obviously that these matters have to be considered and also they were very relevant to the fate initially of this second application I think and the question of whether there was in fact substantial additional information which could be the basis of a subsequent application in relation at least to the first aspect of this application.

I have considered very carefully the material that is set out largely in the prosecutor's submissions and I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence that has been put before the Court and the material that I am not precluded from considering a further application notwithstanding those errors which occurred and that it is obviously a balancing exercise which involves not only a consideration of those errors and whether the Crown should be precluded from moving forward because of that conduct and legally that is not absolutely the case but as a matter of discretion it is something which needs to be taken into account very carefully when a person's rights particularly those long held rights against self incrimination are to be disturbed.

I am satisfied that there has been substantial additional information contained in this application and that notwithstanding the fact that at least part of it was available at the time of the first application that should not be a bar and that in the interests generally of properly discharging this application I should allow the application to come forward. That substantial additional information in relation to the first part I think is available. I don't propose to go through all of the details of it but it has been set out in the list in the submission from the prosecution and I will be happy for that to remain on the court papers as part of this determination.

I THEREFORE FIND THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS DISCHARGED THE ONUS IN RELATION TO 26(3).""

Submissions

70The defendant submitted that the Magistrate had applied a wrong test. In particular, he submitted that, in determining whether or not there was additional information that justified the making of the further application, her Honour had not taken into account the fact that the defendant was being ""vexed twice"" (or rather, thrice). It was submitted that the Magistrate should have given explicit consideration to concepts that could very broadly be described as ""double jeopardy"". Accordingly, it was submitted, the order, insofar as it authorises the first procedure, should be quashed.

71The prosecutor submitted that the statutory test is simply what appears in the subsection. It is not to be glossed or elaborated by concepts such as double jeopardy developed in other contexts. The prosecutor submitted that the only judicial consideration of that test is to be found in the judgment of Munro v ACP. She submitted that nothing said by the Magistrate was inconsistent with what R A Hulme J had said in that decision of this Court. The ancillary position of the prosecutor was that, even if double jeopardy and related concepts did require explicit consideration, the fact is that they indeed appear in the judgment. Therefore, it was submitted, the proposition that the Magistrate applied a wrong test should be rejected. 

Determination

72It is not disputed between the parties that the decision of the Magistrate with regard to this threshold question was preceded by very detailed and competent oral and written submissions by both the solicitor then appearing for the prosecutor and the solicitor then appearing for the defendant. To my mind, it is inconceivable that the Magistrate was unaware of the statutory test that fell for consideration pursuant to s 26(3). 

73Furthermore, I am not persuaded that considerations of double jeopardy fall for separate consideration under the subsection. The structure of the subsection is that a further application may not be made (let alone granted) unless a particular precondition is made out. That precondition is a satisfaction on the part of the Magistrate that the additional information provided by a prosecutor justifies the making of the application. The word ""justifies"" connotes a concept of the balancing of competing considerations, in light of the fact that the primary definition given in the Macquarie Dictionary of the word ""justify"" is ""to show (an act, claim, statement, etc.) to be just, right, or warranted"". It is true that that process should include a consideration of the number of previous applications and their surrounding circumstances, in determining whether the test has been made out. To that extent, I agree that the subsection calls for reflection on the degree to which a defendant has been ""vexed"". But nothing in the subsection, nor in the judgment of R A Hulme J, calls for an explicit, detailed discussion of the principle compendiously known as double jeopardy. It follows that I reject the primary submission of the defendant. 

74Even if I am wrong about that proposition, I consider that a fair reading of the reasons of her Honour demonstrates that the fact that there had been repeated applications that were the subject of repeated appellate review was indeed taken into account by her Honour. I refer in particular to the first paragraph of the judgment extracted above. 

75This was an interlocutory threshold ruling that did not determine guilt, made by a Magistrate in oral ex tempore reasons. If this Court trawled through such reasons with a fine-tooth comb, the criminal justice system would grind to a halt. One can imagine the effect it would have on that system if, for example, every time a judicial officer made a determination as to bail, he or she was required to state the regime of presumptions being applied pursuant to ss 9 to 9D of the Bail Act 1978, or the multitude of mandatory criteria being applied to the question pursuant to s 32 of the same Act. 

76There are very many cases to the effect that such judgments have to be approached in a practical way: see, for example, Maviglia v Maviglia [1999] NSWCA 188 at [1]; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343; (2006) 67 NSWLR 402 at [15]; Munro v ACP [2012] NSWSC 100 at [21]; and Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [2012] NSWSC 281 at [18]. Adopting such an approach, I consider that the judgment, especially considered in light of the ample submissions that preceded it, does not demonstrate that the Magistrate applied a wrong test to this question. 

77I perceive no error of law. Therefore, I do not propose to quash the first procedure on this basis, whether by way of appeal or prerogative relief. 

Cross-examination of a prosecution witness?

78I turn next to the interlocutory question determined by her Honour as to whether the prosecution witness Professor Fryer should have been made available for cross-examination by the defendant as part of the determination of the application for the second procedure and the third procedure. As can be seen from the extract of s 30 of the Act that I have provided, it was incumbent upon the Magistrate not to grant leave to the defendant to undertake such cross-examination unless her Honour was affirmatively satisfied by the defendant that there were ""substantial reasons why in the interests of justice"" that should be done. 

79I set out the judgment of her Honour:

""HER HONOUR: ... I have looked very carefully at what is purported to be said in the claims by Emeritus Professor Fryer and what is indicated he would undertake. It is a fairly narrowly defined process using photogrammetry and using that for the purpose of analysing in a mathematical methodology the information which might be derived from the available CCTV and then subsequently compared with the information which might be provided then by virtue of this application. It does seem to me that on the face of it, what he is suggesting he would be doing is somewhat mechanical activity and I do not think that it is something which would be illuminated a lot more by cross examination in any event.

It is obviously something which if the outcome of his measurements were to be established in the way that he says could be of some usefulness in the process, I would not however think that it would assist the Court greatly were he to be cross examined. The matters which have been raised and I refer to the evidence of Dr Kemp which is not the subject of these proceedings but which I was obliged to read in any event, clearly indicates what might be issues which the defence might have wished to challenge him on if he eventually ever does the report he is proposing and it would be well for him and the prosecution to bear in mind those potential criticisms when he purports to either give the analysis or to draw any conclusions from it. But I think that that is something which is fairly obvious and which is not necessarily deficiency [sic] in the material which is put before the Court now, and I DO NOT PROPOSE TO ALLOW FURTHER TIME FOR THIS MATTER TO BE EXPANDED BY HIM BEING CROSS EXAMINED.""

Submissions

80The defendant submitted that the Magistrate had failed to apply the correct test. It was submitted that it was noteworthy that at no stage of the judgment do the precise words of the subsection, or indeed an approximation of them, appear. It was submitted that, to the extent that the judgment speaks of whether the evidence of Professor Fryer would be ""illuminated"" or whether there was ""deficiency"", the Magistrate had not considered whether there were substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should be cross-examined. It was also submitted that the discursive discussion at the end of the judgment about how weaknesses in the evidence of Professor Fryer should be approached in future demonstrated that the Magistrate was applying a wrong test. 

81The prosecutor submitted that the judgment of her Honour was preceded by lengthy and detailed oral and written submissions of both parties that invited her Honour to the correct test with great clarity. There was no dispute in the Local Court about the correct test to be applied. It was submitted that I am permitted to take the context of the judgment into account, and am not restricted to considering merely the words of the judgment itself in determining whether a wrong test has been applied. Reliance was placed upon Condor Asset Management Pty Ltd v Primestone Developments Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 708 at [60] - [62]; Sunter v District Court of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 313 at [35]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [2012] NSWSC 281 at [18] and O'Brien v Hutchinson [2012] NSWSC 429 at [14] in support of that proposition. The submissions of the prosecutor noted that the ground was not failure to supply adequate reasons, but rather the application of a wrong test. The prosecutor submitted that the defendant had not demonstrated in this Court that the Magistrate had applied a wrong test. 

Determination

82A number of factors argue against the submission of the defendant. First, the test to be applied by the Magistrate was a simple one, calling for consideration as it did of only two separate concepts. Secondly, the test has been a commonplace and well-known part of the criminal justice system since 1997, when it was adopted as a test that determined whether the bulk of prosecution witnesses should be required for cross-examination in committal proceedings. Thirdly, it is undeniable that the correct test was repeatedly brought to the attention of her Honour by both parties before her Honour delivered the judgment. 

83The proposition that I am permitted to consider the whole of the transcript of the matter, including the interchanges between the Bench and the Bar table and the written submissions received from both parties, is of significance in my determination.

84It is true that the judgment does not explicitly reflect the statutory test. But in light of the simplicity of the test; its important and longstanding role in the criminal justice system; and the repeated references to it by the parties, I consider it inconceivable that the Magistrate was not aware of the test that her Honour was required to apply to the question. My remarks with regard to the challenge to the first procedure founded upon s 26(3) are apposite here as well. 

85Nor do I consider that the discussions by her Honour in the judgment as to perceived limitations in the evidence of Professor Fryer, and the approaches that may need to be taken to it at some future stage of the proceedings, demonstrate that the Magistrate has applied a wrong test. 

86I am not persuaded that the Magistrate applied a wrong test. Accordingly, I do not propose to grant relief, whether by way of appeal or prerogative relief, with regard to the determination about whether Professor Fryer should be called as a witness. 

Receive evidence of a defence witness?

87As can be seen from the extract from s 30, the Magistrate was required to apply the same test with regard to the question of whether the defendant should be permitted to call Dr Kemp. The relevant judgment is as follows:

""No. Well I do not think it is necessary. I do not propose to allow it for a number of reasons but principally I have read the entirety of Morgan's case. I am satisfied that the issues that are sought to be raised in relation to Professor Kemp's evidence are not dissimilar to what his evidence might have been in that case but I do perceive there to some significant differences in the nature of the evidence that is proposed to be given by Professor Fryer as against that which was given by Henneburg in the Morgan case and I do not think that necessarily, retraversing the information which was before the Court there is going to be of a great deal of assistance to me. I certainly do agree that there are issues raised by the defence as to the possible usefulness and reliability of the evidence which is proposed to be provided by Professor Fryer if the application is successful and I think that anything to do with that can be the subject of submissions. I do not think it is necessary for you to go beyond making submissions on that basis. And I do not think I need any further evidence from Professor Kemp on those aspects of what or may not be useful or reliable or helpful. So I do not propose to allow him to be called.""

Submissions

88Again, the defendant submitted that a wrong test had been applied. He emphasised the reference to questions of necessity at the beginning and end of the judgment, and submitted that it was not incumbent upon the defendant to make out that it was necessary to receive the evidence of the defence witness. Similarly, he submitted that whether or not the evidence would be of ""a great deal of assistance"" to her Honour was not the appropriate test.

89The prosecutor repeated the submissions about the correct approach to be taken to ex tempore oral judgments of magistrates with regard to interlocutory matters. Again, it was submitted that the parties in the Local Court were in complete agreement about the applicable test, and had repeatedly drawn it to the attention of her Honour, including very shortly before the delivery of the judgment. 

Determination

90For the general reasons given by me above with regard to the question of calling Professor Fryer, I do not accept that the Magistrate applied a wrong test. I consider that, in light of the simplicity of the test, the fact that is well known, and the correct submissions of the parties, the Magistrate delivered the judgment founded on the assumption of the test, and sought to explain in that judgment why that test had not been made out. 

91It follows that I do not propose to provide relief of any kind founded upon this submission. 

Wrong test with regard to final order?

92At the end of the proceedings, the Magistrate was required to determine whether the test in s 24 had been made out by the prosecutor with regard to all three procedures. As can be seen from the structure of the section, that required a consideration of a number of subsidiary factors. The judgment of her Honour with regard to this question is as follows:

""In relation to each of the parts of the application then, I am satisfied that there is in the proposed work to be undertaken by Professor Fryer a work which is related directly to the material which has been provided in the evidence so far and that the evidence which has been available so far goes directly to the question of identification of the defendant and that this evidence, if allowed, would be likely to either induce a reasonable belief that he committed the offence or that he did not do so and I am satisfied accordingly that it goes to the heart of the evidence which is required. The evidence which is proposed to be adduced is said to be directly dependant upon measurements and the evidence so far in the statement of Professor Fryer is that he would be using well documented methodology and photogrammetry to establish physical sizes and relationships which can then be compared with the information which would be provided in relation to the defendant by the forensic procedures.

I am satisfied that the evidence in the statement sufficiently indicates that this would be a useful exercise either for the purpose of indicating the impossibility of the defendant in fact being the person of interest or, alternatively, the possibilities one somewhat remote that it could be established conclusively that he was or, more likely, that it could be established that the evidence shows that his identification through this means would be consistent with other evidence of a nature that is at this stage circumstantial.

In those circumstances and given the possibility that it could exonerate him but also the possibility that it could at least indicate the possibility of consistency with other police evidence, I am of the view that this evidence certainly is of the sort of usefulness provided it is subject to the constraints which have been discussed in these proceedings as to the manner in which the work by professor fryer [sic] is carried out that would have the usefulness which is set out in his report as to the provision of comparative dimensional evidence in relation to the person depicted on the CCTV and the defendant himself.

I am mindful of the extremely serious nature of the alleged offence and of the need to protect the interest of the defendant which are rights which should not be easily set aside but AT THIS STAGE I AM SATISFIED THAT THE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET AND THAT I SHOULD ALLOW THE PROCEDURE TO BE UNDERTAKEN.""

93In the proceedings before the Magistrate, the establishment of the contents of s 24(3)(a) were effectively conceded by the defendant. In other words, there was no real dispute that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant had committed an offence. The dispute was about s 24(1)(b) and s 24(3)(b).

Submissions

94The defendant submitted that the various tests required by the section had not been applied. It was submitted that the first part of the judgment did not explicitly refer to the concept of ""reasonable grounds to believe"" contained in s 24(3)(b). Again, it was submitted that the discursive discussion of possible ""constraints"" is suggestive of error. He also submitted that the discussion of the question of justification in all the circumstances, pursuant to s 24(1)(b), and as informed by the balancing test in the opening words of s 24(4) and the paragraphs that follow it, was so meagre as to lead to the conclusion that the proper test had not been applied. 

95The prosecutor submitted, as before, that the examination of the judgment of the Magistrate in these circumstances should not be unduly onerous or pernickety. Again it was submitted that the parties had correctly and repeatedly made submissions to her Honour founded upon the test that required consideration. The prosecutor submitted that the concluding words of the judgment demonstrated that there had been an explicit mention in the judgment of, at the least, ss 24(4)(a) and (c). It was submitted that the flavour of the last part of the judgment was consistent with a balancing test of the kind contained in s 24(4). 

Determination

96It can be seen that, pursuant to s 24 of the Act, the Magistrate had to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of three things before making any order for a non-intimate forensic procedure against the defendant. The first was that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant had committed an offence, pursuant to s 24(3)(a). The second was that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the defendant had committed that offence, pursuant to s 24(3)(b). The third was that the carrying out of the procedure was justified in all the circumstances, pursuant to s 24(1)(b). In determining the last question, the Magistrate was required to balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the defendant committed the alleged offence, as against the public interest in upholding his physical integrity. That was required pursuant to the chapeau of s 24(4). In undertaking that balancing exercise, the Magistrate was required to have regard to all of the factors enumerated in ss 24(4)(a)-(i).

97As noted above, the question of whether or not there were reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant had committed an offence was not an issue before her Honour. Therefore no explicit consideration of s 24(3)(a) was required. 

98A fair reading of the first three paragraphs of the judgment demonstrates to my mind that the Magistrate was engaging with the test contained in s 24(3)(b). 

99The fact that the Magistrate spoke of the future ""constraints which have been discussed in these proceedings"" does not persuade me that the Magistrate was applying a wrong test in that regard.

100It is true that the discussion of the contents of s 24(1)(b) and the balancing test and mandatory factors in s 24(4) is concise indeed. That attribute of the judgment has caused me concern. However, upon consideration, and again looking at the context of the voluminous and correct submissions as to the test to be applied, I am not persuaded that the Magistrate has applied a wrong test in this regard. Rather, I consider that the Magistrate has applied the correct test; but, because it was not the subject of dispute between the parties, has not enunciated it in the judgment.

101It follows that I do not propose to provide any kind of relief on this basis.

Proposed relief

102In short, for the reasons founded upon statutory interpretation, I propose to uphold the appeal with regard to the second procedure and the third procedure. I shall do so by ""setting aside"" the order insofar as it authorises them, to use the language of s 54(2)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. 

103I discern no legal error that could found an appeal or prerogative relief with regard to the first procedure. I shall simply dismiss the rest of the orders sought in the second further amended summons of the defendant. 

104As for costs, the defendant has succeeded with regard to a proportion of the order of the Local Court under attack. 

105I received detailed written submissions from the parties as to whether or not I have a power to order costs when an appeal pursuant to Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is upheld. The defendant submitted that, on various bases, I do. The prosecutor submitted that, in light of the absence of an explicit power in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, I do not, as a matter of statutory construction. It cannot be disputed that, although powers to order costs are provided with regard to other appeals in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, there is no such power created by statute with regard to the kind of appeal before me. 

106I considered this question in Cunningham v Cunningham (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 954. In that judgment I discussed the decision of White J in ASIC v Sigalla (No. 6) [2012] NSWSC 83, and came to the view that I do have a power to order costs in these circumstances. I shall not revisit everything I said in that judgment, except to say that it may be that the question of possible lacunae in the costs powers contained in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act deserves the consideration by Parliament. I maintain the opinion I expressed in Cunningham v Cunningham (No 2) that I have a power to order costs in an appeal such as this, despite the absence of an explicit statutory power to do so. 

107In light of his partial success in this Court, I propose to order that the defendant have 50 per cent of his costs in this Court. 

Consideration of general issue

108I have upheld a ground of appeal based upon a question of statutory construction that was, for good reasons, not brought to the attention of the learned Magistrate. I also do not propose to grant any relief with regard to those aspects of the proceedings that were, in truth, founded upon alleged deficiencies in the ex tempore oral judgments of her Honour. 

109With regard to the latter, I am aware from my own experience of the enormous volume of matters that are required to be dealt with in the Local Court, and the pace with which proceedings are conducted in that jurisdiction. I am also acutely aware of the fact that one should not, at leisure, criticise things done by other persons in imposed haste. 

110Having said that, a large proportion of these proceedings would have simply fallen away if the learned Magistrate at each stage of the inquiry that her Honour was conducting had referred explicitly, even if only in the briefest of terms, to the statutory tests that her Honour was required to consider. Despite their interlocutory nature, and the fact that they are not determinations of guilt or otherwise, I respectfully suggest that it would not be inappropriate for magistrates dealing with applications for forensic procedures to refer in their judgments, even if only very briefly, to the applicable statutory tests being applied.

Orders

(1)Appeal allowed in part.

(2)The order made by the Magistrate on 20 April 2012, insofar as it authorises the second procedure, is set aside.

(3)The order made by the Magistrate on 20 April 2012, insofar as it authorises the third procedure, is set aside.

(4)Otherwise the summons is dismissed. 

(5)The first defendant to pay half the costs of the plaintiff.

2760613,R v O'Brien; Williams; McManus [2012] NSWSC 1503,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: On 11 July 2012, Christopher William O'Brien, Bryce Marc Williams and Thomas Hugh McManus pleaded not guilty to the charge that they on 12 November 2010 did murder Alfred Lee. Each offender entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Lee. 

2The offenders pleaded not guilty to a further charge of the attempted armed robbery (in company) of Mr Lee and others and the wounding of Mr Lee contrary to ss 98 and 344A Crimes Act 1900. Each offender entered a guilty plea to the charge that they, being in company with each other attempted to rob Mr Lee and others of a quantity of prohibited drugs contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act. 

3The pleas of guilty were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. 

4The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. An offence of attempted robbery in company is punishable by imprisonment for 20 years. 

5Mr Lee was part of a group who had arranged to supply ecstasy to the offenders. He died from a gunshot wound to the head during an attempt by the offenders to rob the suppliers of the prohibited drug. 

6The Crown has made the following concessions: 

(a) the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt who fired the gun that killed Mr Lee. 

(b) the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders knew that there was a gun present; and 

(c) the acts of the offenders were not done with an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm.

7Accordingly, each offender must be sentenced on the basis that he did not fire the gun that killed the deceased and did not know of, or contemplate the presence of the weapon prior to the shots being fired, and their acts were not done with an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm.

8The pleas of guilty to the offence of manslaughter were entered by the offenders and accepted by the Crown on the basis that the offenders went to Albany Lane with the intention to commit a robbery and it was within their contemplation that there was the possibility of some harm, less than grievous bodily harm, being inflicted on members of the deceased's group during the course of the attempted robbery. 

9The principle of parity is of importance when sentencing co-offenders. It is sometimes necessary to assess an offender's degree of criminality by defining his role and the level of actual participation in the common offence. However, the Crown and counsel for the offenders submitted that the offenders should each bear equal responsibility for the commission of the offences. In any event, it is not possible on the agreed facts and concessions made by the Crown to determine the role that each of the offenders played in the manslaughter. In this case, each offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he is equally responsible for the offences. Nevertheless, their subjective cases are to be separately considered: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462.

10During the proceedings on sentence, Mr T Thorpe appeared for the Crown, Mr J Trevallion appeared for Christopher O'Brien, Mr P Williams for Thomas McManus and Mr P Little for Bryce Williams.

11Statements of agreed facts in identical terms were tendered by consent. The agreed facts are: 
""On 9th November 2010 the offender McManus was given use of a green Hyundai Elantra registration AM13BI ... 
At 1.31pm on Wednesday 10th November 2010, the offender Williams contacted Bobbie-Joan McDonald and asked her if she knew someone who could supply 2000 tablets of the prohibited drug 3, 4 MDMA commonly known as ""ecstasy.""
Bobbie McDonald confirmed that she had a source for the drugs and contacted Matt Van Oosten by sending him a message on the social networking website ""Facebook."" Arrangements were made for Van Oosten to supply the 2000 pills on Friday 12th November 2010 for the price of $11.50 per pill, being a total of $23,000.
Later that day McDonald attended Van Oosten's address and obtained a sample of the pills, which she subsequently provided to the accused Williams about 9pm on Thursday 11th November 2010.
On Friday 12th November 2010, Williams sent a number of messages to Hewson indicating that he would come to Hewson's house. At 2.28pm Williams sent a message to Hewson saying ""out front cuz"".
About 2.30pm Hewson left his house and entered the green Elantra in the company of O'Brien, Williams and McManus. The four drove around the Panania area in the vehicle before dropping McManus at the Padstow Hotel where he obtained a white Nissan NX Coupe, registration BH78QN from his mother.
About 5pm on Friday 12th November 2010, Williams picked up McDonald from her home address in the green Elantra. This vehicle was driven by O'Brien, Williams was in the passenger seat of the vehicle and McDonald sat in the back-seat with Hewson. The four were going to travel to Artarmon to meet Van Oosten to further the drug transaction.
Williams and O'Brien were accompanied by McManus, who was driving in convoy with them, in the white Nissan NX Coupe. These two vehicles were accompanied by a third vehicle containing another associate, believed to be Cameron Cook. Regular SMS messages between Williams and Cook have established that Cook was driving in unison with Williams destined for Artarmon.
At 5.55pm McManus sent a message to Williams saying ""Lad, pull into a servo"".
At 6.05pm the green Elantra stopped at Coles Express Service Station on Wattle Street, Ultimo, where CCTV footage depicts Williams and O'Brien as they exit the vehicle, refuel, make payment and return to the vehicle.
Evidence obtained of the communications between Williams and McManus includes directions that he was ""one car behind"" Williams on his way to Artarmon.
Upon arrival in Artarmon, McDonald left the vehicle and met with Van Oosten's and two of his associates Nicholas Ivers and Aaron Kelk at Van Oosten's business, a pizza shop. The deceased Lee was at this time at the pizza shop eating with his family.
At 6.46pm they walked to Hampden Lane, Artarmon, where they met with Williams and O'Brien at the car. Negotiations occurred between the parties and Van Oosten indicated he had not yet obtained the drugs which were to be sold. As a result, it was agreed that the transaction would occur in the vicinity of the McDonalds Restaurant, Stanmore around one hour later. During this meeting, Van Oosten was unaware of the presences of McManus and Cook in the vicinity.
At the conclusion of negotiations, McDonald returned to the green Elantra with Williams, O'Brien and Hewson and left. Williams sent an SMS message to Cook in the other vehicle directing him to ""Stanmore Maccas"".
About 7.45pm Cameron Cook left the area and returned to the Panania area, where he later reported on bail at Revesby Police Station.
At 7.10pm, the green Elantra failed to pay the toll on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and was photographed as it passed the toll booth travelling towards the city. It was immediately followed by a white Nissan NX Coupe which was being driven by -McManus. This vehicle was also photographed.
After dropping McDonald at home, Williams, O'Brien and Hewson arrived at the McDonalds Restaurant, Parramatta Rd, Stanmore in the green Elantra
At 8.34pm CCTV footage recorded the arrival of the green Elantra immediately followed by the white Nissan NX coupe. CCTV video footage depicts the two vehicles stopping together in Bridge Rd, Stanmore where the occupants of the two vehicles appear to have a brief discussion. Between 8.34pm and 8.52pm, a variety of CCTV video cameras recorded the white Nissan NX Coupe circulating in the streets surrounding Bridge Road Stanmore, where Williams, O'Brien and Hewson were parked in the green Elantra.

About 8.10pm Van Oosten, Kelk and Guy Wells arrived at the McDonalds Restaurant, Stanmore in a black Holden Caprice, owned by Kelk. Their intention was to complete the sale of the drugs to the accused persons for $23,000. At this time, Williams, O'Brien and Hewson were parked in their vehicle AM13BI a short distance away in Bridge Road, Stanmore.
About 8.37pm, after an SMS message from McDonald, Van Oosten and his associates left the car park of the McDonalds restaurant and drove the short distance along Bridge St, to where Williams, O'Brien and Hewson were parked. Van Oosten and his associates recognised Williams and O'Brien as well as the green Elantra and resumed their earlier negotiations in Artarmon.
Agreement was made for Van Oosten to go and get the drugs and return to Williams and O'Brien where the transaction would be completed.
Van Oosten had previously arranged for his friend, the deceased Alfred Lee, to be picked up nearby in Stanmore with the 2000 pills to be sold to the offenders. Lee had obtained the drugs from a man called Bengt Oskarsson who lived in Salisbury Road Stanmore, only a short distance away, however Lee had only been able to obtain 1600 pills.
After confirming the deal would go ahead, Van Oosten and his associates drove to Salisbury Rd Stanmore, where they picked up Lee who was in possession of the 1600 tablets that he had collected.

Lee entered the vehicle and sat behind the driver Kelk in the back seat, before the vehicle returned to Bridge Rd. As Van Oosten's party approached the accused's car in Bridge Road, they turned left into nearby Albany Lane with the intention of completing the drug transaction in this darkened laneway.
When Van Oosten's vehicle parked in Albany Lane, ... Williams approached it on foot and leant into the back seat to be shown the drugs by Lee. Subsequent forensic examination of the rear passenger side window of the Kelk's vehicle located a number of fingerprints of the accused Williams
Lee told Williams that there were only 1600 pills rather than the 2000 previously sought and directed Williams to go and get the money.
After Williams had confirmed that the drugs were present in the vehicle, he ran back towards the parked green Elantra. O'Brien was standing a short distance away
It is the Crown case that the offenders did not intend to pay for the drugs and that they intended to rob Van Oosten and the others of the drugs.
A short time later the white Nissan driven by McManus entered Albany Lane. It approached Van Oosten's vehicle from behind, passed it and stopped apparently in order to block its forward movement. The Elantra, containing Williams, O'Brien and Hewson, entered the lane and came to a stop immediately behind Kelk's car blocking its rearward movement. Williams, O'Brien and Hewson got out of the car.
Suspecting they were about to be robbed of the drugs, Kelk attempted to drive around the white Nissan being driven by McManus, clipping the kerb as a result. As his vehicle drew level with the Nissan, two gunshots were fired from the vicinity of the green Elantra The first of these rounds penetrated the rear windscreen of Kelk's vehicle striking the deceased in the head, killing him instantly.
The vehicle drove a short distance to Fitzroy Lane, Newtown, where Van Oosten got out of the vehicle and went to the rear passenger door where he removed the body of the deceased. He also removed the drugs that were in the vehicle. Kelk drove from the scene, leaving Van Oosten and the body of the deceased. Witnesses saw Van Oosten chase the vehicle calling out for it to stop.
Leaving the deceased's body in the lane, Van Oosten ran to the nearby railway line and threw a jar containing approximately 600 pills onto the tracks. This jar and its contents were subsequently recovered by Police and weighed 133 grams of the prohibited drug 1-benzylpiperazine. Each tablet weighed 0.35 grams per tablet. He also discarded a re-sealable plastic bag containing approximately 1000 pills which have never been recovered.
Van Oosten hailed a passing car which took him to Newtown Police Station where he spoke to police.""

12I make findings of fact in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the offenders. 

13The offenders had no intention of paying for the ecstasy pills that they had agreed to purchase. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the robbery was carefully planned and motivated by the offenders' desire to 'on sell' the drugs for financial gain. The original agreement with Van Oosten was for the supply of 2000 ecstasy pills for the price of $11.50 per pill, being a total of $23,000. The potential financial gain from the robbery was not insignificant. 

14Mr Crown invited me to find as a factor of aggravation that the offence of attempted robbery was committed ""in company."" I decline to do so as being ""in company"" is an element of the offence contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act. I do not find that being ""in company"" is an aggravating factor of the manslaughter, as it is an element of the foundational crime. 

15Although the offending did not involve an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, the offenders unsurprisingly, contemplated that there was the possibility of some harm, albeit less than grievous bodily harm being inflicted on members of Van Oosten's group during the robbery. The attempt to block Kelk's vehicle in Albert Lane precipitated what then happened. Mr Lee was shot when Kelk tried to escape the blockade. The occurrence of Mr Lee's death in the course of the attempted robbery increases the objective seriousness of the manslaughter, whereas the offenders' lack of knowledge of the presence of a weapon reduces its objective seriousness. Nevertheless, these to my mind are objectively serious offences of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act and attempted robbery. 

16The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value, which the community places upon the preservation of human life, is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise, as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Alfred Lee has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 

17When considering the sentences to be imposed for the attempted robbery, I bear in mind the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 per Spigelman CJ at [161]-[165].

18Each of the offenders pleaded guilty on 11 July 2012. The trial had been fixed to commence the next day. Acting on instructions from Williams, Mr Little had initiated discussions with the Crown concerning a plea a few weeks before the trial. The estimated length of the hearing was 4 to 6 weeks and involved issues arising from the principles of joint criminal enterprise and accessorial liability that were complex. Notwithstanding the lateness of the offenders' pleas, I assess their utilitarian value to be 15 per cent. 

19With no disrespect to the offenders, I will refer to them furthermore by their surnames during these sentencing remarks. 

20O'Brien was born on 19 March 1991. He was 19 years old at the time of the offence and is now 21 years old. His prior criminal history discloses that on 17 March 2008, for a charge of malicious wounding, he was released on probation for 2 years, which was subject to Juvenile Justice supervision. On 5 February 2009, the Campbelltown Youth Drug Court adjourned a charge of robbery in company under s 33(1)(c2) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the present offences were committed whilst O'Brien was in the Youth Drug Court Program. 

21The offender's criminal history does not entitle him to leniency but it is not such that it is a matter of aggravation. It is an aggravating factor that O'Brien committed the offences at a time when he was in the Youth Drug Court Program. Having regard to his criminal history, I give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566; R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159.

22O'Brien did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are drawn from the history provided to Dr Stephen Allnutt (a forensic psychiatrist), and a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report dated 31 August 2012. O'Brien is the eldest of three sons. He completed Year 10 and obtained a sheet metal apprenticeship. After completing three years of the apprenticeship, he terminated his employment and then worked in casual occupations. He was unemployed when the offences were committed. 

23The offender first used cannabis, ecstasy and alcohol at age 13. He drank alcohol on a daily basis and in a binge fashion on weekends. At the time of the offending, he was using cocaine at least three to four times a week, ecstasy on weekends and cannabis daily. He had also been taking steroids since age 17. I take into account O'Brien's family background and personal history. 

24In a report dated 5 October 2012, (ex O'B 1) Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that when he saw O'Brien, he was manifesting some mild paranoid ideas. Dr Allnutt detailed a number of factors that supported the conclusion that O'Brien has a psychotic disorder. He stated that ""there is cause for significant concern that [O'Brien] has chronic psychotic disorder such as paranoid schizophrenia triggered, aggravated or unmasked by substances, and on balance I would conclude a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia."" (ex O'B 1 p8). 

25Mr Trevallion contended that although there was no direct causal connection between O'Brien's mental condition and the offences, it would have impacted upon his ability to reason. Mr Crown argued that Dr Allnutt's report was only of assistance as to the offender's subjective background, but did not provide an explanation as to why the offender had committed the crimes. 

26Dr Allnutt reported that at the time leading up to the offending, O'Brien had ""used significant amounts of substances, experiencing paranoid ideation consistent with a psychosis along with anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms, also likely triggered by substances"" (ex O'B1 p8). At the time of the commission of the offences, O'Brien was using cocaine and cannabis heavily. He has a history of early behavioural problems with mental health involvement and a family history of paranoid schizophrenia. I accept that he was experiencing paranoid thoughts at that time. I do not find on the probabilities, however, that a direct causal connection existed between the paranoia and the offender's participation in the robbery, but I do find that his mental condition and continuing drug use reduced his ability to reason clearly and exercise judgement, which is a mitigating factor. I make it clear that the offender's severe drug habit is not of itself a mitigating factor: Henry per Wood CJ at CL at [273].

27The offender's mental condition reduces the weight that I give to general deterrence in the sentence. 

28Mr Trevallion submitted that the offender's paranoid schizophrenia will increase the hardship of a custodial sentence. The offender has received psychiatric treatment and has been prescribed medication whilst in custody. It is clear that the offender's mental condition can be adequately managed within the prison system and that imprisonment will not be a greater burden for him by reason of that condition. The principles in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587; (1987) 27 A Crim R 315 are not enlivened so as to mitigate the offender's sentence: see also R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395.

29Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) (i)-(ii) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. By his pleas of guilty, O'Brien has accepted responsibility for the offences. 

30Dr Allnutt observed that O'Brien presents as an individual who expresses remorse about his offending, takes responsibility for it, accepts that he has a substance abuse problem which needs to be addressed and voices motivation to pursue drug and alcohol counselling. Whilst noting that O'Brien's desire to overcome his substance abuse problems needs to be viewed ""in light of his earlier admonitions to rehabilitating his life"", Dr Allnutt believed it would be fair to consider ""the effects of maturation and age"":(ex O'B1 p9). 

31Tracey O'Brien, the offender's mother, in a letter dated 8 November 2012 writes of her son's feelings of great sorrow when they discussed the death of the deceased, and that he is very remorseful. Mrs O'Brien visits the offender on a weekly basis and he has the support of his family. Three references were also tendered in which the authors refer to the offender in complimentary terms. 

32I accept that O'Brien is remorseful. I take into account his remorse as a mitigating factor.

33Although he is remorseful and it appears that his substance dependence is currently in remission, that his mental condition has received treatment and he is a young man with family support, I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. His previous failures to benefit from the Youth Drug Court Program and Juvenile Justice supervision do not encourage an optimistic view being taken. Much will depend on his ability to avoid relapsing to alcohol/and or drug misuse upon release from custody. 

34O'Brien was a young adult at the time of the offending. That does not mean that the principles relevant to sentencing a young offender are irrelevant, but I am unable to conclude that the offender's behaviour had anything to do with immaturity. The intended robbery was well planned and the possibility of harm was contemplated. As has been said, youth is not a cloak of convenience behind which those who commit serious crime can shelter from the consequences of their conduct: see R v Mastronardi [2000] NSWCCA 12; (2000) 111 A Crim R 306; per Sully J at [20]. 

35I take into account that he is a young adult in giving weight to his need for rehabilitation. 

36I find that special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of the sentence, being his need for rehabilitation, psychological, and drug and alcohol counselling upon release. 

37McManus was born on 7 March 1991. He was 19 years old at the time of the commission of the offence and is now 21 years old. His prior criminal history reveals an offence of robbery in company for which he was released on 12 months probation by the Children's Court on 29 January 2009 that was subject to Juvenile Justice supervision. On 6 January 2010, he was fined and disqualified from driving by the Waverly Local Court for driving a vehicle with illicit drugs present in his blood. That criminal history deprives the offender of the considerations of leniency to which he may have been entitled if the current offences were isolated acts of criminality. 

38McManus did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are drawn from the history provided to John Machlin, a clinical psychologist. He was born in Sydney and has a younger full sister and an older half sister on his mother's side. The offender's parents separated when he was about 8 years old. He and his younger sister remained with their mother. After his parents separated, McManus and his sister would spend weekends at their father's which he depicted as ""sitting around watching him drink with his mates."" By the time the offender was 15, the weekends with his father had stopped and their contact has been occasional since that time. 

39Mr Machlin reported that McManus did not have any specific academic or literacy problems at school, but the offender told him that he rarely applied himself. He was asked to leave Picnic Point High School in Year 10 and was transferred to East Hills where he failed to see out a probationary period and was expelled for fighting. He was an apprentice in carpentry for two years until his employer's bankruptcy. His subsequent employment included work as a labourer and a glazing apprenticeship that he would like to return to when able. McManus described himself mainly as a social and recreational user of alcohol, marijuana and ecstasy. He said that he had given up all drug use in the final weeks before his arrest. I take into account the offender's family background and personal history. 

40Mr Machlin considered that at the time of the offence, McManus ""would probably have met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for a Substance Use Disorder, given that his alcohol and drug use was causing clinically significant impairment to his social, behavioural, and vocational functioning"": ex M1 p7. The psychologist opined that McManus is not otherwise suffering problems on the scale of a diagnosable mental health condition. Mr Machlin was of the opinion that it is possible that the offender suffers a bipolar disorder and if so, it is not severe and not meaningfully connected to the offence. The psychologist noted that ""psychometric testing identified a dependent personality style"". Mr Machlin observed that McManus is prone to depressive reactions and the effects of past traumas, which he considered would be likely to add to the hardship of custody. 

41Mr Williams submitted that McManus was 18 years old at the time of the offences and was the youngest of the offenders by a couple of months. The significance of this was said to be the offender's high score on the dependency test which indicated that he was someone who was easily led. Mr Williams submission about the offender's age is mistaken as the records disclose that he was 19 years old at the time of the offending. He is a dozen days younger than O'Brien. In any event, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that McManus participated in the attempted robbery because he was led into it by his co-offenders or that his behaviour had anything to do with immaturity. 

42Mr Machlin recounted that McManus accepted responsibility for his knowing involvement in the attempted robbery and indicated an understanding of the gravity of the offence involving the death of the victim, but his depth of remorse was difficult to ascertain. Mr Machlin noted that the offender's mother had discussed the offence with her son during prison visits and said that he had ""shown remorse and tears over the death of the victim, and a kind of helplessness in not knowing what he should say to the widow"": ex M1 p6. Mr Machlin concluded that the offender ""is aware of the gravity of his offence; he acknowledges the loss of the victim's life and the devastation to the victim's family, but has had difficulty articulating his emotional reaction in the context of the current interview"": ex M1 p7.

43Jo-anne Wallace and Colleen Nickel gave evidence during which they spoke of McManus's sorrow and regret for the death of the deceased and of his intention to be a better person. Mrs Wallace said that there was work available for him as a bricklayer upon release. Written references from both Mrs Wallace and Ms Nickel were also tendered. 

44I accept that McManus is remorseful. By his pleas of guilty, McManus has accepted responsibility for his actions. I take into account his remorse as a mitigating factor. 

45The offender's prospects of rehabilitation are not as uncertain as those of his co-offenders. He has not previously breached conditional liberty and has a less serious drug and alcohol problem. Provided he avails himself of the therapeutic resources suggested by Mr Machlin, I consider that McManus is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g)-(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, personal deterrence does not have a significant role to play in my task of sentencing McManus. I do, however, give weight to general deterrence. 

46I take into account that he is a young adult in giving weight to his need for rehabilitation.

47I find special circumstances being his need for rehabilitation, psychotic monitoring and counselling. 

48Williams was born on 8 October 1987. He is the eldest of the offenders being 23 years old when the offences were committed and is now 25 years old. His prior criminal history discloses that for two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, he was placed on 6 month good behaviour bonds by the Lidcome Children's Court on 20 April 2005. For offences of destruction of property and common assault, Liverpool Local Court imposed community service orders on 22 June 2007. He was placed on a 100 hours community service order for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 9 months for an offence of common assault by the Bankstown Local Court on 10 March 2010. Upon being called up for breaching the community service order, he was sentenced to imprisonment for one month commencing 17 December 2010 and expiring 16 January 2011. 

49The offender's criminal history does not entitle him to leniency but it is not such that it is a matter of aggravation. At the time of the commission of the offences, the community service order had not been completed and Williams remained subject to the s 9 bond. It is an aggravating factor that Williams abused his conditional liberty by his offending. Having regard to his criminal history, I give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: R v McNaughton; R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K.

50I give weight to general deterrence. 

51Williams did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are principally drawn from the testimony of his father Gary Williams and the history provided to Michelle Player, a clinical psychologist. Williams' mother died in January 1997 when he was 10 years old. He and his father found his mother deceased in bed before he left for school. Mrs Williams had been dependent on heroin and had died from an accidental overdose of alcohol and anti-depressant medications. 

52Gary Williams said in evidence that after the death, his son had become ""a lot more withdrawn."" Michelle Player reported that Williams' academic performance declined after his mother's death and he commenced drinking alcohol from the age of 12 years. He was introduced to the use of cannabis at the age of 11 years and he was using cannabis daily by Year 9. Williams engaged in recreational weekend use of ecstasy and amphetamine from the age of 15 years. Williams used methamphetamines from age 19 years, but ceased taking this prohibited drug for 12 months from age 21 to 22 years. However, he recommenced using methamphetamines over a two-day period on a weekly basis, interspersed with weekend use of ecstasy and/or cocaine. He became dependent on the prescription drug Xanax, when he was 22 years old. 

53Williams attained his Year 10 Certificate before leaving school and commenced an apprenticeship in French polishing and furniture finishes. Williams had been employed in an apprenticeship as a French Polisher with a company in Bankstown for four years, but after the company experienced financial difficulties, he was unable to obtain any substantial employment. He completed all of the TAFE based theory and work-based practical experience and had one TAFE term to complete before he went into custody. Williams told Ms Player that he planned to finish the course upon his release. 

54I take into account the offender's family background and personal history. I accept Mr Little's submission that Williams' tragic early life was on the probabilities causative of his descent into alcohol and drug abuse at an early age. 

55Ms Player expressed the opinion that Williams' main psychological vulnerability ""is his unresolved grief response which has contributed to substance abuse and poor expression of anger, particularly when intoxicated"": ex W1 p8. Ms Player suggested that Williams' involvement in the present offences ""was, in part, underscored by his frozen grief response and maladaptive use of substances to try to cope at that time."" She assessed his risk of re-offending with the HCR - 20 clinical risk assessment guide and found that the offender presents an overall low-moderate risk of violent recidivism. The psychologist's recommendations include that Williams access individual psychological therapy whilst in gaol. Ms Player observed that the offender ""appeared genuinely remorseful for the death of the victim and willing to participate in interventions to address his recidivism risk.""

56Gary Williams testified that his son was aware of the grief he caused to the victim's family and to his own family. Mr Williams recounted that his son had said to him, ""I've totally grown up and I'm just so sorry that the whole thing's happened"": T 10 37-38. Mr Williams said that the offender wished to complete his HSC and his apprenticeship. Upon the offender's release from custody, the plan was for him to move to Adelaide with his elder brother who is a mining manager and to take up employment in the mining sector. 

57Williams took the initiative in instructing his counsel to have discussions with the Crown concerning a plea. By his pleas of guilty, Williams has accepted responsibility for his actions. I accept that Williams is remorseful. I take into account his remorse as a mitigating factor. 

58I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that Williams is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. Notwithstanding his family's support, the prospects of employment and his remorse, his failure to be of good behaviour during the term of the s 9 bond and community service orders detracts from an optimistic view being taken. As in the case of O'Brien, much will depend on Williams' ability to avoid relapsing to alcohol and or drug misuse upon release. 

59In considering his need for rehabilitation, I take into account that Williams is a comparatively young man. I find special circumstances being his need for rehabilitation, drug and alcohol counselling and psychological therapy. 

60A victim impact statement from Khan Hood, the deceased's sister and Lynette Weaver, the deceased's fiancée were read to the Court and a victim impact statement from Louissa Hood, another sister was tendered. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offenders' sentences: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.

61My attention was drawn to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for offences of manslaughter but the limited use that may be made of these statistics is further diminished by the wide embrace of offending that might amount to the crime of manslaughter: R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 at [27]-[30]. Various cases have been cited by counsel which have been of assistance, but each case depends on its own circumstances. 

62In structuring the sentences to be imposed on the offenders, I have fixed an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considered questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality. As these offenders' actions in reality reflect one course of criminal conduct, I conclude that the sentence to be imposed for manslaughter can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the attempted robbery. I do not accept the Crown's submission that there should be some partial accumulation of the sentences. 

63The agreed date for the commencement of the sentences of O'Brien and Williams is 17 December 2010. The agreed date for the commencement of McManus's sentence is 3 March 2011. 

64After applying a discount of 15 per cent the total term of O'Brien's sentence for manslaughter is 7 years 10 months. I have found special circumstances. 

65Christopher William O'Brien for the offence of manslaughter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months which is to commence on 17 December 2010 and to expire on 16 June 2016. I set a balance of term of 2 years 4 months which is to commence on 17 June 2016 and will expire on 16 October 2018. 

66Christopher William O'Brien for the attempted robbery, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years 3 months which is to commence on 17 December 2010 and is to expire on 16 March 2015. 

67The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 16 June 2016.

68After applying a discount of 15 per cent the total term of McManus' sentence for manslaughter is 7 years 8 months. I have found special circumstances. 

69Thomas Hugh McManus for the offence of manslaughter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 4 months which is to commence on 3 March 2011 and is to expire on 2 July 2016. I set a balance of term of 2 years 4 months which is to commence on 3 July 2016 and will expire on 2 November 2018. 

70Thomas Hugh McManus for the attempted robbery, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years 1 month which is to commence on 3 March 2011 and is to expire on 2 April 2015. 

71The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 2 July 2016.

72After applying a discount of 15 per cent the total term of Williams' sentence for manslaughter is 8 years 1 month. I have found special circumstances. 

73Bryce Marc Williams for the offence of manslaughter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 9 months which is to commence on 17 December 2010 and to expire on 16 September 2016. I set a balance of term of 2 years 4 months which is to commence on 17 September 2016 and will expire on 16 January 2019. 

74Bryce Marc Williams for the attempted robbery, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months which is to commence on 17 December 2010 and is to expire on 16 June 2015.

75The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 16 September 2016.

2760618,R v Kristine Weston [2012] NSWSC 1498,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1On 10 August 2012 Kristine Weston (""the offender"") was indicted in the following terms:

(i)that between 29 October 2010 and 5 January 2011, at Casino in the State of New South Wales, whilst knowing that David Comber did murder Adrian Trevett, afterwards did receive, harbour, maintain and assist the said David Comber;

(ii)that on 25 December 2012, at Casino in the State of New South Wales, did provide false information to the police as to the whereabouts of David Comber, with the intent to hinder the apprehension of David Comber, who was wanted by the police in relation to the disappearance and murder of Adrian Trevett.

2The offender pleaded not guilty to the first count, but guilty to the second (which was an alternative to the first). The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment.

3There is before me a Certificate pursuant to s. 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 containing a back up charge pursuant to s. 316(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act""). The Crown has invited me to dismiss that charge upon the pronouncement of sentence in respect of the second count in the indictment to which the offender pleaded guilty.

4The offence in the second count is an offence against s. 315(1)(c) of the Act which is in the following terms:

315 Hindering investigation etc 
(1) A person who does anything intending in any way to hinder: 
...
(c) the apprehension of another person who has committed a serious indictable offence

is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

5No standard non-parole period is prescribed for this offence.

THE FACTS
6An agreed statement of facts was tendered on sentence, from which I summarise the following.

7Adrian Trevett (""the deceased"") was murdered on 29 October 2010 at Red Range in the State of New South Wales. The persons responsible for his death were Mathew Aquilina (""Aquilina""), Karen Dawson (""Dawson"") (each of whom was found guilty by a jury following a trial) and David Comber (""Comber"") (who entered a plea of guilty shortly before the trial).

8In the latter part of 2010 the offender resided at Casino with Comber and her two children. Aquilina and his then partner Deborah Grant (""Grant"") (who also pleaded guilty to an offence against s315) lived nearby. As a consequence, the offender and Comber became acquainted with both Aquilina and Grant.

9At the time of his death, the deceased resided alone in a caravan on a block of land at 49 Victoria Street Red Range, which was a small village east of the township of Glen Innes. The deceased was a bachelor, but had strong family connections in and around the Glen Innes area, through a nephew and through his brother. He was well known in the area and operated a small fruit and vegetable business from a street cart in Glen Innes as a means of providing income. He was an avid cycling enthusiast and being unlicensed, he used his bicycle as his main mode of transportation.

10Dawson and her 12-year-old son Brandon lived in a property at Red Range, the rear of which adjoined that of the deceased. As a consequence, Dawson and the deceased became friends, often participating together in social events and ""drinking sessions"".

11Around October 2010, Dawson informed Aquilina and Grant that she had ongoing issues with the deceased. Both Grant and Aquilina discussed the issues with Dawson. It was decided between Aquilina and Dawson that they would go to the deceased's home at Red Range to ""sort out"" the issues which had arisen. Aquilina enlisted the assistance of Comber to attend with him. 

12On 29 October 2010, Aquilina, Dawson and Comber left Casino and drove to Red Range. Later that day, the deceased was killed at the rear of Dawson's property. Aquilina, Dawson and Comber subsequently disposed of the deceased's body at an area known as Sandy Hill, east of Tenterfield. 

13On Monday 15 November 2010, the deceased was reported missing to police. Following that report, a police investigation was commenced, which included the interception of telephone conversations, as well as the use of listening devices. By virtue of those listening devices, numerous conversations were recorded between the offender and Comber. Those conversations indicated an awareness, on the part of the offender, of the disappearance and murder of the deceased, as well as an awareness of Comber's involvement in that murder. Comber ultimately came to the attention of the investigating police through his use of a bank account, cheque book and credit cards belonging to the deceased, which were taken at or about the time of his death. 

14At some stage shortly after the deceased's murder, Comber left the offender's home. After leaving, and when he was evading police, Comber kept in contact with the offender by telephone. The offender assisted Comber by making small cash deposits into his bank account when he asked her to do so.

15Police surveillance established that on 25 December 2010 Comber had returned to the offender's home to visit her. At a time when he was, to the knowledge of the police, inside the premises, police attended and enquired as to his whereabouts. The offender said to police on that occasion (in reference to Comber):

""I haven't seen him since October"".

16It is that statement which is the gravamen of the offence committed by the offender. 

17At about 6:30am on 5 January 2011 investigating police executed a search warrant at the home of the offender, at which time she was arrested and placed in custody. She declined to be interviewed when arrested. 

THE NATURE OF THE OFFENDING
18In determining the appropriate sentence, I am required to have regard to the nature of the offending, and its objective seriousness.

19 R v Mobbs [2005] NSWCCA 371, Johnson J (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) made the following observations (at [49]-[50]) in relation to offences under s315: 

""In sentencing for an offence under this section, it is appropriate to take into account the seriousness of the ""serious indictable offence"", the investigation of which was hindered by the offender: R v Skinner [2000] NSWSC 303 at para 15; R v Derbas [2003] NSWCCA 44 at para 30; R v Ahmad [2005] NSWSC 848 at para 11... 

[50] There are other factors, however, which bear upon an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence. The fact that the offence is committed on the spur of the moment, without planning or premeditation, is relevant: Hamze at paras 24, 33; Derbas at para 17; Ahmad at para 14. The length of time during which the hindering is maintained is also relevant: Ahmad at para 14. The motive of the offender in committing the offence is relevant: Derbas at para 28; Hamze at para 33; Ahmad at para 14. General deterrence is significant: Derbas at para 28; Hamze at para 33.""

20His Honour's observations were made in the context of a consideration of an offence pursuant to s. 315(1)(a). The offender in the present case has been charged with an offence pursuant to s315(1)(c). However in my view his Honour's observations remain apposite.

21In the present case, the ""serious indictable offence"" is that of murder. Any comment about the seriousness of such an offence would be superfluous. 

22The author of the pre-sentence report which is before the court recorded that the offender ""maintained that she was not aware of (Comber's) involvement in committing the offence"". However the offender, by her plea of guilty, has acknowledged an awareness, at least in a general sense, not only of the fact of the deceased's disappearance and murder, but also of the fact that Comber was in some way involved (as to which see R v El-Zeyat [2002] NSWCCA 138).

23These factors, without more, point to the commission of an offence of considerable objective gravity. 

24However, I am satisfied on the evidence before me that the offence was committed on the spur of the moment, and without any degree of planning or premeditation. Further, the offence was an isolated one. There is no suggestion that the offence extended beyond the making of the one statement to the police on 25 December 2010. 

25In order to commit an offence against this section, the actions of an offender must be done with an intention to hinder the apprehension of another person who has committed a serious indictable offence. In the present case the offender has acknowledged, by her plea, that she had that intention. Actual hindrance of itself is not an element of the offence. However, in determining the circumstances of the offending, and its objective seriousness, I have had regard to the fact that there is no evidence that the apprehension of Comber was actually hindered as a result of the offender's actions. On the contrary, the facts make it clear that as a result of both electronic and physical surveillance, the investigating police were aware, at the time at which the offence was committed, that Comber was inside the premises. 

26The offender told the author of the pre-sentence report that Comber had threatened harm if she disclosed his presence. However, the offender did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings before me. It has been observed on several occasions that considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon such statements where no evidence is given by an offender. In many cases, only very limited weight can be given to them (see for example R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353 per Smart AJ at [58]). In R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358 Whealy J (with whom Ipp JA and Davidson AJ agreed) put the principle in this way (at [24]-[25]):

The Crown referred to two decisions of this court - R v Qutami [2001] 127 A Crim R 369 and R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335. In the latter of these cases Wood CJ at CL said, at paragraph 24: 

""So far as I can see, there was no factual basis for the finding made by his Honour beyond a self-serving and untested statement made by the respondent to the psychologist. Recently this court has criticised the practice of placing material of this kind before sentencing judges in an attempt to minimise the objective seriousness of a crime otherwise apparent on the face of the record: Regina v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, at para 58 and 59 per Smart AJ, and at para 79 per Spigelman CJ. I wholeheartedly agree with the criticism offered in that case. If an offender appearing for sentence wishes to place evidence before the court which is designed to minimise his/her criminality, then it should be done directly and in a form which can be tested.""

[25] The matters of principle stated in R v McGourty and R v Qutami are plainly important. They require emphatic endorsement by this court. Indeed it needs also to be further emphasised that this principle extends not only to statements in psychological reports, but also to statements by offenders in pre-sentence reports - (R v Palu per Howie J with whom Levine J and Heydon J agreed (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 185). In addition, the current practice of tendering a note or letter from an offender in sentencing proceedings attracts the same admonishment. Considerable caution should be exercised in reliance upon such exculpatory material where there is a matter in dispute and where no evidence is given by an offender or other direct evidence is not placed before the court. The essential reason for treating the material in that way is precisely because it remains untested. Indeed, where the Crown has either objected to the tender of this type of material or has made it clear, either at the time of tender or when submissions are made, little or no weight should be placed upon the material, that the sentencing court would be entitled to treat the material as being of little or no weight. Indeed, in an appropriate case, it ought to do so.""

27In these circumstances, in the absence of sworn evidence, I do not accept the offender's assertion that she committed the offence under some threat of harm. 

28Counsel for the offender submitted that it would be open to find that the offender's commission of the offence was motivated out of her love and affection for Comber. He relied, in support of that proposition, on the fact that the offender and Comber had been in a de facto relationship for some time in which, according to the pre-sentence report, Comber was ""affectionate and loving"". 

29Whilst the evidence of the relationship between the offender and Comber may provide some support for counsel's submission I am again not satisfied, in the absence of sworn evidence from the offender, that she was so motivated. Had I reached such a finding, the need for general deterrence in the sentencing process would, in all probability, have been greater (as to which see R v Derbas [2003] NSWCCA 44 per R S Hulme J at [28]).
30An offence against s. 315(1)(c) is an offence which finds its place in a division of the Act dealing with offences involving interference with the administration of justice. Offences of that nature are, of themselves, necessarily serious. They have been created for the purpose of ensuring, amongst other things, that the integrity of, and confidence in, the administration of justice is maintained. In the present case, the relevant ""serious indictable offence"" was one which carries a maximum term of life imprisonment.

31That said, and having regard to all of the circumstances to which I have referred, I consider that the nature of the offending in the present case falls towards the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. I did not understand the Crown to put any submission to the contrary.

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE
32The offender is 33 years of age. She has two children from a previous relationship, who are now aged 12 and 11 respectively. The offender's eldest daughter has what have been described as ""multiple neurological challenges"" and is currently under the care of a paediatrician. Her youngest daughter suffers a learning disability.

33According to the statements made by the offender to the author of the pre-sentence report, Comber introduced her to illicit drugs in 2007/2008, as a consequence of which she became addicted to amphetamines and cannabis. According to information provided by the offender and which is recorded in the pre-sentence report, she abstained from drug taking some three years ago. That was confirmed by her mother who gave evidence before me on sentence, and I am satisfied that this is the case.

34The offence was not part of any planned or organised criminal activity. That is a mitigating factor pursuant to s. 21A(3)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"").

35The offender has no record of previous convictions. That is a mitigating factor pursuant to s. 21A(3)(e). However, counsel for the offender went further, and submitted that the offender was a person of good character within the meaning of s. 21A(3)(f) of the Sentencing Act. Evidence of an absence of previous convictions, combined with other evidence, is capable of amounting to material that might support a finding that the offender was otherwise a person of good character. That is a matter which must be established on the balance of probabilities (see Aoun v R [2007] NSWCCA 292 per Hodgson JA (with whom Hislop and Latham JJ agreed) at [23]-[24]). In the present case, I have heard sworn evidence from the offender's mother, which was not the subject of any real challenge by the Crown. Although that evidence was limited, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender was a person of good character within the meaning of s. 21A(3)(f) of the Sentencing Act. 

36Counsel submitted that I should find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. The evidence which might support that finding is limited to say the least. The author of the pre-sentence report concluded by expressing the view that the offender was suitable for a low to medium level of intervention which, he said, was ""commensurate with the assessed risk"". I assume that this refers to the risk of re-offending, however the nature and extent of the assessed risk was not otherwise identified. 

37In these circumstances I am not able to reach any conclusion regarding the risk of re-offending, or the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. 

38Finally, at least in terms of the factors set out in s. 21A(3), I have had regard to the fact that the offender pleaded guilty, although it must be noted that the plea came at a late stage, the offender having been committed for trial in late 2011 on the charge of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased. I was also asked to have regard to the fact that the offence is one which was capable of being dealt with summarily by a Magistrate (as to which see generally R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 at [15] per Hall J (Grove J and Smart AJ agreeing). In view of the conclusion I have reached, I need not give any further consideration to this issue.

39Leaving aside the statutory mitigating factors, the submissions on behalf of the offender concentrated upon two particular matters.

40The first was the fact that the offender is the sole carer of two of her daughters, both of whom have the difficulties to which I previously referred. In this regard the offender's mother gave evidence, which I accept, that she is required to assist the offender from time to time in the care of her children. However as a general principle, hardship to the dependants of an offender is an unavoidable consequence of a custodial sentence and is not a mitigating consideration unless a conclusion can be reached that such hardship is properly regarded as exceptional (see R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510). Counsel for the offender ultimately accepted that the circumstances of the present case did not fall into the exceptional category. 

41The second matter, upon which significant emphasis was placed, was what was described in the written submissions as the offender's ""mental state"". In this respect, the following was stated in the pre-sentence report:

""Ms Weston's Doctor confirmed that she was diagnosed with a learning disability at age 16 years and is intellectually impaired with a low IQ. He advised that she had an equivalent mental age of 11 years when she was 16 years old. The Doctor advised that as a child she exhibited behavioural problems due to her poor cognitions and lack of coping skills. Despite these difficulties the Doctor confirmed that the offender knows the difference between right and wrong. In addition, he confirmed that Ms Weston was prescribed anti-depressants in January 2010; however the Doctor advised that the offender ceased taking the medication some months later without prior consultation"".


42In addition, counsel for the offender tendered a report of Dr Lynette Arnoldus-Lewis, psychologist. Ms Arnoldus-Lewis spoke with the offender on two occasions, each for a period of one hour. She administered no psychometric testing to assist her in making assessment of the offender's psychological state, IQ, or functional incapacities, stating that she had adopted ""a qualitative approach"" which was said to be based upon (inter alia) ""interviews and data generated from sessions"". I assume that amongst the interviews which were used in this way where the two interviews with the offender. 

43I have read the report of Ms Arnoldus-Lewis carefully. It has provided me with little or no assistance in assessing the offender's subjective circumstances generally, or determining her mental state in particular.

44It is evident that Ms Arnoldus-Lewis had difficulty in obtaining any cogent information from the offender. Indeed, she specifically commented upon the fact that it was ""difficult or near impossible to facilitate a consistent meaningful response from (the offender), no matter what topic"". As I have observed, Ms Arnoldus-Lewis chose to approach her assessment by relying upon (inter alia) the content of her interview with the offender. In circumstances where such difficulties were experienced in obtaining any meaningful response from the offender, it must be said that the approach which was adopted to the preparation of the report, to the extent that it relied partly upon the content of an interview with the offender, may not have been the best one. 

45Further, and bearing in mind the purpose for which it was tendered, the report is completely bereft of any diagnosis as to the offender's mental state. The closest it reaches in that regard is the passage which records the following: 

""....I conferred with her life-long (since birth) GP, Dr Aldo Castanga, on 18 July 2012. Dr Castanga confirmed that Ms Weston was intellectually or developmentally impaired with a low IQ which was more than likely congenital, as there was a family history of varying degrees of intellectual impairment or developmental delay, including her mother, and two young daughters.""
46It is apparent that the offender's General Practitioner, to whom both Ms Arnoldus-Lewis and the author of the pre-sentence report spoke, has treated the offender for a period in excess of 30 years. In addition, the pre-sentence report records the fact that the author spoke to a person described as the offender's psychologist (which I construe to be a reference to a treating psychologist, and someone other than Ms Arnoldus-Lewis). 

47I am at a loss to understand why I have not been provided with a report from one or the other (or both) of these practitioners. Instead, I have been provided with a report produced as a result of two short consultations conducted for medico legal purposes which reaches no definitive conclusion, arrives at no identifiable diagnosis, and contains an observation that the offender ""does not have the mental, social or moral capacity to accept responsibility for her involvement in the aforementioned criminal act"", an observation which counsel conceded was somewhat inconsistent with the offender's plea of guilty. 

48In circumstances where there has been considerable focus in the submissions upon the offender's ""mental state"", and the extent to which that condition should be taken into account on sentence, I regard the state of the evidence as most unsatisfactory. 

49Counsel described the offender's relevant mental state as being an ""intellectual or developmental disability with a low IQ and a reading age of 11 years when 16 years"". He conceded that according to information obtained by the author of the pre-sentence report from the offender's General Practitioner, the offender was a person who ""does understand the difference between right and wrong"". Nevertheless, he submitted that in all of the circumstances, the offender's mental state was such that she was not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence.

50There is no doubt that the presence of a substantial and chronic mental illness is relevant to a determination of whether the case is one which calls for a particular measure of general or specific deterrence (see R v Sharrouf [2009] NSWSC 1002 per Whealy J at [61] and the authorities cited therein). 

51However, the difficulty in the present case is that the evidence falls substantially short of establishing that the offender has any significant mental disorder or abnormality. The pre-sentence report makes reference, on the basis of information provided by the offender's General Practitioner, to an ""intellectual impairment"". It also refers to the fact that the offender was prescribed anti-depressant medication in 2010, but ceased taking that medication shortly after it was prescribed for her. The latter reference may tend to indicate that the offender was diagnosed with depression at some point, but the present position is simply not known. This issue, along with many others, would seemingly have been capable of resolution had the appropriate evidence been placed before the court. 

52I am satisfied that the offender suffers from some form of intellectual impairment. The evidence does not enable me to determine the nature of that impairment, nor its extent. Whilst I have taken it into account as part of the offender's subjective circumstances, I am not satisfied that the offender's mental state is such that normal principles of general deterrence should not apply. 

CONCLUSION
53In written submissions, counsel for the offender argued that it would be open to me to impose something other than a sentence which required the offender to serve a period of full time custody. He submitted firstly, that a bond pursuant to s9 of the Sentencing Act would be appropriate in all of the circumstances. Alternatively, he submitted that if I were to come to the view that a full time custodial sentence was appropriate, I should suspend any such sentence pursuant to s12. In oral submissions, although counsel did not abandon his position in relation to the first of these outcomes, he concentrated very much on the second.
54The Crown submitted that there was a need for any sentence to have proper regard to the nature of the offending and, in particular, to the fact that the Parliament's creation of this offence was obviously born out of a need to protect the administration of justice. For these reasons, the Crown submitted that a bond under s9 would fail to properly reflect the seriousness of the offending. 

55The Crown conceded however, that there was no evidence to suggest any special need for specific deterrence. In fact, the Crown went so far as to say that it could be reasonably anticipated that the fact of the offender's arrest and charge had been of a salutary effect upon her. In these circumstances, whilst submitting that a custodial sentence was called for, the Crown agreed that it would be open to me to order, either that such a sentence be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order, or alternatively, that it be wholly suspended pursuant to s12 of the Sentencing Act. 

56In considering these submissions and determining an appropriate sentence, I am required firstly to have regard to s. 5(1) of the Sentencing Act which is in the following terms:

""A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate"".

57If I reach the view that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, I am then required to determine what the length of the sentence should be. That is a determination which is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served, and without regard to the manner in which it is to be served. Once the term of the sentence is determined, I must then consider whether any alternative to full time imprisonment is available (see generally R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [22] - [29] per Howie J).

58In my view, taking all relevant matters into account, no penalty other than a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate. The offence is, for the reasons I have set out, a serious one. There is a need to protect, and maintain, the integrity of the system of justice. That, in turn, gives rise to a need for general deterrence for which the offender remains a suitable vehicle.

59In my view, taking into account all of the matters to which I have referred, a sentence of 12 months imprisonment is appropriate.

60Having reached that conclusion, I turn to consider how that sentence ought be served. That determination is a discretionary one, and the exercise of that discretion must be carried out with regard to established sentencing principles (see Zamagias (supra) at [29]).

61I have come to the view that it is appropriate that I suspend, pursuant to s. 12 of the Sentencing Act, the entirety of the sentence which I have determined is appropriate, and that I order that the offender be released on the condition that she enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. In view of the evidence before me, I consider it appropriate that such release be subject to a number of conditions.

		10 December 2012",2012-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760619,R v David Comber [2012] NSWSC 1502,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1On 22 August 2012 David Roland Comber (""the offender"") pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging that on 29 October 2010, at Red Range in the state of New South Wales, he did murder Adrian Trevett (""the deceased"").  I will refer to this as ""the murder offence"".
2In addition to the murder offence, the offender appears for sentence in relation to 17 back up offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception contrary to s. 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act (""the Act"").  Those matters are annexed to a certificate issued pursuant to s. 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (""the Procedure Act"").  I will refer to those matters as ""the dishonesty offences"".
3Further, the offender pleaded guilty before me to an indictment containing two offences pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Code""), namely an offence against s. 400.5(1) and an offence against s. 400.6(1).  Pleas of guilty had earlier been entered to those matters before the Local Court.  I will refer to those matters as ""the Commonwealth offences"".  
4The offender had previously been committed for sentence to the District Court in relation to the Commonwealth offences.  However, when the District Court was made aware of the fact that he was facing the murder offence, the matters were referred to this Court to be dealt with, pursuant to the provisions of s128(2) of the Procedure Act.  
5As to the Commonwealth offences, s400.5(1) of the Code is in the following terms:
400.5   Dealing in proceeds of crime etc.--money or property worth $50,000 or more 
(1)  A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a)  the person deals with money or other property; and                       (b)  either: (i)  the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or (ii)  the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and (c)  at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $50,000 or more. 
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 15 years, or 900 penalty units, or both. 
....

6Section 400.6(1) of the Code is in the following terms:
400.6   Dealing in proceeds of crime etc.--money or property worth $10,000 or more 
(1)  A person is guilty of an offence if: (a)  the person deals with money or other property; and                      (b)  either(i)  the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or (ii)  the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and (c)  at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $10,000 or more. 
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years, or 600 penalty units, or both. 
....
MAXIMUM PENALTIES7The maximum penalty for the murder offence is one of life imprisonment pursuant to s. 18 of the Act.  A standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment is prescribed for that offence.  
8Each of the dishonestly offences carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  No standard non-parole period is prescribed.  Having regard to the provisions of ss. 183 and 267 of the Procedure Act, I am restricted to the powers of a Magistrate in the Local Court in dealing with the dishonesty offences and the maximum penalty that I may impose for each offence is one of 2 years imprisonment.   
9In respect of the Commonwealth offences, the maximum penalty for the offence under s. 400.5(1) is imprisonment for 15 years, a fine of $99,000, or both.  The maximum penalty for an offence under s. 400.6(1) of the Code is 10 years imprisonment, a fine of $66,000, or both.  
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDINGThe murder offence10A statement of facts, and a copy of the offender's Record of Interview with Police, were tendered by the Crown on sentence.  Counsel for the offender informed me that the facts were agreed, and he made submissions to me regarding the findings I should make, based upon those facts, as to the circumstances of the offending.  
11The facts of the murder offence may be summarised as follows.
12In October 2010, Karen Dawson (""Dawson"") was a neighbour of the deceased.  Mathew Aquilina (""Aquilina"") is the adult son of Dawson and is the father of two young boys under the age of 3 years, and a step-father of a third boy under the age of 3 years.  Those three boys stayed with Dawson for a period of a few weeks in October 2010.  
13Deborah Grant (""Grant"") was, in October 2010, the de-facto partner of Aquilina.  She resided with him, and her six children, in Casino.  
14Kristine Weston (""Weston"") was, at the same time, the offender's de-facto partner and resided with him in Casino, in premises next to those of Aquilina and Grant.   It was in these circumstances that the offender became acquainted with Aquilina.
15At the time of his death, the deceased resided alone in a caravan on a block of land at Red Range, a small village east of the township of Glen Innes, in northern New South Wales.  The deceased was a bachelor, but had strong family connections in and around the Glen Innes area through, in particular, a nephew and a brother.  He operated a small fruit and vegetable business from a street cart in Glen Innes in order to supplement his income.  He was well known in the local area, was an avid cycling enthusiast, and being unlicensed, used a bicycle as his main mode of transportation. 
16Dawson was an openly homosexual single mother who, with her 12 year old son Brandon, lived on a property at Red Range, the boundary of which adjoined that of the deceased.  As a consequence, Dawson and the deceased became close friends.  They often socialised together, and drank heavily in each other's presence.  Due to the fact that the deceased did not have a driver's licence, Dawson would sometimes be observed driving with the deceased in her car in and around the local area.
17On 28 October 2010, Dawson drove the deceased to the ""Jackadgery"" Caravan Park located on the Gwydir Highway, approximately 120 kilometres east of Glen Innes.  The deceased intended to stay the night at the caravan park, and then cycle across the Gibraltar Range back towards Glen Innes the following morning.  Dawson arranged to collect the deceased the next day from a location known as ""Ranger's Hut"" which was about 70 kilometres east of Glen Innes.  That evening, whilst at the caravan park, the deceased made a number of telephone calls to friends, informing them of his intentions to ""ride the summit"" the next day.    
18At the time of being taken to the caravan park the deceased had in his possession an ""Apollo"" brand road bike, a black backpack and a bicycle helmet.  The owner of the caravan park told police that at the time the deceased paid for his accommodation, he was observed to have a substantial amount of money in his possession, amounting to at least $1,000.00.
19On the morning of 29 October 2010 the deceased had coffee at the kiosk at the caravan park, purchased sweets for the ride, and left the caravan park at around 8:30am.  At approximately 11:30am, he reached Ranger's Hut where he made a number of telephone calls to friends, indicating that he had arrived.  A recipient of one of those calls told police that during the conversation with the deceased she heard a female voice in the background, at which time the deceased said that he had to leave because his ""lift"" had just arrived.  The deceased was identified by a number of witnesses as having cycled along the Gwydir Highway that day.  He was also identified as being at a public telephone box at Ranger's Hut.
20On the same morning Dawson had driven to Casino to see Aquilina.  Aquilina then approached the offender asking him to travel with him to Red Range.  Aquilina told the offender that Dawson was having troubles with her neighbour (the deceased) and that he (Aquilina) was proposing to go over there and ""sort it out"".  The offender initially expressed some concerns about going, referring to the fact that he had only recently been released from gaol.  He nevertheless agreed to go.  The offender saw his role, at that point, as one of ""back up"" in the event that the deceased was to ""get the better"" of either Aquilina or Dawson.
21Dawson then drove Aquilina and the offender to her property at Red Range, stopping en route in Glen Innes to purchase a quantity of alcohol.  During the journey, Dawson spoke of the difficulties she had been having with the deceased.
22After arriving at Red Range, Dawson left Aquilina and the offender at her property in an area known as The Old Butter Factory which housed an open shed.  Dawson then drove to the top of the Gibraltar Range and collected the deceased, before returning to Red Range.  Whilst Aquilina and the offender were at Red Range awaiting the arrival of Dawson and the deceased, Aquilina gave the offender a carving knife.
23The deceased and Dawson returned to Dawson's premises at Red Range. When they arrived, the deceased went to the area where the offender and Aquilina were waiting, at which time the offender approached him and they greeted each other.  Simultaneously, Aquilina approached the deceased from behind and struck him to the back of the head with an iron bar, causing a laceration to his head.  The deceased, who had been stunned by the blow, was assisted by the offender who proceeded to explain to the deceased why he had been struck.  
24The deceased was thereafter questioned by Aquilina and Dawson, in the offender's presence, concerning his behaviour towards Dawson.  He repeatedly denied the allegations which were put to him.  At some point, the offender and Aquilina walked away, at which time Aquilina told the offender he was intending to kill the deceased.  The offender replied:  
""What? ... Dude, don't need to do that shit, talk to the bloke and try and get him to just stay on his property"".
25Aquilina and the offender then returned.  The deceased was then assaulted by Dawson and Aquilina in the presence of the offender.  Dawson and Aquilina told the deceased that he could not leave, as they wanted to ""sort everything out"".  The deceased walked past the offender, who was seated at the time.  The offender got up and told the deceased to remain and ""sort things out"".  
26At one point during the assault by Dawson and Aquilina, the deceased fell over and hit his head on a table, following which he hit the ground.  During the fall, the deceased's glasses were broken and he sustained a cut across the nose which drew blood.  When the deceased was on the ground, he was further assaulted with the offender watching.  It must have been apparent to the offender at this point that he was unlikely to be required to perform any ""back up"" role as he had originally thought.  I am satisfied that the offender was in a position to stop the violence perpetrated on the deceased, but did not do so.
27When the deceased was lying on the ground, Aquilina located a thick piece of rope that was nearby.  He used it to fashion a noose which he placed around the neck of the deceased who was still lying on the ground.  Aquilina commenced pulling on the rope and continued to do so for 15 to 20 minutes before handing the rope to the offender.  Aquilina then grabbed the rope back from the offender, telling the offender that he was not pulling it tightly enough.  Aquilina proceeded to pull the rope until such time as the deceased was blue in the face, and obviously dead.  
28I am satisfied that the offender was aware that the deceased was going to be killed when Aquilina was pulling on the rope.  I am also satisfied that the offender held onto the rope for some short period and pulled on it.  However, I am satisfied that the physical act of choking the deceased was that of Aquilina.
29The body of the deceased was then loaded into the rear of Dawson's vehicle by herself, Aquilina and the offender, with the aid of a wheel barrow.  The deceased's bike was placed on top of him.  The area where the violence had occurred was then cleaned with bleach and hosed off.
30In the company of the offender and Aquilina, Dawson then drove the vehicle, containing the body of the deceased, to an isolated location known as Sandy Hill, located approximately 27 kilometres east of the township of Tenterfield.  The body of the deceased was disposed of near a dirt fire trail at that location, and covered with sticks and leaves.  All three persons then left the area.
31On 31 October 2010, Dawson, the offender and Aquilina returned to Sandy Hill  There, the offender and Aquilina dragged the body of the deceased through a fence line, and rolled it down a steep slope until it hit a fallen tree, where they used sticks and branches to cover it.  They then returned to the car and left the area with Dawson, in her vehicle.
32On Monday 15 November 2010, the deceased's brother attended the Glen Innes Police Station and reported the deceased's disappearance to the police.  A police investigation was then commenced, and evidence was obtained detailing events leading up to what were the last public sightings of the deceased on 29 October 2010.  The police investigation included the use of warrants authorising the interception of telephone services, as well as the use of listening devices at the premises occupied by the offender and Aquilina.
33The use of the listening devices, in particular, provided the investigating police with evidence linking Dawson, Aquilina and the offender to the death of the deceased.  Other evidence obtained by the police established that between late October and early November 2010, bank accounts of the deceased were accessed, and the contents used to purchase a variety of items at locations in Northern New South Wales.  The police investigation in this respect revealed that the transactions were conducted by the offender, in the company of other persons. 
34The offender was arrested on 5 January 2011 at premises in Grafton, New South Wales.  He participated in a electronically recorded interview, which has been tendered before me on sentence, in which he made various admissions relating to the deceased's death.
35The body of the deceased was located on 1 January 2011 down an embankment at Sandy Hill.  His decomposed remains were still clothed in his bike riding apparel.  A length of rope was tied around his neck and had wrapped around his torso, which had been crudely covered by sticks and branches, and left exposed.
36A post mortem was conducted by Professor Tim Lyons, Forensic Pathologist.  The ultimate opinion of Professor Lyons was that the noose around the deceased's neck gave rise to neck compression and asphyxia, causing his death.  He said that when pressure is applied to the neck area, there are three common mechanisms which can be associated with resultant death, namely:  
(a)restriction of the airway;
(b)obstruction of the blood supply;
(c)the application of pressure to nerves of the neck.
37Professor Lyons described the noose as being 40 centimetres in circumference, and found that it had been wrapped twice around the deceased's body.  Leaving aside detected defects in the soft tissues of the clavicle, Professor Lyons also observed that there was a defect in the deceased's body consistent with his genitalia being absent.  However, he was not able to come to a definitive conclusion as to whether the deceased's genitals had been removed by a person, or whether they had been removed as a consequence of animal predation or heavy maggot infestation.
38It is evident from his statements to the police when interviewed that the offender, from the outset, had some concerns about what might occur if were to go to Red Range.  That, in my view, is the only reasonable construction which can be placed upon his reference, when Aquilina asked him to go with him, to the fact that he had only recently been released from gaol.  However, I am satisfied that at least at that point, the offender saw his role as being that of a back up for others, rather than the instigator of any violence.
39It was submitted on behalf of the offender that I should find that his involvement commenced at or about the time he was given the rope by Aquilina.  However, such a finding would, ignore what had occurred up to that point.  Although I am not satisfied that the offender knew that Aquilina was going to assault the deceased with the iron bar upon his arrival, he was necessarily aware, from the point at which that assault occurred (particularly in circumstances where he had been given a knife by Aquilina) of the likelihood of violence being perpetrated on the deceased.  Contrary to the submission made on behalf of the offender, I do not regard the fact that the offender chose to come to the deceased's aid at that time as affecting, in any way, the offender's awareness of the likelihood of violence.  
40More significantly, as a result of his subsequent conversation with Aquilina, the offender became directly aware of Aquilina's intention to kill the deceased.  Whilst the offender's attempt to dissuade Aquilina from carrying out his stated intention was laudable, the fact is that thereafter, and with direct knowledge of Aquilina's intention to kill the deceased, the offender remained present, observing gratuitous violence being perpetrated upon the deceased who was largely defenceless.  The offender conceded to police that he had been in a position to stop that violence, but did not do so.  Not only did he not stop the violence, he prevented the deceased from leaving the area.
41Counsel for the offender submitted that because a period of time had elapsed following the offender's conversation with Aquilina when no violence was perpetrated on the deceased, the offender was entitled to assume that Aquilina had decided not to take his stated intentions any further.  That may be so.  However, the submission overlooks the fact that when the violence resumed, the offender observed it, took no steps to stop it, and assisted by preventing the deceased from leaving.   He had no reason to think at that point that Aquilina had been dissuaded in any way from his stated intentions.  
42Moreover, having been present when Aquilina fashioned the noose, the offender must have been acutely aware, at that point, that Aquilina's previously stated intentions were about to be carried out.  There is no suggestion that the offender tried to dissuade Aquilina at that point.  Indeed on the evidence, the offender stood by, watching Aquilina choke the deceased with the rope, in circumstances where he was ready, willing and able to assist as and when required.      
43The offender himself told police that Aquilina had given him the rope, and that that he (the offender) had then held on to it before Aquilina grabbed the rope from him, telling him that he was 'not holdin' it tight enough'.  I am satisfied that the offender pulled on the rope when he was holding it, although it is evident from Aquilina's statement to him that he was doing so with limited force.  I am satisfied that in terms of the pulling of the rope, the offender's role was minimal compared with that of Aquilina.  However, the offender remained nearby, willing and able to assist.
44The offending had a number of aggravating features.  The use of a ligature has been treated as a form of weapon (as to which see Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76) and accordingly this is an aggravating feature pursuant to s21A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act.  Further, the offence was committed in company (s21A(2)(e) of the Sentencing Act).  
45The offender has a lengthy history of previous convictions dating back to 1987, recorded in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.  Whilst those convictions are not on the scale of the present offending, the offender's criminal history is nevertheless an aggravating factor under s. 21A(2)(d) of the Sentencing Act.  
46Further, the offender's criminal history establishes that only 9 days prior to the commission of the murder offence, he had received the benefit of a suspended sentence following an appearance at the Southport Magistrate's Court on a charge of possessing a dangerous drug. Accordingly, the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of the murder offence which is an aggravating factor under s21A(2)(j) of the Sentencing Act.
47The offender's participation, on two separate occasions, in the treatment of the deceased's body at Sandy Hill following his death is also an aggravating factor (see for example Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315).   
48Having regard to the fact that Professor Lyons was not able to come to a definitive conclusion about the matter, I am not satisfied the deceased's body had been mutilated by the removal of his genitalia.  Even if I were in a position to be satisfied of that fact, there is no evidence at all which would link that mutilation to any conduct on the part of the offender.  In any event, the general principle that treatment of the body of the deceased (of a kind in which the offender was involved) is capable of amounting to an aggravating factor has been extended to cases where such treatment did not involve any form of mutilation:  R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170; R v Dong [2010] NSWSC 1242.  
49In my view, taking into account all of these factors, the offending falls at the mid range of objective seriousness.  
The dishonesty offences50Whilst at Red Range, the offender took a backpack belonging to the deceased, from which he removed the deceased's wallet.  He removed a sum of $500.00 in $50.00 notes which he held up before Aquilina, who took them.  The offender then took possession of credit cards, key cards and a cheque book belonging to the deceased.  
51In the days following, the offender used the credit cards to make purchases of various kinds.  He also forged two cheques, one of which was successfully negotiated.  It was these activities which finally brought the offender to the attention of the police.  
52The dishonesty offences were committed over a short period between 30 October 2010 and 1 November 2010.  The items purchased included mobile telephones, running shoes and alcohol.  There is no specific information before me as to the value of the property which was obtained but having regard to the nature of the items which were purchased, the total sum would seemingly be relatively modest.  That said, multiple offences were committed over several days and the offending is aggravated by the fact of the offender's criminal history, which includes numerous entries for offences of dishonesty.
The Commonwealth offences53On 29 May 2008 a bank account (""the CBA account"") was opened at the Casino branch of the Commonwealth Bank.  On 2 July 2008 an account at the Greater Building Society (""the GBS account"") was opened at the Casino branch.
54Centrelink documents, each bearing the number 403342082s, were used to open each of the CBA account and GBS account.  That number was registered with the Australian Taxation Office (""ATO"") as having been allocated to the offender.  
55The ATO operates a system of self-assessment, by which it is assumed that taxpayers are honest, and provide information that is true, unless there is material to show otherwise.  Assessments are made on the basis of the information provided in a taxpayer's return and in these circumstances, returns are not generally examined in detail before assessments are made.  The ATO conducts various audit programs to monitor taxpayer compliance with the law.
56Consistent with the self-assessment system, Income Tax Returns (""ITRs"") are electronically scanned onto the computer system operated by the ATO.  To expedite the processing, payment summaries are not required to be attached to paper income returns, with employer details being subsequently matched for audit purposes.
57On 5 June 2008, three ITRs, each for the year ending 30 June 2007, were lodged with the ATO in the names of:(i)Andrew Duncan;
(ii)Mitchell Sonnex; and
(iii)Kristine Weston.
58A review of those returns established the following:
(i)each statutory declaration within each return was identical. This included the period of employment of 2 June 2007 to 28 December 2007 the majority of that period being in the 2008 financial year, and not the 2007 financial year to which the return related). Whilst the statutory declarations were identical, the employers listed in the ITRs in the name Duncan and Sonnex were different to the employers listed in the statutory declarations;
(ii)each of the three ITRs was received by the ATO on the same day;
(iii)each figure in the body of each ITR was identical to the corresponding figure in the other ITRs;
(iv)each of the three ITRs nominated the CBA account into which any refund was to be paid.
59Refunds for the ITRs in the names of Duncan and Sonnex issued on 24 June 2008.  The refund for the ITR in the name Weston issued on 26 June 2008.  Each refund was for a sum of $7,014.30, and each was paid into the CBA account.
60On 10, 11 and 14 July 2008, a further ten ITRs for the year ended 30 June 2008 were received by the ATO in the names of:
(i)Christopher Barnard;
(ii)David Comber;
(iii)Selena Randall;
(iv)Adam Richards;
(v)Helen Richards;
(vi)Peter Richards;
(vii)Mitchell Sonnex;
(viii)David Wells;
(ix)Kristine Weston; and 
(x)Susan Williams.
61Once again the figures in the body of the returns were identical to each other, as well as being identical to those in the 2007 returns.
62A review of these additional ten ITRs established the following:
(i)five of the ITRs listed the relevant employer as Enviro Green Pty Limited, whilst five listed the employer as Hans Continental Small Goods Pty Limited;
(ii)there was a variation of one day in the starting period of employment;
(iii)five statutory declarations were purportedly witnessed by a Queensland police officer at Upper Mount Gravatt Police Station, and another five by a Queensland police officer at Ferny Grove Police Station;
(iv)eight returns listed at the GBS account as that into which any refund was to be paid, whilst the remaining two listed the CBA account for that purpose.
63Refunds issued from the ATO to the relevant nominated account between 29 July 2008 and 4 August 2008.  Each refund was for a sum of $8114.30, with the exception of that relating to the ITR submitted in the name of Helen Richards. The refund in relation to that ITR was in the sum $8614.30, the additional rebate being paid on the basis that the nominated taxpayer was purportedly a senior citizen.
64Overall, thirteen returns were processed by the ATO resulting in total refunds of $102,685.90. 
65The statutory declarations contained in each ITR listed two employers, either Enviro Green Pty Limited, or Hans Continental Small Goods Pty Limited.  Offices of each organisation confirmed that none of the nominated taxpayers had ever worked for them.  Moreover, both of the two Queensland Police Officers whose names appeared on the statutory declarations confirmed that they did not witness them.  
66Nine of the thirteen persons in whose names the ITRs were lodged denied any involvement in their lodgement.
67An analysis of the GBS account established that after its opening deposit of $1.00 on 2 July 2008, the only deposits up until 6 August 2008 were deposits constituted by eight refund cheques issued from the ATO in respect of ITR's lodged in the names of David Comber, Adam Richards, Mitchell Sonnex, Selan Randall, David Wells, Helen Richards, Kristine Weston and Peter Richards.
68An analysis of the GBS account demonstrated that withdrawals commenced on 29 July 2008, coinciding with the date on which the first of the refunds from the ATO had been credited to the account.  The analysis also demonstrated that various cash withdrawals, as well as a cheque withdrawal in favour of the offender, were made from the account.  The offender was identified, from still images obtained from CCTV footage, as the person responsible for those withdrawals.69A similar analysis was conducted in respect of the CBA account.  It demonstrated that the only deposits to the account between 24 June 2008 and 4 August 2008 were the five ATO deposits in the names of Andrew Duncan, Mitchell Sonnex, Kristine Weston, Susan Williams and Christopher Barnard.  The only other deposits, which were each cheques drawn on the GBS account, were for $20,842.90 and $12,500, which were carried out on 29 and 30 July 2008 respectively.  Withdrawal slips in relation to the CBA account were each signed in the name of the offender.
70Pursuant to s. 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Com) (""the Commonwealth Act"") I am required to impose a sentence for the Commonwealth offences that is of a severity which is appropriate in all of the circumstances.  Pursuant to s. 16A(2), I am required to take into account such of the matters enumerated in that section as are relevant, together with any other relevant factors.  Some of the matters in s16Aare relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, whilst others go to subjective considerations.  I have dealt with all of these matters separately below.
THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES71The offender pleaded guilty to the murder offence only a matter of days prior to the scheduled commencement of the trial.  A number of submissions have been made in relation to the circumstances which led to the entering of that plea.  The Crown sought to emphasise that an application for a separate trial, and an application for the exclusion of the offender's record of interview, were foreshadowed but were not ultimately pursued.  The Crown suggested that this was because the applications were futile.  I am not aware why they did not proceed but in my view, that is of limited significance.  The more significant issue is that the plea was entered at what was, on any view, a very late stage.    
72In the circumstances, I have applied a discount of 10% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea to the murder offence, having particular regard to the time at which it was entered (see generally R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383).
73The pleas entered in respect of the dishonesty offences are in a different category.  They were entered in the Local Court and in my view there is no reason why the maximum discount of 25% should not be applied.      
74 Counsel for the offender relied on a number of other statutory mitigating factors.  The first was pursuant to s. 21A(3)(b), namely that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.  I accept that it was not until after the offender attended Red Range that he contemplated that serious bodily injury may be inflicted upon the deceased and that it was not until his conversation with Aquilina that he was aware of any intention on the part of Aquilina that he (Aquilina) intended to kill the deceased.  I accept the submission on behalf of the offender that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
75Counsel for the offender also submitted that the offender had shown remorse within the meaning of s. 21A(3)(i).  That section provides that remorse shown by the offender for the offence is a mitigating factor but only if: 
(i)the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions; and
(ii)the offender has acknowledged any injury loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury loss or damage (or both).
76Counsel for the offender submitted that by virtue of his co-operation with the police and his plea of guilty to the charge, I should infer that the offender had accepted responsibility for his actions, and had acknowledged the loss suffered by the death of the deceased.  Counsel referred me, in particular, to the offender's answers to questions 471 and 479 of his interview with police.  In the course the first of those answers, the offender had said that he wanted ""to get this off (his) chest"".  In his answer to question 479 the offender said to police:
""I wish it never happened. I can't believe I did, when out and did somthin' stupid tryin' to help a mate, like someone that I thought was a mate.""
77It should also be noted that the report of Mr Champion, psychologist, which was relied upon by counsel for the offender, contained the following observation:
""In relation to the issue of remorse/contrition it would be difficult to suggest that Mr Comber expressed much in the way of regret other than a general comment that he felt ""bad"" it happened.  When asked again how he felt about what happened he commenced that it was 'hard to say ... I didn't know the bloke ...not much I could do ...not in my hands.  He commented at a later stage that he 'turned off quicker now ... don't feel as much', this I think reflecting my earlier comments about blunted sensibilities and emotional detachment"".
78These observations do not assist the offender.  It would be incorrect to confuse expressions of regret, with expressions of genuine remorse of the kind to which s. 21A(3)(i) is directed.  However on balance, I am satisfied that a combination of the circumstances relied upon by the offender constitutes remorse of the kind to which the section in directed.
79Counsel for the offender further submitted that the circumstances of the present case fell within the provisions of s. 23(1) of the Sentencing Act which is in the following terms:
23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities 
(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence. 
80Counsel submitted that because the offender had agreed to take part in a record of interview where he made admissions in relation to the offence, and because he agreed to assist the authorities in recovering the credit cards and identification documents belonging to the deceased, his actions in this regard constituted assistance of the kind which s. 23 was directed.  I do not accept this submission.  
81In my view, the assistance to which this section is primarily directed is the type of assistance considered in cases such as R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 and R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243.  Acceptance of the submission advanced on behalf of the offender would give rise to a situation where each and every offender who had taken part in a record of interview would be entitled to the benefit of a lesser penalty by virtue of the provisions of s23.  In my view, that is not how the section ought be construed.  
82In further support of his submission in relation to s23, counsel submitted that in the absence of the admissions made by the offender, the Crown would have been ""left with a weak circumstantial case"".   The Crown took issue with that proposition.  Whilst I accept that without the offender's admissions the Crown case would necessarily have been a wholly circumstantial, I am not in a position, on the evidence which has been placed before me, to make any determination beyond that.  I have, however, previously noted (at paragraph [32]) that there were conversations, to which the offender was a party, which were recorded by listening device and in which the murder of the deceased was discussed.   
83As I have noted, counsel for the offender relied upon a report of Peter Champion, Clinical Psychologist, of 14 September 2012 which contained information concerning the offender's background.  The offender is presently 38 years of age and has little formal education.  He reported a history of poly substance abuse to Mr Champion in respect of which he was, until recently, in receipt of methadone.  The offender provided a history to Mr Champion of having been adopted at about the age of 2, and asserted that he had been exposed to abuse and neglect as a result.  
84Mr Champion did not conclude that the offender was mentally ill and in relation to the risk of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation, Mr Champion reported in the following terms:
""In regards to his prognosis there are a range of risk factors present which include substance abuse, a pattern of chronic offending, emotional detachment and distorted personality functioning which includes anti social features, and institutionalisation. 
Whether these risk factors would necessarily lead him to commit this sort of offence (murder) again is not clear, though one thinks that the risk of future offending behaviour in general would be significant, particularly if he continues to have no motivation for change; and his prognosis would seem poor overall"".
85In these circumstances, I am unable to come to any conclusion in favour of the offender regarding his prospects of rehabilitation.  Quite apart from the opinion expressed by Mr Champion, the offender's criminal history provides me with no confidence in that respect.  That record extends across a number of states of Australia, and includes a range of criminal offending and at least one breach of probation.  The Crown submitted that the offender's criminal history indicates that he is completely unresponsive to supervision, post release counselling and assistance, and has been consistently so for more than 20 years.  I accept that submission.  There is no support for a finding that the offender's risk of re-offending is low, or that his prospects of rehabilitation are good.
86Counsel for the offender also submitted that because of the offender's criminal history, there was a significant issue in relation to institutionalisation which should be taken into account on sentence.  There is certainly authority for the proposition that a risk of institutionalisation is a basis for a finding of special circumstances (see Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24] per Fullerton J and the authorities cited therein).   However, I am not prepared to find special circumstances within the meaning of the Sentencing Act.  In my view, the period of parole that I propose to impose will be sufficiently lengthy to make allowance for the offender's need for rehabilitation.
FACTORS IN RELATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH OFFENCES87As I have previously noted, s. 16A(2) of the Commonwealth Act sets out a number of factors which I am required to take into account, in so far as they are relevant, in determining the appropriate sentence for the Commonwealth offences.  I note that counsel for the offender did not address me specifically in respect of these factors, other than those which were common to those to relevant to the other offences.    
The nature and circumstances of the offence (s. 16A(2)(a))88The facts before the court indicate that the offender opened two bank accounts which, I am satisfied, were opened for the sole purpose of facilitating the receipt of the monies gained from his criminal activity.  The amount of money involved in the commission of the offences was significant and the offences were, for the reasons that I have already expressed, the subject of some degree of pre planning.  The offending was systematic, and the offender used the money for his own benefit.
Course of conduct (s. 16A(2)(c))89The offending constituted a course of conduct which occurred over a period of more than two months. It involved the creation of a number of false documents, the forging of signatures, the setting up of two bank accounts solely for the purposes of providing a vehicle to receive money which had been obtained dishonestly.  The offender then withdrew the entirety of the money so obtained.   



Contrition and remorse (s. 16A(2)(f))90The offender has pleaded guilty to the offence, a matter which I have discussed in further detail below.  I regard this as some evidence of contrition and remorse on his part.
The plea of guilty (s. 16A(2)(g))91In respect of the Commonwealth offence, a plea of guilty should be taken into account subjectively as a mitigating factor, on the basis that it demonstrates a willingness to facilitate the course of justice (see Cameron v R (2002) 209 CLR 339 at 343; Tyler v R; R v Chalmers (2007) 173 A Crim R 458).  
92As is the case with the other offences, a significant factor relevant to an assessment of the discount is the timing of the plea.  I am also entitled to consider whether or not the offender's plea was motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or was simply a recognition of the inevitable (see for example Danial v R [2008] NSWCCA 15 at [28]).  Further, although the scale in Thomson (supra) does not expressly apply to Commonwealth offences, it has been observed that the principles stated in that case are generally applicable to sentencing for Commonwealth offences, such that the range of discount of 10 to 25 percent is reasonable to adopt (see for example R v Otto (2005) 157 A Crim R 540).
93In the present case, it has been submitted that the plea was entered in the face of a strong Crown case and was, in those circumstances, a recognition of the inevitable.  On this basis, it has been submitted that the offender is entitled only to a limited discount.
94It is difficult for me on the evidence before the court to determine the strength of the Crown case.  The pleas were, on the information available to me, entered before the Local Court and in my view, should be regarded in those circumstances as having been entered at the first available opportunity.  In my view, there is no reason why the offender ought not have the benefit of a reduction of 25% in these circumstances.
Deterrent effect  (s. 16A(2)(j))95There is evidence in the present case that the offender used the money for his own benefit and there is evidence that his criminal history contains a number of previous offences of dishonesty.  In these circumstances, specific deterrence is necessarily a consideration.
The need for adequate punishment (s. 16A(2)(k))96I accept the submission on behalf of the Crown that the offender's conduct in the present case constitutes a serious breach of the law, and that regard must be had to the need for general deterrence.
Character and prior convictions (s. 16A(2)(m))97I have already observed when dealing with issues in relation to the other matters for which the offender faces sentence that he has a criminal history and is adversely recorded in four separate States in Australia.  Whilst I do not propose to set out in detail his criminal history, it is sufficient for present purposes to note that it contains a number of offences of dishonesty.  That history gives rise to a need for personal deterrence.
98I have taken all of these matters into account in determining the appropriate sentence.
99I further note s. 16A of the Commonwealth Act provides that the court may only impose a sentence of imprisonment if satisfied that imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence.  In all of the circumstances of the present case, and having regard to the various matters to which I have referred, I am of the view that a period of full time imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence for the Commonwealth offences.  
100My attention has also been directed to s. 19 of the Commonwealth Act which is in the following terms:
Cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent sentences 
(1)  Where a person who is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences is at the time of that conviction or those convictions, serving, or subject to, one or more federal, State or Territory sentences, the court must, when imposing a federal sentence for that federal offence, or for each of those federal offences, by order direct when the federal sentence commences, but so that: 
(a)  no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and 
(b)  if a non-parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences--the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non-parole period commences immediately after the end of the period. 
(2)  Where: 
(a)  a person is convicted of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and 
(b)  the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences; 
the court must, by order, direct when each sentence commences, but so that no sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or of the last to end of those sentences. 
(3)  Where: 
(a)  a person is convicted of a federal offence or offences, and a State or Territory offence or offences, at the same sitting; and 
(b)  the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences; 
the court must, by order, direct when each federal sentence commences but so that: 
(c)  no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and 
(d)  if a non-parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences--the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non-parole period commences immediately after the end of the period. 
(4)  For the purpose of fixing the commencement of a sentence under this section, a reference in this section to a sentence the commencement of which has already been fixed includes a reference to another sentence imposed at the same time as the first-mentioned sentence. 

101My attention has also been drawn to the provisions of s. 19AB of the Commonwealth Act which is in the following terms:
When court must fix non-parole period or make a recognizance release order (1)  Subject to subsection (3), where: 
(a)  a person is convicted of a federal offence, or of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and 
(b)  a court imposes on the person a federal life sentence, or a federal sentence that exceeds, or federal sentences that, in the aggregate, exceed 3 years; and 
(c)  at the time the sentence or sentences are imposed, the person is not already serving or subject to a federal sentence; 
the court must either: 
(d)  fix a single non-parole period in respect of that sentence or those sentences; or 
                     (e)  make a recognizance release order. 
(2)  Subject to subsection (3), where: 
(a)  while a person is in prison and is serving or subject to a federal sentence, a further federal sentence is imposed on the person; and 
(b)  the result is that the person is to serve or to complete a federal life sentence or federal sentences the unserved portions of which, in the aggregate, exceed 3 years; and 
(c)  at the time the further federal sentence is imposed, the person is not already subject to a non-parole period or recognizance release order in respect of a federal sentence; 
the court imposing the further sentence must either: 
(d)  fix a single non-parole period in respect of all federal sentences the person is to serve or complete; or 
                     (e)  make a recognizance release order. 
(3)  Where, but for this subsection, a court would be required by this section to fix a non-parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect of a person, the court may decline to do either if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the person, the court is satisfied that neither is appropriate. 
(4)  Where the court decides that neither a non-parole period nor a recognizance release order is appropriate, the court must: 
                      (a)  state its reasons for so deciding; and 
(b)  cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court. 

102In terms of s. 19AB, the Crown in respect of the Commonwealth offences  conceded that it would be open to me not to impose either a non-parole period or a recognisance release order.  In the circumstances I do not propose to impose either.  My reason for taking that course is because the offender will, as a consequence of the sentence that I propose to impose in respect of the murder offence, be subjected to a lengthy period of custody which will be far in excess of that which I propose to impose in respect of the Commonwealth offences.
103Notwithstanding the fact that they constitute offending which is quite separate from both the murder offence and the dishonesty offences, the Crown in respect of the Commonwealth offences submitted that I should structure the matter such that the sentences imposed for those offences would run wholly concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the murder offence.  In circumstances where, had the matter proceeded in the normal course, the Commonwealth matters would have been dealt with to finality some time ago, I propose to accede to the Crown's submission.  
104There will be some partial accumulation in respect of the sentences imposed for the dishonesty offences with that imposed for the murder offence.  
CONCLUSIONCommonwealth offences105In respect of each of the Commonwealth offences, being the offence pursuant to s. 400.5 of the Code and the offence pursuant to s. 400.6 of the Code, the offender is convicted.
106In respect of each of those matters, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 5 January 2011 and ending on 4 July 2012.
107I decline, for the reasons I have previously stated, to fix a recognisance release order or a non-parole period in respect of either of those sentences.
The dishonesty offences108In respect of each of the offences pursuant to s. 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, which are annexed to the certificate issued pursuant to s. 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the offender is convicted.  
109In respect of each of those matters I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months.  Each of those terms of imprisonment will commence on 5 January 2011 and conclude on 4 July 2011.
The murder offence110In respect of the murder offence, the offender is convicted.
111The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 17 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 5 April 2011 and concluding on 4 October 2028, with an additional period of 5 years and 10 months imprisonment commencing on 5 October 2028 and ending on 4 August 2034.
112The total term of imprisonment imposed in respect of the murder offence is one of 23 years and 4 months imprisonment.
113The offender will be eligible for parole on 5 October 2028 and his sentence will expire on 4 August 2034.
114I record the fact that but for the offender's plea of guilty, the appropriate sentence for the murder offence would have been a non-parole period of 19 years and 6 months with an additional term of 6 years and 6 months, that is, a total term of imprisonment of 26 years.

		10 December 2012",2012-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760621,R v Karen Dawson [2012] NSWSC 1497,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1On 27 August 2012 Karen Dawson (""the offender"") was indicted for the murder of Adrian John Trevett (""the deceased""), contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act"").   
2The offender pleaded not guilty to that offence and stood trial jointly with her son, Mathew Aquilina (""Aquilina"").
3On 26 September 2012 both the offender and Aquilina were found guilty by the jury.  A third offender, David Comber (""Comber"") had pleaded guilty to a charge of murder shortly before the trial commenced.
4The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is one of life imprisonment pursuant to s 19A of the Act.
5A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed for the offence pursuant to s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"").
6Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Act mandates the imposition of a life sentence if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence.  The Crown has conceded that the circumstances in which the offender committed the offence are not such as to attract the provisions of s 61(1).  I am satisfied that the imposition of a life sentence is not warranted.
7In determining the appropriate sentence, I am not required to assess whether or not, having regard to the standard non-parole period, the offence is within the middle range of objective seriousness.  Similarly, I am not required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]).  The relevant statutory provisions, particularly ss 21A, 54B(2) and 54B(3) of the Sentencing Act require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified and, having regard to all such factors, a determination reached as to the appropriate sentence (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]).  
8The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the 'non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness'.  It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27]; [31]).
9The court received a victim impact statement from Lee Ostler, the deceased's niece.  Whilst Ms Ostler chose not to read that statement to the court, I have done so.  The statement sets out the effect and impact of the deceased's death upon his family, and particularly his brother.   
10As I did when the matter was before me for the purposes of hearing submissions on sentence, I express my sympathy to the members of the deceased's family.  It is to be hoped that the opportunity which Ms Ostler has taken to provide her statement will assist her family's process of grieving.  The authorities make clear the approach which is to be taken by a sentencing Judge in relation to statements of that kind in a case such as the present (see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76).
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING11For the purposes of determining the appropriate sentence, I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the circumstances of the offending.  Any factual findings I make must be consistent with the verdict returned by the jury.  In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by that verdict, and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is inconsistent with it (see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374).
12The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender.  The offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation on the balance of probabilities.  
13The Crown case against the offender was that she was part of an extended joint criminal enterprise with Aquilina and Comber, amounting to an agreement that the deceased would be assaulted by the application of physical force.  It was the Crown case that in participating in that agreement, the offender contemplated the possibility that in carrying out that crime, there may be a wilful act or acts carried out with the intention of inflicting really serious bodily injury upon the deceased.   
14Much of the evidence given at the trial was not the subject of any real dispute on the part of the offender.  Bearing in mind that evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following facts.
15At the time of his death the deceased was aged 62. He resided alone in a caravan which was located on a vacant block of land at Red Range, a small village situated east of the township of Glen Innes in northern New South Wales.  The deceased was well known in the local area.  An avid cycling enthusiast who used his bicycle as his principal mode of transportation, he operated a small business selling fruit and vegetables from a cart in Glen Innes as a means of supplementing his income.  
16At the time of the deceased's death, the offender resided, with her 12 year old son Brandon, on a property, the boundary of which adjoined that of the deceased.  As a consequence the offender and the deceased became friends.  They would socialise together, and were in the habit of drinking heavily in each other's presence.    
17At some time in or about the middle of 2010, the relationship between the offender and the deceased became strained.  Evidence was given by a number of persons called by the Crown at the trial that the offender had complained to them that the deceased was sexually harassing her, that he was attending her premises uninvited, that he was drinking her alcohol and that he had assaulted her son.  I am satisfied that those complaints were made by the offender in the period leading up to the deceased's death.
18In addition, there was evidence called by the Crown at the trial that the offender had complained to a friend that whilst minding her grandchildren, she had seen the deceased inappropriately touch one of them (the child in question being a child of her son, the co-offender Aquilina).  I am satisfied, having regard to the evidence given at trial, that such a complaint was made by the offender.  Although the time at which such complaint was made is not entirely clear, I am satisfied that it was within a few weeks prior to the death of the deceased.   
19On 28 October 2010 the offender drove the deceased to the Jackadgery Caravan Park which was located on the Gwydir Highway, 120 kilometres east of Glen Innes.  It was the intention of the deceased to stay the night at that location, before undertaking a cycling trip across the Gibraltar Range on the following day.  The offender left the deceased at that location and arranged to collect him on the following day from a location known as Ranger's Hut, which was on the eastern side of the Gibraltar Range, further towards Glen Innes.
20When taken to the caravan park by the offender, the deceased had in his possession an ""Apollo"" road bike, along with a black backpack and a bicycle helmet.  He was in possession of approximately $1,000.00 when he checked into the caravan park.
21On the morning of 29 October 2010 the offender drove to Casino to see Aquilina.  I am satisfied that the purpose of doing so was to discuss, with Aquilina, the behaviour of the deceased which the offender had reported to other persons in the period leading up to that time.  I am also satisfied that at the instigation of the offender, Aquilina agreed to travel with her to Red Range for the purpose of confronting the deceased about his alleged behaviour.  I am also satisfied that the offender was aware that the proposed confrontation could involve violence.  It was Aquilina who asked Comber to accompany them.
22The offender then drove Aquilina and Comber from Casino to Red Range, stopping en route at Glen Innes for the purpose of purchasing alcohol.  Evidence was given at the trial that Aquilina was in possession of an iron bar when he left Casino.  However, I am satisfied that the offender did not know this to be the case.  Upon arrival at Red Range, the offender left Aquilina and Comber in an area known as the ""Old Butter Factory"" which was adjacent to her premises.  That area housed an open shed with a cement floor and some items of furniture.  
23Having left Aquilina and Comber at Red Range, the offender went to collect the deceased, before returning.  Upon their arrival at Red Range, the offender left the deceased in the area of the Old Butter Factory, where she knew Aquilina and Comber were waiting, before going into her house.  Upon entering the area of the Old Butter Factory, the offender was struck on the head from behind by Aquilina with the iron bar.  The offender was not present at that time and I am satisfied that she did not know until some later time that the deceased had been assaulted by Aquilina in that way.  
24Aquilina then called the offender to join himself, the deceased, and Comber.  The offender then left her premises and made her way down to the Old Butter Factory.  I am satisfied that it was at that time that the offender became aware that the deceased had been subject to violence in her absence.  
25Following the arrival of the offender at the Old Butter Factory, various allegations were put to the deceased about his behaviour towards the offender.  I am also satisfied that during this period the deceased was subject to a number of acts of violence.  This included the offender herself assaulting the deceased by punching him with a closed fist, and the deceased being punched and kicked by Aquilina before being knocked to the ground.  
26At a time when the deceased was, in the presence of the offender, lying helpless on the ground, Aquilina fashioned a noose from a length of rope which had been found nearby.  The rope was then placed around the deceased's neck by Aquilina, and was used to kill the deceased.  On the evidence at trial, Aquilina was the person primarily responsible for pulling on the rope.  The Crown has not submitted that I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender pulled on the rope.  
27Following the deceased's death, his body was loaded into the rear of the offender's vehicle, with the aid of a wheelbarrow, by the offender, Aquilina and Comber.  The offender then drove in her vehicle, with Aquilina and Comber as passengers, to Sandy Hill, a location approximately 27 kilometres east of Tenterfield.  Upon arrival, the deceased's body was disposed of in the bush and barely covered.  The offender then drove Aquilina and Comber back to Glen Innes.
28Two days later, on 31 October 2010, the offender returned to Sandy Hill with Aquilina and Comber.  I am satisfied that the purpose of doing so was to take steps to further conceal the deceased's body in the hope that it would not be discovered.  Upon the arrival of the offender, Aquilina and Comber, the deceased's body was dragged by Aquilina and Comber through a fence line and then rolled down a steep slope until such time it hit a fallen tree.   Sticks and branches were used to cover the body, following which the offender drove away from the area with Aquilina and Comber.
29Evidence was given at the trial by Professor Timothy Lyons, a Forensic Pathologist, who conducted an autopsy of the remains of the deceased on 4 January 2011.  Whilst there was extensive decomposition and some early skeletalisation, Professor Lyons was able to observe that there was a noose around the neck of the deceased which had been constructed from what he described as heavy duty twisted hemp rope, which had been tied with a bow line.  
30Professor Lyons described the noose as being 40 centimetres in circumference, and found that it had been wrapped twice around the deceased's body.  Leaving aside detected defects in the soft tissues of the clavicle, Professor Lyons also observed that there was a defect in the deceased's body consistent with his genitalia being absent.  However, he was not able to come to a definitive conclusion as to whether the deceased's genitals had been removed by a person, or whether they had been removed as a consequence of animal predation or heavy maggot infestation.
31The ultimate opinion of Professor Lyons was that the noose around the deceased's neck gave rise to neck compression and asphyxia, causing his death.  He said that when pressure is applied to the neck area, there are three common mechanisms which can be associated with resultant death, namely:  
(a)restriction of the airway;
(b)obstruction of the blood supply;
(c)the application of pressure to nerves of the neck.
32Professor Lyons explained that the deceased's death could have occurred due to any one of those methods, or alternatively a combination of more than one.  The evidence of Professor Lyons was not in dispute, and I accept it.  I am satisfied that the deceased's death was caused as a result of neck compression and asphyxia, brought about by the application of the rope around his neck.
33As I have noted, I am not satisfied that the offender had any direct involvement in the death of the deceased, in the sense that she pulled on the rope so as to cause the neck compression or asphyxia to which Professor Lyons referred.  The verdict of the jury reflects an acceptance of the Crown case that the offender was part of the joint enterprise, that she was present during the entirety of the period in which the deceased was killed, and that she was ready, willing and able to assist as necessary. 
34The essence of the Crown case which was put to the jury was that although it may have been open to find that the offender joined the enterprise at a much earlier time, they would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the very least, she had done so by the time that Aquilina called her from her home as detailed in paragraph [24] above.  On sentence, the Crown specifically did not advance a submission that I should find that the offender had joined the enterprise at any earlier time.  I am satisfied that she did not.  
35At the trial, the offender raised provocation by way of defence.  She herself did not give evidence.  However, she relied upon a number of witnesses called by the Crown who gave evidence about statements she had made to them concerning her distress at aspects of the behaviour of the deceased.  
36It is evident from the jury's verdict that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was not acting under provocation of a kind which would provide a defence to the charge.  However, it is open to me, if I am so satisfied, to have regard to that evidence as constituting provocation as a mitigating factor, albeit provocation which obviously falls short of that which is required to provide an accused person with a defence to murder.  For the reasons I have more fully set out below, I am satisfied that there was some limited provocation exhibited towards the offender by the deceased.  That is relevant to the assessment of objective criminality (see R v Buddle [2005] NSWCCA 82 per Wood CJ at CL at [11]).  
37Further, and for the reasons I have set out more fully below, there is evidence before me on the basis of which I am satisfied that the offender was suffering from a depressive illness at the time of her offending.  The presence of such an illness is also relevant in the assessment of objective criminality (see R v Sharrouf [2009] NSWSC 1002 at [61] per Whealy J).
38The offending had a number of aggravating features.  The use of a ligature has been treated as a form of weapon (as to which see Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76) and accordingly this is an aggravating feature pursuant to s21A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act.  Further, the offence was committed in company (s21A(2)(e) of the Sentencing Act).  
39The offender's participation, on two separate occasions, in the treatment of the deceased's body following his death is an aggravating factor (see for example Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315).   
40Having regard to the fact that Professor Lyons was not able to come to a definitive conclusion about the matter, I am not satisfied the deceased's body had been mutilated by the removal of his genitalia.  Even if I were in a position to be satisfied of that fact, there is no evidence at all which would link that mutilation to any conduct on the part of the offender.  In any event, the general principle that the treatment of the body of the deceased is capable of amounting to an aggravating factor has been extended to cases where such treatment did not involve any form of mutilation:  R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170; R v Dong [2010] NSWSC 1242.  
41Taking into account all of these matters, and having regard in particular to the role which was played by the offender and the time at which I am satisfied that she joined the enterprise, I take the view that the offending falls slightly below the mid range of objective seriousness.  

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE42The only evidence tendered before the court on sentence was the report of Dr Richard Furst, Psychiatrist, dated 20 November 2012.  Dr Furst examined the offender following the jury's verdict.  
43Before dealing with particular aspects of Dr Furst's report, and whilst I do not propose to set it out in its entirety, it must be said that the report as a whole paints a picture of the offender having suffered a number of personal traumatic events.  She has had, on any view, a difficult life and has been beset by a number of personal tragedies.  It is important, however, that in carrying out the task of sentencing the offender I do not give undue attention to her subjective circumstances, to the point where such attention results in the imposition of a sentence which is not reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the crime of which she has been found guilty (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354, cited in R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [136] per Johnson J).  
44The offender is 48 years of age.  She was adopted following her birth, and has four sons, aged 28, 27, 20 and 14.  Her 14 year old son, Brandon, was conceived as a result of a sexual assault upon her at the age of 33.  She has been, for some time, an openly homosexual woman.
45Based upon the history provided to him, Dr Furst reported that the offender had a lengthy history of emotional problems, and excessive drinking.  Significantly, Dr Furst also recorded the following:
""Ms Dawson apparently suffered a number of depressive symptoms in 2010 prior to the events in question before the court.  She said that she was always down, felt sad, felt tired, and had low energy levels.  She was more withdrawn, excessively emotional and irritable, and was not sleeping well, averaging only 3 hours of sleep at night.  She had problems with negative and intrusive thoughts and worries.  She felt harassed by her neighbour Adrian Trevett and was also subject to negative taunts and a lack of acceptance by other people ever (sic) Red Range, partly due to her sexuality.  She recalls feeling helpless, vulnerable and weak, but was not suicidal"".46Part of the history provided to Dr Furst by the offender, and upon which this part of Dr Furst's report was apparently based, was that at some time prior to the commission of the offence (it is not clear exactly when) the offender was under the care of a General Practitioner in Glen Innes who prescribed anti-depressant medication, which the offender ceased of her own accord because of the side-effects.  In addition, the offender told Dr Furst that she had consulted a clinical psychologist in Glen Innes (again, it is not clear when) for the purposes of counselling.
47Dr Furst diagnosed the offender as suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder, and alcohol dependence.  Importantly, his conclusions included the following:
""It would appear that she was fearful of the deceased to some degree, especially in light of his aggression when intoxicated, physical assault on her son Brandon and alleged sexual assault of her two young grandsons.  She felt guilty about not protecting them and was suffering from symptoms of her depressive illness in October 2010 (my emphasis).

48Dr Furst also concluded:
""Her judgment may well have been impaired by her depression"".
49The Crown submitted that the offender's depressive illness did not mitigate the seriousness of her offending and that there was no evidence to support a conclusion that the offender's judgment was impugned in any way.  In view of those parts of the report of Dr Furst which I have extracted above, I do not accept the Crown's submissions in this regard, particularly in circumstances where the report of Dr Furst was tendered without objection, and where Dr Furst was not required for cross examination.  
50I am satisfied, on the basis of the opinions expressed by Dr Furst, that the offender suffers from a Major Depressive Disorder, and was suffering from depression at the time of her commission of the offence.  Leaving aside the relevance of that issue in the determination of the objective seriousness of the offending (to which I have already referred), the issue is also relevant in another respect.  
51In Sharrouf (supra at [61]) Whealy J observed that the presence of a substantial and chronic mental illness is relevant not only to an assessment of objective criminality, but also to a determination of whether or not the case is one that calls for a measure of specific or general deterrence.  In making that observation, his Honour referred to a number of authorities, including R v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 112 where Wood CJ at CL had made the following observations (at [25]):
""The community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive functions or emotional restraints and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments.  Almost inevitably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act or of its moral culpability which, although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility, does justify special consideration upon sentencing.  However, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice"".

52The Crown submitted that this was not a case in which the offender's depressive illness noticeably affected the significance of general deterrence.  In light of the evidence, and the authorities to which I have referred, I do not accept that submission.   That is not to say that I am of the view that matters of general and specific deterrence are wholly irrelevant.  However in the case of this offender, their significance is less on account of her mental illness.
53In terms of the statutory mitigating factors, three particular matters have been raised on behalf of the offender.  

54The first is her criminal history.  The offender has a limited criminal history in New South Wales for driving offences.  She also has a criminal history for offences of dishonesty in the Northern Territory which, although it discloses multiple offences, indicates that those offences were all related to the one course of conduct, and were dealt with at the one time.  There is a further single conviction for an offence of dishonesty in Western Australia. She does not have any history of offences of violence.  In my view, her criminal history is not such that it should be regarded as a mitigating factor pursuant to s21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act, other than to the limited extent that it discloses no offences of violence.
55The second concerns the offender's prospects of rehabilitation pursuant to s21A(3)(h).  It was submitted on behalf of the offender that in circumstances where she has no history of violence I should find that she has good prospects of rehabilitation and that on this occasion, she had acted out of character.  In my view, although there is some force in that submission, this is a case in which the offender's prospects of rehabilitation may ultimately depend, to a large degree, upon her receiving appropriate treatment.  The report of Dr Furst records the fact that the offender has not had any psychological or psychiatric treatment since being taken into custody.  However, Dr Furst reported that although the offender had not engaged in any drug or alcohol counselling, she was ""open"" to engaging in such treatment.  
56In all of these circumstances, it is my view that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are best assessed as reasonable.  They are, as I have said, largely dependent upon the offender undertaking appropriate treatment, and that treatment being successful.
57The third (and perhaps most significant) matter of mitigation, stems from the provisions of s. 23A(3)(c) of the Sentencing Act, which deals with provocation.  I have already made reference to the evidence which was relied upon by the offender at her trial in that regard.  It is evident that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's actions were not committed under provocation.      
58However, I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence given at the trial, that the offender made a number of complaints about the conduct of the deceased to other persons in the period leading up to the commission of the offence.  Those complaints were repeated and consistent, and the fact that the offender had made them was independently corroborated.  I am satisfied that there had been some behaviour on the part of the deceased towards the offender which, although he may not have intended it to be so, was found by the offender to be offensive and hurtful.  The Crown did not argue against such a finding, nor did the Crown argue against the proposition that it was open to me to find provocation as a mitigating factor.  However, notwithstanding her complaints to others, I am not satisfied, in the absence of evidence from the offender, that such provocation included the inappropriate interference, by the deceased, with one of her grandchildren.
59It has been observed that evidence of relationship tension, and general enmity, between relevant parties leading up to an offence, and which forms part of the overall circumstances in which an offence was committed, does not constitute evidence of provocation sufficient to amount to mitigation:  see Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 at [26].  In the present case however, the evidence at trial extended, in my view, beyond mere tension and enmity.  However, it must be emphasised that such provocation as I have found does not constitute an excuse for the offender's conduct (see generally R v Buddle (supra) per Wood CJ at CL at [11]).  
60I must also observe that although I am satisfied that the offender was hurt and offended by the conduct of the deceased, her chosen manner of dealing with that issue, involving, as it did, being party to an agreement to inflict harm upon the deceased, was wholly out of proportion.  There were a number of ways in which the offender could, and should, have dealt with the situation which had arisen between herself and the deceased.  The simplest option was to move away from the area in which she and the deceased lived.  Significantly, there was evidence called by the Crown at the trial that the offender had discussed, with a neighbour, the fact that she had in fact made a decision to do just that, because ""she had had enough"" of life at Red Range.  It is, to say the least, regrettable that she did not choose to take that course, but chose another which produced disastrous consequences.  
61The offender has been in custody since her arrest on 30 December 2010 and it is agreed that any sentence I impose should be backdated to commence on that date.
conclusion62In respect of the murder of Adrian Trevett, the offender is convicted.
63The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 17 years and 3 months imprisonment, commencing on 30 December 2010, and ending on 29 March 2028, with an additional period of 5 years and 9 months commencing on 30 March 2028 and ending on 29 December 2033.
64The total term is one of 23 years imprisonment.
65The offender will be eligible for parole on 30 March 2028 and her sentence will expire on 29 December 2033.

2760626,R v Hazairin Iskandar [2012] NSWSC 1324,"Judgment

1On 27 June 2012 a jury convicted Hazairin Iskandar of the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin on or about 21 February 2010. 

2The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 20 years.

The facts

3I will deal with the factual background. The facts which I find against the Offender have been found by me to be beyond reasonable doubt, and those in his favour on the balance of probabilities. 

4Nita Iskandar and Hazairin Iskandar were born in Indonesia. They were married in 1984 and moved to Australia some three months later. There was only one child of the marriage being Andrew Iskandar. Andrew was born in Sydney on 16 May 1990. He was, therefore, 19 at the time of the offence. The family have lived at Croydon since about 1984.

5The Offender worked as a taxi driver and Nita came to work as a clerk in the Malaysian Consulate in Sydney in 2000. The Deceased Mohd Shah Saemin (known as Shah) commenced employment with the Malaysian Consulate in 2006. He had a second job driving buses to and from the Airport. 

6Nita came to know that the Deceased and his wife had separated. Nita had a sister, Jujung also called Suzanne, in Indonesia. When she visited Nita and the Offender about eight or nine months before his arrest (perhaps May or June 2009) Nita introduced Suzanne and the Deceased. Although it appeared a relationship might develop between them Suzanne decided it was not for her. She returned to Indonesia. 

7The Offender was first told by a friend in the Indonesian community, Bay Malik that Nita and the Deceased had been seen together in a way that was considered inappropriate for practising Muslims. Although the Offender thought nothing of that at the time other friends reported that the Deceased and Nita had been seen together. The Offender raised the matter with Nita and subsequently the Deceased. 

8Both of them denied it. The rumours persisted. The Offender noticed that Nita had changed in some ways. She started to buy more fashionable clothes, she largely stopped cooking at home, she started coming home later from work, she would receive calls on her mobile phone and go into the bedroom to speak to the caller. The Offender heard the word ""adultery"" or ""infidelity"" (in Indonesian) mentioned at a wedding at which he was a guest, and he realised that the people concerned were talking about him.
9After this the Offender said he felt shock. It started to bother him. He lost motivation and concentration in his work driving taxis. He even had a minor accident through lack of concentration. He asked Nita about it again but she denied that there was an affair. She said she just loved the Deceased as a friend. The Offender and Nita started arguing a bit. The Offender rang the Deceased about it. He met with the Deceased about a month and a half before the Deceased's death. The Deceased said that he and Nita were like brother and sister, nothing more.

10On another occasion the Offender, whilst driving his taxi, saw the Deceased driving the airport bus. He called out to him to stop so that they could talk but he said the Deceased just drove off while giving him the finger. Some little time later the Offender saw the Deceased near the taxi queue at the airport. He asked him to stay away from Nita. He said the Deceased was ""stretching his body"" (I understood by his demonstration to mean that the Deceased was flexing his muscles) and told the Offender not to worry about it. The Offender said that he felt intimidated.

11I accept that the ongoing relationship between Nita and the Deceased caused the Offender considerable anguish. I accept Mr Malik's evidence that the Offender changed from being a happy man to one who was sad and apparently depressed, and that the Offender felt the affair brought shame on his family.

12By February 2010 the Offender said his relationship with Nita had completely broken down. She was not sleeping with him, not speaking to him or cooking for him. She would come home late and then shut herself in her room. He told her that if things kept going that way they would be broken up. He thought about divorcing her. He said that divorce was acceptable to him. However, his friend Mr Malik advised against divorce.

13On 14 February 2010 the Offender and Andrew went to the Kings Cross Branch of Budget Car Rentals. The Offender effected the hiring of a car whilst Andrew sat on one of the chairs in the office. The Offender was asked by the Budget representative if Andrew was to be an additional driver, but the Offender said that Andrew was his son and that he was too young. 

14At some time during the following week the Offender and Andrew went in the rental car to the vicinity of the Malaysian Consulate in Woollahra. They parked the car in such a position that they could observe people and vehicles leaving the Consulate. Andrew took a photograph on his mobile phone from the front passenger seat of the car. The photograph depicts his father in the driver's seat, and the front of a property with a distinctive object on its front fence which is probably only 100 metres from the Malaysian Consulate can be seen in the background.

15The Offender admitted that the purpose of this visit to the street outside the Consulate was to spy on Nita and the Deceased. 

16In the week before the killing, and after the Offender had hired the car from Budget, he followed the Deceased and Nita on a number of occasions. There may have been occasions before that time where the Offender followed one or both of them. On one occasion he saw them go into the Deceased's house and stay there for a few hours at a time.

17During the late afternoon and evening of 21 February 2010 there were a number of telephone calls and/or text messages passing between Andrew and the Offender including a text message from Andrew to the Offender which simply said ""?"". The Crown case was that this text concerned the planned murder and an enquiry from Andrew to the Offender when it was to happen. It is not possible to reach a concluded view about what that message meant. 

18Andrew and the Offender left their home at some time late on the night of Sunday, 21 February 2010 in the rental car. They were both wearing similar clothing being dark hooded jackets. One of these jackets had been purchased by the Offender a week or so previously. They were both wearing caps. In the car was a knife, a hammer, a spanner and possibly a crowbar. The Offender first said that these were in the car because he had used them that afternoon to repair his taxi. He later admitted that he had put them into the car to use in order to scare the Deceased. There were also two pieces of folded blank paper with pegs attached in the car. The folded paper matched the size of the number plates of the car. I find that the purpose of those pieces of paper was to obscure the number plates of the car but the Offender was not able to achieve that because the rear number plate, at least, was flush with the car.

19The Offender drove over to the vicinity of Cromwell and Marion Streets in Leichhardt to wait for the Deceased to arrive home from his night job as an airport bus driver. The Offender said that the reason he drove to that location was to speak to the Deceased and to scare him. He asked Andrew to accompany him so that when the Deceased saw Andrew he would realise that the matter was serious.

20When the Deceased arrived he parked his car, a silver Volvo, on the western side of Cromwell St a short distance north of an electricity utility box.

21The Offender's account of what then happened is this. Either immediately before, or at the same time as, the Deceased alighted from his car, the Offender drove the rental car at the Deceased's car and hit it at the rear. After the Deceased alighted from his car the Deceased swore and then saw that it was the Offender who had run into his car. The Offender, who was by then out of his car, said to the Deceased, ""Finish it. This is serious, no more, no more, no more"". The Deceased then said, ""That's your bad luck. You can't look after your woman"" and he called the Offender ""Betima"" which is an offensive Indonesian word for a female animal. The Deceased also called him ""poofter"" using the English word. 

22The Offender said that he lost control because of what the Deceased said and he tried to jump on the Deceased. A fight then ensued. Andrew became involved. Andrew and the Deceased were wrestling. The Offender went to his car and grabbed the knife and hammer. He hit the Deceased with the hammer which he had in his right hand, the knife being in his left hand. After the Deceased was hit with the hammer he ran diagonally across Cromwell St towards Marion St. The Offender gave the hammer to Andrew and said ""Hit that animal"". The Offender chased him, hitting him as he ran with the knife. When the Deceased fell on the footpath on the southern side of Marion St the Offender said that he ""lost it"" and stabbed him in the chest. In cross-examination he admitted also to stabbing him in the back when the Deceased was on the ground in Marion Street before stabbing him in the chest.

23Nada Bailey was walking down Marion St from Norton St on the southern side. As she approached the intersection with Cromwell St she saw three men who were running across Marion St from the direction of Cromwell St. The two men on either side of the man in the middle appeared to be kicking him very hard. The man in the middle was trying to get away. He ran over towards Ms Bailey, and he was calling out ""help, help me"". She said the man tripped over the gutter as he approached her, and he fell to the ground outside number 28 Marion St. She noticed his shirt was all wet.

24She shouted to the other two men to leave him alone but they continued to run after him. When he fell she tried to cover him with her body but one or both (she was not sure) of the two attackers kicked her out of the way into the gutter. One of the men was bashing him with a hammer. The other man stood to one side holding a small black object like a small bar. I am satisfied from other evidence that this object was the knife used to stab the Deceased and that the man holding it was the Offender.

25Whilst this was happening Janine Cahill was walking down the southern side of Marion St. She saw what she thought at first to be two men running across Marion St from Cromwell St. As she continued walking she saw two men attacking a third man who was on the ground. She also saw Ms Bailey trying to protect the man on the ground. When she was about level with 18 Marion Street she rang 000 and asked for the police. She then yelled at the attackers telling them she had rung the police. She saw one of the men striking the Deceased very hard with a weapon a number of times. Then the two men ran off in the direction of Cromwell St.

26The police were first notified at 11.53pm and arrived at the scene a short time afterwards. In the meantime Ms Cahill commenced to perform CPR on the Deceased,. When Constable Hickey arrived she took over performing CPR until the ambulance arrived. The Deceased was pronounced dead at 12.05 am.

27The police had noticed the silver Volvo in Cromwell St with the door open. Inspection of that car and its surrounds determined that it was the Deceased's car. It was damaged at the back where it had been struck by the rental car driven by the Offender. A clump of what turned out later to be the Deceased's hair was found, and there was a trail of blood leading from that car across both Cromwell and Marion Streets. The police also located a hammer lying on the ground near the car. Andrew Iskandar's DNA was later found on that hammer.

28The Post Mortem report makes it clear that the Deceased was both struck with a weapon consistent with being a hammer, and stabbed with a long-blade knife. Four stab wounds were identified, one to the lower right flank, one to the mid back, one to the upper back and one to the chest. The cause of death was a stab wound to the chest area which pierced his Vena Cava, the main vein carrying blood back to the heart. Despite the Offender's evidence suggesting that he inflicted only three of those wounds, one as he chased the Deceased in Cromwell St, and two when he was on the ground in Marion Street, I find that all four were inflicted by him.

29The Offender's defence to the admitted killing was that he was provoked. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation but that plea was not accepted by the Crown. The jury's verdict demonstrates that they did not accept the Offender had been provoked so as to reduce the crime to manslaughter.

30I do not accept the Offender's evidence that the Deceased said the words to the Offender as the Offender alleged. Significantly, when the Offender spoke to a number of his friends within 12 hours of the killing he did not tell them that the Deceased had spoken any words to him that had provoked him. He said that he did not tell them because he was embarrassed. I do not accept that evidence. Moreover, I accept Mr Malik's evidence that in a conversation he had with the Offender shortly after the killing that the Offender said to him that he bashed the Deceased ""for the dignity of my family"". Mr Malik also said, and I accept, that the Offender said only that he bashed the Deceased but said nothing about a fight with him first. 

31Ultimately the account given by the Offender contains such inconsistencies that it cannot be accepted. At one time in his evidence he said he did not even intend to go to Leichhardt that night - rather, the idea only occurred to him as he was driving to have a meal with Andrew in Crown St. It was in a restaurant in Crown St that the Offender falsely told the police in his ERISP that he had met a stranger who, when he heard the Offender's story of his wife's affair, persuaded the Offender to kill the Deceased that night. At other times in his evidence he said that he planned to confront the Deceased and scare him that night. At one point he said he took Andrew with him, just to stay sitting in the car, so that the Deceased would see that he was serious when he told the Deceased to stay away from Nita. At another point he said that he took a knife and two hammers (one for Andrew and one for himself) so that they could scare the Deceased with those weapons.

32I find that the altercation happened in this way. The evidence establishes that the Deceased had just alighted from his car and was opening the rear driver's side door when his car was hit. He was almost immediately set upon by at least the Offender who was armed with one or more of the weapons. The clump of the Deceased's hair found in the back of his car is supportive of the immediacy of an attack while the Deceased was positioned right near the rear driver's side door. At some short time later Andrew was also involved in the attack. The trail of blood to Marion St establishes that the knife was used on the Deceased in Cromwell St. .

33I reject the submission made on behalf of the Offender that when he stabbed the Deceased he did not intend to kill him. The evidence from the pathologist was that two of the stab wounds, including the one that killed him, were made with considerable force.

34I find the position to be that the Offender went to ambush the Deceased on that evening with the intention of killing him. I find that the attack on the Deceased took place before there was any verbal exchange between the Offender and the Deceased. The Deceased was struck with the hammer and probably the knife whilst the parties were in Cromwell St. If the Deceased fought back at all he did not do so after he attempted to run from them in Cromwell St. At least two of the stab wounds were inflicted after the Deceased fell at the gutter on the southern side of Marion Street. He was completely defenceless. His brave defender, Nada Bailey, was kicked out of the way so that the Offender and Andrew could continue the attack. Whilst the Offender stabbed the Deceased Andrew was hitting the Deceased with considerable force, as the pathology report demonstrates, using the hammer that was taken to the scene in the car. The Offender and Andrew did not speak during the attack except when the Offender told Andrew to ""hit that animal"". That was because the killing was planned.

Subjective features

35The Offender was born on 13 November 1954 in Palembang in Indonesia. He is now aged 58 and was 55 at the time of the offence. He left school at 18 without any formal qualification. He worked for a few years before moving to Australia in 1979. He worked in a variety of positions including labouring, restaurant work and factory work. 

36On a visit home to Indonesia in 1983 he was introduced to Nita. They were married in 1984 in Indonesia. She then moved with him to Australia. Their son Andrew was born in 1990. The Offender worked as a taxi driver from about 2003.

37The Offender and his family are of the Islamic faith and his beliefs about matters relevant to the circumstances of the offence are informed by that faith.

38The Offender has only one matter on his record. He received a s 10 Bond for a common assault in May 2007. It arose from an altercation he had with a passenger in his taxi who refused to pay the fare by reason of the way she alleged he drove.

39References were tendered from friends and neighbours of the Offender, and from Nita, who all spoke highly of him. Some spoke of the volunteer work he did for the Indonesian community. I accept that this offending seems to be quite out of character for him. However, I note what Dr Jonathon Adams, the psychiatrist who examined him in September 2012, said in his report:

On the basis of the information currently available it appears that the offence took place in the context of Mr Iskandar's feelings of social embarrassment and shame - strongly linked with his religious beliefs - alongside his increasing preoccupation with his wife's infidelity and adjustment difficulties. However, bearing in mind Mr Iskandar's reported background history and these predisposing and precipitating factors, in my opinion the severity of violence involved in the offence is difficult to understand. On the one hand this formulation might be reasonable, but on the other hand I am concerned that there are unknown variables - perhaps in relation to Mr Iskandar's dispositional traits - that I am not currently aware. 

40Dr Adams noted that the Offender did not report any history leading up to the offence consistent with mental illness, including a mood, psychotic or anxiety disorder. He said that the Offender's presentation was in keeping with that of adjustment difficulties prior to the offence. 

41When he gave evidence at the sentencing hearing he had been provided with the Offender's evidence at the trial, the evidence of Bay Malik and the references to which I have referred. On the basis of that further material Dr Adams said that he considered the Offender suffered from an adjustment disorder at the time of the offence. One effect of that, Dr Adams said, was that it would have impacted on the Offender's ability to think rationally at the time of the offence. The difference between adjustment difficulties and adjustment disorder, he said, is ""the impact upon one's functioning and how that prolongs over time"".

42It is apparent that Dr Adams' diagnosis that the Offender was suffering from an adjustment disorder came from his acceptance of the Offender's and Mr Malik's evidence. However, I do not accept that in all matters the Offender told the truth. Contrary to the Offender's evidence I have found that this offence was carefully planned, that there were no words spoken by the Deceased before the attack, that the attack occurred in a way different from that described by the Offender and was far more vicious and brutal than he recounted. I shall return to the relevance of any adjustment disorder presently.

Objective seriousness

43The starting point is that the death of a human being by any unlawful killing is one of the gravest offences against an ordered society: R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487; (2001) 126 A Crim R 284 at 293. It is the responsibility of the Courts to protect and preserve human life and to punish those who unlawfully take it: R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [31]. 

44I mentioned earlier that murder carries a standard non-parole period. I note what was said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [17], [20], [25] - [27] and [29] concerning the way the standard non-parole period is to be dealt with. What remains unclear from Muldrock is whether any assessment should be made of where in the range of objective seriousness the offence lies: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19]. In cases decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal since Muldrock the preponderant view appears to be that it is not an error to do so and may be helpful: Beveridge v R [2011] NSWCCA 249 at [10]-[18]; Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 at [36]. 

45In my opinion this offence should be regarded as falling a little above the mid-range of objective seriousness. The following matters support that.

46First, I have found that the Offender had an intention to kill the Deceased. Secondly, there was considerable pre-planning. Thirdly, it was committed in company. Fourthly, weapons were used. Fifthly, there is the nature and length of the attack.

47I have made reference earlier to the first and fourth of those matters, that is, the intention to kill and the use of the weapons. I have referred to the fact that the offence was committed with his son Andrew as an active participant. In relation to the second matter, the pre-planning, the following facts lead me to the view that the Deceased's murder was pre-planned:

(1)The hiring of the car and the spying on, and following of, the Deceased ;

(2)The purchase of the second dark spray jacket in the week before the offence, and the wearing of those jackets on a hot summer night;

(3)The wearing of caps at night in an attempt to disguise themselves;
(4)The taking of the weapons in the car;

(5)The paper folded to the size of the number plates with the pegs although they were not able to be used;

(6) The lack of communication between the Offender and Andrew during the attack, particularly seen in the light of the number of telephone calls earlier that day between father and son;

(7) The failure of the Offender's encounters with the Deceased to persuade him not to see Nita and the Offender's ongoing frustration with the situation; 

48The fifth matter going to the objective seriousness of the offence concerns the level of violence employed. I share Dr Adams' view that, in the light of what is known about the Offender, the level of violence is very difficult to understand. This was a vicious, prolonged and brutal attack with some of the worst aspects of its violence being perpetrated whilst the Deceased lay on the ground endeavouring to protect himself and with his attempted protector, Nada Bailey, as I have noted, having been kicked out of the way.

49Although the one offence on the Offender's record involved a small measure of violence I do not regard that offence as an aggravating factor.

Mitigating factors

50I turn now to consider mitigating factors.

51I accept that the Offender is genuinely remorseful for what happened. On more than one occasion at the trial whilst giving evidence he cried. On another occasion whilst he was listening to evidence being given he broke down completely necessitating an adjournment of the court. These incidents were not feigned.
52At his sentencing hearing he asked to be able to say that he was sorry to the Deceased's family for what he had done. His further evidence in relation to that apology highlighted the significance of his religious beliefs, and demonstrates that his feelings of guilt, shame and remorse are genuinely held.

53I have given consideration in determining whether he is genuinely remorseful to the fact that the Offender has maintained his account of provocation by the Deceased, and for that reason has continued to say that he did not set out to kill the Deceased. In this regard s 21A(3)(i) is relevant as is what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Windle v R [2011] NSWCCA 277 at [44] and [52] - [54]. Remorse is a mitigating factor in accordance with s 21A(3):

but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).

54I do not think that the Offender deliberately lied when giving this evidence. I consider that, in a way that is often observed in witnesses, the Offender has come to believe that his account is the way it happened, although that account does not accord with the true position. I consider that he is sincerely sorry for what he believes was his lack of control that resulted in the death of the Deceased. I do not consider that his statement that ""Satan took hold of me"" was other than his way of acknowledging that he had done a very wicked thing.

55It was submitted that regard should be had to the Offender's mental state at the time of the offence and matters of provocation not amounting to a defence. 

56I accept that the relationship between Nita and the Deceased caused the Offender to become upset and to some extent depressed. It did not prevent him, however, from working nor from carrying out ordinary activities such as taking Andrew for driving lessons and socialising with his friends in the Indonesian community. It did not prevent him endeavouring to make arrangements within a week before the offence for his relatives in Wollongong to come to Sydney to visit him and the family although that did not eventuate for reasons external to the Offender. 

57Further, the extent of the pre-planning that commenced with the Offender following the Deceased and Nita to see where the Deceased lived, and included the hiring of the car a week in advance and the detailed planning for the night (the purchase of the spray jacket, the placement of the tools, the sheets of paper and pegs) do not point to a person incapacitated to any significant extent by an adjustment disorder. I consider that any such disorder has small relevance to the offence. That is, in a sense, supported by Dr Adams who denied any causal relationship between the disorder and the commission of the offence. 

58I have already rejected the evidence of provocation on the night of the offence. I take into account the upset and shame the Offender felt as a result of the ongoing relationship over which he appeared to have no control. However, as this Court said in Regina v White (NSWCCA - 23 June 1998 - unreported) these matters only explain the Offender's motive for murdering the Deceased, and where the crime is a carefully premeditated murder motive should not be regarded as a mitigating factor. 

59Nevertheless, the provocation from the ongoing relationship means that personal deterrence has less of a role to play. On the other hand it has some significance for general deterrence. As the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Dwayne William Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 209, people cannot be allowed to take the law into their own hands and exact vengeance for wrongs done to them.

60The Offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the first day of the trial. The result was that the only significant issue in the trial was provocation. That meant that agreement was able to be reached on a number of matters - DNA evidence, fingerprint evidence, phone records and evidence from Malaysian witnesses who had returned to their own country. There was a saving of time and money. This showed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice (R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119), and I have allowed a discount of 10% for this.

61Consideration must be given to the Offender's age. He is, as I have noted, now 58 years old. On any view he will be of advanced years when he leaves prison. It may be accepted that, for that reason, prison will be more onerous than for a younger person who will still have many years left when released: Holyoak v R (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507. The authorities stress the significance of the objective seriousness of the offence and the need to provide for an appropriate sentence whilst not overlooking the future of an older Offender: De Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16 at [32]. They also suggest that the case may be a less appropriate vehicle to give voice to general deterrence: Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 at [128]; Holyoak at 507.

62Although I have taken into account the Offender's age and that a lengthy sentence will be more onerous as a result, the Offender is not in ill-health. Further, and most significantly, this was a brutal and, for the Deceased, a terrifying slaying where he no doubt suffered considerably before he died. The reason for the commission of this crime makes it a suitable vehicle to give voice to general deterrence as I have mentioned above.

Parity

63I sentenced Andrew Iskandar on 16 March 2012 for his part in the murder to a non-parole period of 18 years with an additional term of 7 years. I made a small adjustment for special circumstances because of his age, lack of criminal record and prospects of rehabilitation.

64The differences of significance between the present Offender and Andrew Iskandar are twofold. First, is what I have found to be the genuine remorse of the present Offender. I found that Andrew Iskandar expressed no remorse. Secondly, the present Offender is to be given a discount for his plea.

65I gave some consideration to Andrew's youth and in the same way I give some consideration to the present Offender's more advanced years. Partly because of the age of the present Offender, his obvious remorse and the victim-specific nature of the crime, rehabilitation is not an important factor here. Those matters also mean that he is unlikely to be a danger to the general public in the way that those who kill randomly or concomitantly with the commission of property or drug offences are such a danger.

66As at Andrew's trial the evidence at the present trial suggests the present Offender was the moving influence in what was arranged and perpetrated. The evidence also demonstrated, however, that their culpability in the execution of the crime cannot be differentiated. Both employed savage and brutal force with the weapon each wielded.

Sentence

67Taking all of these matters into account I consider that the appropriate non-parole period is 17 years with an additional term of 6 years. The Offender has been in custody since 23 February 2010. The sentence will commence on that day.

68Hazairin Iskandar, for the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin I sentence you to a minimum term of 17 years imprisonment commencing 23 February 2010 and expiring 22 February 2027 with an additional term of 6 years expiring 22 February 2033.

		07 December 2012",2012-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760629,R v Goel [2012] NSWDC 284,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: In September last year I sentenced Mr Dinker Goel for fortyone offences involving breaches of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. They were offences of causing tax returns to be filed with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth. Those sentences followed Mr Goel's pleas of guilty to those offences. His pleas of guilty came in somewhat unusual circumstances. Part way through the trial, after he had pleaded not guilty at first, Mr Goel said things that indicated that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged, even if he was not then admitting to the extent of the dishonesty alleged by the Commonwealth Prosecution. He therefore pleaded guilty to each of the offences and it was up to me to determine the factual basis on which I would sentence him was it the lesser dishonesty suggested by Mr Goel or the more serious dishonesty suggested by the Prosecution? For reasons which I gave on 9 September 2011 I accepted beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Goel had done what the Prosecution alleged. I then sentenced him.

2There were, as I said, fortyone offences and I made the decision to arbitrarily divide them up into groups of ten, or eleven in one case, and partially accumulated the sentences for one group on sentences for others. The resulting sentence consisted of a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of five years. That non-parole period is due to expire on 8 September next year.

3One might have thought that this was the end of the matter but today an application has been made by Mr Goel for a permanent stay of proceedings relating to sixteen further charges which he currently faces. Coincidentally, that application for a permanent stay has come before me. There is no explanation offered by the Prosecution as to why these sixteen charges were not dealt with at the same time as the fortyone charges dealt with by me last year. They concern, as far as I can tell, similar alleged conduct arising out of similar circumstances with similar losses. They could have been dealt with at the same time as the other matters, although I do have to note that that would have led to an indictment containing fiftyseven counts being presented against the accused. Many Judges would have looked askance at such a lengthy indictment, suggesting that it would be more appropriate for two sets of proceedings being brought. But, that is not the explanation offered by the Prosecution.

4There are a couple of things that I need to note; firstly, as I said before, Mr Goel's question of parole will come up on 8 September 2013. Even if he is released from prison on the day that his non-parole period expires there is plenty of opportunity for his guilt or otherwise on these new matters to have been resolved before then. Current trial dates in this Court are being offered in May next year. The trial, assuming things go according to plan, will thus be held well before Mr Goel's parole expires. That removes from relevant consideration one of the matters put by Mr Norrie on Mr Goel's behalf. It was suggested that there is the possibility that Mr Goel will be required to spend further time in custody awaiting trial for these matters. As I say, it is highly likely that by the time Mr Goel's parole expires the authorities will know whether he has been further sentenced for these matters. They will know the length of that sentence, if he is convicted of course. And so there is no real likelihood that Mr Goel will suffer any prejudice in that sense from these charges now being presented.

5It has to be recognised that a permanent stay of proceedings is not lightly granted, the authorities are replete with statements to that effect. The community expects that where someone is charged with a criminal offence that matter is resolved in the Courts. Mr Norrie says that it would be an abuse of process for these proceedings to be brought; I do not agree. Although, it has to be said that in one sense the division of proceedings against Mr Goel into two separate matters is regrettable, I can see no relevant basis in which Mr Goel is unfairly prejudiced by that circumstance. 

6The application for a permanent stay of proceedings is refused.

2760638,Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Ngo [2012] NSWSC 1521,"Judgment

Introduction

1This is an appeal by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") against an order for costs made by a Magistrate in favour of a defendant after proceedings for a Commonwealth offence were withdrawn in the Local Court of New South Wales. The appeal raises a question of statutory interpretation with regard to the precise elements of that Commonwealth offence. An important part of the submissions of the DPP in support of the appeal is the proposition that her Honour misinterpreted the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 205. 

2The DPP is the plaintiff in these proceedings. In the Local Court he was the prosecutor of the offence, and the respondent to the application for costs. The defendant in this Court was the defendant in the criminal proceedings, and the applicant in the application for costs. For ease of comprehension I shall consistently refer to the DPP as the prosecutor, and to Mr Ngo as the defendant. 

3The defendant has entered a submitting appearance, save as to any order for costs of the proceedings in this Court.

Chronological background

4On 10 March 2011, the defendant was charged with an offence pursuant to s 400.9(1A) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Code""). The foundation of the charge was the finding of $80,000 in cash in the tyre well of a car possessed by the defendant. It was part of the prosecution case that the defendant had said to the police that the money had been loaned to him by an unnamed acquaintance. 

5On 6 September 2011, the decision in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) was handed down. 

6On 1 November 2011, the prosecutor withdrew the charge. There is no evidence why that occurred. The defendant applied for costs. 

7On 15 November 2011, that application was heard by her Honour. On 16 November 2011, her Honour granted the application. 

8On 9 December 2011, the prosecutor filed a summons commencing this appeal. 

9On 23 August 2012, an amended summons was filed.

Legislation permitting costs application

10The costs application was brought pursuant to ss 213 and 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Those sections are as follows:

""213 When professional costs may be awarded to accused persons

(1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.

(2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable.

(3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because:

...

(b) the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.

...

214 Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity

(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following:

(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,

(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,

(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,

(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.

...""

Legislation permitting appeal

11The appeal was brought pursuant to s 56 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. That section is contained in Division 2 of Part 5, which is entitled ""Appeals by prosecutors"". It is as follows:

""56 Appeals as of right

(1) The prosecutor may appeal to the Supreme Court against:

(a) a sentence imposed by the Local Court in any summary proceedings, or

(b) an order made by the Local Court that stays any summary proceedings for the prosecution of an offence, or

(c) an order made by the Local Court dismissing a matter the subject of any summary proceedings, or

(d) an order for costs made by a Magistrate against the prosecutor in any committal proceedings, or

(e) an order for costs made by the Local Court against the prosecutor in any summary proceedings,

other than an order or sentence with respect to an environmental offence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.

(2) An appeal must be made within such period after the date of the sentence or order as may be prescribed by rules of court.""

12Section 59 of the same Act is contained in the same Division. It is as follows:

""59 Determination of appeals

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against sentence:

(a) by setting aside the sentence, or

(b) by varying the sentence, or

(c) by dismissing the appeal.

(2) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in section 56 (1) (b), (c) or (d) or 57 (1) (b) or (c):

(a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or

(b) by dismissing the appeal.""

It is worth noting at this stage that s 59(2) does not refer to appeals brought pursuant to s 56(1)(e). 

Relevant parts of the Code

13As noted above, the charge was brought pursuant to s 400.9(1A) of the Code. The whole of s 400.9 is as follows: 

""400.9 Dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime etc.

(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and

(b) it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 3 years, or 180 penalty units, or both.

(1A) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and

(b) it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is less than $100,000.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years, or 120 penalty units, or both.

(2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b) or (1A)(b), that paragraph is taken to be satisfied if:

(a) the conduct referred to in paragraph (1)(a) involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or

(aa) the conduct involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or

(b) the conduct involves using one or more accounts held with ADIs in false names; or

(ba) the conduct amounts to an offence against section 139, 140 or 141 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006; or

(c) the value of the money and property involved in the conduct is, in the opinion of the trier of fact, grossly out of proportion to the defendant's income and expenditure over a reasonable period within which the conduct occurs; or 
(d) the conduct involves a significant cash transaction within the meaning of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, and the defendant:

(i) has contravened his or her obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or

(ii) has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or

(da) the conduct involves a threshold transaction (within the meaning of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006) and the defendant:

(i) has contravened the defendant's obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or

(ii) has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or

(e) the defendant:

(i) has stated that the conduct was engaged in on behalf of or at the request of another person; and

(ii) has not provided information enabling the other person to be identified and located.

(4) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) and (1A)(b) and (c).

(5) This section does not apply if the defendant proves that he or she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money or property was derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from some form of unlawful activity.

Note: A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5) (see section 13.4).""

14The offence that had been under discussion in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) is contained in s 400.5(1) of the Code. The relevant portions of that section are as follows:

""400.5 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc.-money or property worth $50,000 or more

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and

(b) either:

(i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or

(ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and

(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $50,000 or more.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 15 years, or 900 penalty units, or both.

...

(4) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(c), (2)(d) and (3)(d).

Note 1: Section 400.10 provides for a defence of mistake of fact in relation to these paragraphs.

Note 2: Section 400.2A affects the application of this section so far as it relates to a person dealing with money or other property that:

(a) is intended by the person to become an instrument of crime; or

(b) is at risk of becoming an instrument of crime.""


15The phrase ""proceeds of crime"" is defined in s 400.1 of the Code as follows:

""proceeds of crime means any money or other property that is wholly or partly derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).""

16The definition of ""instrument of crime"" contained in the same section is similar: 

""instrument of crime: money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).""

17Section 400.13 of the Code played an important role in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth), and in the judgment of her Honour:

""400.13 Proof of other offences is not required

(1) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division that money or property is proceeds of crime, to establish:

(a) a particular offence was committed in relation to the money or property; or

(b) a particular person committed an offence in relation to the money or property.

(2) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that:

(a) an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or

(b) an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property.""

18It is necessary to refer to a portion of Chapter 2 of the Code in order to determine the appeal. Part 2.6 of the Code specifies the default standard of proof and the party that bears the burden of it. The relevant portions are as follows: 

""13.1 Legal burden of proof-prosecution

(1) The prosecution bears a legal burden of proving every element of an offence relevant to the guilt of the person charged.

Note: See section 3.2 on what elements are relevant to a person's guilt.

(2) The prosecution also bears a legal burden of disproving any matter in relation to which the defendant has discharged an evidential burden of proof imposed on the defendant.

(3) In this Code:

legal burden, in relation to a matter, means the burden of proving the existence of the matter.

13.2 Standard of proof-prosecution

(1) A legal burden of proof on the prosecution must be discharged beyond reasonable doubt.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the law creating the offence specifies a different standard of proof.""


The submissions of the parties in the Local Court

19The submission of the defendant was a simple one. He submitted that the proceedings had been summary proceedings; that they had been withdrawn; and that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause. The latter submission was based upon the proposition that the principles enunciated in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) demonstrated that, on the evidence available to the prosecutor, the proceedings were always doomed to failure. That was because there was no evidence of an essential element of the offence. Therefore, he submitted, costs should be granted. 

20The prosecutor did not accept that Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) meant that the proceedings were doomed to failure from the start. He submitted that analysis of that case demonstrates that it has no application to the offence under consideration. 

21He also submitted that each of the requirements contained in ss 214(1)(a) to 214(1)(d) of the Criminal Procedure Act was not met in this case. With regard to ss 214(1)(a) and 214(1)(c), it was submitted that there were no inadequacies nor improprieties in the conduct of the investigation which could found a costs order under those subsections. Regarding s 214(1)(b), the prosecutor relied on the statement of the defendant to the police to the effect that the moneys were the proceeds of a loan from an unnamed associate as a reasonable basis upon which to initiate the proceedings. Finally, in addressing s 214(1)(d), the prosecutor relied upon the failure of the defendant to assist the police as a circumstance which would disentitle the defendant from being awarded costs. Reliance was placed upon Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59; (1990) 170 CLR 534.

The judgment of her Honour

22The judgment under consideration is quite lengthy and it is not convenient to set it out in its entirety. I shall refer to the salient features of it when recounting the submissions of the prosecutor and in my determination. 

23In very broad summary, her Honour provided a conspectus of the competing submissions of the parties; made some remarks about the mental elements attaching to the physical elements of the offence in question; and rejected the proposition that the decision of Latoudis v Casey was of assistance. Her Honour ultimately found that the decision in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) was determinative as to what it was that the prosecutor needed to prove in support of the charge commencing the proceedings. Her Honour found that there was no evidence in support of an essential element, and never had been. In particular, her Honour accepted the submission of the defendant as to the degree to which it was incumbent upon the prosecutor to point with particularity to the criminality said to underpin the phrase of ""proceeds of crime"". Accordingly, her Honour determined that it had been unreasonable for the prosecutor to commence the proceedings, and therefore granted costs to the defendant.

Overview of submissions of the prosecutor in this Court

24The prosecutor pointed to three broad asserted errors in the judgment. 

25The first submission was that her Honour had misconstrued the mental element that attached to the physical element of the offence contained in s 400.9(1A)(b). It was submitted that the Magistrate had found that the mental element of intention attaches to that physical element. To the contrary, it was submitted, absolute liability applies to that paragraph pursuant to s 400.9(4). Accordingly, it was submitted, far from intention being a matter that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove, in truth no mental element needed to be proven with regard to that element.

26The second submission was that her Honour had fallen into error in determining that the reasoning in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth), which is to do with the elements of the offence in s 400.5 and analogous offences, applies to the offence under consideration. That submission had a number of aspects, to which I shall turn in a moment. 

27The third submission was that her Honour had misapplied the test with regard to whether or not it was reasonable to commence proceedings. Reliance was placed upon Kanan v Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union [1992] FCA 539; (1992) 43 IR 257 and Nimmo, Re Application for an Inquiry relating to an Election for an Office in the Australian Education Union (NT Branch) (No 2) [2011] FCA 728. It was also submitted that her Honour had misinterpreted Latoudis v Casey.

28It is convenient for me to deal in detail with the second submission first.

Submissions about Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth)

29The prosecutor accepted that Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) is an important decision for determining, in almost all of the offences contained in ""Division 400 - Money Laundering"" of the Code, the meaning of the phrases ""proceeds of crime"" and ""instruments of crime"". It was accepted before me that, in accordance with what was said by Basten JA at [27] - [33] and Garling J at [94] - [100] respectively, in order to prove that an item is proceeds of crime or (will become) an instrument of crime for the purposes of those offences, the prosecution must point to a particular indictable offence. By that I mean, the prosecutor did not concede that the prosecution must point to a particular criminal act, such as (for example) armed robbery committed by particular offenders on a particular bank at a particular time. But it was conceded that the prosecution must point to a particular offence such as armed robbery, as opposed to murder, or dealing in drugs, in proving those offences. 

30However, it was submitted that what was said in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) has no application to the offences under consideration, namely those contained in s 400.9 of the Act. That submission had three bases. 

31First, it was submitted that the decision in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) was really a consideration of how the definitions of ""proceeds of crime"" and ""instrument of crime"" in s 400.1 operate in combination with the provision in s 400.13. However, it was submitted that the opening words of s 400.13(1) talk of proof ""for the purposes of this Division that money or property is proceeds of crime"". The opening words of s 400.13(2) are relevantly identical. But the submission was that there is no requirement in the offence under consideration to prove that money or property is in fact proceeds of crime. As can be seen from paragraph s 400.9(2)(b), what needs to be established is that ""it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime"". Accordingly, it was submitted, s 400.13 has no application to the offences contained in s 400.9. Therefore, to the extent that Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) is very much founded on an analysis of how s 400.13 operates with the rest of the Division, that decision has no application to this matter. 

32I queried whether, if s 400.13 has no application to the offences in s 400.9, that position has the potential to make things even more difficult for the prosecution with regard to particularity than they would be in accordance with Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth). I made that query of counsel for the prosecutor on the basis that it could be said that s 400.13 is a provision that is designed to assist the prosecution by reducing the degree of particularity that may otherwise be required. The response of the prosecutor was that one need not consider the effect of the operation or otherwise of s 400.13; the provision is simply inapplicable. 

33The second submission was related to the first. It was submitted that s 400.13 speaks of a necessity ""to prove for the purposes of this Division"". My attention was drawn to ss 13.1 and 13.2 of the Code, which I have already quoted. It was submitted that s 400.13 must be referring to proof by the prosecution of an element beyond reasonable doubt. However, with regard to s 400.9(1A), it was submitted that it is not the case that the prosecution is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that ""it is reasonable to suspect"" the state of the affairs contained in that subsection. The prosecutor submitted that to speak of proof beyond reasonable doubt that it is reasonable to suspect that a state of affairs exists is a semantic absurdity. It was submitted that there is authority for the proposition that, in such a case, the prosecution is not so required: see R v Buckett (1994) 132 ALR 669 and R v Zotti [2002] SASC 164; (2002) 82 SASR 554. It was submitted that that is another basis upon which it can be demonstrated that s 400.13 does not apply to the offences contained in s 400.9. Again, it was submitted, the decision in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) is therefore not determinative.

34The third submission was as follows. It is noteworthy that, in stark contrast to the other offence creating provisions contained in the Division, s 400.9 contains ""deeming provisions"" in s 400.9(2). It can be seen, it was submitted, that the element contained in s 400.9(1A)(b) is ""taken to be satisfied"" if one of a number of matters is established. The prosecutor submitted that many of those matters are inconsistent with proof of an offence with the particularity spoken of in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth). My attention was particularly invited to ss 400.9(2)(b), (c) and (e). 

35The submission, in short, was that the offence creating provision contains deeming provisions that flatly contradict the degree of particularity called for in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) with regard to the phrase ""proceeds of crime"". Therefore it cannot be the case that the judgments in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth), which are to do with the construction of s 400.5 and similar sections, can be binding with regard to the construction of s 400.9. 

Consideration of the submission about Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth)

36There were two issues in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth). The primary issue was whether the dealing that founds the physical element contained in s 400.5(1)(a) can also be the source of the criminality that founds the mental element in 400.5(1)(b)(ii). Basten JA and Garling J held that it could not. Simpson J dissented and held that it could. That issue is not relevant to the determination of this appeal. 

37The secondary issue was as follows. In the trial that founded that appeal, the Crown had placed before the jury a nebulous theory about an alternative criminality that could found the mental element in 400.5(1)(b)(ii). Neither a particular criminal act (such as an armed robbery at a particular place and time) nor a particular offence (such as armed robbery as opposed to drug dealing) was properly identified. Basten JA and Garling J held that such evidence was insufficient, and was not made sufficient by the operation of s 400.13. Their Honours were of the view that that section only assists the Crown by dispensing with any requirement as to proof of a particular criminal act, but not as to proof of a particular offence, in the senses used by me above. Simpson J did not address the issue, in light of the minority position of her Honour with regard to the primary issue. 

38It follows that I would accept the concession of the prosecutor before me that Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) is authority for the proposition that, with regard to the offences contained in ss 400.3 to 400.8, a particular offence must be identified, but not a particular criminal act. In the application for costs, it is clear from the judgment that her Honour was persuaded that that proposition in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) is binding with regard to the offence in s 400.9(1A). It was conceded before her Honour that the prosecutor could never point to an offence with such particularity. That was the simple basis, as I interpret the judgment of her Honour, upon which her Honour ordered costs. Her Honour found that it was not reasonable to commence the prosecution when there was no evidence available at any stage of an essential element of the offence.

39The question of the effect, direct or indirect, that the majority position in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) has upon the interpretation of the offence under consideration is not an easy one to resolve. On the one hand, the fact is that the identical phrase ""proceeds of crime"" is used in the offence under consideration. That same phrase is used in s 400.5, and all of the other offence creating provisions. The definition contained in s 400.1 of that phrase, and of the phrase ""instrument of crime"", undoubtedly applies across the whole Division, pursuant to the opening words of that subsection. It would perhaps be a strange result if that identical phrase has a different meaning within the offence creating provision under consideration from that within all of the other offence creating provisions in the Division.

40On the other hand, I respectfully consider that the submissions of the prosecutor before me have a deal of force. In particular, there seems to be a profound contradiction between the particularity required by the majority judgments in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth), and the lack of particularity envisaged by s 400.9(2). As was pointed out before me, those deeming provisions would seem to permit the offence in s 400.9(1A) to be made out without the identification of any particular criminal act, or indeed particular offence. Considering ss 400.9(2)(b),(c) and (e) in isolation, it seems that they could perhaps be satisfied even in the case of proceeds of crime that are not founded on the concept of ""an indictable offence"" contained in the definition in s 400.1. 

41The true meaning of the phrase ""proceeds of crime"" in s 400.9(1A)(b) is not easy to discern. Nor is the effect of the majority judgments in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) on that question. However, I do not consider that, in order to determine this appeal, I must determine that question. That is because of my view about the question of the approach of her Honour to the question of whether costs should be granted. I turn to consider that aspect.

Reasonable to commence proceedings?

42The defendant submitted in the Local Court that ""the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause"". As I have said, his submission was that, because there was no evidence of an essential element of the offence (on the assumption that Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) applied to the offence under consideration), it was not reasonable to commence the prosecution.

43However, as my discussion above with regard to the very question of the applicability of the reasoning in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) to the offence in s 400.9 demonstrates, it is a matter for serious legal debate precisely what the phrase ""proceeds of crime"" in the offence under consideration encompasses. 

44As was said by Wilcox J in Kanan v Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union [1992] FCA 539; (1992) 43 IR 257 at 264:

""It seems to me that one way of testing whether a proceeding is instituted ""without reasonable cause"" is to ask whether, upon the facts apparent to the applicant at the time of instituting the proceeding, there was no substantial prospect of success. If success depends upon the resolution in the applicant's favour of one or more arguable points of law, it is inappropriate to stigmatise the proceeding as being ""without reasonable cause"". But where it appears that, on the applicant's own version of the facts, it is clear that the proceeding must fail, it may properly be said that the proceeding lacks a reasonable cause.""

45Furthermore, in Nimmo, Re Application for an Inquiry relating to an Election for an Office in the Australian Education Union (NT Branch) (No 2) [2011] FCA 728, it was said at [30]:

""Finally, the test to be applied in relation to the expression ""without reasonable cause"" is similar to that adopted in an application for summary judgment, viz ""so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed"", ""manifestly groundless"" or ""discloses a case which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed"": see Heidt at 272-273; Geneff v Peterson (1986) 19 IR 40 at 87-88; Hatchett at 327 and Crozier at [12]. I might add that these statements express the test for a summary judgment before the introduction of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). However, I consider they are apt under s 329 of the Act because s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) uses the expression ""no reasonable prospects of success"", rather than ""no reasonable cause"" and, more importantly, s 31A also contains an express statutory exclusion (not present in s 329) of the need to show the proceedings are hopeless or bound to fail: see s 31A(3).""

46It seems to me that this case falls squarely within the test enunciated by Wilcox J. The question of precisely what is the subject matter of the state of affairs that the prosecution must show it is reasonable to suspect existed is, to my mind, a very ""arguable point of law"". As I have sought to show, the determination of that question will require a consideration of the interaction of a number of provisions of the Code, both within Division 400 and Chapter 2. 

47The fact that the true meaning of the offence contained in the section under consideration is a matter I find to be arguable demonstrates that the proceedings commenced by the prosecution in this case were not ""without reasonable cause"". The fact that, at some stage, a court will need to grapple directly and authoritatively with the question demonstrates that proposition. 

48It follows that the Magistrate was in error in finding that the proceedings had been instituted without reasonable cause. Accordingly the order for costs should be quashed. 

Other submissions of the prosecutor

49Because I have upheld the second submission, it is unnecessary to deal with the first, which is founded on the proposition that there was a misapprehension about whether a mental element attaches to the physical element of the offence contained in s 400.9(1A)(b).

50Nor is it necessary to deal with the submissions founded on the proposition that her Honour misapplied what was said by Toohey J in Latoudis v Casey.

Orders Sought

51The prosecutor did not seek to have the matter remitted to the Local Court for further consideration. He simply sought to have the order for costs quashed. 

52Nor did the prosecutor seek costs of the appeal against the defendant. It follows that the order that I should make is that the order for costs made by the Magistrate be quashed. 

53However, it is remarkable that, as can be seen from the legislation extracted by me, there is no explicit power so to order in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. It seems strange that Parliament has provided the prosecutor in these circumstances with an explicit right of appeal without providing an explicit form of relief. It is especially strange in light of the fact that Parliament has, pursuant to s 59(2), provided for explicit relief with regard to costs orders made in committal proceedings, but not those made in summary proceedings. I understand that this seeming lacuna is currently being considered by Parliament. 

54In any event, I am content to follow the lead of Garling J in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Elskaf [2012] NSWSC 21 at [78] - [79] and make an order quashing the order for costs in the Local Court on the same basis as his Honour. 

Orders

(1)Appeal upheld.

(2)The order for costs made by the Magistrate in the Local Court against the plaintiff and in favour of the defendant is quashed.

		10 December 2012",2012-12-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760647,R v Glynatsis [2012] NSWSC 1551,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1JOHNSON J:  On 3 February 2012, the Offender, Nicholas Glynatsis, pleaded guilty to nine counts of insider trading contrary to ss.1043A(1) and 1311(1)(a) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
The Course of the Sentencing Proceedings 
2The sentencing proceedings have extended over some months. I should explain why.
3A sentencing hearing proceeded before me on 29 June 2012.  In the course of that hearing, submissions were made concerning the availability, in law, of an intensive correction order as a sentencing option in the Offender's case.  I was informed that a Crown appeal was to be heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal in early August 2012, which was regarded as a test case on this question.  The availability of an intensive correction order, as a sentencing option, was a live issue in submissions made on 29 June 2012.  
4At the conclusion of the hearing on 29 June 2012, I adjourned the proceedings for sentence on 17 August 2012.  
5The Crown appeal, which raised the use of intensive correction orders, was heard by a five-Judge Bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 6 August 2012.  Judgment was reserved, and was delivered ultimately on 22 October 2012:  R v Pogson [2012] NSWCCA 225.  
6As it happens, I was a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Pogson, with the leading judgment of the Court being a joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and myself.  
7Because of the pending decision in R v Pogson, I determined that it was appropriate that the sentencing of the present Offender be delayed until that decision had been handed down.  Accordingly, the Offender's matter was stood over. It was relisted on 25 October 2012.  On that occasion, in light of the decision in R v Pogson, and without committing the Court to a particular course by way of sentence, I determined that an assessment report should be obtained concerning the suitability of the Offender for an intensive correction order, a statutory prerequisite for that course of action.
8The proceedings were adjourned until today for sentence.  The assessment report has been obtained, and further reference will be made to it later in these remarks on sentence.
9I have raised these matters to explain the delay in sentencing the Offender.  That delay is not referrable to the conduct of the parties.  Given the coincidence in timing of the Offender's case and the Crown appeal in R v Pogson, I determined that it was appropriate to delay sentencing of the Offender until clarification of the legal question as to the availability of an intensive correction order in a case of this type.  
10As a result, a decision in the Offender's case will be made with the Court having a clear understanding of available sentencing options.
11The Offender has been on conditional bail since his first appearance in the Local Court on 15 December 2011.
12By virtue of s.1311, and Schedule 3 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), each offence for which the Offender is to be sentenced carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years and/or a fine of $220,000.00.
Facts of Offences
13An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing.  In addition, the Offender gave evidence and was cross-examined concerning aspects of his conduct giving rise to the offences.
14What follows is drawn from the Agreed Statement of Facts.
15The Offender was born in January 1983.  He obtained Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of Business Administration degrees from Macquarie University in 2005.  He commenced, but did not finish, a Diploma in Financial Services from Kaplan Professional in 2010.
The Offender's Position  
16In February 2007, the Offender commenced employment with PricewaterhouseCoopers (""PwC""), a large accounting firm which provides a range of professional services to public and private clients, including some of Australia's leading companies.  He was initially employed as a graduate consultant in the Research and Development section of the Tax and Legal Department (""R&D Section"") and, from July 2009, he was employed as a Senior Consultant within that Section.
17The nine offences for which he is to be sentenced were committed in a period between November 2009 and November 2010.
18Around 20 January 2011, search warrants were executed on behalf of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (""ASIC"") in relation to this matter, at which time the Offender was placed on leave.  The Offender resigned from PwC at the beginning of June 2011.
19It is necessary to refer briefly to the function of the R&D section of PwC to place the Offender's conduct in context.  The R&D section of PwC specialises in the provision of taxation advice to companies engaged in research and development activities that are potentially risky or innovative.  The Offender's role in this section rarely required him to work on projects that involved accessing ""inside information"" as defined in s.1042A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  
20During his employment at PwC, the Offender had access to a business process and record management system called Documentum, which houses caches of files relating to (amongst other things) PwC's clients and the various projects in respect of which PwC had been retained to provide advice.  Unless access to a client file or projects stored on Documentum had been specifically limited, all Documentum users had access to that information.  
21The Offender had exclusive use of a laptop provided to him by PwC which was protected with a username and password unique to the Offender.  This laptop contained a program which enabled the Offender to access the Documentum database, and also automatically saved the documents he viewed and recorded the date and time at which he viewed them.
Insider Trading Conducted by the Offender
22Between November 2009 and November 2010, the Offender, on the occasions to be mentioned shortly, improperly and for the purpose of financial gain:
(a) accessed confidential PwC documents on Documentum identifying proposed transactions involving PwC clients, such as corporate takeovers, which contained inside information; and
(b) shortly afterwards traded in ""Division 3 financial products"" (as defined in s.1042A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)), namely securities (for example, shares in a company or units on a listed trust or fund) and Contracts for Difference in respect of securities (""CFDs""), to which the inside information related.  
23It is not necessary for the purpose of these remarks on sentence, to expand upon the concept of CFDs, which are ""derivatives"" within the meaning of ss.761D and 1042A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (see, generally, International Litigation Partners Pte Ltd v Chameleon Mining NL [2011] NSWCA 50; 276 ALR 138 at 150 [68]-[71]).
24The Offender had no legitimate work-related reason to access these documents and, at all relevant times, he was aware that his actions in accessing the documents and subsequently trading, contravened various PwC policies and were illegal.
25The Offender personally caused all of the trading referred to hereafter by placing orders over the internet through either a trading account held with CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty Limited in his own name, or three separate trading accounts held by relatives (""relatives' trading accounts""):
(a) an account in the name of Michael Glynatsis, the Offender's uncle;
(b) an account in the name of Irene Glynatsis, the Offender's sister; or
(c) an account in the names of Michael Glynatsis and his business partner, Peter Nicola.
26The Offender traded, acquired and disposed of relevant financial products, through his relatives' trading accounts, as their agent, although not pursuant to any formal written agency agreement.  In particular:
(a) each of the relatives gave the Offender permission to trade through their accounts, and provided him with their usernames and passwords for this purpose;
(b) each of the relatives was broadly aware of the Offender's trading through their accounts, although they were usually not aware of the specific details of each particular trade; and
(c) all of the trades through the relatives' trading accounts were conducted by the Offender on behalf of, and for the financial benefit of, his relatives.
27It is not alleged that any of the relatives were complicit in the Offender's offences.
28Further, the Crown accepts that the Offender did not derive any financial benefit for any trades conducted through his relatives' trading accounts.  
First Offence
29Challenger Kenedix Japan Trust (""CKT"") was an Australian-based listed property trust whose ordinary fully-paid units traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (""ASX"") at all material times.  Challenger Limited (""Challenger"") is an investment management firm that was listed on the ASX in 1987.  Income payments made by Challenger pursuant to annuities are guaranteed by Challenger Life Company Limited (""CLC""), a life insurance company under the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth).  
30Prior to 20 November 2009, the Offender had never acquired any units or CFDs in respect of units in CKT through either his own trading account, or his relatives' trading account.
31At 2.31 pm on 19 November 2009, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum a letter dated 18 November 2009 from PwC to Challenger Financial Services Group Limited entitled ""Engagement Letter - Provision of Australian and Japanese Tax Services:  Challenger Kenedix Property Trust"".  The letter contained a proposal from PwC to provide tax structuring and due diligence servicing in respect of a proposed takeover.
32Between 20 November 2009 and 2 December 2009, the Offender:
(a) acquired, through his own trading account, 58,000 CFDs in respect of units in CKT at prices between $0.705 and $0.79 per CKT unit, resulting in a total exposure of $42,950.00; and
(b) acquired, for his relatives' trading accounts, 48,700 units in CKT at prices between $0.71 and $0.73 per unit, for a total cost of $27,971.00.
33At the time when the Offender acquired all of these units and CFDs in respect of units in CKT, he possessed inside information concerning CKT to the effect that CLC had developed, and sought advice from PwC in relation to, a proposal to take over 100% of the interests of CKT by way of a scheme of arrangement.  
34At the time when the Offender acquired all of these units and CFDs in respect of units in CKT, he knew that this inside information was not generally available and, if it were generally available, that a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of units and CFDs in respect of units in CKT.
35At 10.07 am on 9 December 2009, CKT released a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive"", stating that it recommended a proposal from CLC which, if approved and implemented, would result in CLC owning all of the units in CKT and unit holders receiving a cash consideration of $1.00 per unit.
36Prior to this analysis, units in CKT last traded on the ASX at $0.70 per unit.  When trading resumed after the announcement, the opening price of CKT units was $0.965 per unit, a 37.9% increase from its preannouncement price, and the price reached an intraday high of $1.00 per unit.
37On 9 December 2009, after the public announcement, the Offender disposed of all of the units and CFDs in respect of units in CKT for prices of or reflecting between $0.965 and $0.99, for a total consideration of $94.658.00.  This resulted in a total gross profit of $23,737.00, comprised of $13,600.00 for the Offender and $10,137.00 for his relatives.
Second Offence
38Hastings Diversified Utilities Fund (""HDF"") is a small-cap diversified utility stock trust whose ordinary fully-paid units traded on the ASX at all material times.  APA Group (""APA"") is an Australian-based listed natural gas infrastructure business, owning and operating gas transmission and distribution assets.
39As at 11 March 2010, the Offender did not hold any units or CFDs in respect of units in HDF, but he had previously held CFDs in respect of units in HDF and had last traded them on 29 January 2010.  
Second Offence - First Particulars
40Shortly after 2.00 pm on 11 March 2010, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum a transaction summary report entitled ""APA:  Project Mo"", which had been created or saved the previous day.  Shortly after, he accessed, again for no legitimate work-related reason, a powerpoint presentation entitled ""UK Water Assets - 31 December 2009"" which had been created or saved the day before and set out steps for the proposed acquisition of 100% of the units in HDF by APA and other entities.
41Between 11 March 2010 and 17 March 2010, the Offender:
(a) acquired, through his own trading account, 9,000 CFDs in respect of units in HDF at a price reflecting $1.25 per HDF unit, resulting in a total exposure of $11,250.00; and
(b) acquired, through one of his relatives' trading accounts, 10,000 units in HDF at a price of $1.225 per HDF unit, for a total of $12,250.00.
42At the times when the Offender made these acquisitions, he possessed inside information to the effect that APA had developed, and sought advice from PwC in relation to a proposal to acquire 100% of the units in HDF.  
43At the time of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that the inside information in his possession was not generally available and, if it were, that a reasonable person would have expected it to have a material effect on the price or value of units and CFDs in respect of units in HDF.
44The proposed takeover of HDF by APA was not publicly announced, and did not eventuate in March or April 2010.
45Between 23 March 2010 and 8 April 2010, the Offender disposed of all the units and CFDs in respect of units in HDF for prices between $1.235 and $1.275, for a total consideration of $23,880.00.  This resulted in a total gross profit of $380.00, comprised of a loss of $120.00 for the Offender, and a profit of $500.00 for his relatives.
Second Offence - Second Particulars
46Between 18 March and 4 May 2010, the Offender did not acquire any further units or CFDs in respect of units in HDF through either his own trading account or any of his relatives' trading accounts.
47At about 12 noon on 4 May 2010, and again at 2.57 am on 5 May 2010, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum a powerpoint presentation entitled ""APA:  Project Moe - Acquisition Structure/Steps Overview"", which had been created or saved on 4 May 2010, and which contained a detailed outline of steps for the proposed acquisition by APA of 100% of the units in HDF.
48Between 11.07 am on 5 May 2010 and 7 May 2010, the Offender acquired through his own trading account, 40,000 CFDs in respect of units in HDF at prices reflecting between $1.255 and $1.315 per HDF unit, resulting in a total exposure of $51,550.00.  
49At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender possessed inside information concerning HDF to the effect that APA had developed, and sought advice from PwC in relation to, a proposal to acquire 100% of the units in HDF, and that APA had proposed a bid price of $1.54 per unit in HDF.
50At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that this inside information was not generally available and that, if it were, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of units and CFDs in respect of units in HDF.
51The proposed takeover of HDF by APA was not publicly announced and did not eventuate in May 2010.
52On 13 May 2010, the Offender disposed of all his CFDs in respect of units in HDF at prices reflecting $1.34 or $1.35 per unit, resulting in a gross profit for the Offender of $2,225.00.
Third Offence
53Brockman Resources Limited (""BRM"") is an ASX 300 Australian-based mining company whose ordinary fully-paid shares traded on the ASX at all material times. Wah Nam International Holdings Limited (""Wah Nam"") is an investment holding company, incorporated in Bermuda and listed on the ASX.
54Prior to 3 May 2010, the Offender had never acquired any shares or CFDs in respect of shares in BRM through either his own trading account or any of his relatives' trading accounts.
55On 14 April 2010, and again on 26 April 2010, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum an extract from a draft bidder's statement relating to the proposed takeover of BRM by Wah Nam, entitled ""Risk Section - Risks relating to the offer and the combined group"".  
56At 10.06 am on 3 May 2010, the Offender acquired through his own trading account, 10,000 CFDs in respect of shares in BRM at a price reflecting $3.34 per BRM share, resulting in a total exposure of $33,400.00.
57At the time of this acquisition, the Offender possessed inside information concerning BRM to the effect that Wah Nam had developed, and sought advice from PwC in relation to, a proposal to make an offer to acquire more than 80% of the shares in BRM.
58At the time of the acquisition, the Offender knew that this inside information was not generally available, and of the effect upon a reasonable person, if it were.  
59On 3 and 4 May 2010, shortly after the Prime Minister announced a proposed Resources Super Profits Tax (""RSPT"") on mining profits, share prices of Australian mining companies, including BRM, generally fell significantly and, thereafter, share prices of such companies generally remained relatively volatile for many months.
60On 4 May 2010, the Offender disposed of all of his CFDs in respect of shares in BRM at prices reflecting $2.84 and $2.96 per BRM share, resulting in a gross loss to the Offender of $4,400.00.
Fourth Offence
61At 11.06 am on 10 May 2010, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum a 116-page draft bidder's statement setting out extensive details of Wah Nam's proposed takeover of BRM, which had been saved on Documentum only nine minutes earlier.  This document identified, amongst other things, that Wah Nam intended to make a takeover offer for all of the shares in BRM at a price representing ""a substantial and attractive premium"" to the existing and past prices of BRM shares, with an effective price of $4.50 per share suggested.  
62At 12.03 pm on 10 May 2010, the Offender recommenced acquiring, through his own trading account, CFDs in respect of shares in BRM, and he continued to acquire them up until 13 July 2010.  He acquired, over this period, a total of 31,000 CFDs in respect of shares in BRM, for prices reflecting $2.77 and $3.02 per BRM share, resulting in a total exposure of $90,355.00.  
63At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender possessed inside information to the effect that Wah Nam intended to make, and sought advice from PwC in relation to, a takeover of all of the shares in BRM, that Wah Nam intended to offer a price representing ""a substantial and attractive premium"" to the existing and past prices of BRM shares, and that Wah Nam had proposed offering an effective price of $4.50 per BRM share.  
64At the time of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that this inside information was not generally available, and was aware of the effect upon a reasonable person, if it were.
65Between May and October 2010, the proposed takeover of BRM by Wah Nam was not publicly announced, and it did not occur.
66Between 3.30 pm on 10 May 2010 and 13 September 2010, the Offender disposed of his 31,000 CFDs in respect of shares in BRM at prices reflecting between $2.67 and $3.34 per BRM share, resulting in a total gross profit for him of $3,851.00.
67On 10 November 2010, Wah Nam released a public ASX announcement stating that it intended to make a takeover offer for all of the ordinary shares in BRM at an effective price of $6.47 per share, which represented an 89.9% premium to the value-weighted average price for the 180 days to 9 November 2010.  When trading resumed after the announcement, the opening price of BRM shares on the ASX was $5.70 per share and the price reached a high that day of $6.09 per share (a 28.5% increase from its preannouncement price).
Fifth Offence
68Ferraus Limited (""FRS"") is an Australian-based mining company whose ordinary fully-paid shares traded on the ASX at all material times.
69As at 10 May 2010, the Offender and his relatives did not hold any shares or CFDs in respect of shares in FRS, but the Offender had previously held CFDs in respect of shares in FRS and had last traded them on 28 April 2010.
70At 11.06 am on 10 May 2010, the Offender accessed the 116-page draft bidder's statement mentioned above (at [61]).  In addition to detailing the proposed offer by Wah Nam to acquire all of the shares in BRM, the document also identified that Wah Nam intended to make an off-market takeover offer for all of the ordinary shares in FRS and that Wah Nam intended to offer an effective price representing ""a premium"" to the existing price of FRS shares.
71Between 18 May 2010 and 6 July 2010, the Offender acquired, through his relatives' trading accounts, 10,000 shares in FRS at prices between $0.795 and $0.80, for a total cost of $7,975.00
72At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender possessed inside information with respect to Wah Nam's intention.  
73At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that this information was not generally available, and was aware of its impact upon a reasonable person, if it were.

75On 24 June 2010 and 22 September 2010, the Offender disposed of all of the 10,000 shares in FRS at prices of between $0.84 and $0.85 per FRS share.  This resulted in a total gross profit for his relatives of $475.00.

When trading resumed after the announcement, the opening price of FRS shares on the ASX was $0.86 per share, and the price reached a high that day of $1.15 per share (a 33.7% increase from its preannouncement price).
Sixth Offence
77Apollo Gas Limited (""AZO"") was an Australian gas company whose ordinary fully-paid shares traded on the ASX at all material times.  Dart Energy Limited (""DTE"") is an Australian publicly listed company focused on the development of coal bed methane throughout eastern Australia and Asia. 
78Prior to 24 September 2010, the Offender had never acquired any shares or CFDs in respect of shares in AZO through either his own trading account or any of his relatives' trading accounts.
79At around 12.02 pm on 24 September 2010, the Offender for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum a letter dated 23 September 2010 from PwC to DTE entitled ""Engagement Letter - Project Trojan"".  
80At 3.37 pm on 24 September 2010, the Offender acquired through one of his relatives' trading accounts, 18,300 shares in AZO at a price of $0.61 per share, for a total cost of $11,163.00.

When trading resumed after the announcement, the opening price of AZO shares was $0.75 per share, and the price reached an intraday high of $0.81 per share.
84On 29 September 2010, the Offender disposed of all of the AZO shares at a price of $0.85 per share, resulting in a gross profit for the Offender's relatives of $4,392.00.

88Between 2.26 pm on 12 October 2010 and 19 October 2010, the Offender acquired, through his own trading account, 11,000 CFDs in respect of shares in DOM at prices reflecting between $2.82 and $2.89 per DOM share, for a total exposure of $31,586.00.  In the same period, he acquired, through one of his relatives' trading accounts, 4,300 shares in DOM at a price of $2.80 per share, for a total cost of $12,040.00.
89At the time of these acquisitions, the Offender possessed inside information concerning DOM to the effect that KCN had developed, and sought advice from PwC in relation to, a proposal to acquire 100% of the shares in DOM at  a price including a premium above net tangible assets identified in DOM's consolidated balance sheets.
90At the time of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that the inside information in his possession was not generally available, and was aware of its effect upon a reasonable person, if it were.
91On 20 October 2010, DOM released a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive"", stating that it had agreed with KCN a takeover proposal for KCN to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares in DOM at an effective price of $3.63 per share.  When trading resumed after the announcement, the opening price of DOM shares was $3.14 per share, and the price reached an intraday high of $3.35 per share (a 33% increase from its preannouncement price).
92Between 21 October 2010 and 3 November 2010, the Offender disposed of all of the shares and CFDs in respect of shares in DOM at prices between $3.202 or $3.25 per share, for a total consideration of $49,519.00.  This resulted in a total gross profit of $5,893.00, comprised of $4,164.00 for the Offender and $1,729.00 for his relatives.
Eighth Offence
93Caledon Resources Limited (""CCD"") is an Australian-based mining company whose ordinary fully-paid shares traded on the ASX and London Stock Exchange at all material times. Guangdong Rising Assets Co Limited (""GRAM"") is a Chinese State-owned asset management company.
94Prior to 22 September 2010, the Offender had not acquired any shares or CFDs in respect of shares in CCD through either his own trading account or any of his relatives' trading accounts.
95At 2.38 pm on 22 September 2010, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum from a client directly for GRAM, a powerpoint presentation dated 22 September 2010 and entitled ""Project Jack - Draft Tax Report"", which was marked ""Strictly Private and Confidential"".
96Between 3.56 pm on 22 September 2010 and 3 November 2010, the Offender acquired 24,500 shares in CCD through two of his relatives' trading accounts at prices of between $1.14 and $1.191 per share, for a total cost of $29,017.00.  
97At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender possessed inside information concerning CCD to the effect that GRAM had developed, and sought advice from PWC in relation to, a proposal to acquire CCD and that PwC had advised GRAM that it had not identified any tax issue it considered would have a materially adverse impact on the decision to acquire CCD.
98At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that this inside information was not generally available and was aware of its impact upon a reasonable person, if it were.
99At 6.11 pm on 8 November 2010, CCD released a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive"", stating that it had reached an agreement in principle with GRAM on the terms of a possible cash acquisition of CCD by a wholly-owned subsidiary of GRAM at a price of about $1.78 per CCD share.  When trading resumed after the announcement, the opening price of CCD was $1.60 per share (a 12.7% increase from its preannouncement price).
100Between 9 November 2010 and 12 November 2010, the Offender disposed of all of the shares in CCD at prices of between $1.54 and $1.62 for a total consideration of $38,770.00, resulting in a total gross profit for his relatives of $9,753.00.
Ninth Offence
101Exoma Energy Limited (""EXE"") is an Australian gas explorer whose ordinary fully-paid shares traded on the ASX at all material times.  CNOOC Limited (also known as the China National Offshore Oil Corporation) (""CNOOC"") is China's largest producer of offshore crude oil and natural gas, and is traded on the Hang Seng and the stock exchanges of New York and Hong Kong.
102At 4.32 pm on 16 November 2010, at which time the market for EXE was $0.25 per share, the Offender, for no legitimate work-related reason, accessed on Documentum a draft contract entitled ""Farmin Agreement"", which had been created or saved only a few hours beforehand.  This document identified, amongst other things, that CNOOC and EXE proposed to enter into a contract upon certain specified terms.  
103Between 11.09 am on 17 November 2010 and 23 November 2010, the Offender acquired, through one of his relatives' trading accounts, 40,000 shares in EXE at a price of $0.25 per share, for a total cost of $10,000.00.  This relative had pre-existing holdings of 11,500 shares in EXE, which had been acquired by the Offender (as agent of his relative) on 26 October 2010.
104At the time of these acquisitions, the Offender possessed inside information concerning EXE to the effect that CNOOC and EXE proposed to enter into a contract under which CNOOC would acquire a 50% interest in a number of EXE's exploration permits, that EXE would receive $50 million as consideration for the 50% interest, that CNOOC would receive an option to acquire a placement of up to 19.9% of the fully-paid ordinary shares of EXE for a price of $A0.315 per share, and that CNOOC was to receive an equivalent number of options for each share that it acquired under the placement.
105At the times of these acquisitions, the Offender knew that the inside information in his possession was not generally available, and of its impact upon a reasonable person, if it were.
106On 9 December 2010, EXE released a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive"", stating that it had executed the Farmin Agreement and identifying various features of the agreement.  When trading on the ASX resumed after the announcement, the opening price of EXE was $0.31 per share, and the price reached an intraday high of $0.315.  
107On 23 December 2010, the Offender disposed of all of the shares in EXE at a price of $0.235 per share, resulting in a gross loss to his relative of $600.00.
Total Profits from the Offender's Insider Trading
108The total gross profit (excluding losses) derived from all of these offences was $50,826.00.  Deducting the losses on some of the transactions ($5,120.00), this figure stands at $45,706.00.
109The total gross profit (excluding losses) derived by the Offender through his own trading account was $23,840.00.  Deducting the losses made on some of these transactions ($4,520.00), this figure stands at $19,320.00.
110The total gross profit (excluding losses) derived from the Offender's insider trading through his relatives' trading accounts was $26,986.00.  Deducting the losses made on some of these transactions ($600.00), this figure stands at $26,386.00.
The Offender's Subjective Circumstances
111As mentioned earlier, the Offender was born in January 1983.  He was 27-28 years' old at the time of the offences and is now 29 years of age.   He is unmarried.
112The Offender has no prior criminal history.
113A presentence report dated 7 June 2012 is before the Court, together with an intensive correction order assessment report dated 3 December 2012.  
114In addition, senior counsel for the Offender tendered a report of Sam Borenstein, consultant clinical psychologist, dated 20 April 2012.  Also tendered were a range of documents concerning the Offender's background, education and family circumstances, including a letter from his sister, Irene Glynatsis, and references from persons who know the Offender and attest to his prior good character.
115A number of documents were tendered, as well, concerning the financial circumstances and bankruptcy of the Offender's father, an issue to which I will return.  
116A number of media reports were tendered, revealing the publicity which has been given to the charges brought against the Offender.
117As mentioned, the Offender resigned from PwC in early June 2011.  I will proceed to sentence the Offender upon the basis that his convictions for these offences will have a terminal effect upon his capacity to work as a legal practitioner and in the area of financial advice in the future.
118As already mentioned, the Offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing which extended to his background, as well as the circumstances of the offences.  Amongst other things, the Offender confirmed that the history given to Mr Borenstein was correct.
119The Offender was born in Greece and came to Australia with his parents and younger sister when he was seven years' old.  When he was 10 years' old, his mother left the family and returned to Greece.  The Offender had been close to his mother and her departure had an unsettling effect.
120To some extent, the Offender's paternal grandmother filled the void left by his mother, looking after him (in conjunction with his father) until he was about 14 years' old.
121The evidence establishes that the Offender was a hardworking and studious young person, working in the father's fish and chip shop whilst he was at school.  When in Years 11 and 12, the Offender helped his father who ran a Greek restaurant in Terrigal.
122The Offender did well in the Higher School Certificate and undertook tertiary studies.  He continued to work whilst a university student.
123Whilst studying at university and working in Sydney, the Offender was living with his grandmother, as were his uncle and, occasionally, his sister.  He continued to work part time in the family restaurant business as a kitchen hand and cook and as a general manager.  After university, the Offender again worked in the family business (a nightclub) as a disc jockey, bar tender and casual manager.
124The Offender's father had remarried when the Offender was 16 years' old and he had another daughter (now 11 years' old).  The Offender's father and his second wife divorced in 2009.  This process resulted in stress and tension across the whole family, culminating in the father's bankruptcy in February 2010, as well as the loss of the family house.  
125Irene Glynatsis confirms the family difficulties in 2009.  She stated that she and the Offender commenced to look for a house for her father and his young daughter to occupy.  A place was found in October 2010, with settlement in December 2010.  She confirmed that the Offender had placed most of the deposit on the purchase of the house for his father and half-sister.  This provides some context for the offences committed by the Offender in 2010.
126Since his resignation from PwC in June 2011, the Offender has performed some work as a bar manager for large-scale events, this being work organised by his sister.  He presently resides with his father and half-sister on the Central Coast.  His current employment is in his father's nightclub on the Central Coast.
127Mr Borenstein initially saw the Offender in November 2011, on referral from his general practitioner, for treatment under a mental health care plan.  The Offender was treated for depression and anxiety.  Treatment continued in the early months of 2012, with a diagnosis being made of adjustment disorder and depressed mood.  
128Mr Borenstein observed, in the context of counselling/therapy, that the Offender had come to appreciate the fact that he has been depressed for many years dating to childhood, that he had not come to terms with his parents' failed marriage, and that he took on the role of protecting the family name, and pleasing his father by excelling academically and caring for his younger sister.  Mr Borenstein confirmed that cognitive behaviour therapy is being undertaken to manage the Offender's symptoms of depression and anxiety.
129Mr Borenstein observed that the Offender initially rationalised his behaviour, which he regarded as borderline, but that he has acknowledged that his actions were illegal and had demonstrated remorse.  
130Mr Borenstein observed that, at the time of the offences, the Offender's family were in a ""state of significant distress"", with his father having been declared bankrupt and his uncle having ""sustained a large financial loss as the result of a rogue share trader"".  
131Mr Borenstein considered the Offender's future prospects to be sound, given his expression of remorse and contrition, and he believed that the likelihood of the Offender coming before the Court again was extremely low.
132The Offender's evidence confirmed the history contained in the various documents before the Court.  He explained that his interest in share trading increased, and that there was an element of boredom and dislike for his job.  He explained the family difficulties occurring in 2010.  He acknowledged that what he had done was wrong.  
133Under cross-examination, the Offender was challenged as to whether he was still, in a sense, distancing himself from accepting responsibility for his knowingly criminal acts during 2010.  He denied that he had attempted to downplay his criminal activity in his discussions with Mr Borenstein.
134I accept that the Offender is contrite and remorseful for his actions and accepts full responsibility for them.  Whilst it is the case that he did not give a full account of his actions when they were initially under investigation in 2011, he has readily accepted responsibility for his offences, agreeing to the facts upon which he is to be sentenced, which includes an express acceptance that he knew what he was doing to be wrong at the time.
135The Offender is an intelligent young man who held a responsible position.  He comes from a background where his educational and other achievements are held in high regard by his family and community.  I accept that he felt a level of pressure to assist his father during the clear and serious financial difficulties which affected him in 2010.  This provides some context for the offences.  
136I accept as well that the Offender's activities involved trading for the benefit of family members, with at least a desire on the part of the Offender to please those family members on whose behalf he was trading.  At the same time, the Offender was obtaining some benefit for himself through his activities.
137The evidence reveals that the Offender has been a hard-working young man devoted to his family over the years.  He does not appear to be a person who has sought to live life ""in the fast lane"", in a way sometimes seen with offenders in this class of crime.
138None of these things serve to excuse the Offender's criminal conduct which was serious and in breach of trust.  However, it provides some context for the exercise of sentencing discretion concerning this particular Offender.
Sentencing for Insider Trading Offences
139Insider trading offences are regarded as a serious form of criminal activity.  They serve to undermine the integrity of the stock market:  R v Doff [2005] NSWSC 50; 23 ACLC 317 at [40].  The offences are difficult to detect:  R v Rivkin [2003] NSWSC 447; 198 ALR 400 at 409-410 [44].  
140General deterrence is important in the sentencing process to provide a firm disincentive to insider trading, and with a need to sound ""a clarion call"" to discourage illegal and unethical behaviour by persons who are in a position to offend in this way:  R v Rivkin at 409-410 [44]; cf R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119; 54 ACSR 200 at 212 [56].
141Insider trading not only has the capacity to undermine the integrity of the market, it also has the potential to undermine aspects of confidence in the commercial world generally arising from breaches of trust:  Hartman v R [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [94].
142The cases have emphasised the particular gravity of offences by a ""true insider"", who abuses the office or employment occupied by the offender to take advantage of information acquired in the course of that employment in order to avoid potential losses by an early sale or to buy with a view to profit:  R v Doff at 212 [57] (NSWCCA). 
143Insider trading is not a form of victimless crime, and it is a form of cheating:  R v Hartman [2010] NSWSC 1422 at [45], [94]; Hartman v R at [94]; R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643 at [15]-[21].
144It will be necessary to apply these principles for the purpose of sentencing the Offender for his offences. 
Some Other Relevant Matters
145The Crown accepts that the Offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity so that he should receive appropriate credit for facilitating the course of justice.  Although it is not necessary for Commonwealth offences to quantify the discount arising from pleas of guilty, I approach the question of sentence of the Offender upon the basis that a 25% discount applies.  
146On 15 May 2012, with the consent of the Offender, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions obtained a pecuniary penalty order under s.116 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in the sum of $50,826.00, representing the total gross profits derived from the offences committed by the Offender.  This amount was paid on 4 June 2012.  
147I have regard to the Offender's payment of the pecuniary penalty order as evidencing his co-operation in resolving action taken against him:  s.320(a) Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).
148I accept that the Offender's co-operation with law enforcement agencies has been somewhat chequered.  During voluntary interviews in January 2011, he did not admit any of the suspected offences and he falsely denied having obtained price sensitive information by accessing PwC documents.  However, in July 2011, immediately after a compulsory examination of the Offender, his legal representative indicated co-operation and a willingness to plead guilty to appropriate charges.  
149A statement of Hayden Evans, a lawyer with ASIC, dated 18 June 2012, accepted that the Offender's co-operation in admitting the facts and pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity had been of ""significant value to ASIC"" and that, without this co-operation, ASIC would have been required to expend significant time and resources seeking to gather admissible evidence capable of proving the offences.
150The Offender is entitled to appropriate credit for his prior good character.  However, in the area of white-collar offences such as this, good character is not as significant a mitigating factor as in sentencing for other classes of offences.  The authorities have recognised that it is often an offender's prior good character and standing within the community that enables him to be placed in the position of trust from which he is then able to commit the offence in question:  R v Bateson at [33].
151As a result of his criminal actions, the Offender has suffered certain detrimental consequences, including what I accept is irreparable damage to his professional career in law and finance, together with media publicity which has been given to his prosecutions.  Whilst matters of this type do not loom large in the exercise of sentencing discretion, being the almost inevitable consequences of his own actions, they remain matters which are relevant to the sentencing process and ought be taken into account by the Court:  R v O'Brien [2011] NSWSC 1553 at [74]-[75].
Determining the Appropriate Sentences
152In the course of these remarks, I have touched upon a range of matters which fall for consideration on sentence under s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
153The Crown submitted that the objective gravity of the Offender's crimes was such that a full-time sentence of imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty in the exercise of sentencing discretion.  
154Mr Hastings QC, for the Offender, accepted that the offences were such that periods of imprisonment should be imposed, but submitted that, in all the circumstances of the case, the Offender should be released upon recognizance.  In the alternative, he submitted that an intensive correction order should be imposed.  
155I accept that the circumstances of these offences are serious.  The Offender breached a position of trust with PwC.  As a result, he had access to a business process and business management system containing confidential, price-sensitive information.  On the occasions giving rise to these charges, he used his position to access documents on this system, identifying proposed transactions such as corporate takeovers.  He was a true insider.
156On each occasion, the Offender accessed the inside information improperly, and for the purpose of financial gain for himself or his relatives.  
157The offending conduct occurred over a period of some 12 months on nine separate occasions.
158In each instance, the securities were sold yielding total gross profits of $50,826.00 or an overall gross benefit of $45,706.00.  Of that amount, the Offender derived, on his own account, a gross profit of $23,840.00, and his relatives derived a profit of $26,386.00.  
159It is necessary to keep in mind that the total amount invested was $371,507.00.  This is an important indication of the gravity of the offences: R v Doff at [31] (NSWSC).
160The Crown submitted that the fact that some of the securities were purchased on behalf of the Offender's relatives was of no particular importance in this case.  The Offender had permission from the relatives to access  their trading accounts and he did so.  Mr Hastings QC submitted that this aspect was of significance in this case.
161I am satisfied that the trading on behalf of relatives is a significant factor which operates in the Offender's favour in this case.  For reasons mentioned earlier, it sheds some light upon the Offender, his thought processes and his family background.  I keep in mind, as well, the evidence of clear family financial difficulties affecting the Offender's father in 2010, and the various steps which the Offender and his sister were taking on his behalf.  
162In raising these matters, I am not suggesting that the Offender was acting as a form of ""white knight"", for noble reasons to assist his family in committing these offences.  There was an element of personal gain as well.  
163However, the Offender has no prior criminal history and has generally indicated himself as being a person of good character.  For him to have engaged in this criminal fashion, in breach of trust with his employer, may be better understood by the family dynamics occurring in 2010, including significant financial pressure on his father, all of this to be viewed against the background of the Offender's sense of responsibility as the only son in the family.
164I accept that the Offender demonstrated a willingness to put his own interests, and the interests of his relatives, ahead of the integrity of the market and the interest of his employer.  All of this, as I have said, involved serious and sustained breaches of trust.  However, the context of this offending is important to a proper understanding of the offences.
165Having regard to the objective gravity of the offences and the Offender's subjective circumstances, and sentencing principles applicable to this class of offending, I am satisfied that sentences of imprisonment are required in this case.  As I have said, so much was accepted by senior counsel for the Offender at the sentencing hearing.
166I do not accept the submission on behalf of the Offender that these matters can appropriately be dealt with by way of recognizance.  The offences are of a gravity that such a sentence would be inappropriate and would not give effect to the purposes of sentencing, including general deterrence.
167This brings me to the issue of the use of intensive correction orders for this class of offence.  Intensive correction orders have been utilised with respect to insider trading offences:  R v Dalzell [2011] NSWSC 454; 83 ACSR 407 (Hall J); R v Bateson (Buddin J) and R v O'Brien (Hoeben J).
168At the time of the sentencing hearing on 29 June 2012, the Crown referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Boughen [2012] NSWCCA 17; 215 A Crim R 476 in support of a submission that an intensive correction order was not available in a case such as this.  The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Pogson overturned this aspect of R v Boughen, so that an intensive correction order is an available penalty in a case such as this.  It remains, of course, to determine whether such an order should be made in the case of the Offender.
169Submissions were made before me which sought to compare or contrast the circumstances of the offenders in R v Bateson, R v Dazell and R v O'Brien, with a view to demonstrating that an intensive correction order either would, or would not, be an appropriate sentence in this case.
170Care must be exercised in comparing other sentencing decisions which, of course, turn upon the circumstances of the particular offender and the nature of the offences committed.  These decisions are, however, useful for the purpose of the present decision.  
171The Crown submits that it is most important that the sum invested by the Offender in these offences totalled $371,507.00, a sum far in excess of the nearest comparative case, being the sum of $174,755.00 in R v O'Brien.  I accept that this is a factor to be taken into account on sentence, although it is also important that the gross benefit in this case was in the sum of $50,826.00, with that sum subdivided as between the Offender and his relatives.  The gross benefit in the case of R v O'Brien was $54,748.00.
172In R v O'Brien, the offender traded exclusively to the benefit of his elderly mother's superannuation fund, which he managed and which had lost value.  The present Offender traded on his own behalf and on behalf of his relatives, although the circumstances prevailing in 2010 were as I have already described.  The Offender's conduct involved eight companies, whereas four companies were involved in R v O'Brien.
173The point is reached where comparisons of this type cannot progress the exercise of sentencing discretion in the present case.  The task of a sentencing Judge is to attempt to apply individualised justice in all the circumstances, many and varied as they are, of the particular case.
174The power to impose an intensive correction order is not confined to offenders who are in need of rehabilitation and are at risk of reoffending:  R v Pogson at [99].  However, rehabilitation also addresses the moral sensibilities of the offender, not just his or her propensity to reoffend, so that moral self-correction and renunciation of wrongdoing by an offender are included in the concept of rehabilitation:  R v Pogson at [120], [124].  
175An intensive correction order is a substantial punishment.  Stringent conditions are attached to an intensive correction order which deprive an offender of his or her liberty in a real sense:  R v Pogson at [112].
176In Director of Public Prosecutions v Edwards [2012] VSCA 293, Weinberg JA and Williams AJA observed, at [242], with respect to the Victorian community correction order:
""A community correction order is not, and should not be viewed as, a mere 'slap on the wrist'.  It is a significant punishment, and is capable of having substantial deterrent effect, both specific and general.""
177In my view, these comments are consistent with the statements of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Pogson, and apply to intensive correction orders in this State (see R v Pogson at [110]).
178At the same time, however, it is necessary to keep in mind that, as with all sentencing options that do not involve immediate incarceration, an intensive correction order also has a significant degree of leniency:  R v Pogson at [108].
179On 25 October 2012, I considered the preliminary question as to whether an assessment report should be obtained concerning the Offender's suitability for an intensive correction order.  Such an assessment is a mandatory requirement before a sentence of this type can be imposed:  s.67(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  I determined on that occasion, for the purpose of s.69(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate for the Offender and that the sentence was likely to be for a period of no more than two years.
180That assessment was necessary to trigger the request for an assessment report.  I made it clear that the question remained as to whether the Offender should be sentenced to full-time imprisonment, a question to be answered today as part of the sentencing decision.
181The assessment report dated 3 December 2012 states that the Offender has been assessed as suitable for an intensive correction order, and has signed an undertaking to comply with all of the obligations of such an order.  
182The report assessed the Offender as being at a low risk of reoffending, with his criminogenic needs being in the area of his mental health.  The author of the assessment report confirmed that contact had been made with the Offender's treating psychologist who stated that ongoing treatment was occurring.  The report stated that a local work placement had been arranged for the Offender to undertake the compulsory work component.  
183I have had regard to all aspects falling for consideration under s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  I have had regard, as well, to s.17A of that Act, which provides that a sentence of imprisonment is effectively a sentence of last resort.
184I have concluded that no sentence other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances of the case.  To impose a lesser sentence would not reflect the seriousness of the Offender's crimes, or give proper effect to applicable sentencing principles to which I have made reference.  
185I have had regard to the principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality.  I accept the Crown submission that the Offender's conduct cannot be treated as a single episode of criminality.  As there are a number of offences committed over a period of time, I consider that a measure of accumulation is appropriate, although I am satisfied that the total sentence of imprisonment should not exceed two years.  
186In my view, the appropriate sentencing outcome will involve concurrent sentences of imprisonment of one year with respect to each of the first to fifth offences, commencing today, 12 December 2012, and expiring on 11 December 2013.  With respect to the sixth to ninth offences, concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 12 months will be imposed, commencing on 12 December 2013 and expiring on 11 December 2014.
187I propose to direct that the sentences be served by way of intensive correction in the community.  
Orders
188Mr Glynatsis, would you please stand.
189I make the following orders:
(a) with respect to each of the insider trading offences contained in Counts 1 to 5 on the indictment, the Offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 12 months, commencing on 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 December 2013;

2760664,R v Oswald [2012] NSWDC 256,"SENTENCE

 

1HIS HONOUR: Brendan Oswald was convicted of possessing child pornography in 2004. He served a sentence of periodic detention and for some years after completion of that sentence he appears to have been able to refrain from committing further offences of that kind. But in 2009 things changed. Why that was has been difficult to determine. All I know is that in that year he began once again to access child pornography using the internet. Also in that year he began to realise that the victims, as I will describe the children involved in the production of that material for obvious reasons were not participating in the production of the material because they enjoyed it but because they were being exploited. Another thing happened in 2009 as well. The offender began to pay for child pornography. Indeed in that year he spent almost four and a half thousand dollars to get child pornography delivered to his computer.

 

2One of the reasons that he gave for not accessing treatment in 2009 was because of financial pressures. He said he could not afford to pay a psychologist, for example, but he did choose to spend money on accessing child pornography. One of the important aspects of determining a person's moral culpability is to examine to what level that person has made the choice to do the wrong thing. It has to be recognised that in 2009 the offender chose to spend money on accessing child pornography rather than receiving treatment to deal with his desires to commit that very offence.

 

3From 2009 until his later arrest the offender began downloading, storing and making available for dissemination a significant quantity of child pornography. There was so much material stored on seven separate storage devices owned by the offender that it was not reasonably possible for investigators to examine all of it. They therefore examined about ten per cent of the storage capacity possessed by the offender and discovered a significant quantity of pornography, about 160,000 images for example.

 

4The prosecution does not ask me to conclude that in the remaining ninety per cent there was further child pornography material and I will therefore proceed on the basis that the images and videos viewed by investigators represent the extent of the images and videos downloaded and stored by the offender. But there must come a time when a different approach has to be taken. With the introduction of faster and faster internet speeds and larger and larger storage devices it is impractical for every image and video stored by an offender to be viewed by an investigator, to say nothing of the occupational, health and safety risks that that would present to those investigators.

 

5Suggestions have been made, including by me, as to how this matter could be dealt with. I wish to suggest that we have now reached the stage where a different approach needs to be taken to the way in which cases of this kind are dealt with. But I repeat what I have just said is for the future. In the present proceedings I will proceed on the basis that the prosecution has asked me to that the extent of the offender's criminality is to be determined by taking into account those images and videos which the investigators were able to view and categorise as child pornography.

 

6The offender's activities on this occasion came to the attention of the authorities after a child pornographer in the Philippines was arrested. He was selling pornography and the offender was one of those who purchased it. This led to the investigators identifying the offender as possibly being a person who might have committed offences of this type. They therefore went to his premises on 30 November last year and searched those premises. The offender was at work but voluntarily attended at the police station that afternoon and was arrested. He was then released on bail. He participated in a record of interview with police and as far as can be told was honest with them. He explained what he had done and how he had done it and allowed police to use his log-in details to what appeared to be a file-sharing program, although there is no evidence that anything useful came of that.

 

7The images and videos are apparently primarily in the less serious categories, but simply because there is a significant number of images and videos of child pornography in this matter, even the fact that a small proportion of those images and videos were in the most serious categories, means that a large number of images and videos in those categories was found by the authorities. Thus there are over 800 images and videos showing bestiality and sadism involving children, and 17,000 images and videos involving things such as penetrative sex. The offender's focus seems to have been on pre-pubescent females and he gave evidence that the more serious forms of child pornography did not really interest him, but he nevertheless continued to possess those after downloading them.

 

8The offender was born in the Newcastle area. He has had an unremarkable upbringing except in what is described as the psycho sexual area. He had a good upbringing and indeed is supported in court by his parents today. Also in court to support him is the offender's wife. She married him before the first of his offences in 2004 but has remained supportive of him and their relationship continues to this day.

 

9The offender had trouble meeting and socialising, at least in a sexual way, with females of his age as he was growing up. His first sexual experience was an unusual one and thereafter he discovered the services of prostitutes and that they could provide him with the enjoyment that he sought. Indeed his first marriage was to a prostitute that he met in a brothel. Not surprisingly that marriage did not last long. (I suppose I should say the obvious that there is no suggestion that his current wife performed that occupation).

 

10A great deal of evidence concerned the future. Since being arrested on this occasion the offender has belatedly, it must be said, sought out treatment for what is clearly a disorder of paedophilia. That treatment will apparently take some time but has been relatively successful so far. There is thus hope that in the future the offender might, with the assistance of ongoing treatment, be able to resist the temptations to commit further offences of this kind in the future. If that happens of course not only does the offender benefit but so does the community and so I will make an adjustment between the head sentence and non parole periods in the offender's favour to allow an extended period of supervision on parole.

 

11But it remains the case that he must serve a significant time in custody. There are many reasons for that. At one stage I perhaps unfairly thought that Mr Sutton who appears for the offender today was going to suggest that a diagnosis of paedophilia would suggest that general deterrence needed to play less of a part in the sentence to be imposed upon Mr Oswald. Quite clearly that would not be the case. Indeed if that were the case then the law would soon cease to have an effective deterrent effect.

 

12It has to be recognised that it was the offender's personal choice to resume downloading child pornography in 2009. His decision to do so and his decision to make available child pornography and his decision to keep what he downloaded in his possession were all matters of personal choice. He may have been less able to make the right choice because of his disorder but it is still a choice he made.

 

13During the course of today's proceedings it has been suggested that similarities can be drawn with gambling and drinking, as both of those can lead to addictions. But I would prefer to draw the analogy with drug addiction. The authorities make it clear that where a person voluntarily commences to use drugs then ensuing addiction can have little mitigating effect. So it is with an addiction to child pornography, after all, no one could begin to commit offences of this kind thinking that what they were doing was not illegal. The offender's decision to commence downloading pornography in 2005 and then to resume his illegal activities in 2009 were all personal choices that he made. I repeat, for emphasis, that having made that choice he had the further decision as to whether he would spend money getting treatment for what he was doing or spend money obtaining more child pornography, and he chose the latter.

 

14The offender is, apart from his problems with child pornography, a man of apparently otherwise good character at least at the present point of time. He has a good work history and is well regarded by his friends and family. The fact that they still support him is of course testament to that. But that does not effect the circumstance that he in a significant way has committed very serious offences, each of which is capable of causing harm to the victims of such offences.

 

15As the Crown rightly points out there is one particular circumstance which makes the offender's conduct worse than ordinarily is the case and that is that he paid for some of this material. Part of the problem with downloading child pornography is that a market is created. Well, that is even more so the case when the person who produces the pornography can make money out of it by selling to people such as Mr Oswald. That evil person then has the incentive to abuse more and more children so that more and more child pornography can be produced and more and more money can be made from people like Mr Oswald. He has, as the Crown said, contributed to the market for child pornography and that does make his offending more serious than would otherwise have been the case.

 

16The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. That is consistent with his attitude towards police when they interviewed him and his evidence in court today when he said that in a strange way he was happy when the police arrived. I accept that he is remorseful for what he has done and is now struggling to come to terms with that and explain to himself and others why he continued to commit these offences for such a lengthy period of time knowing each time he did commit an individual aspect of the offence that he was causing harm as he did so.

 

17Because the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage there was a utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system too. His willingness to facilitate the course of justice in the Commonwealth matters and the utilitarian benefit in the State matter will lead to sentences which are twenty-five per cent than they would otherwise have been.

 

18I have decided to structure the sentences this way. There are five offences but if the law had not changed there would have only been three. Counts 1 and 2 concern similar conduct as do counts 3 and 4 but multiple charges needed to be laid because of the increase in the maximum penalty which occurred in April 2010. I will impose concurrent sentences on counts 1 and 2, and concurrent sentences on counts 3 and 4. But apart from that there will be partial accumulation to reflect the separate criminality involved in the separate aspects of what the offender did over those many years.

 

19I have decided to impose fixed terms on the Commonwealth matters because of the sentence that I will impose upon the State matter. As I mentioned earlier there will be an adjustment as far as the State matter is concerned in the offender's favour as far as the ratio between non parole period and head sentence is concerned. The overall ratio is more consistent with what use to happen before various bits of legislation suggested standard ratios between non parole period and head sentence.

 

20On count 1 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to date from 13 December 2012, that is today. On count 2 on the indictment I set a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months to date from 13 December 2012. On count 3 on the indictment I set a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to date from 13 June 2013, that is six months hence. On count 4 on the indictment I set a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months to date from 13 June 2013. On count 5 on the indictment I set a non parole period of twelve months to date from 13 December 2013 and a head sentence of three and a half years. That means the offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 12 December 2014. The overall sentence I have imposed consists of a non parole period of two years and period of eligibility for parole of two and a half years, making a total overall sentence of four and a half years.

2The consequences of these crimes extended from instilling terror in the occupants of the properties, the infliction of severe physical injury to a person and the death of another. 

3Sentencing hearings concerning Natuba and Tamapua proceeded before me on 1 and 2 November 2012. They have pleaded guilty to various offences.

4As a result, the Offenders are to be sentenced for serious crimes committed by them, including murder.

The Offenders and the Offences

(a) Conspiracy to carry out a robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon at Villawood on 29 June 2010.

(b) Robbery of Maxine Rogers whilst armed with an offensive weapon at Warwick Farm on 1 July 2010 (""the Warwick Farm offence"").

(c) Robbery of Tracey Burgess whilst armed with an offensive weapon at Lurnea on 1 July 2010. 

Natuba

7Natuba (who was aged 19 years and five months at the time of the offences) has pleaded guilty to the following offences:

(a) The Warwick Farm offence - robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900 - committed on 1 July 2010 against Maxine Rogers.

(b) The murder of Kesley Burgess on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea.

8Natuba asks the Court to take into account on sentence for murder, on a Form 1, an offence of robbery of Tracey Burgess whilst armed with an offensive weapon at Lurnea on 1 July 2010.

13The maximum penalty for an offence under s.33B(2) Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for 15 years, with no standard non-parole period applying to that offence.
 
Facts of Offences

14In the case of each Offender, an Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered by the Crown. These statements were detailed, with identical core features, and with differences reflecting the roles of the Offenders in the various crimes. 

15In addition, both Natuba and Tamapua gave evidence at the sentencing hearings. 

16What follows constitutes findings of fact drawn largely from the Agreed Statements of Facts. 

17A large number of persons are referred to in this factual recital. A number of these persons have already pleaded guilty and been sentenced in the District Court for their involvement in the offences, being persons who were not charged with murder, Richard Vergara (""Vergara""), John Bautista (""Bautista"") and CB. In addition, a number of persons (John Khoury (""Khoury""), Mohammed Karimi (""Karimi"") and Mahdi Mir (""Mir"") are to stand trial in this Court for murder and other matters in 2013. 

18MA, Thomas Byquar (""Byquar"") and David Ramos (""Ramos"") pleaded guilty and were sentenced by me on 11 December 2012: R v MA; R v Byquar; R v Ramos [2012] NSWSC 1527.

19Tuki was, on 23 November 2012, found unfit to be tried for the offences with which he is charged: R v Tuki [2012] NSWSC 1436.

Background to Offences

20In February 2010, Shane Kraak (""Kraak"") moved into a house at Claymore where he met Tamapua and his partner, Witness C.

21In May 2010, Vergara was associating with Tamapua. Vergara was friends with Ramos, MA, CB and Bautista. 

22In mid-to-late June 2010, Tamapua met Khoury, Tuki and Karimi - Tamapua knew Tuki from a time when they played football together.

23Khoury invited Tamapua, Vergara and Kraak to his home in Villawood (referred to as ""the compound""). Khoury then invited Tamapua to join his group, called the ""United Brotherhood"". Tamapua accepted.

24Tuki and Karimi were already members of the United Brotherhood and were Khoury's left and right-hand men. 

25Tamapua stated that he was answerable to Tuki so that ""if Ray wants one of my boys, he comes to me and says I want to take him with me this and that, and I say Alright, go with him"".

26A couple of days later Khoury began telling Tamapua, Vergara and Kraak about his plan to shut down all the drug dealers within the Liverpool, Warwick Farm and Villawood areas by committing home invasions to take their drugs. 

27On Tuesday, 29 June 2010, Tamapua and Vergara met in the Glenfield area. Tamapua stated that they caught a train to Villawood to meet Khoury, who had ""jobs"" for them to do that night. A number of people were in telephone contact with each other leading to a meeting at the compound. Ramos had access to his father's Toyota Tarago van, which came to be used in the offences. Vergara contacted Ramos concerning the use of the Tarago.

28At the meeting at the compound on the evening of 29 June 2010, those gathered discussed offences to be committed that night. Those present at the meeting were:

(a) Khoury (29 years' old);

(b) Karimi (22 years' old);

(c) Bautista (21 years' old);

(d) Tamapua (20 years' old);

(e) Tuki (20 years' old);

(f) Vergara (19 years' old);

(g) Ramos (18 years' old);

(h) Aimee Walsh (""Walsh""), Khoury's girlfriend (18 years' old);

(i) MA (17 years, eight months' old);

(h) CB (17 years, five months' old).

29Khoury gave the group instructions to commit a home invasion on the premises of Khoury's ex-girlfriend's uncle at Lakemba. Khoury wanted the group to steal firearms from a safe in the house that included a Desert Eagle .357 pistol, two Beretta pistols and a Glock pistol. Khoury told the group that they would be paid from the proceeds obtained from the guns.

30Khoury emphasised his particular desire that the Desert Eagle pistol be obtained. It was planned that four males would go inside the house, whilst Karimi and Tamapua stayed in the car in case something went wrong.

31Khoury gave the group weapons, including a large serrated machete and a sawn-off .22 calibre rifle, which were otherwise kept at the compound. Tamapua stated that the machete was his.

Conspiracy to Commit Robbery Whilst Armed with a Dangerous Weapon on 29 June 2010 (Form 1 Offence for Tamapua)

32Khoury and Walsh drove to the Lakemba address in a vehicle with Tamapua, whilst MA, CB, Karimi, Vergara and Bautista were driven by Ramos in the Tarago van. Khoury pointed out the address and then departed. 

33Karimi loaded the .22 sawn-off rifle and then gave it to Vergara. Vergara checked out the property and returned to the vehicle, with MA, CB and Bautista following Vergara into the house. Karimi, Tamapua and Ramos remained in the Tarago van. One of the men accompanying Vergara was armed with a large machete, whilst another had a bag to collect the intended proceeds.

34Soon after, the group returned empty handed to the Tarago van. Vergara told Karimi that they had not done the job because there were three boys and two girls in the house, and they thought they were outnumbered. Karimi became upset because Khoury had given directions that he wanted the Desert Eagle pistol from the house. Karimi instructed them to return to the house and complete the job.

35The group of young men then returned to the house. Once again, they returned empty handed to the vehicle a couple of minutes later. Vergara said that the people had now left the house so they could not carry out a home invasion. Karimi became extremely angry, and took the rifle from Vergara and told them to return to the compound saying, words to the effect, ""We are going to get shot when we get back to the compound"". Tamapua stated that this was a reference to Khoury becoming very angry when they went back empty handed.
 
The Ashcroft Offence - Specially Aggravated Break, Enter and Steal Offence on 29 June 2010 Involving Serious Injury to James Stiff (Offence of Tamapua)

36After the failed home invasion on the evening of 29 June 2010, the group returned to the compound where Khoury was informed as to what had happened. On hearing this account, Khoury told the group that they would do a job at Ashcroft.

37Khoury directed Tamapua that MA, CB, Vergara and Bautista were to go with Tamapua to do the Ashcroft job. Vergara was given a large machete for that purpose. The plan was that four males would enter the Ashcroft address, which was believed to be occupied by a known drug supplier, with Tamapua and Karimi remaining outside. The purpose of this raid was to steal drugs and money at the house, and return them to Khoury. Tamapua stated that the Ashcroft offence was to be an initiation for Vergara, who had failed with the Lakemba job.

38Tamapua, MA, Vergara, Karimi, CB and Bautista travelled in the Tarago van, which was driven by Ramos to Ashcroft. Ramos drove past the nominated address in Ashcroft and Tamapua pointed out the house. According to Tamapua, it had been intended that the job be done the previous night, ""but the bloke wasn't home"".

39MA, Vergara, CB and Bautista got out of the Tarago van and walked towards the Ashcroft house. Vergara was armed with a large machete. CB carried a bag to collect the stolen property. Tamapua, Karimi and Ramos remained in the Tarago van. Karimi had the shortened .22 rifle with him although it remained with him in the Tarago van.

40James Stiff (39 years' old) lived at the Ashcroft property with his wife and three teenage children. At about 10.40 pm, one of the Offenders knocked on the front door of the property. All members of the Stiff family were asleep at that time. Mr Stiff walked to the front door and asked ""Who is it?"". He heard a voice say ""It's Damo"" and he thought it was a person that he knew. After opening the front door, Mr Stiff observed Bautista holding the screen door open with his back. At this point, Vergara stepped up to the front door and swung the machete at Mr Stiff, who put his left arm up to protect himself. The machete hit his forearm causing a deep cut down to the bone. The wound bled profusely. 

41MA, Vergara and Bautista forced their way through the front door heading to the lounge room. MA was wearing a ""hoodie"" pulled over his head. MA moved towards Mr Stiff and pointed at him, what appeared to be a rifle covered with a red cloth. MA said ""Don't move or I'll blow your fucking head off"". 

42Mr Stiff retreated to a corner of the lounge room, still in the presence of MA. Mr Stiff was going into shock as he saw a large flap of skin and muscle hanging off his arm and the bone below.

43Bautista and Vergara walked to the hallway adjoining the lounge room. Mr Stiff's 17-year old daughter awoke at this point and went to the bathroom. As she walked into the hallway, she saw two men, Bautista and Vergara. Vergara was holding a machete, and wore black gloves and a black-hooded jumper with the hood pulled over his head. He held the machete out in front of him and was waving it in a threatening manner.

44Mr Stiff's 18-year old son heard a male voice say ""Get back in your room"". He could hear his sister commencing to cry, so he opened his bedroom door. He observed a male (Bautista) who demanded ""Where's all the money?"". At the same time, he observed Vergara with a machete. 

45The 17-year old daughter returned to her bedroom and closed the door. At this point, her mother, who had fallen asleep in her daughter's bedroom, woke up and tried to go out of the bedroom. Another 12-year old daughter remained asleep in the same bedroom. The 17-year old daughter stopped her mother from leaving the room.

46Vergara asked the 18-year old son for money and also enquired ""Where's the stuff?"", whilst holding the machete upright at head height. The son felt threatened by the machete and went to his father's bedroom and obtained a clear plastic lunchbox containing two or three bags of cannabis (about seven grams) which he gave to Vergara. 

47Vergara then ran down the hallway with the drugs, hitting the hallway wall with the machete. 

48The 18-year old son observed MA pointing what he believed to be a firearm at his father's head. MA picked up the 17-year old daughter's school laptop computer and, at this point, all the Offenders decamped through the front door.

49Family members then attended to Mr Stiff. He was bleeding heavily and was taken by his son to Liverpool Hospital. I will recount the injuries sustained by Mr Stiff later in these remarks. It is sufficient to observe at this point that he suffered very severe injuries. 

50After fleeing the Ashcroft address, MA, Vergara, CB and Bautista ran back to the Tarago van, where Ramos, Tamapua and Karimi were waiting. As they drove back to the compound, Vergara smiled and laughed when he told the others in the Tarago van how he ""chopped"" the male victim in the arm.

51Karimi grabbed the proceeds of the offence (the container of cannabis and the laptop computer) and placed them into one bag. Karimi said ""Is this all?"". 

52Whilst Mr Stiff was at Liverpool Hospital with his son after 10.47 pm, Tuki was observed on CCTV in the waiting area of the hospital. Tuki used his mobile phone to contact Khoury.

53When the group returned to the compound, Karimi patted the others down to make sure that they were not hiding any proceeds of the offence. Karimi gave the stolen items to Khoury, who counted the cannabis sticks in the container and handed them out to the group over a number of days.

54In response to an enquiry from Khoury as to what had happened at the Ashcroft address, Vergara boasted in detail about how he chopped the victim, and how he had bounced the machete off the walls as he was slicing. Khoury told the group that Tuki had seen the victim at hospital.

Meetings, Events and Planning on 1 July 2010 for Further Home Invasions and the Recruitment of Natuba

55During the afternoon of 1 July 2010, as a result of a conversation with Tamapua, Byquar made some telephone calls in an attempt to recruit other young men to engage in these activities. Khoury asked Byquar to recruit other young men, indicating that Byquar had ""a test tonight"".

56Byquar sent a SMS message in the early evening of 1 July 2010 to his cousin, Natuba. It said ""U want 2 recruit 2 united! Don't call txt me!"". Two minutes later, Natuba replied ""Wats dat"", and Byquar replied ""New game cumin up! Connected 2 benditoz n that!"". By a process of SMS message and telephone calls, Byquar told Natuba to come to Chester Hill to do some ""jobs"" to make money.

57As a result of these calls, at about 8.25 pm on 1 July 2010, Natuba joined Byquar and others at the Chester Hill Hotel. Tamapua told Natuba that the group committed home invasions on drug dealers, and asked if he knew anyone interested in joining them.

58Soon after 9.30 pm, Vergara contacted Ramos, requesting that they meet at Chester Hill. The group met back at Khoury's shop where Tamapua introduced Natuba to Khoury. In the course of discussion about events planned for that night, Khoury produced a large Elephant-brand meat cleaver. The group discussed the use of meat cleavers in the events being planned. Tamapua felt the weight of the meat cleaver which he described as being ""very heavy"".

59A plan was hatched to invade the home of a drug dealer known as ""Beanie Boy"" at Warwick Farm. Tamapua had some knowledge of the activities of ""Beanie Boy"" and Khoury instructed Tamapua to ""shut him down"" as part of Khoury's plan to shut down businesses in Liverpool and Warwick Farm so that he could carry on in their place.

60During this discussion, plans were also made for what was described as the ""Jacob job"". This involved a plan to raid the home of Jacob Burgess, the brother of Kesley Burgess. Karimi was placed in charge of the ""Jacob job"".

61It was decided that the next job would be the raid on ""Beanie Boy"". Tamapua and Khoury decided that the job would be done by MA, Byquar, Natuba and Mir with Ramos as the driver. Tamapua and Karimi were to accompany the group to oversee the job and point out relevant addresses. 

62Khoury obtained four Elephant-brand meat cleavers and handed them out to members of the group. Each of MA, Byquar, Natuba and Mir were handed a meat cleaver. Khoury instructed the group that the meat cleavers were for doing the jobs that night. In addition, each of these four men was given a pair of white gardening-type gloves with green dots for grip. 

63Soon after 10.20 pm, MA, Byquar, Natuba, Mir, Tamapua and Karimi entered the Tarago vehicle driven by Ramos which headed in the direction of Warwick Farm. Ramos parked the vehicle at a location indicated by Tamapua. Tamapua then sent Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir to what was thought to be ""Beanie Boy's"" address to scare him and take his ""stuff"". Tamapua, Karimi and Ramos remained in the Tarago.

The Warwick Farm Offence - Armed Robbery of Maxine Rogers on 1 July 2010 (Offence of Natuba; Form 1 for Tamapua)

64At about 10.45 pm, Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir approached premises at Hume Highway, Warwick Farm each armed with a meat cleaver and wearing gloves. Byquar went to the front door and knocked. 

65Maxine Rogers (41 years' old) was present in her unit with her daughters aged nine and 10 years. She looked out the window and saw a boy wearing a hooded jacket, whom she thought mistakenly was her son. She opened the front door. The four men then rushed inside, pushing Ms Rogers and causing her to scream. Natuba held his meat cleaver up to Ms Roger's face and told her to ""shut up"". Ms Rogers picked up her mobile phone and Natuba took it from her. He held his meat cleaver to her face and asked ""Where are the drugs?"". Ms Rogers replied ""We don't have any drugs, it's just me and my girls. Don't hurt us, we don't have any drugs"".

66Byquar, MA and Mir unsuccessfully searched the unit for money and drugs whilst Natuba kept asking Ms Rogers ""Where's the drugs?"", with Ms Rogers responding in the negative. Ms Rogers' daughters sat close to their mother, witnessing events. 

67Natuba retained Ms Rogers' mobile phone and one of the other men grabbed a laptop computer belonging to Ms Rogers' son, before the men ran out of the unit. 

68The group ran back to the Tarago vehicle and told Tamapua what had happened. He realised that they had entered the wrong unit. Tamapua rang ""Beanie Boy"" and the two persons made several threats to each other. Tamapua was angry so the group spent some time in Warwick Farm, unsuccessfully looking for ""Beanie Boy"". As it happened, he lived in another unit in the block where Maxine Rogers lived.
 
The Murder of Kesley Burgess and the Form 1 Offence of Armed Robbery of Tracey Burgess on 1 July 2010 (Offences of Natuba and Tamapua)

69After the Warwick Farm offence, Tamapua turned to the others and said ""What do we do now?"". Karimi advised that they needed to drive to Merrylands to meet his cousin who knew the address of Jacob. They travelled to Granville and, shortly after, Karimi, Tamapua and an associate of Karimi got into a white car.

70It was decided to commit the ""Jacob job"" at Lurnea. Karimi directed Ramos where to drive.

71With the guidance of Karimi in the white vehicle (with Tamapua and another person), the occupants of the Tarago travelled to the vicinity of the Burgess home at Lurnea. The intended purpose of the offence was to target Jacob Burgess, and to forcefully steal drugs and money from him using weapons.

72As they approached Lurnea, Karimi and his associate spoke to each other. Karimi's associate said he knew Jacob had a shotgun.

73Karimi's associate pointed out Jacob Burgess' home. Karimi told his associate not to park in front of the Burgess house, and the white car parked in a nearby street. Ramos parked the Tarago behind the white car.

74Karimi got out and spoke to the occupants of the Tarago. He indicated the Burgess house, before returning to the white car where he remained with Tamapua and his associate.

75At some time after 11.15 pm, Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir got out of the Tarago and approached the Burgess home, each armed with a meat cleaver. Ramos remained in the Tarago. According to Natuba, the plan was that he and Byquar would go to the house first, followed by the two other men.

76Byquar knocked on the front door of the Burgess home whilst Natuba waited at the side. Present in the house at that time were Tracey Burgess (47 years' old), her son Kesley Burgess (25 years' old), his girlfriend, Kristal McLachlan (24 years' old) and a family friend, Gary Venus (56 years' old). All the occupants were asleep or preparing to go to sleep, except for Mr Venus who was watching television in the lounge room. 

77On hearing a knock on the door, Mr Venus thought it was Jacob Burgess (20 years' old), as he had recently left the house to see friends. As Mr Venus commenced to open the door, it flung open and struck him on the head and he fell backwards on the floor. 

78Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir then entered the front door and moved to the lounge room. 

79As Mr Venus opened the front door, Tracey Burgess came out of her bedroom and observed a number of men enter the house armed with what she described as machetes. She immediately ran to Kesley Burgess' bedroom, screaming to him to open the bedroom door. Tracey Burgess looked back and saw a tall dark male close by with a meat cleaver. He was dressed in black clothing with a black cover on his face, so that only his eyes were visible. This was Natuba, who headed for the bedroom as Karimi had told him earlier that a male in the house may have a shotgun, so he went straight for the bedrooms to try to get to him first.

80Natuba said to Tracey Burgess ""Where is the drugs and the cash?"". Tracey Burgess was crying and replied ""There are no drugs or cash"". Natuba grabbed Tracey Burgess by her nightie and pushed her whilst demanding money. Natuba then smashed a number of items and yelled ""I want the money"". He said words similar to ""I will kill you"" and swung the meat cleaver towards Tracey Burgess. The meat cleaver missed her face, but the tip of the blade glanced the palm of her left hand, before impacting heavily and wedging into the laundry door. Natuba pulled the meat cleaver from the laundry door and commenced to hit items on the bookshelf in the hallway.

81Each of the males made demands for cash and drugs. 

82Kesley Burgess armed himself with a weapon similar to a machete before telling Ms McLachlan to stay in the room. She did so, shaking and looking for her mobile phone. She could hear smashing and banging, as well as Kesley Burgess saying ""Get out. Get out. Get out"".

83Tracey Burgess observed Kesley Burgess lunge at Natuba using what she described as a sword, and push him back into the lounge room. 

84Meanwhile, Ms McLachlan had located Kesley Burgess' mobile phone and used it to ring ""000"". As Ms McLachlan commenced to speak to the ""000"" operator, she saw one of the four men open the bedroom door. This man, who was wearing a black beanie and was armed with a meat cleaver, told her to get off the phone. Terrified, Ms McLachlan threw the mobile phone at the person who put it into his trouser pocket.

85Meanwhile, Kesley Burgess struck Natuba with his weapon in the lounge room, causing a stab wound to Natuba's shoulder. Byquar then hit Kesley Burgess from the back, before Kesley Burgess grabbed Mir and the two men fought each other. According to Natuba, Mir slashed Kesley Burgess' hand during this exchange. At one point, Byquar swung his meat cleaver at Kesley Burgess, but missed and struck his own foot, causing a deep cut which bled freely. 

86According to Natuba, Kesley Burgess had said earlier ""I've got nothing. I've got an ounce in the kitchen, that's it"". Natuba described Kesley Burgess as ""pleading"" with the men, stating that that was all that he had.

87Kesley Burgess fell to the ground.

88Natuba examined the injury to his own shoulder and then, whilst in a rage, picked up a coffee table and flipped it, demanding to know where the drugs and money were and then slashing at Kesley Burgess while he lay on the ground, striking him once to his lower leg.

89Tracey Burgess looked into the lounge room and observed Kesley Burgess lying on his back on the floor with his head under a glass coffee table. She saw three men, including Natuba, crowded around Kesley Burgess, using their weapons to hit him. At this point of the attack, Tracey Burgess fell to her knees and repeatedly screamed ""Kill me, please kill me!"".

90Kesley Burgess was struck a number of blows, sustaining eight incised wounds to various parts of his body.

91Forensic examination revealed that the characteristics of the wounds indicated infliction by a sharp-edged implement or implements in a chopping or slashing motion, applied with severe force. The wounds to the upper limbs were defensive in nature. The wounds to the left and right buttocks were aligned, indicating that it was caused by the same action.

92Tracey Burgess went into the kitchen and grabbed a tin in the shape of a Jim Beam racing car which contained some cannabis. One of the armed men came to the kitchen door, and Tracey Burgess threw the tin at him and he put it under his arm. As this man walked out of the kitchen, he grabbed Tracey Burgess' beach bag and a handbag that was on a chair. Tracey Burgess' handbag contained a wallet in which there was $420.00 in cash, her driver's licence and Medicare card, keycards and other personal cards together with Mr Venus' wallet and Jacob Burgess' wallet. These acts give rise to the armed robbery offence to be taken into account, on a Form 1, on sentence of the Offenders for murder.

93At this time, Mr Venus was attempting to assist Kesley Burgess on the floor of the lounge room. Kesley Burgess was bleeding heavily and there was a large amount of blood on the floor. Tracey Burgess phoned ""000"" and reported that four people with machetes were fighting and her son was injured and was going to pass out.

94Police arrived shortly afterwards and attended to Kesley Burgess before the arrival of ambulance officers who treated Kesley Burgess and then conveyed him to Liverpool Hospital. 

95Kesley Burgess died at about 9.15 pm on 2 July 2010 whilst in hospital. The post-mortem report stated that the direct cause of death was multiple incised wounds, with the combination of injuries resulting in blood loss, hypotension and ultimately cardiac arrest.

The Offenders Flee the Scene and Return to Khoury's Shop

96Byquar, MA, Mir and Natuba fled the house and ran back to the vehicle. 

97A neighbour had heard crashing and banging sounds from the Burgess house, and went to the lounge room window and saw four men, all wearing dark clothing with hoods, run down the front stairs of the Burgess house and run down the street.

98The men had with them Tracey Burgess' beach bag and handbag, the Jim Beam tin and Kesley Burgess' mobile phone. 

99Tamapua saw that Mir was covered with blood.

100Tamapua, Karimi and Mir left the area in the white vehicle. Ramos left the area with the others in the Tarago. Tamapua told Ramos by telephone to return to Khoury's shop.

101When Tamapua came to Khoury's shop, Khoury, Walsh, Tuki, Vergara, Kraak and Witness C were there. Karimi, Mir and Karimi's associate were also there. Tamapua saw Mir go to the back of Khoury's shop, where he threw his meat cleaver away and started to take his clothes off. The phone was given to Kraak and Tamapua told him to ""keep it, hide it, whatever"".

102Soon after, the group in the Tarago arrived at the shop. It was observed that both Byquar and Natuba were injured. Discussion ensued as to what had happened in the Burgess house. According to Tamapua, those who had struck Kesley Burgess were laughing, with Mir saying ""I got him good on the wrist"" and mentioning how many times he had struck Kesley Burgess.

103Natuba was heard to say ""A big bloke ran up behind me and chopped me! I dropped to the ground and spun around and hit the bloke in the ankle with the meat cleaver. Old mate [Mir] ran over with Sonny and we all started to chop into him"". Mir was heard to say ""Yeah I chopped the cunt"" in a bragging tone. According to Kraak, Mir said ""I chopped him good"". As they were describing the attack, Khoury and Walsh laughed.

104Byquar also detailed to the group how he missed the victim and chopped his own toe. The group then made efforts to clean themselves and dispose of the weapons. Bloodstained clothing was collected and placed into a plastic bag.

105Tamapua and Khoury then looked through the wallets and handbags which had been stolen. Khoury expressed disappointment to the group that there was only a small amount of money. 

106Three bloodstained meat cleavers were placed on a towel at the back of Khoury's shop.

107It became apparent that Natuba required medical attention. Khoury instructed Vergara and Ramos to drive him to Bankstown Hospital, as it would be too suspicious to take him to Liverpool Hospital. A story was devised, in case of any police enquiry, that Natuba would say that he had been ""jumped"" in Bankstown.

108Before the others left Khoury's shop, Khoury told the group to keep their mouths shut and that if anyone said anything, they would be shot. After efforts were made to clean up Khoury's shop and the persons involved, the group left and went their separate ways. 

109Later that morning, Ramos drove Tamapua and Witness C back to their premises, where Byquar, Kraak and Vergara were present. Tamapua saw that Byquar was playing with the mobile phone of Kesley Burgess, which was handed to Tamapua, who had a look and then returned it to Byquar.

Police Interviews with Natuba at Bankstown Hospital on 2 July 2010 and Subsequent Events Involving Tamapua and Others

110At about 1.15 am on 2 July 2010, police attended Bankstown Hospital to allow a prisoner in an unrelated matter to receive medical attention. 

111During this time, police were informed of the presence of an injured man (Natuba) in the Emergency Department. Police spoke to Natuba, who gave a false account as to how he had come to be injured.

112At about 3.45 am, police again spoke to Natuba, who continued to give a false account.

113At about 4.00 pm on 2 July 2010, a video interview of Natuba was conducted by police at Bankstown Hospital, at the commencement of which Natuba was told he was under arrest for the Warwick Farm offence and offences arising from the home invasion at the Burgess house. Natuba then told police that his earlier account was false and that he had been involved in the home invasion offences committed on 1 July 2010. Natuba initially detailed his involvement and the involvement of others, however he said he was unaware of the identity of any of the co-offenders.

114During the afternoon of 2 July 2010, police searched the Burgess house and found a Winchester .22 long rifle in one of the bedrooms and four cannabis plants, a transformer and high-powered lamp in the back shed.

115During 2 July 2010, police initiated telephone intercepts with respect to the telephones of Tamapua, Vergara, Natuba and Kraak. 

116At 11.04 pm on 2 July 2010, Tamapua called a male who asked him if he has ""pumped anything lately"". Tamapua replied ""just a couple of dealers and shit man"". Tamapua then stated ""The Lakemba one is still on hold"". He went on to say ""there's registered fummers [or similar] in the safe"". The male asked if he was going to do that one and Tamapua replied not yet.

117At 11.20 pm, Karimi rang Tamapua and they spoke briefly. Karimi then asked to speak to Khoury. During this conversation, Khoury said ""Did you get rid of everything"" and Karimi said ""Not yet"". Khoury said ""Why, it should be very quick"", and discussion continued on the topic.

118At 3.44 am on 3 July 2010, Tamapua called an associate and told him to become part of the group as of tomorrow, as he has something to do tomorrow. Tamapua then put Byquar on the phone, who told the male to make sure he came the next day.

119On the morning of 3 July 2010, major media outlets reported that Kesley Burgess had died.

120At 8.54 am on 3 July 2010, Natuba rang an associate using his intercepted phone whilst in hospital, and told the associate that he slashed a guy's legs in a home invasion. Natuba later called another associate and said that he had stabbed a male who died and he was going to be charged. In a later call, he told an associate that he was going to tell the police the truth.

121Later on the morning of 3 July 2010, detectives informed Natuba that Kesley Burgess had died. Natuba then disclosed that his cousin, Byquar, had been involved in the offence.

122After being interviewed at Bankstown Police Station, Natuba took part in a drive around with police on the evening of 3 July 2010, during which he pointed out various locations, including Khoury's shop.

123After 2.30 pm on 3 July 2010, Khoury and Karimi picked up Tamapua in a vehicle. Khoury asked Tamapua if he had heard the good news before saying that Kesley Burgess was dead. Khoury told them to ring everyone who was involved and tell them not to say anything.

Tamapua's Firearm Offences at Miller Between 3 and 4 July 2010

124During the afternoon of 3 July 2010, Byquar met John Unasa (""Unasa"") (19 years' old) and took him to the compound, where he introduced him to a number of persons, including Tamapua, Khoury and Vergara. Khoury was introduced to Unasa as the ringleader. Tamapua and Khoury explained that the group made money by doing home invasions and that Unasa would have to do a ""test"" that night to prove himself first. It was said that as they were already ""red hot"" from the murder at Lurnea, they had decided not to do anything that night.

125On the evening of 3 July 2010, Unasa and Byquar attended the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre at Miller where there was a Polynesian night to raise funds. About 350-400 people of Polynesian descent, including families and children, attended the event where food and alcohol were being consumed and six security guards were providing security.

126A confrontation is said to have occurred between Unasa, Byquar and others and Daryl Pologa (""Pologa""), who was allegedly part of a group called the ""Miller Boys"". A confrontation between two groups of young men was developing, when Pologa noticed some police cars arrive and they decided to leave.

127As Unasa was being told to go inside by security guards, he allegedly told Byquar to make a call summoning members of the United Brotherhood to help them.

128Telephone contact was recorded between a number of persons, including Karimi, Tamapua and Khoury.

129At 11.38 pm, Tamapua spoke to Unasa on an intercepted phone and enquired as to where ""Sonny"" was. Unasa told him ""Sonny"" was outside. Further conversations by telephone took place between Tamapua, Vergara and Unasa. During one call, Vergara told Tamapua ""I am just going to pick up something from Bishop [Khoury], you know what I mean?"", the something being a reference to a firearm.

130Further telephone conversations took place including calls between Byquar and Tamapua.

131Tamapua stated that when he and the others were travelling to the Miller pools, Karimi said that as soon as they got there, Tamapua would go and see where they are. If Tamapua didn't come back in five minutes, Karimi was ""going to come up and just start popping everyone"". They also discussed that Vergara was there to chop with the machete that he had, Tamapua was the puncher whilst Tuki was the driver.

132About 1.15 am on 4 July 2010, police stopped a vehicle in Miller on the basis of these telephone intercepts between several members of the United Brotherhood, arranging guns and knives to be brought to assist in a confrontation with other males at Miller. Police removed Tuki, Tamapua, Karimi and Vergara from the vehicle. 

133Located in the vehicle were a machete in a sheath, a shortened .22 calibre long rifle and a knife. Tamapua stated that the machete was the one used by Vergara during the Ashcroft offence.

134Subsequent analysis of a stained area on the tip of the machete blade identified a partial DNA profile matching the DNA profile of Mr Stiff. The shortened .22 calibre long rifle had been stored at the compound. Khoury's DNA was located on the rifle. Vergara's shoes were seized and the DNA of Mr Stiff was detected on one of them.

135Tamapua participated in an interview where he initially stated that he was being dropped at his cousin's house and had no idea about the weapons in the vehicle, or what they were going to be used for. Police obtained an extension-of-time warrant. After the warrant was granted, and the interview resumed, Tamapua said ""Listen, you know what, fuck this. All right. I'm going to say everything ... but I need you to protect my family"". Tamapua then gave detailed information about the United Brotherhood and the offences they had committed including the murder of Kesley Burgess. He also made admissions regarding his involvement in the offences.

136At about 1.30 am on 4 July 2010, police approached Byquar in Cabramatta Avenue, Miller and placed him under arrest. 

Searches and Forensic Examination of Various Premises and the Location of Evidence

137On 4 July 2010, police executed a crime scene warrant at Khoury's shop and forensic examination of the premises proceeded over the next three days. This examination found several sources of human blood and extensive evidence of blood clean up. Subsequent analysis identified the blood as being that of Natuba and Byquar.

138The Jim Beam tin taken from the Burgess home was found inside Khoury's shop with blood smears on it. Fingerprints belonging to Karimi, Khoury and Walsh were identified on the tin, as well as the DNA and fingerprints of Kesley Burgess.

139Fingerprints belonging to Khoury, Tuki, Vergara, Karimi, Walsh and MA were found at different areas in Khoury's shop. The fingerprints of Khoury were found on a mop that appeared to have been used to clean up blood.

140The search of Khoury's shop revealed a large number of meat cleavers identical to the ones used in offences on 1 July 2010. It appeared that the meat cleavers and other knives were intended to be put on sale at Khoury's shop.

141Forensic examination of the Burgess home found the blood of Natuba on a coffee table in the lounge room where Kesley Burgess had been attacked.

142Tamapua told police that he had taken Kesley Burgess' mobile phone with blood on it. After Tamapua's arrest, Kraak placed the mobile phone inside a sock and secreted it at the rear of a neighbour's property in Claymore. Police attended that location and found the mobile phone, with subsequent analysis identifying Kraak's DNA and Byquar's blood on the mobile phone.

Police Seizure of the Ramos Tarago on 6 July 2010 and Subsequent Forensic Testing

143On 6 July 2010, police observed the Ramos Tarago in Macquarie Fields. The vehicle was stopped. Ramos, MA and others were in the vehicle. Police seized the Tarago, informing Ramos it was being taken in connection with the murder of Kesley Burgess.

144Initial forensic testing of the Tarago found visible blood staining on the seat and the foot well in the first row of seats behind the driver. Further examination revealed that the Tarago had been cleaned. Subsequent analysis revealed the DNA of Natuba, the blood of Byquar and the blood of Kesley Burgess inside the Tarago, with the fingerprints of MA and Ramos also being located in the vehicle.

Arrest of MA, Byquar, Ramos and Others on 22 July 2010

145On 22 July 2010, police mounted a large-scale operation where Ramos, MA, Mir, Tamapua and Byquar were arrested and charged with the murder of Kesley Burgess. These arrests received wide media coverage.

146Tamapua participated in a further recorded interview where he provided more detail about the Lakemba conspiracy offence and the Ashcroft offence.

147On 6 September 2010, police located a white Toyota Echo at Granville. The registered owner was Sadiqa Karimi, the cousin of Karimi. That vehicle is said to be the white vehicle in which Karimi, Tamapua and Karimi's associate travelled to the Burgess home on 1 July 2010.

Arrest of Khoury and Walsh on 29 September 2010 and Forensic Examination of Meat Cleavers

148On 29 September 2010, police arrested Khoury and Walsh. A search warrant was executed, and a bag was located which contained three Elephant brand meat cleavers wrapped in a towel. 

149Forensic analysis of the meat cleavers identified Tuki's fingerprint on the blade of one of the meat cleavers, Tuki's DNA on the handle of a meat cleaver and Kesley Burgess' blood on the blade of one of the meat cleavers.

Effects of Offences Upon the Surviving Victims

James Stiff and his Family

150Mr Stiff was taken to hospital on the evening of the Ashcroft offence. He was operated upon to repair damage to tendons, nerves and muscles. Mr Stiff also received a blood transfusion due to the amount of blood lost. 

151Mr Stiff's injuries included:

(a) a compound division of the ulnar artery and nerve;

(b) division of the flexor tendon muscle to the fingers (used to flex the fingers);

(c) division of the flexor tendon muscle to the wrist (used to flex the wrist); and

(d) irregularity of the surface of the ulnar bone (one of the two forearm bones) indicating that the machete had impacted with the bone.

152Mr Stiff was discharged on 3 July 2010. Whilst the outcome was expected to be good, Mr Stiff required hand therapy to regain strength and movement of the wrist and fingers. Nerve recovery to the hand is variable and may take some time to occur. Despite good nerve recovery, it may never reach pre-injury state.

153A victim impact statement was made by Mr Stiff on 24 February 2012, some 18 months after the offence. It is apparent that Mr Stiff continues to experience the damaging physical and emotional consequences resulting from the invasion of his home. 

154Mr Stiff described the serious and long-lasting psychological effects resulting from the invasion of his home and the attack upon him. He referred, as well, to the detrimental effects of the offence upon his children, who were present at the time of these terrible events. The family could not remain at the house and have been living elsewhere. Mr Stiff and his family were understandably fearful about returning to the house.

155Mr Stiff referred, as well, to financial and other difficulties flowing from his inability to use his hand and the scarring on his arm. 

156A report of Lubica Vracar, psychologist, dated 22 December 2010 confirmed that Mr Stiff was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder with severe features of anxiety and depression.

Tracey Burgess and the Burgess Family

157Tracey Burgess made a victim impact statement, which she read to the Court during the Natuba sentencing hearing. 

158It is appropriate that I state, in these remarks on sentence, a number of matters mentioned by me in the course of sentencing MA, Byquar and Ramos.

159In the eyes of the law, Mrs Burgess is a victim in at least two ways. She is a direct victim of the armed robbery offence, to be taken into account on sentence for murder on a Form 1. In addition, Mrs Burgess was a family victim of the murder of her son, Kesley. 

160This is not a case where a member of the family of a deceased person learns of the event indirectly and after it has occurred. Rather, Tracey Burgess was present and observed the horrifying events which took place in her house, culminating in the brutal killing of her son. 

161Mrs Burgess gave a harrowing account of this dreadful night and its effects upon her family. The recital, earlier in these remarks, of the events which took place in the Burgess home on this night, and of the direct involvement of Mrs Burgess, allows some understanding of the devastating effect of these experiences upon Mrs Burgess. It is difficult to imagine a worse experience that a mother could be called upon to endure.

162A report dated 19 September 2012 of Dr Sidney Lo confirms the understandable position that, as a result of the offences, Mrs Burgess experiences a high degree of stress, which has had a detrimental effect upon her physical health in a number of ways. 

163The substantial personal harm suffered by Mrs Burgess as the victim of an armed robbery is to be taken into account as a relevant factor in determining the objective gravity of that Form 1 offence.

164I acknowledge the dreadful loss suffered by Mrs Burgess and the Burgess family, as a result of the death of Kesley and the impact of that loss, which will undoubtedly be life long. 

165During the Natuba sentencing hearing, after Mrs Burgess had made the victim impact statement, I expressed the condolences of the Court and the community for the family's great loss. In these formal remarks on sentence, I once again express condolences on behalf of the community to the Burgess family.

166In passing sentence on the murder counts, I keep in mind the principles in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim 501 at 529-520.

Maxine Rogers and her Children

167Although no victim impact statement was made by or on behalf of Maxine Rogers, an irresistible inference is available, and should be drawn, that the invasion of her home by armed men brandishing machetes would have been a terrifying experience for her and her two young daughters.

168No medical evidence or victim impact statement is required before a sentencing court can draw obvious inferences from facts such as those giving rise to the Warwick Farm offence.

Sentences Imposed Upon Co-Offenders in the Supreme Court and the District Court

169On 11 December 2012, I sentenced MA, Byquar and Ramos for a series of offences in which Natuba and Tamapua were co-offenders. It is not necessary to recite the circumstances of those offences and those Offenders, and the sentences imposed upon them, in these remarks. What was said in that separate judgment ought be read in conjunction with these remarks on sentence. I will refer to matters relevant to issues of parity and proportionality later in these remarks.

170Likewise, it is not necessary to recite the detailed account provided in those remarks (at [149]-[172]) of the sentences imposed upon Vergara, Bautista and CB in the District Court. It is sufficient to observe that the firearm offences for which Vergara was sentenced (see [149](c) and (d)) are the same offences for which Tamapua is to be sentenced arising from events at Miller on 3-4 July 2010.

Subjective Circumstances of Natuba and Tamapua

Natuba

171Natuba was 19 years and five months' old at the time of the offences and is now 21 years' old. 

172Natuba has a prior criminal history. On 7 August 2008, he received a suspended four months' control order in the Parramatta Children's Court for an offence of aggravated robbery.

173On 1 June 2009, he was called up in relation to the aggravated robbery offence, with the four-month control order being imposed commencing 1 June 2009. On the same day, he was granted probation for 16 months, subject to supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

174On 21 December 2009, Natuba was fined $500.00 and placed on an 18-month good behaviour bond, with supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, for damaging property. 

175Accordingly, Natuba was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the present offences by way of the probation order made on 1 June 2009 and the bond granted on 21 December 2009. 

176Ms Loukas SC, for Natuba, tendered a number of documents on sentence. These included a report of Mr Taylor, forensic psychologist, dated 15 December 2011, together with a number of references from members of Natuba's family, friends and associates who speak favourably of him generally in the experience of the authors. 

177Ms Loukas SC tendered, as well, a number of documents from the Department of Corrective Services describing aspects of Natuba's conduct in custody. A letter dated 21 August 2012, from Martin Sinclair of the Special Purpose Centre, describes the restrictions upon Natuba as a result of him being held in that facility, given his assistance to the authorities and preparedness to give evidence for the Crown against alleged co-offenders. 

178Natuba gave evidence at the sentencing hearing which touched upon, amongst other things, the restrictions upon him as a result of his custody in the Special Purpose Centre.

179Natuba is the oldest of three children born in Australia of Melanesian/Fijian parents. He was raised in the Blacktown area of Sydney.

180He was living at home before entering custody in July 2010. 

181Natuba left school at the age of 17, early in his Year 12 studies. After leaving school, the only qualification he obtained was the Responsible Service of Alcohol Certificate. He had significant disciplinary issues at school.

182At the age of 17 years, Natuba was employed unloading containers for about half a year, until he was placed in juvenile detention. He was next employed as a storeman at the same place where his father worked. He worked there for about a year until his arrest for these offences in July 2010. 

183Mr Taylor recited Natuba's history of abuse of alcohol and his use of cannabis, ecstasy and ice.

184Natuba told Mr Taylor that his motive for becoming involved in the activities of the United Brotherhood was, in part, to gain money so that he could consume alcohol.

185Mr Taylor observed that relevant testing indicated that Natuba was inclined toward sensation-seeking and risk-taking behaviour. He considered that he had moderate anger pathology. Mr Taylor expressed the opinion that the results of actuarial analyses indicated that Natuba had a moderate risk of recidivism in general, with a low-moderate risk of violent recidivism.

186Mr Taylor considered that Natuba presented as a person of about average intellectual ability and there were no indications of him having significant cognitive impairment. His level of intellectual ability was not considered to be a relevant factor with respect to his offending behaviour and, accordingly, it was not considered necessary to administer tests of his cognitive abilities.

187Mr Taylor noted that Natuba provided a history of having been raised in a close early family environment. There was some history of aggressive behaviour from about the age of 11 years.

188Mr Taylor observed that the results of tests indicated that he has an above-average predisposition to engage in substance abuse and that when he has been affected by alcohol or drugs, his controls become impaired and he is then prone to behaving in an impulsive manner. With respect to the present offences, Mr Taylor considered that factors of impairment in his impulse control due to consumption of alcohol, his above-average tolerance for aggressive behaviour and his inclination towards risk-taking behaviour had contributed significantly to his offending behaviour.

189Natuba had expressed regret and remorse for what he had done and Mr Taylor reported that he appeared genuine in this regard, with Natuba accepting responsibility for his offences.

Tamapua

190Tamapua was aged 20 years at the time of the offences and is now 22 years old.

191He has a prior criminal history. On 24 July 2006, he was granted nine months' probation in the Campbelltown Children's Court for an offence of robbery in company. 

192On 21 November 2006, a period of 12 months' probation was ordered in the Campbelltown Children's Court for an offence of robbery in company.

193On 10 March 2008, a period of two years' probation was ordered in the Campbelltown Children's Court for offences of assault with intent to rob, common assault and take and drive a vehicle without consent. 

194On 16 March 2009, a 12-month good behaviour bond was granted in the Liverpool Local Court for common assault. 

195On 16 December 2009, a suspended sentence of 15 months' imprisonment was imposed in the Liverpool Local Court for an offence of having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14 years.

196Accordingly, Tamapua was subject to conditional liberty at the time of these offences by way of the suspended sentence imposed on 16 December 2009.

197Since his arrest on the present matters in July 2010, Tamapua has been dealt with by way of call-up for the offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14 years with the Parramatta District Court, on appeal from the Local Court, on 3 June 2011, sentencing him to imprisonment for 15 months commencing on 26 June 2010 with a non-parole period of nine months expiring on 25 March 2011.

198In addition, Tamapua was sentenced at the Liverpool Local Court on 9 March 2011 for an offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order (an offence committed on 31 December 2009) for which a term of imprisonment of three months was imposed, commencing 14 July 2010. 

199As a result of these sentences, I accept that Tamapua's sentences for the present offences should commence on 26 March 2011.

200Mr Pontello, counsel for Tamapua, tendered a report of Dr Katie Seidler, clinical and forensic psychologist, dated 26 October 2012 and a report of Mary Jelen, social worker, dated 16 October 2012. In addition, Tamapua gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, as did his partner, Witness C.

201Tamapua was born in Samoa and is one of five children. He spent the first nine years of his life in the care of his maternal great grandmother, following the death of his mother. It appears that he experienced limited contact with his father, who withdrew himself physically and emotionally from the family. His father died when Tamapua was 17 years' old.

202Tamapua lived in Samoa until the death of his great grandmother when he was nine years' old. Following this, arrangements were made for Tamapua and his sister to be cared for by his maternal aunt who lived in Australia. Tamapua found life in Australia difficult.

203His living siblings all reside in New Zealand and he has no consistent contact with them.

204He has a somewhat chequered educational history which saw him voluntarily discontinue during Year 9. 

205Tamapua and Witness C commenced living together in 2006, and four children have been born of the relationship, of whom two have died as a result of a rare genetic condition.

206For about two years leading up to his arrest in July 2010, he was working for the father of Witness C packing meat. However, about six months prior to his arrest, Tamapua left this position after a disagreement with his partner's father. He was unemployed at the time of the offences.

207Tamapua told Dr Seidler that he became involved in the offences to make money. 

208Dr Seidler considered that Tamapua has suffered from long-standing depressed mood that is consistent with dysthymia and it is likely that, at times, this had deteriorated into episodes of major depression. He has a history of both cannabis and alcohol abuse. Dr Seidler recommended, amongst other things, that Tamapua participate in the Violent Offender Treatment Program, but noted that this was unlikely to occur given his placement in the Special Purpose Centre.

209Tamapua gave evidence of the restrictions upon him as a result of his detention in the Special Purpose Centre. It was clear, as well, that the pressures upon Witness C have been significant given her assistance to the authorities, and that concern for her has contributed to the difficulties of custody for Tamapua.

Assistance to the Authorities and Pleas of Guilty

210Natuba has assisted the authorities and is to give evidence for the Crown at the trial of alleged co-offenders in 2013. A confidential exhibit was tendered concerning his assistance to the authorities.

211Both the Crown and senior counsel for Natuba submitted that the Court should extend a discount of 25% to Natuba for his assistance to authorities, divided into 10% for past assistance and 15% for future assistance for the purposes of s.23(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Having considered the evidence tendered with respect to the assistance provided by Natuba and having regard to his intention to provide future assistance, I am satisfied that a discount of this magnitude ought be granted.

212Tendered at the Tamapua sentencing hearing was evidence concerning his past assistance to authorities and his undertaking to give evidence for the Crown at the trial of alleged co-offenders. Both the Crown and Mr Pontello submit that a discount of 25% should be extended to him, divided into 10% for past assistance and 15% for future assistance, for the purposes of s.23(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

213Having regard to the evidence tendered with respect to Tamapua's past and future assistance, I am satisfied that a discount of this magnitude is appropriate in this case.

214The discounts to be extended to Natuba and Tamapua for the past and future assistance to authorities will be taken into account, in addition to discounts for their pleas of guilty. 

215In the case of each Offender, the Crown submits that a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of their pleas of guilty ought be extended given the entry of pleas of guilty at the earliest possible time. Both Ms Loukas SC and Mr Pontello asked me to extend a discount of this order to their clients for their pleas of guilty.

216I am satisfied that a 25% discount, for the utilitarian value of their pleas, should be extended to each of Natuba and Tamapua. 

217The combination of the 25% discount for assistance to authorities and the 25% discount for pleas of guilty will lead to a combined 50% discount on sentences to be imposed upon each of Natuba and Tamapua.

The Roles of the Offenders in the Offences

A Broad Hierarchy

218The Crown submitted, and counsel for each of the Offenders accepted, that a broad hierarchy of those involved in these activities was as follows. Khoury was the head of the group. Below Khoury was a second tier of command, comprising Tuki and Karimi. Below this, at the next tier, was Tamapua. Below Tamapua were MA, Byquar, Ramos and Natuba. 

219Although care must be taken in attaching labels to persons engaged in criminal activity, this general hierarchy appears to be consistent with the factual narrative set out earlier in these remarks on sentence.

Joint Criminal Enterprise

220It was common ground that the Offenders are to be sentenced upon the basis that they are participants in a joint criminal enterprise with respect to each offence before the Court. The joint criminal enterprise was to commit an armed robbery. Participants in a joint criminal enterprise are equally responsible for all the acts in the course of carrying out the enterprise, regardless of who commits them. However, it is plainly desirable, if the evidence allows, to identify acts carried out by an offender as part of the joint criminal enterprise. An assessment of a particular participant's level of moral culpability may be assisted by reference to that person's conduct disclosed in the evidence: R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [28]-[30]; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 34-35 [160]-[162]; KR v R [2012] NSWCCA 32 at [19]. 

221The facts in the present case do allow some identification of what each Offender did (and did not do) with respect to each offence. One entered the premises armed with a meat cleaver and, in the course of the offence, struck a person with the meat cleaver. Tamapua did not enter any premises, but he played an important organisational role in the group undertaking these offences.

222With respect to the charge of murder, the facts reveal that a number of persons struck Kesley Burgess with meat cleavers. The evidence does not suggest that any single blow was fatal. Rather, the cumulative effect of the blows and injuries led to severe blood loss and, ultimately, death. 

223Concerning the murder charge, the present Offenders include one who was in the house and who struck Kesley Burgess with a meat cleaver (Natuba) and a person outside who was criminally responsible by application of the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise (Tamapua). 

224Although it cannot be said that any person intended to inflict grievous bodily harm or death to Kesley Burgess until he armed himself to challenge the intruders, events that followed saw persons striking Kesley Burgess in a manner demonstrative at least of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, if not death.

225To the extent that those who actually struck Kesley Burgess with meat cleavers, including Natuba, had at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, it seems to me that this is a case where there is little difference objectively between the striking of blows with meat cleavers with intent to cause grievous bodily harm or intent to kill. To my mind, this case falls within that class of case where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm can reflect similar criminality to cases involving an intention to kill: R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312; 164 A Crim R 252 at 258 [16]. 

Natuba

226Natuba only joined the enterprise after being recruited by his cousin, Byquar, on 1 July 2010.

227He entered the home of Maxine Rogers during the Warwick Farm offence armed with a meat cleaver. He was actively involved in the offence, threatening Maxine Rogers with the meat cleaver and grabbing her mobile phone. He was a significant and active participant in the Warwick Farm offence.

228Natuba entered the Burgess house, armed with a meat cleaver, and immediately became actively involved in demands for money and cash. In the course of this, he grabbed Tracey Burgess and pushed her.

229It is the case that Kesley Burgess struck Natuba with a weapon, causing a significant injury to Natuba's shoulder. This action led to Natuba becoming enraged and turning over furniture, as well as slashing towards Kesley Burgess who was lying on the ground.

230Natuba was a significant and active participant in events in the Burgess house and, although the injuries sustained by him may serve to explain his subsequent rage and actions, it was a predictable state of affairs given the nature of the home invasion. 

Tamapua

231Tamapua was present, in a form of organisational capacity, at each of the Lakemba conspiracy, the Ashcroft offence, the Warwick Farm offence and the offences committed in the Burgess house. 

232Although he did not enter any of the houses, he was well aware of the nature of the activities being undertaken by those entering the premises, and of their armed state for the purpose of achieving those ends. His position may be regarded as less significant than that of Khoury and Karimi. However, he played an important organisational role, including the provision of information concerning the location of premises.

233I do not consider that Tamapua can be regarded as displaying significantly lesser criminality than those who entered the premises armed with meat cleavers. The nature of his role is such that, in my view, he is about at the same level of moral culpability as those persons for the purpose of sentence. 

234Tamapua's position is clearly more culpable than that of Ramos, who did not enter the house and whose role was as the driver, with no supervisory or directive function.

Home Invasion Offences Committed by Young Persons

235Submissions were made for Natuba concerning the relevance of youth on sentence. It is appropriate to repeat observations which I made in the course of sentencing MA, Byquar and Ramos. 

236Courts in this State have observed that home invasion offences are frequently committed by young men. In R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, Lee CJ at CL (Gleeson CJ and Hunt J agreeing) observed at 135 that home invasion offences were crimes of great gravity, which were ""becoming all too frequent"". His Honour continued at 135:

""Day and night people live in fear and terror of being assaulted and robbed in their own homes. Frequently this class of offence along with robberies of commercial premises are committed by persons who have barely entered upon manhood. Whilst the early background of each respondent merits sympathy and understanding it can not be used to cloak or disguise the fact that the actions of the respondents and the other men involved can only properly be described as the actions of a gang of thugs and armed thugs at that, violently invading the home of the victims and rendering them helpless.

It is true that Courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal Court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes.""

237The Court of Criminal Appeal has emphasised more recently the need for an appropriate level of punishment in the case of the forced invasion of a home by armed men, in the middle of the night, with terror being inflicted on the occupants, even allowing for the offender's youth and troubled adolescence: R v Murrell [2012] NSWCCA 90 at [55]. Offending of this type involves, amongst other things, an invasion of the privacy of the victims: Haines v R [2012] NSWCCA 238 at [62].

238A further factor which bears upon the gravity of home invasion offences is their unpredictable and chaotic nature, exemplified by the observations of Evans J (Tennent and Wood JJ agreeing) in Wahl v State of Tasmania [2012] TASCCA 5 at [30]:

""Whilst the actual harm caused by a crime is most important in the sentencing process, in my view one of the reasons why home invasions are considered to be particularly serious is the wide and unpredictable range of significant harm they can precipitate and cause. Not uncommonly the outcome of a home invasion is quite different from that intended by the intruder or intruders. The occupants, who not infrequently include children, can be terrified, and the intrusion can provoke a response that results in serious injuries and damage.""

239The offences committed by the present Offenders provide vivid illustrations of the circumstances described by Lee CJ at CL in R v Pham and Ly and by Evans J in Wahl v State of Tasmania. Young men engaged in brutal and frightening activities, whilst armed with meat cleavers, in circumstances which were likely (at the least) to instil great fear in those whose homes are invaded, with the distinct prospect that an occupant would (on the spur of the moment) decide to resist, even though outnumbered by the armed invaders. 

240The tragic events which occurred in the Burgess house, not long after the frightening circumstances of the Ashcroft offence and the Warwick Farm offence, illustrate the nature and risks of offending of this type.

241I have taken into account the principles recited by McClellan CJ at CL in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 at 577-578 [22]-[26], which are capable of some extended application to young adult offenders.

242Given the gravity of the offences, general deterrence and the need for punishment remain most important factors on sentence. 

243It is necessary to take into account, to the extent that the evidence indicates, the immaturity of a young offender. At the same time, it is not unimportant to note that the Offenders (including Natuba) appear to have been selected because of their size and age, no doubt to heighten the level of intimidation to be used in the home invasions. The addition of meat cleavers to this scenario added further to the level of intimidation, as well as increasing the likelihood that serious harm or death would occur. 

244Further, there was an element of planning surrounding the offences. Although it was persons further up the hierarchy than Natuba who were making the decisions concerning the target premises and the times when forced entry would occur, Natuba was a willing and active participant in this repeated criminal conduct. He carried out the plans of others.

245The offences were not spontaneous. These were not cases of hasty decision making, influenced significantly by immaturity. The bravado and aggression of youth may reflect a level of immaturity. However, as Lee CJ at CL observed in R v Pham and Ly, young, aggressive men are frequent offenders in this class of crime.

246The youth of Natuba is of less assistance to him on sentence in these circumstances.

Tamapua's Role in the Firearm Offences

247Tamapua's role in the offences committed on 3-4 July 2010, involving possession of a firearm and possession of that weapon in company with intent to commit affray was significant. The evidence indicates a hectic period of communication between Tamapua and others as part of the planning for the anticipated violent confrontation which was to follow he was not a minor participant in those offences.
 
Application of Parity and Proportionality Principles to these Cases

248In approaching the question of sentence of these two Offenders, I have kept in mind the sentences imposed in the District Court with respect to Vergara, Bautista and CB, as well as the sentences imposed by me earlier this week upon MA, Byquar and Ramos.

249The District Court sentences related essentially to the Ashcroft offence, with Vergara sentenced, as well, for the firearm offences at Miller for which Tamapua is also to be sentenced.

250In my view, with respect to the Ashcroft offence, application of the principles of parity and proportionality ought see the appropriate reference point for Tamapua as being the sentence imposed upon Bautista.

251With respect to the murder of Kesley Burgess, in my view, the appropriate reference point for the purpose of application of the principles of parity and proportionality, would be the sentence imposed upon Byquar. Natuba's role is of a similar order to that of Byquar. Although Tamapua did not enter the house, his supervisory role places him, in my view, in a similar range. 

252Natuba is to be sentenced, as well, for the Warwick Farm offence, as to which I consider Byquar's sentence is the appropriate reference point for the purpose of parity and proportionality.

253With respect to Tamapua's firearm offences, I accept that the sentences imposed upon Vergara are helpful reference points for the purpose of Tamapua's sentencing. 

254There are a number of clear differences between the various Offenders as well, so that these indications are a general guide to sentence only.
 
Determining the Appropriate Sentences

255Having identified factors relevant to sentence, and discussed the significance of a number of them, it is now necessary to determine the appropriate sentence to be passed for each offence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 375 [39], 378 [51].

256It is necessary to keep in mind, as statutory guideposts, the maximum penalty for each offence and the applicable standard non-parole periods: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

257It is necessary that the Court determine an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. 

Natuba

258I take into account the assessment which I have made of the role of Natuba in the commission of the offences for which he is to be sentenced. With respect to the Warwick Farm offence, Natuba entered the unit whilst armed with a meat cleaver, with the consequence that Ms Rogers and her children were terrified. He brandished the weapon at Ms Rogers whilst demanding money and drugs from her. He was a direct participant in this offence, a serious example of an armed robbery.

259The invasion of the Burgess home involved Natuba entering whilst armed with a meat cleaver, as were others, and becoming directly involved in the physical confrontation with Kesley Burgess, leading to a number of the home invaders striking Kesley Burgess, thereby causing his death. I accept that the injury sustained by Natuba no doubt contributed to the state of anger which manifested itself in him. However, Natuba was already acting in a highly aggressive way, and the response of Kesley Burgess to attempt a form of defence against the odds was completely predictable. Even though Natuba did not enter the house intending, at that time to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, he was part of an extremely violent joint criminal enterprise where resort to violence, and fatal violence, was made by the invaders upon the sign of serious resistance. This was a most serious offence, as was the Form 1 offence of robbery of Tracey Burgess in the course of the home invasion.

260Natuba's offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty. His criminal history does not assist him on sentence.

261Natuba has strong family support which will no doubt play an important part in the future in assisting his return to the community when he is released. 

262I accept that Natuba, at an early point, showed signs of contrition and remorse in his decision to commence to assist the authorities. I accept that his contrition and remorse is genuine. 

263I have regard to the restrictions upon him in custody, a consequence of his decision to assist authorities and give evidence for the Crown against alleged co-offenders. The evidence demonstrates that his period in custody is likely to be more onerous as a result. 

264I consider that there are reasonable prospects of rehabilitation in his case. I have reached this conclusion having regard to the psychological evidence and the strong body of evidence concerning support available to him in the community upon release. His continuing maturity in custody supports this conclusion as well. 

265It is appropriate that Natuba's sentences commence on 2 July 2010, the date of his arrest.

266Given the separate crimes for which he is to be sentenced, with different victims, partial accumulation of sentences is appropriate. I have had regard to totality.

267A combined discount of 50% is to be applied by reference to Natuba's pleas of guilty and his past and future assistance to authorities.

268A finding of special circumstances has been made to give effect only to the effect of accumulation upon sentences.

269Having regard to the objective circumstances of the offences and the subjective circumstances of Natuba, and taking into account all of the purposes of sentencing, I am satisfied that the starting point sentences, before application of the 50% discount, should be in his case:

(a) for the murder of Kesley Burgess, taking into account the Form 1 offence, a head sentence of 28 years' imprisonment;

(b) for the Warwick Farm offence, a head sentence of 10 years' imprisonment.

270After application of the 50% discount, and allowing for some measure of accumulation, the following sentences should be imposed upon Natuba:

(a) for the Warwick Farm offence, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and nine months, commencing on 2 July 2010 and expiring on 1 April 2014 with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 2 April 2014 and expiring on 1 July 2015;

(b) for the murder of Kesley Burgess, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 2 July 2011 and expiring on 1 July 2021 with a balance of term of four years commencing on 2 July 2021 and expiring on 1 July 2025.

271The total effective sentence for Natuba will involve imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years and a balance of term of four years.

Tamapua

272I have made a number of findings concerning the objective gravity of Tamapua's offences. Although he did not enter any of the premises, his role in planning and management is such that, in my view, his crimes are of a broadly similar level of seriousness to those of Natuba and Byquar. 

273Of course, Tamapua was involved from 29 June 2010 until 1 July 2010 in the home invasion offences. His type of middle-management role extended over a not-insignificant period of time, given the frequency of the offences. 

274The firearm offences committed at Miller were serious with the likelihood of significant violence if the police had not intervened. 

275Tamapua's offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty. His criminal history does not assist him.

276I have mentioned Tamapua's subjective circumstances earlier in these remarks. I take them into account.

277I accept that Tamapua has demonstrated a measure of contrition and remorse, illustrated best by his willingness to assist the authorities from a relatively early stage. His prospects of rehabilitation are difficult to assess, but I consider them to be fair.

278I take into account the evidence of the restrictions upon Tamapua in custody having regard to his present and likely long-term custodial status. His imprisonment will be more onerous as a result. 

279It is necessary to keep in mind, in his case, that there are three offences to be taken into account on a Form 1 when he is sentenced for murder.

280I am satisfied that a measure of accumulation is appropriate as between the sentences and I have kept in mind the totality principle in approaching his sentence. The sentences for the Miller offences on 3-4 July 2010 ought be concurrent as they embrace a single course of criminality.

281I have found special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of sentences only. 

282Tamapua is entitled to have brought to bear the combined 50% discount for his pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities, past and future.

283As stated earlier, the sentences should date from 26 March 2011.

284Having regard to the objective circumstances of his crimes, his subjective circumstances and the purposes of sentencing, and before applying the 50% discount, I am satisfied that the following sentences should be imposed upon Tamapua:

(a) for the Ashcroft offence, imprisonment comprising a head sentence of eight years;

(b) for the offence of possession of an unauthorised firearm, imprisonment comprising a head sentence of six years;

The facts of the offences
First set of offences

6The victims in the matters, WK, born in November 1982, and KK, born in June 1986, are sisters. The victims resided with their parents DK and SK and their brother VK in Ramsgate Avenue, Bondi, between 1986 and 1992.

7Whilst residing at that location, the family met the Applicant at church. The Applicant had a 35mm camera which he kept with him frequently. He would often take photographs of the K children playing. The Applicant would give the developed photographs to DK and SK. Over time, the friendship between the K family and the Applicant grew to the stage that the Applicant was invited to their family home in Bondi. 

8The Applicant would spend a considerable amount of time with the K family forming a bond that allowed him to take the K children with him on outings to local parks, beaches and shopping outlets in the Bondi area. The Applicant would take the K children with him in his motor vehicle that he owned at the time being a white 1983 model Mitsubishi Express van. The Applicant lived in the motor vehicle at the time, having a mattress in the back covered with blankets and the windows lined with fitted curtains. The Applicant had all of his personal belongings in the vehicle including his clothing, footwear and cooking utensils. The Applicant also had a black dog that lived with him in the van.

9In early 1992, DK and SK separated and DK moved to Surry Hills. When DK moved out of the premises, the Applicant would attend more frequently, spending more time with SK and the three K children. SK decided to move herself and the three children to the lllawarra area for a new start. 

10SK informed the Applicant of the move to the lllawarra and he offered to help. The Applicant hired a truck from a local hire company in Bondi and assisted SK and the three K children with the move. SK and the three K children moved to a property at Farmborough Heights on 6 April 1992.

11After the move was completed on the night of 6 April 1992, the Applicant asked KK to come to his van to which KK agreed. KK was 5 years old at this time. KK was taken into the rear of the van by the Applicant through the nearside sliding door which was closed behind them by the Applicant. As KK entered the vehicle, the Applicant told her to remove her pants, which she did. KK was laid down on the mattress in the van and the Applicant proceeded to lick his fingers. The Applicant then began to rub KK on the outside of her vagina. This action continued for a number of minutes, with KK feeling scared and confused. KK then put her pants back on, at which time the Applicant said, ""This stays with us. No one needs to know."" This was Count 1.

12Over the next year the Applicant frequented the Farmborough Heights property, attending the residence between two and three weekends out of every month. The Applicant would park his van outside the premises on the street and would stay the weekend. During his visits, the Applicant would spend time with WK, and would frequently take WK, KK and their brother VK out on day trips in the local lllawarra area. The Applicant would often take the K children on trips on his own, after getting permission from SK to care for the children. On occasions, the Applicant would take WK and KK out with him by themselves, and would offer the others gifts upon his return.

13Whilst living at the Farmborough Heights property, WK befriended JR, who was born in July 1983, whom she met through school at Farmborough Road Public School. JR spent a lot of time at the K residence, especially with WK. JR frequently slept over at the K residence and came into contact with the Applicant during 1992 to 1994.

14In June of 1992, the Applicant took the victims JR and WK to Westfield Figtree. Whilst at Westfield, the Applicant took the two girls to Kmart where they both were allowed to select a pair of shoes. The girls both selected a pair of pink and white joggers. The Applicant took the girls through the checkout and paid for the shoes. The Applicant escorted the two girls back to the van and drove them to the Hockey Field behind the Westfield Figtree car park. The two girls went to play in the field while the Applicant waited in the van.

15JR returned to the van whilst WK continued playing. JR was taken into the rear of the van and placed on the mattress. The Applicant sat next to JR at which time he slowly placed his hand down her pants onto the outside skin of her vagina. The Applicant began to rub his fingers up and down JR's vagina. JR yelled for the Applicant to ""stop"" and the Applicant removed his hand and said, ""sorry"" before opening the sliding door and leaving the van. JR remained on the mattress and was in shock about what had happened to her. She recalls remaining on the mattress until she was driven home by the Applicant. This was Count 3.

16In July 1992 the Applicant took WK for a drive in his van. The Applicant pulled over at some remote location and had WK get into the back of the van. She was asked to get undressed and did so. He asked her to lie down and WK did so. The Applicant then rubbed his fingers on the outside of her vagina. The Applicant then stopped and told WK not to tell anyone what had happened. This was Count 2.

17In 1994, a disclosure was made by KK to her mother SK about the assault upon herself and sister by the Applicant. DK was informed and he attended the home address in Farmborough Heights. Whilst DK was at the location, a call was made to the Applicant to have him attend the address. The Applicant attended the address where an altercation erupted and he was detained at the address until Police were called and arrived. Police attended a short time later and the Applicant was removed from the scene. An initial complaint was made to Police, and a statement made by the victim WK. No further action against the Applicant was taken at this time.

18The victim KK reported the matter to Police in October 2008, after suffering for many years in relation to the matter. Statements were obtained from victims and witnesses in relation to these matters, and investigations led to the police locating the Applicant at Little Bay.

19On 30 April 2010, the Applicant was arrested. He was conveyed to Maroubra Police Station and was offered the opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview to which he agreed. During the interview the Applicant made admissions to the offences in relation to WK, KK and JR over the years 1992 to 1994. The Applicant explained in detail the accounts which were stated by the victims, stating that he was very sorry and was very apologetic to the victims.

Second set of offences

20There were four different victims. Victim one was 11 years old, victim two 7 years old, victim three 10 years old, victim four 11 years old.

21The facts in short are these. The Applicant owned a white Toyota Hi Ace van. He regularly frequented the Rose Bay Boat Hire business, situated in Vickery Avenue, Rose Bay. This was in the area of a beach and the sailing club and was very popular and busy throughout the summer period. It was frequented by families with school age children.

22On 3 May 2010 the Applicant contacted a friend asking her to go to his unit and remove a number of items. She had the key to his unit. He directed her to remove certain items contained in a bag in his lounge room. She attended, she collected the bags, she looked inside the bags and saw that one of the bags contained numerous pairs of children's underpants. The other bag contained a number of cardboard cigarette packets and cardboard bandage boxes. Inside them were located small video cameras. She contacted the police.

23A search warrant was obtained and a search was executed. During the search of the premises and the vehicle numerous items were seized as exhibits. There were numerous pairs of children's underwear, five Spy Cam video cameras, one of which was contained inside an empty Benson & Hedges cigarette packet and another of which was in an elastic bandage box. The boxes were seized along with 27 micro SD memory cards. The boxes and packets had been modified to allow a miniature Spy Cam camera to fit and holes had been cut in the packets. 

24The footage contained on the twenty-seven micro SD memory cards was downloaded and viewed. The total of the cards contained eighty-four video files which were viewed by police. Nineteen of the video files formed the basis of the four offences charged and the 15 Form 1 offences, all of which involve the four different victims. 

25In respect of Count 1 on 30 January 2010 the video showed the Applicant's face as he positioned the camera on the floor of what appeared to be inside the rear of a van. He left the van and closed the door. Victim one entered the van closing the door behind her. She was dressed in a white swimming shirt and pink tartan shorts. She removed her shorts and underwear, pulling them down to her ankles. She crouched down and urinated into a clear container that had a black and white honey label on it. When she finished she replaced the lid back on the container, pulled her pants back up and left the van. She did not acknowledge the camera in any way and it is accepted that she did not know about the camera. The footage was of high quality and clearly depicted the victim's genitalia and actions of her urinating.

26The other videos were all of a very similar nature. In each of them a young girl went into the van, removed part of her clothing, usually the underwear, crouched down, urinated and exited the van. The footage was of high quality each time that depicted the victim's genitalia and actions of them urinating.

27The Applicant also told both the Psychologist, Ms Robilliard, and the Psychiatrist, Dr Furst, who examined him that he afterwards drank the urine because he believed it had melatonin and serotonin in it and that those substances helped him to sleep better.

Subjective factors

28The Applicant was born on 15 August 1946. He was, therefore 65 at the time of sentence. The First set of offences was committed in 1992 when he was aged 45. 

29He gave evidence of a difficult upbringing. His parents separated when he was eight and he was largely raised by his grandparents. He was sexually molested when he was nine or ten years of age by one of the Brothers at his school. At eighteen he was imprisoned for a month. He was anally raped on three occasions in prison.

30He married when he was in his mid-thirties. He and his wife had a daughter. The marriage broke up after two years. He has not had any contact with his daughter since she was very young.

31He said he was diagnosed with schizophrenia in about 1989. A report from Dr Lee indicated that he suffered from schizophrenia since 2004 when that doctor first came in contact with him. He told the Psychologist and the Psychiatrist that he regularly used cannabis and had done so for many years.

Remarks on Sentence

32His Honour gave the Applicant a discount of 25% in relation to both sets of offences by reason of early pleas. He noted that the Applicant had expressed remorse.

33His Honour made reference to the various reports from the doctors and the psychologist but his Honour's conclusion was that the schizophrenia did not appear to affect his commission of the offences. His Honour thought that there was every likelihood he could re-offend in the future towards young children. His Honour said that he needed treatment.

34His Honour said it was difficult to make a finding of special circumstances even though there were some because it was necessary to accumulate sentences. After imposing the sentences his Honour said that he found some special circumstances, these being rehabilitation and accumulation of sentence. 

35For the first set of offences his Honour noted that he had to sentence the Applicant in the way he would have been sentenced in 1994 when the matter was first reported to the police. His Honour was of the view that sentences at that time were significantly lower than at the present time. 

36In relation to the second set of offences his Honour said that they did not fall anywhere near the top of the range for those sorts of matters. Nevertheless, the offending was extremely serious. 

The appeal

37The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on one ground only as follows:

His Honour erred in that in seeking to maintain the ""statutory ratio"" between the total non-parole period and the total ""head"" sentence his Honour erroneously extended the additional term of Count Two in the second set of charges rather than reducing the non-parole period for that count and (at least) Count One in the second set of charges consistent with a finding of special circumstances.

38The Applicant submitted that since Counts 1 and 2 in the second set of charges were both on the same facts the individual sentence for Count 2 should not have been longer than that imposed for Count 1. In fact, it was submitted, because Count 1 involved taking into account a large number of other offences it might have been expected that a longer sentence would have been imposed for that count rather than for Count 2. 

39The Applicant submitted that it appeared that his Honour increased the additional term for Count 2 so that overall the statutory ratio was maintained. Since, however, his Honour had found special circumstances based partly on rehabilitation one might have expected that there would have been a reduction in the ratio as far as the overall sentence was concerned. 

40The Crown acknowledged that the Sentencing Judge could have structured the sentences other than he did. The Crown said, however, that it was clear his Honour gave close attention to the difficulties associated with totality and the statutory ratio by making reference to those matters at three different places in his Remarks on Sentence. 

41The passages are these:

When I consider this matter I have to allow him a twenty-five per cent discount for his plea of guilty. He has expressed remorse. He had a difficult upbringing as a child and young adult. His schizophrenia does not seem to affect his commission of these offences. It seems to me there is every likelihood he could re-offend in the future towards young children. He needs treatment, but it is difficult to find special circumstances, although there are some, because I have to accumulate sentences and it is a difficult exercise in accumulating between the first and second sets of offences. It is a mathematical problem more than anything else.

...

The next problem, of course, is I have to sentence him the way he would have been sentenced back in 1994. As I recall, that was well before standard non-parole periods which I think came in in 2003. From what I have read, the sentences at that time were significantly lower than sentences today. I have had a look at a number of different sentences about that time. They do not really help because they are all different to this, but they do show a significantly lower pattern of sentencing than he would have been sentenced to today. I have to take into account that the sentences have a maximum penalty of ten years and seven years. There are three victims. I have to take twenty-five per cent off for the plea of guilty, and I have to have a look at the overall criminality involved. I also need to accumulate the sentences, at least in part.

...

This does not fall into that top category, but it is still extremely serious. It calls for a full-time term of imprisonment. It also means that I have a most difficult task in sentencing this man, in accumulating and in the end achieving sentences which still observe the requirement that he cannot be sentenced to more than three-quarters of the head sentence and, therefore, I have had to adjust some of them from what I might have done to reflect that. I have taken into account all that was said on his behalf in very careful and well-worded submissions made on his behalf. (emphasis by the Crown)

42The Crown submitted that these passages show that the Sentencing Judge was concentrating on the principle of totality. It was submitted that the Applicant's concentration on Count 2 in the second set of offences ignored the overall criminality and the approach of the Judge to the totality principle.

Consideration

43As far as the individual sentences are concerned his Honour reduced the statutory ratio to 66.66% for Count 3 in the first set of offences and for Count 1 in the second set of the offences. He also reduced the statutory ratio to 50% for Count 2 in the second set of offences. That appears to have been to maintain the 75% ratio overall. His Honour has done that by increasing the additional term for Count 2 in the Second set of offences. 

44Where special circumstances are found an approach which results in an increase of the additional term rather than a reduction in the non-parole period is erroneous: R v Tobar; R v JAN [2004] NSWCCA 391 at [33], [36] and [39]; R v Huynh [1995] NSWCCA 220 at [35] and [39].

45Bearing in mind that his Honour found some special circumstances based on the need for rehabilitation of the Applicant the final result with an overall ratio of 74.6% indicates that his Honour has overlooked the need to reduce the non-parole period by virtue of that finding of special circumstances.

46A failure of a Sentencing Judge to advert to the finding of special circumstances in connection with the overall sentence will lead to an inference that the matter has been overlooked: Terry v R [2006] NSWCCA 351 at [16]; R v Hung Lo [2005] NSWCCA 436 at [74].

47Furthermore, his Honour's approach has resulted in the Applicant receiving a lesser sentence for Count 1, in respect of which 15 associated offences were taken into account, than for Count 2 when the criminality involved in Counts 1 and 2 was identical.

48In my opinion error has been demonstrated by reason of the Sentencing Judge's approach to the adjustment of the statutory ratio as a result of the finding of special circumstances. It is, therefore, necessary for this Court to consider if any lesser sentence is warranted and, if so, to re-sentence the offender.

49No complaint is made about the second set of offences being made wholly cumulative on the first set of offences, nor about the sentences imposed for the first set of offences. I note, however, that the Crown accepted at the sentencing hearing that it would be appropriate for there to be only partial accumulation of the second set of offences on the first set.

50I would not disturb the sentences for the first set of offences.

51In my opinion, for the following reasons, a lesser non-parole period is warranted for the second set of offences, particularly bearing in mind the finding by the Sentencing Judge of special circumstances. References hereafter are to the second set of offences unless otherwise stated. The Judge's starting point for these offences must have been a 4 year period in total by reason of the 25% discount given to the Applicant. That starting point was appropriate. 

52First, the offences were serious, as the Sentencing Judge noted but they must be regarded as falling well below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The significant matter is that they were, as the Psychologist described them, non-contact offences. The victims were entirely unaware that they were being filmed. There was no physical contact between the Applicant and the victims. That is not to overlook the considerable betrayal of trust involved in the offending.

53Secondly, the Sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant's schizophrenia did not appear to affect the commission of the offences. Nevertheless, the Psychologist drew attention to a number of matters in his personality and mental make-up that were highlighted in her testing of the Applicant which might have provided an explanation for what the Judge referred to more than once as bizarre offending. For example, the Psychologist noted that the Applicant achieved a highly elevated score on the Schizotypal scale. Individuals who exhibit symptoms of Schizotypal disorder can engage in inappropriate interpersonal behaviour which may extend to sexual abuse of children.

54Thirdly, both the Psychiatrist and the Psychologist thought that there were some prospects for rehabilitation with appropriate treatment both inside and outside custody. The Applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing that he wanted to enrol in the CUBIT program, and he applied to do so shortly after he was sentenced. At the time of the hearing of the appeal he was still awaiting a place in the program

55Fourthly, although there were two separate counts of producing child pornography they were both part of the same course of offending. That is highlighted by the inclusion of 13 similar offences in the Form 1 to be taken into account in respect of Count 1. Further, and as his Honour recognised, the offences constituting Counts 3 and 4 and two similar offences on the Form 1 were also part of the same offending.

56In my opinion the Applicant should be sentenced for the second set of offences as follows: In respect of Count 2 a non-parole period of 12 months commencing 30 July 2012 and expiring 29 July 2013 with an additional term of 9 months expiring 29 March 2014; In respect of Count 1, and taking in to account the matters on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 14 months commencing 30 September 2012 and expiring 29 November 2013 with an additional term of 1 year 8 months expiring on 29 July 2015; in respect of Counts 3 & 4, imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing 20 July 2012 and expiring 19 July 2013.

57The result will be an overall sentence (including the first set of offences) of 5 years 3 months with a total non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. That produces a ratio of 68.25%, a result that is consistent with the Sentencing Judge's view of the special circumstances which he found.

58Each of the sentences is for a non-parole period of fewer than 3 years. Section 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies. The Sentencing Judge did not refer to this provision nor did he make orders in accordance with it. It does not appear that his attention was drawn to it by Counsel who appeared at the sentencing hearing.

59The difficulties in complying with this section where multiple offences are involved were referred to in Cross v R (No. 2) [2012] NSWCCA 234. For reasons there given it is futile to make orders in respect of the first set of offences because those non-parole periods have expired. S 50(2) mandates the making of a parole order for each of Counts 1 and 2 of the second set of offences notwithstanding that at the expiry of the sentence which will be imposed for Count 2 the Applicant will not be eligible for release by reason of the sentence for Count 1.

Conclusion

60I would make the following orders:

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Appeal allowed.

(3)Quash the sentences imposed by Judge Garling in respect of the Second set of offences.

(4)In lieu, sentence the Appellant as follows:


(a)In respect of Count 2 a non-parole period of 12 months commencing 30 July 2012 and expiring 29 July 2013 with an additional term of 9 months expiring 29 April 2014;

(b)In respect of Count 1, and taking in to account the matters on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 14 months commencing 30 September 2012 and expiring 29 November 2013 with an additional term of 1 year 8 months expiring on 29 July 2015;

(c)In respect of Counts 3 & 4, imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing 20 July 2012 and expiring 19 July 2013.

(d)Direct that in respect of Count 2 the Appellant be released on parole on 29 July 2013;

(e)Direct that in respect of Count 1 the Appellant be released on parole on 29 November 2013.

1HIS HONOUR: On 20 June 2011 the offenders Damien Raymond Young and Dwayne Daniel Douglas, while both on parole, committed a series of offences arising out of a relatively small debt, $150, which the offenders believed was owed by Charmaine Allen to a friend of theirs, Shane Cook.

2Mr Cook was dying. He had lent $150 to Ms Allen but the money had not been repaid. On 20 June both offenders were at Mr Cook's unit when they began discussing this circumstance. Mr Douglas had known about the debt for some time. The Crown suggests that Mr Young also knew about it before that evening but Mr Young says he only learnt about it that evening. It does not matter. What does matter is that, somewhat incensed at their dying friend's generosity having been abused by Ms Allen, the offenders decided to go and get the money from her. 

3She lived with a number of other people. Jennifer Fielding, Brad Duncan and Darren Hilliard in a unit in Sutherland. At about 11 o'clock Ms Allen and Mr Hilliard were in their bedroom. Ms Fielding had just had a shower and Mr Duncan was watching television in the lounge room. Ms Fielding, who was wearing a singlet, underpants and a dressing gown, heard a knock at the door. The two offenders entered the unit. Mr Young made their intentions clear when he said somewhat eloquently, ""Where's that fat slug?"" They then made their way through to the lounge area. Ms Fielding saw that Mr Young was holding a thick length of chain with a large padlock attached while Mr Douglas was holding a thirty centimetre hammer. They were armed with those weapons with the intention of intimidating the occupants of the unit. Indeed that is the offence to which they pleaded guilty and for which they must now be sentenced.

4Ms Fielding expressed surprise and suggested that they were doing the wrong thing. Mr Young, who appears to have been somewhat taking the lead at this stage said that Ms Allen had ripped off his mate, Shane Cook. Ms Fielding bravely tried to stop them from approaching Ms Allen's room but she heard the commotion and came out and said ""What's going on?"" She saw Mr Douglas wrestling with Ms Fielding during which he dropped the hammer. It was at that stage that Mr Young confronted Ms Allen's partner, Mr Hilliard near Ms Allen's bedroom. He had some of the chain wrapped around his hand and was dangling the remainder. He said ""Do you want some of this too you weak dog"" and swung the chain as though he was going to hit him. Mr Hilliard, who had done nothing wrong, said ""What have I done, I've done nothing to you mate"" and Mr Young then walked away.

5That is an offence of common assault upon Mr Hilliard which appears on the Form 1 attached to the indictment concerning Mr Young. When Ms Allen came into the lounge room, she saw Mr Young and Mr Douglas. Mr Young was swinging the chain around saying ""How could you rip someone off that's dying. No-one rips off my fucking mates."" 

6I mentioned before that there had been a struggle over the hammer between Mr Douglas and Ms Fielding. Ms Fielding managed to get the hammer first after Mr Douglas dropped it but in the struggle which ensued, she fell over backwards onto the lounge. Mr Douglas continued to try to get the hammer out of her possession and so she eventually let go. As a result of the struggle Ms Fielding sustained grazes and welts to her forearm. Mr Edwards who appears for Mr Douglas today tendered a photograph showing the injuries that Ms Fielding suffered. They were not terribly serious in the spectrum of offences covered by the description, ""actual bodily harm"". That represents an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in which appears on the Form 1 attached to the indictment concerning Mr Douglas. 

7Then both of the offenders continued to act aggressively, in particular Mr Douglas began to hit the wall beside Ms Allen with the hammer. He managed to break a mirror, a picture frame and dented the wall. He demanded money from her, once again complaining that she had ripped Shane Cook off and that he was dying. She tried to explain to Mr Douglas that that had been sorted out. The damage occasioned to the wall has formed the basis of another offence on the Form 1, this time concerning both offenders, of destroying or damaging property, Mr Young's criminality being based on the circumstance that his offence was committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Douglas.

8Then we come to another common assault. After the assault on Ms Fielding there was a struggle between Mr Douglas and Ms Allen. Following that struggle Mr Douglas swung the hammer and hit the wall beside Ms Allen's head and that represents an offence of common assault which is on the Form 1 concerning Mr Douglas. 

9Eventually Ms Allen and Mr Hilliard sought refuge in their room and called the police. They held the door closed and at some stage there was a kick at the door and a hole appeared in the door. The two offenders then left the room. As a parting shot Mr Young said ""If you ring the coppers or the coppers get involved, it will come back on you tenfold"". 

10The offenders were arrested relatively soon afterwards. Mr Young, when he was arrested, displayed such concerning behaviour that he was sedated by the Mental Health team at Sutherland Hospital. Mr Douglas knew that police were after him but told Mr Cook that he would hand himself into police after he had spent the last few days with him. He was arrested a few days later. 

11Of course, neither offender should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his cooffender. Although it appears that, initially at least, Mr Young played the more aggressive role and it was he that was doing the talking and he supplied Mr Douglas with the hammer, once matters started, it was Mr Douglas who was much more enthusiastic in what he did. Looking at their circumstances objectively, that is what they did during the commission of the offences, it has to be said that Mr Douglas's conduct was more criminally serious than Mr Young's although there is not a lot in it. 

12I mentioned before that both offenders were on parole at the time. Both offenders have lengthy criminal histories including for offences broadly of the same type for which they are to be sentenced today, although two things need to be noted in both cases. Firstly, that this is the first time they have appeared for sentence in this court and secondly, that the time they have both spent in custody awaiting sentence, is the longest time that they have spent in gaol so far.

13It has been some time since the offenders were arrested until today. I should explain why there has been a delay. Initially the offenders pleaded not guilty. They changed their pleas when fresh indictments were presented against them on the first day that their matters were listed for trial. This has led to some submissions as to the appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. Having looked at the matters realistically, I am satisfied that whilst the pleas were late, the circumstances of the negotiations which led to the pleas being entered suggest that slightly more than ten percent, in fact approximately fifteen percent, should be allowed for the utilitarian value of those pleas. 

14Both offenders are people upon whom it would be appropriate to reduce the level to which general deterrence plays a part in these sentences that I will impose upon them. Mr Douglas was seen by Dr Nielssen. Dr Nielssen noted that there was a history of psychiatric illness in Mr Douglas's case, most obviously demonstrated by an involuntary admission to a psychiatric ward when Mr Douglas was scheduled under the Mental Health Act. Dr Nielssen found a family history of mood disorder, substance abuse and possibly schizophrenia and diagnosed Mr Douglas with a bipolar mood disorder although when he was seen by Dr Nielssen, that was in remission. On top of that, Dr Nielssen regarded Mr Douglas as having a substance dependence and abuse disorder. 

15Mr Douglas has had a number of challenges as he grew up. At a very young age he was sexually abused by an older boy. He then suffered a double tragedy in his life when one of his brothers was killed in a car accident. The driver of that car was another brother who subsequently committed suicide. He has also suffered the loss of a former girlfriend who died through a drug overdose. His father died from cancer before Mr Douglas got to know him and of course, there is the death of Mr Cook, the person with whom the offender was living at the time of the offence. 

16To say that Mr Douglas had a challenging life is something of an understatement but the problems were compounded by the offender's substance abuse. He began using alcohol and cannabis from the age of twelve, took heroin from the age of fifteen, and was addicted to that drug for about ten years. He also uses and abuses other forms of medication. Of course, ordinarily, the abuse of drugs is not a mitigating factor in sentencing but given the early onset of the offender's substance abuse, it has to be recognised that he was not able to reason as an adult would about his decision to first begin drinking and using drugs.

17At times the offender appears to have done reasonably well (when not in gaol) when he engages with mental health services and receives consistent treatment for his bipolar disorder. There is thus some hope for the future should the offender, upon his release from custody, engage with mental health services and do what is required of him. He is now thirty two years of age and has spent a significant period of his earlier life in custody. He says that now having spent the longest period of custody that he has ever experienced, he wishes to change his ways. I have got no doubt that that is a genuine desire but I do not want to underestimate the challenges that Mr Douglas will face upon release. He does recognise that taking his medication on release will be an important aspect of increasing the likelihood that he will stay out of trouble. He does have family support. His mother, to her great credit, supports him and is present in court today. He expressed his remorse for what he had done. It appears to have been a matter that the offender was stewing over for some time and became distressed at watching his friend die, he responded in a completely inappropriate, violent and criminal way. There is no challenge by the Crown, that I observed to the suggestion that Mr Douglas is deserving of a finding of special circumstances in his favour. 

18Mr Edwards relied on some statistics from the Judicial Commission. I want to briefly say some things about those statistics and the enhancement that the Judicial Commissioner has recently made. Previously, all that was available under the sentencing indication system were graphs setting out the sentences imposed for particular offences. There could be filters applied but the High Court in particular has expressed a view that statistics of that type were of little utility. There is now an enhancement whereby someone looking at the sentencing statistics can obtain some information about the cases behind the statistics. Mr Edwards did what he could in this case, but little further information was obtainable. 

19Sometimes when the cases behind the statistics are examined, hyperlinks are obtained to District Court decisions which have been published on Caselaw. Unfortunately none of the five cases that Mr Edwards produced were in that category. The enhancement is at an early stage and it is to be hoped that as time goes on, the increasing use of Caselaw will lead to much more valuable information being available through the sentencing indication system. But I wish to say just one more thing before I move to the case involving Mr Young. Not all District Court judges publish their judgments and sentences on Caselaw. Some of us do, but many do not. The enhancement will mean that judges like me who do publish on Caselaw, will perhaps have a disproportionate influence on the statistics and thus, District Court sentencing. I am quite content with that but others may not be. 

20I now move to the case involving Mr Young. Mr Young's background is also a troubling one. His first involvement with mental health services came at the tender age of three and a half. He has had a lengthy history of behavioural problems, and for example, he began smoking cannabis at only six. Mr Young understands that he has, as he told Dr Adams, longstanding behavioural problems. Those problems manifested themselves in very many ways: fights at school, truanting, difficulties with teachers, he was made a ward of the State and placed in foster care at a fairly young age but eventually ran away and went back to living with his mother. He has a developmental disability too.

21The entirety of Mr Young's problems mean that, as I mentioned earlier, he too is a person upon whom it is inappropriate to impose a sentence reflecting a substantial component of general deterrence. He is serving his sentence on protection but this is not that form of protection where he is effectively isolated from other human contact. There is a risk of course that in future the circumstances of his protective custody will change and things might get worse for him. I will take that into account. The offender is supported by his sister, she too is in court today. Upon his release he plans to live with his sister but he ultimately wishes to take up an offer that has been made to him, to live with a friend on a farm. Mr Young finds it difficult when there are a lot of people around. He would he thinks, do better where there are fewer people such as in a rural community. 

22Subjectively and this is of course, relevant to the issue of parity, there is not a lot to distinguish between the offenders. Mr Douglas will receive a slightly heavier sentence than Mr Young because of his more aggressive role and because there are more serious matters on his Form 1 than there are on Mr Young's. On a couple of occasions during these remarks I have mentioned that the full measure of general deterrence is inappropriate for these offenders but there is nothing to suggest the inappropriateness of taking into account a large measure of specific deterrence in both cases. The offenders both have lengthy criminal histories. They were both on parole. The chances that they will stay out of trouble in the future must surely be affected by the level of punishment they receive when they commit further offences. They must know that if they are going to act this way, they will go to gaol for long times. Both of them of course will benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole. When they have been assisted at times things have gone better than when they have not received assistance. If they comply with their conditions of parole, there is a greater chance that they will commit no further offending whilst on parole and that of course is of benefit to the community. 

23I sentence the offenders as follows. Mr Young is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of twentyone months to date from 21 June 2011. I set a head sentence of three years and six months. Mr Young is thus eligible to be released to parole on 20 March 2013 next year that is.

24Mr Douglas is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of two years and a head sentence of four years to date from 8 July 2011. Mr Douglas will be eligible to be released to parole on 7 July 2013. 

25HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else?

26PACE: Yes your Honour. The Crown would ask that sequences for Mr Young, sequences 1, 2 and 5 are formally withdrawn.

27HIS HONOUR: Thank you I will note that they are withdrawn.

28PACE: And for Mr Douglas sequences 1 and 3 are formally withdrawn. 

29HIS HONOUR: I will note that as well thank you.

2760688,Arenilla-Cepeda v R [2012] NSWCCA 267,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Johnson J.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Wilbur Antonio Arenilla-Cepeda, seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Toner SC at the Sydney District Court on 29 October 2010 for an offence of conspiracy to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, cocaine, contrary to ss.11.5 and 307.5(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

3The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. 

4Following a plea of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years commencing on 22 September 2008 and expiring on 21 September 2022, with a non-parole period of eight years and six months expiring on 21 March 2017.

5The sole ground of appeal relied upon by the Applicant asserts that he has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity of the sentence imposed upon him and that imposed upon a co-offender, Suleyman Boga (""Boga""). 

Facts of Offence

6The Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence that, between 1 April 2008 and 22 September 2008, he conspired with a number of persons, including Boga, Rodolfo Vega-Salvatierra (""Vega-Salvatierra"") and others to possess a substance which was unlawfully imported, and which was a border controlled drug consisting of a commercial quantity of cocaine.

7Although the Applicant pleaded guilty to this offence, there was a contested sentencing hearing which extended over three sitting days - 12 August 2010, 17 September 2010 and 23 September 2010. At this hearing, the Crown called a witness, described as CSN, who gave evidence which significantly implicated the Applicant in the conspiracy to which he had pleaded guilty. CSN was cross-examined at some length by counsel for the Applicant at first instance. The Applicant gave evidence and was likewise cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor in the District Court. What follows is drawn from the findings of fact of the sentencing Judge, which are not challenged in this Court.

8The sentencing Judge did not accept the evidence of the Applicant in areas in dispute, finding his version of events to be ""simply incredible"" (ROS3). Likewise, the sentencing Judge rejected the evidence of the Applicant's partner, Luisa Fernanda Morales-Osorio, in areas where her evidence was under challenge. His Honour largely accepted the evidence of CSN (ROS4). 

9In light of these specific findings concerning the credibility and reliability of witnesses who gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, his Honour proceeded to make detailed findings of fact to the criminal standard of proof (ROS5-16). Given the sole ground of appeal, it is not necessary to recite a detailed account of the facts. A summary will suffice, to be followed by the sentencing Judge's express findings concerning the role of the Applicant. 

10The Applicant was born in Colombia in April 1977 and was 31 years' old at the time of the offence. 

11CSN first met the Applicant in 2005 in Colombia. In about 2006, the Applicant entered Australia under a student visa. 

12In early 2008, the Applicant discussed with CSN a possible plan to import an amount of cocaine from South America to Australia. The Applicant stated that he was interested in finding a buyer for the cocaine.

13Thereafter, CSN made contact with persons, including a person in custody in Australia, with a view to progressing this criminal enterprise. 

14In due course, CSN spoke to Boga, an Australian national (born in September 1986) and it was agreed that Boga, the Applicant and CSN would meet on 4 June 2008 to discuss the anticipated cocaine importation. 

15On 3 June 2008, an authority to conduct a controlled operation was obtained and thereafter, conversations of the Applicant and others, and their movements, were monitored as part of the investigation.

16On 4 June 2008, Boga met with a number of persons to progress the enterprise. Boga was informed that the extraction process would be carried out following the arrival of the drugs in Australia. The Applicant informed Boga that, once monies were received, the cocaine could be ready within six weeks. The Applicant informed Boga that the cocaine would be 95% pure, and Boga stated that he was in a position to purchase two kilograms of cocaine.

17Various meetings took place in June 2008 at which plans for the importation were progressed.

18Meetings and discussions continued into July 2008. On 4 July 2008, the Applicant informed CSN that his contacts in South America had confirmed receipt of a sum of money, and that the cocaine would be in Australia in the first week of August 2008.

19On 25 July 2008, the Applicant met with CSN in Sydney, and the Applicant stated that his South American contacts had told him that they were sending four or five kilograms of cocaine. An email sent by the Applicant on 27 July 2008 stated that his South American contacts intended to send at least five kilograms of cocaine in order to make the project worthwhile, with the drugs to be brought into Australia by a person involved in the criminal enterprise.

20In late July and early August 2008, the Applicant and CSN met on a number of occasions to progress a visa application for the proposed courier, Vega-Salvatierra. Efforts continued in this respect into September 2008.

21On 22 September 2008, Boga and another person attended Driver Avenue, Moore Park, believing they would meet with the Applicant and CSN. The purpose of the meeting was to conduct the cocaine/money exchange. Instead, Boga and the other person were arrested by New South Wales Police officers. A search of Boga's vehicle led to the discovery of $99,950.00 inside a bag in the foot well of the front passenger area.

22At about the same time, a search warrant was executed on Boga's residential address at Merrylands. There, police located 107.3 grams of MDMA (ecstasy), and a loaded .22 calibre Beretta brand pistol containing nine rounds of ammunition.

23In the early afternoon of 22 September 2008, police attended the Amora Hotel in Sydney where the Applicant was employed. The Applicant was arrested, declined to be interviewed and was subsequently charged.

24The Applicant has been in custody since his arrest on 22 September 2008. 

Findings of the Sentencing Judge Concerning the Applicant's Role in the Crime

25The sentencing Judge observed that the Applicant's case on sentence was that he was, in effect, ""lured into this crime, and his motivation was, to some extent, misguidedly chivalrous"" (ROS17). His Honour had earlier found, in light of the contested evidence, that the Applicant's evidence to this effect was ""simply incredible"". His Honour had found that both the tone and the tenor of the Applicant's communications by telephone and email revealed him to be ""a competent and involved participant in the criminal enterprise"" and not ""a reluctant starter whose only role was to introduce CSN to those who could supply drugs for resale"" (ROS2-4).

26His Honour found that the Applicant was ""the middle man between those who were to supply the drugs from Colombia and those who were to purchase them in Australia"" and that, as such, the Applicant was ""intimately involved in the conspiracy"", and that it was ""fair to characterise his role as being that of a principal in a tripartite arrangement: that is the supplier, the facilitator, and the purchaser"", in a conspiracy involving a commercial quantity of cocaine (ROS17-18).

27His Honour also found that the Applicant ""conceived this plan, located a source for the drugs, and was instrumental in having a purchaser located for it when it eventually reached this country, albeit that some of those tasks were performed by CSN"" (ROS16).

28His Honour found that the telephone intercept material demonstrated that the Applicant ""was intimately involved in creating fraudulent documentation to enable the 'cook' to travel to Australia"", and that the Applicant ""opened an email account in such a way that he thought would limit the capacity of law enforcement agencies to intercept material transmitted"" through such an account (ROS18).

29Accordingly, his Honour found the Applicant ""was at the top, or at least towards the top of the hierarchy of those who were involved in this conspiracy"" (ROS18). 

30The sentencing Judge noted that the commercial quantity of cocaine was two kilograms in its pure form. The evidence was that the cocaine was to be 95% purity. His Honour found that the conspiracy involved an agreement to possess between four and five kilograms of cocaine, more than twice the commercial quantity.

31His Honour found that the quantity and purity of the drug ""bespeaks an agreement which contemplated a substantial enterprise"" (ROS19). 

32The sentencing Judge observed that there was no evidence as to what financial gain was to be obtained by the Applicant. His Honour rejected the Applicant's account that he was doing it for nothing. After noting that CSN was to receive some $30,000.00 for his role, the sentencing Judge concluded that the Applicant's ""participation in this agreement was significantly greater than that of CSN and commonsense would dictate that had the agreement come to fruition he would have received a significant amount of money for his participation"" (ROS19-20). 

Other Findings of the Sentencing Judge

33The sentencing Judge allowed a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the Applicant's plea (ROS17). It was perhaps fortunate for the Applicant that no submission was advanced by the Crown in the District Court that the 20% discount for facilitating the course of justice by his plea of guilty ought be reduced as a result of a three-day contested sentencing hearing, at which the Crown and the Applicant called evidence, with the evidence of the Applicant being rejected emphatically by the sentencing Judge. This Court has recognised that the utilitarian discount for a plea in State matters is capable of erosion, where a protracted factual hearing takes place on sentence, and the dispute is resolved adversely to the offender: R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229; 59 MVR 356 at 363-364 [30]-[33]. However, no such submission was advanced at first instance or before this Court (T13-14, 18 September 2012). Should this Court move to resentence the Applicant, the 20% discount for the plea of guilty will continue to apply.

34The sentencing Judge had regard to the Applicant's co-operation with law enforcement authorities, giving rise to a further discount of 10% for assistance (ROS20-21).

35His Honour had regard to the Applicant's age (33 years at the time of sentence) and the fact that he had no prior criminal history. A finding was made that the Applicant had excellent prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend in Australia.

36The sentencing Judge had regard to a report of Mr Taylor, psychologist, dated 29 October 2009. 

37His Honour concluded that, without discount, the proper starting point for sentence was imprisonment for 20 years. After application of the 30% discount, the total sentence was one of 14 years' imprisonment. His Honour determined to fix a non-parole period of eight years and six months, a little over 60% of the head sentence.
 
The Sentences Imposed Upon Boga

38On 6 October 2010, Boga was sentenced by his Honour Judge Charteris SC, following pleas of guilty to three offences:

(a) conspiring between 1 April 2008 and 22 September 2008 with the Applicant and others to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine - the offence for which the Applicant was sentenced;

(b) between 4 June 2008 and 22 September 2008, dealing with money that could become an instrument of crime with a value of $50,000.00 or more, an offence under s.400.5(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) with a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment - this offence involved the sum of $99,950.00 located in Boga's car at the time of his arrest (see [21] above);

(c) an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, MDMA (ecstasy), contrary to s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, an offence punishable by 15 years' imprisonment - this offence related to the quantity of 107.3 grams of MDMA located in Boga's residence following his arrest (see [22] above).

39Taken into account on a Form 1 with respect to sentence for the supply prohibited drug charge, was an offence of possession of a prohibited pistol, a .22 calibre Beretta brand pistol, an offence under s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years - this offence related to the pistol located in Boga's residence following his arrest (see [22] above).

40There was no contested sentencing hearing in Boga's case. Boga gave evidence on sentence with respect to subjective matters. The sentencing Judge was cautious as to accepting all that Boga said, but accepted that he wished ""to turn his life around"" (ROS18, 6 October 2010).

41Boga was found to be a lesser participant in the conspiracy. His Honour Judge Charteris SC found that Boga drove to Moore Park with the intention of purchasing the first kilogram ""with the intention of being the middle man and passing that on to others and then utilising those funds to purchase another kilogram"", thus giving rise to a finding that Boga was prepared to purchase at least two kilograms of cocaine (ROS20). 

42The sentencing Judge found that Boga ""chose voluntarily to be an enthusiastic participant"" in the conspiracy but that, because of the role of the informant (CSN), the criminality of Boga's offence was ""below the middle range of offences of this nature"", although ""still serious criminal behaviour"" (ROS20). It was ""very much organised criminal activity"" (ROS21).

43Boga had a prior criminal history, including offences of armed robbery, robbery in company and discharge firearm in a public place. He was on parole at the time of the subject offence (ROS20).

44The sentencing Judge had regard to Boga's youth, 22 years' old at the time of the offence and 24 years' old at the time of sentence (ROS21-22).

45A combined discount of 27.5% was allowed for Boga's plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities (ROS22).

46His Honour Judge Charteris SC sentenced Boga as follows:

(a)for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and taking into account the firearm matter on the Form 1, a fixed term of imprisonment of three years and three months commencing on 22 March 2009 and expiring on 21 June 2012;

(b)for the proceeds of crime offence contrary to s.400.5(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), imprisonment for three years commencing on 22 December 2010 and expiring on 21 December 2013;

(c)for the conspiracy to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, imprisonment for a term of seven years and three months commencing on 22 December 2011 and expiring on 21 March 2019;

(d) with respect to the two federal offences, a single non-parole period of six years was fixed commencing on 22 March 2009 and expiring on 21 March 2015.

47The effective overall sentence imposed upon Boga was one of imprisonment for 10 years, with a non-parole period of six years.

48The Crown has not appealed against the sentences imposed on Boga.

The Ground of Appeal - Claim that the Applicant has a Justifiable Sense of Grievance due to Disparity of Sentence Imposed Upon Boga

49It is appropriate to refer to aspects of the procedural history of the prosecutions of the Applicant and Boga, so as to place in context the arguments advanced before this Court.

The Applicant and Boga Sentenced by Different Judges

50The Applicant's ground of appeal invites an examination of, and comparison with, the sentence imposed upon Boga on 6 October 2010.

51At the hearing before this Court on 18 September 2012, concern was expressed by members of the Court that not only had the Applicant and Boga been sentenced by different Judges, but that it did not appear that the remarks on sentence, or information concerning the sentences actually imposed by his Honour Judge Charteris SC upon Boga on 6 October 2010, had been furnished to his Honour Judge Toner SC prior to the Applicant being sentenced on 29 October 2010.

52The High Court of Australia and this Court have emphasised repeatedly the strong desirability of co-offenders being sentenced by the same sentencing Judge or, if that is not practicable, the second sentencing Judge being fully informed of the sentence imposed upon a co-offender by the first sentencing Judge, with the remarks on sentence of that Judge being provided to assist and inform the sentencing process: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 617, 622; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 320; Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 at 284-286 [32]-[47]; R v Chandler [2012] NSWCCA 135 at [94]-[96].

53Affidavits filed by the parties following the hearing in this Court have served to explain what happened in the District Court. 

54On 29 July 2009, the Applicant was committed for sentence from the Local Court, and his matter was subsequently adjourned on a number of occasions.

55On 11 November 2009, Boga was committed for sentence from the Local Court, and his matter was adjourned as well on a number of occasions.

56On 13 June 2010, the Applicant's sentencing hearing was listed for 12 and 13 August 2010. The Crown had taken the view that it was necessary for the Applicant's matter to be heard separately from that of Boga due to confidential evidence to be led by the Crown. 

57On 6 August 2010, Boga's sentence matter was listed for hearing on 24 September 2010. 

58The affidavit material indicates that the Crown did not seek to have the two matters listed for hearing before the same sentencing Judge due apparently to concerns about the substantial delay in Boga's matter at that point, the uncertainty as to whether the same Judge could be secured and Boga's desire to proceed with his sentencing hearing.

59The sentencing hearing of the Applicant proceeded before his Honour Judge Toner SC on 12 August 2010, and continued on 17 and 23 September 2010. On the first day, his Honour was informed by the Crown that Boga had pleaded guilty and was to appear a couple of weeks later. 

60On 23 September 2010, his Honour Judge Toner SC remanded the Applicant for sentence on 29 October 2010.

61On 24 September 2010, Boga's sentencing hearing proceeded before his Honour Judge Charteris SC. 

62On 6 October 2010, his Honour Judge Charteris SC sentenced Boga to the terms of imprisonment set out above. In the course of sentencing Boga, his Honour observed (ROS2-3):

""The [Applicant] has pleaded guilty before another judge of this court. The parties did not wish this sentence proceeding to be listed before his Honour. For my part, I could not see why the matters could not have been dealt with by his Honour, but not heard at the same time as there were aspects of confidential evidence in relation to each of the matters as well as other problems. I am told that one of the disputes in relation to the sentencing of the co-offender is as to which of [the Applicant] and the informant [CSN] first raised the topic of importing cocaine from South America. His Honour Judge Toner, who will be sentencing the co-offender, has heard evidence on the topic and will be determining that issue. No evidence has been called before me and so I proceed on the basis that it is unknown as to whether it was the informant or [the Applicant] who raised the topic of the importation of the drug cocaine."" 

63On 15 October 2010, the solicitor from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions with the carriage of both the Applicant's matter and Boga's matter prepared a supplementary Crown submission on sentence. The submission indicated the sentences which had been imposed on Boga, and observed that the remarks on sentence were not then available. The solicitor transmitted this document by email to the Associate to his Honour Judge Toner SC and to counsel who had represented the Applicant before his Honour.

64An affidavit of the Applicant's counsel in the District Court states that he did not receive the Crown's supplementary submission. 

65On 29 October 2010, the same prosecution solicitor attended before his Honour Judge Toner SC for the sentencing of the Applicant. The Applicant's counsel was also present. The transcript of that day, and his Honour's remarks on sentence, make no reference to the sentencing of Boga or the provision of a supplementary submission by the Crown on this topic.

66Upon the basis of the information provided to this Court, it appears that his Honour Judge Toner SC did not receive the communication from the prosecution solicitor, and counsel for the Applicant did not receive it either. Had the Applicant's counsel been in possession of this information, given the sentence which had been imposed upon Boga for the conspiracy offence, it is highly likely that he would have sought to make submissions on behalf of the Applicant by reference to it. However, this did not occur. 

67Likewise, if the sentencing Judge had been in possession of this information, it is likely that his Honour would have placed this matter on the record, and invited any further submission by reference to it, before proceeding to pass sentence upon the Applicant.

68Of course, as the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Charteris SC were apparently not available at that time, it may have been difficult to make meaningful submissions by reference to any findings concerning the role of Boga. 

69What has happened in this case illustrates, once again, the difficulties which can occur where sentencing hearings of co-offenders proceed down separate pathways, before different Judges, and where the Crown, in particular, does not seek to confirm with the Court and opposing counsel the fact that information of this type has been actually received. 

70It is not productive in the context of the present appeal to seek to explore further what happened in this case. The fact is that this Court is now seized of the remarks on sentence of both sentencing Judges, and is called upon to consider submissions by reference to the principles of parity and proportionality, against the background where the Judge who sentenced the Applicant did not have the benefit of this material and submissions made by reference to it.

71It falls to this Court to consider the present application for leave to appeal against sentence, against the unsatisfactory procedural background which I have described.

Submissions for the Applicant

72Mr O'Neil, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the markedly different sentences imposed upon the Applicant and Boga for the conspiracy offence gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant. Whilst acknowledging that there were differences between the roles of the Applicant and Boga, counsel submitted that these differences could not reasonably explain the disparity between the sentences imposed upon the two offenders.

73Mr O'Neil submitted that Boga's position was compounded by the fact that he was sentenced for a number of offences, and that his offences had been committed whilst he was on parole.

74Counsel submitted that a marked disparity was apparent from a starting point of 20 years' imprisonment adopted with respect to the Applicant, and a starting point of 10 years' imprisonment used with respect to Boga for the same offence. He submitted that this Court should interfere and resentence the Applicant in these circumstances.

The Crown Submissions

75The Crown submitted that it is necessary to keep in mind that conspirators are to be sentenced not just for acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, but for the essential feature of the offence itself: Tyler v R [2007] NSWCCA 247 at [83]-[84]. It remained necessary to determine what the offenders did in participating in the offence, to assist in understanding the roles of the particular offenders.

76The Crown submitted that there was no unjustifiable disparity between the sentence and the non-parole period imposed upon the Applicant compared with Boga. It was submitted that there was a significant difference between the roles of the Applicant and Boga and their ages at the time of the offending, and that different findings had been made as to the relevant quantities of cocaine in each case, for the purpose of sentence on the conspiracy counts.

77The Crown emphasised the findings made, following a contested sentencing hearing, with respect to the Applicant's senior role in the conspiracy. It was submitted that this stood in stark contrast to the findings made by his Honour Judge Charteris SC concerning Boga, whose role was said to be ""below the middle range of offences of this nature"" (ROS20).

78The Crown submitted that the Applicant's role in the conspiracy was at or near the top of the hierarchy, and was much more senior and significant than that of Boga, so that the Applicant attracted a significantly greater penalty. 

79The Crown emphasised the fact that Boga was sentenced upon the basis that he was prepared to purchase at least two kilograms of cocaine, whereas the Applicant was found to have agreed to possess between four and five kilograms of cocaine. It was submitted that this was a significant difference as between the two offenders, which operated against the Applicant's claim of illegitimate disparity.

80Whilst acknowledging that Boga's criminal history and his additional charges constituted differentiating factors, it was submitted that these were not such as to materially assist the Applicant. 

81The Crown submitted that, even if the sentence imposed on Boga for the conspiracy charge might be viewed as unjustifiably lenient, that fact did not give rise to a disparity calling for appellate intervention: Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [203]. 

Decision

82At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel were invited to make submissions on a number of issues, including the consequences of the Applicant and his counsel not having taken steps to ascertain what had happened on sentence concerning Boga, and to advance submissions to the sentencing Judge on that issue. In requesting submissions on this topic, the Court had in mind that this Court is a court of error, and there is an expectation that an offender who asserts error on sentence will have taken the point at first instance: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [75]-[83].

83Of course, it has been recognised that an appeal may be brought on a parity ground by the first of two or more offenders to be sentenced: Jones v The Queen [1993] 67 ALJR 376. In such a case, the applicant will not have been in a position to take the point at first instance. However, the present Applicant was sentenced after Boga. The difficulty flows from the fact that the Applicant and his counsel were apparently not aware of this when the Applicant was sentenced on 29 October 2010.

84As mentioned earlier, the material furnished to this Court after the hearing revealed a course of events whereby the Applicant's counsel did not receive the communication from the prosecution solicitor with respect to Boga's sentence. It is more than highly desirable that the legal representatives for a person in the Applicant's position take a proactive stance in seeking to ascertain what has happened with a co-offender on sentence: Dwayhi v R at 286 [45]-[46]. However, not without some misgivings, I have formed the view that what has happened in this case should not operate against the Applicant before this Court. It is appropriate, in the circumstances of this case, to consider the Applicant's ground on its merits.

85For the purpose of determining this appeal, I gratefully adopt the statement of principles of Garling J in Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 at [50]:

""So far as I understand it, the authorities on the application of the parity principle in circumstances such as those with which this court is presented in this case, provide the following principles:

(1) The parity principle is an aspect of equal justice, which requires that there be consistency in punishment. Unequal treatment under the law is likely to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice: Lowe at 610-611 per Mason J; Postiglione at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 335 per Kirby J; Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49 at 28 and 30 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ;

(2) Because the function of imposing a sentence on an individual has a discretionary character, an appellate court will ordinarily be reluctant to intervene. There is no such thing as perfect consistency in sentencing. A search for perfect consistency is to look for the unattainable and will frequently be an exercise of academic abstraction: Postiglione at 336-7 per Kirby J, R v M (CA) (1996) 105 CCC (3d) 327 at [92] per Lamer CJ;

(3) Hence, the discrepancy required to be identified between sentences is one which is not merely an arguable one, but one which is 'marked', or 'clearly unjustifiable', or 'manifest ... such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance' or else it '[appears] that justice has not been done': Lowe at 610 per Gibbs CJ (Wilson J agreeing), at 613 per Mason J, at 623-624 per Dawson J; Postiglione at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 323 per Gummow J, at 338 per Kirby J; R v Taudevin [1996] 2 VR 402 at 403 per Hampel AJA, at 404 per Callaway JA; DGM v R [2006] NSWCCA 296 at [46] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, at [105] per Bell J;

(4) The elimination of an 'unjustified' discrepancy is a matter of importance not just to the individual concerned, but to the administration of justice in the community more generally. This court is therefore concerned not with whether an appellant actually feels a sense of grievance, that is, a subjective test, but rather whether, examined objectively, the sense of grievance is a justifiable one, namely that a reasonable mind looking over all of what happened would see that a grievance was justified. In other words, the matter is considered objectively: Lowe at 613 per Mason J; R v Kelly [2005] NSWCCA 280 ; 155 A Crim R 499 at [11] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Postligione at 338 per Kirby J; Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

(5) In determining whether there has been a discrepancy of a kind sufficient to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, a court:

(i) must consider not just the head sentence, but all components of the sentence including the non-parole period and the total effective period that both offenders will serve: Postiglione at 303 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 338 per Kirby J;

(ii) must also consider all of the facts and circumstances applicable to both individuals involved, including the objective seriousness of the offence, in order to identify whether a differential sentence was justified; Green at [30] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ;

(iii) ought not intervene to reduce a sentence below a level, which would mean that the sentence would be wholly inadequate having regard to the offence involved and the criminality of the offender, and consequently the result would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174 ; 130 A Crim R 300 at [289] per Heydon JA, Sully and Levine JJ; DGM at [58] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Kelly at [12] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Green at [33] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.""

86Before moving to the particular circumstances of this case, it is also necessary to mention features relevant to an assessment of a parity ground of appeal, where different Judges have sentenced co-offenders. In Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J, I said at [52]-[56]:

""52 There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge at the same time, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]; Gurney v R; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [81]-[82]; Dwayhi at [39]-[43].

53 Different Judges may take different views as to the relevant culpability of related offenders: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 320; R v Mercieca [2004] VSCA 170 at [6]; Dwayhi at [35], [37].

54 Where co-offenders are dealt with separately, there may be differences in the substratum of facts upon which the different sentencing Judges act and the impressions formed by them with respect to the relative roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation of the individuals involved, with this flowing in part from the different emphases which can be expected to be placed on aspects of the offending behaviour and the circumstances of the offenders: R v Rodden [2005] VSCA 24 at [28]; Dwayhi at [38].

55 Strong maintenance of the practice of related offenders being sentenced by the same Judge at the same time will serve the public interest in consistent and transparent sentencing of related offenders which underlies the parity principle itself: Dwayhi at [46].

56 A recurring theme in the authorities is that, where co-offenders are sentenced after hearings before different Judges, there may be different evidence and submissions, leading to different conclusions being expressed by the sentencing Judges concerning criminal conduct of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise.""

87In my view, the present case constitutes yet another clear example of the consequences which may flow from separate sentencing hearings before different Judges, involving different bodies of evidence and different findings arising from the evidence in each case. The position is exacerbated in this case because the second Judge did not have the remarks on sentence of the first Judge, or even information concerning the sentencing outcome.

88The findings made by the sentencing Judge concerning the role of the Applicant have been set out earlier in this judgment. In the context of a conspiracy to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, the findings against the Applicant were of a most serious kind. Not only was he at a high level in the so-called hierarchy, but his offence involved a quantity of four to five kilograms of cocaine, more than twice the commercial quantity. This was about twice the quantity of cocaine for which Boga was sentenced.

89There are significant points of distinction between the findings made with respect to the objective criminality of the Applicant and Boga by the different sentencing Judges. 

90I have had regard to the fact that Boga had a significant criminal history and was on parole at the time of the commission of the offences, and that he committed other offences apart from the conspiracy. These factors must be kept in mind in comparing the circumstances of the two offenders and the sentencing outcomes in their respective cases. 

91Boga (22 years' old) was significantly younger than the Applicant (31 years' old) at the time of the offence. Youth could assist Boga to some extent, but not the Applicant: R v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at 127 [72](k).

92It is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate an objective foundation for his sense of grievance so as to render it legitimate. In Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191, Bathurst CJ, James J and I said at 210 [82]:

""Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances. This Court will not necessarily intervene where the co-offender's sentence is so inadequate that the Court should not take it into account: Lewins v R at [7]; Dwayhi at 280-281 [21].""

93In Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ observed at 476 [33]:

""Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""

94It may fairly be said that Boga was the fortunate recipient of a lenient sentencing outcome, against which the Crown has not appealed.

95It is undoubtedly the case that there are significant differences between the roles of the Applicant and Boga, and the quantities of cocaine concerned in each offence, with these differences operating against the Applicant on this appeal. At the same time, there are differences in the criminal histories of the two offenders, and the fact that Boga's offences were committed in breach of conditional liberty, with those differences (adverse to Boga) assisting the Applicant before this Court.

96There is a very marked difference between the starting points adopted by the two Judges in sentencing the two co-offenders for this crime. Those differences can be explained, to a substantial extent, by the different bodies of evidence before the two Judges, and the different findings made by the Judges by reference to the evidence before each of them. Further, the second Judge was not in a position to have the advantage of the remarks on sentence of the first Judge to aid the exercise of sentencing discretion. 

97Making all due allowance for these factors, I am nevertheless persuaded that there is an objective foundation for a sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant with respect to the very wide difference in the starting points adopted by the two sentencing Judges. This conclusion does not entitle the Applicant to have his sentence adjusted, in some way, to bring it into line with that of Boga. Rather, as stated by the majority in Green v The Queen (at [93] above), marked and unjustifiable disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences. 

98This leads to the position where the Applicant is entitled to have this Court take into account, in a permissible way, the sentence imposed upon Boga on the conspiracy charge, in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the Applicant. 

99If the point was reached where the Applicant was to be resentenced, Mr O'Neil read the affidavits of the Applicant affirmed 13 September 2012 and his solicitor, Vanessa Carmody-Smith affirmed 12 September 2012. I have taken this evidence into account on resentence.

100The Applicant's offence was most serious. He played a senior and controlling role in the enterprise. The offence was committed for significant substantial gain. A large quantity of cocaine was involved, at least twice the commercial quantity. General deterrence was a most significant factor on sentence. The Applicant could not claim that the immaturity of youth bore upon his transgressions: R v Nguyen at 126-128 [72].

101Having regard to the objective gravity of the Applicant's crime, and taking into account his subjective circumstances, the need for general deterrence and the sentence imposed upon Boga, I am satisfied that an appropriate starting point in the Applicant's case is a head sentence of 18 years. After application of the 30% discount utilised by the sentencing Judge, a head sentence (after some rounding) of 12 years and six months ought be passed. A non-parole period of seven years and nine months should be fixed. 

102I propose the following orders:

(a) leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed;

(b) sentence imposed at the Sydney District Court on 29 October 2010 is quashed;

(c) in its place, the Applicant is sentenced for the offence of conspiracy to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, cocaine, to a term of imprisonment of 12 years and six months commencing on 22 September 2008 and expiring on 21 March 2021 with a non-parole period of seven years and nine months commencing on 22 September 2008 and expiring on 21 June 2016;

(d) the Applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 21 June 2016.

103DAVIES J: I agree with Johnson J.

2760692,R v White [2012] NSWSC 1573,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Rodney Boyd White was found guilty by a jury on 30 April 2012 at the end of a seven week trial at Lismore. The essence of the prosecution case against him was that he had robbed and killed a drug dealer.

2Mr White was tried jointly with Jessica Birkensleigh, who was found guilty of being an accessory before the fact to robbery, and Todd Serone, who was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder. Another man, Ricky Humphries, had earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Facts

3Whilst the evidence in the trial was quite complex, the facts may be succinctly stated as follows.

4The deceased, Saaid (""Sid"") Zaiter, was a person who White described in his evidence as ""a big [drug] dealer on the Gold Coast"". On Tuesday 16 December 2008 Mr White lured Mr Zaiter to Mr White's cabin in a caravan park at Chinderah on the pretext of doing a deal with some buyers from Melbourne. Within that cabin Mr White assaulted him to the point of rendering him unconscious (at least). He then bound him with cable ties and taped over his mouth and nose (this was a disputed issue but I am satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt) so that if Mr Zaiter was not dead already, he soon would be.

5Mr White had duped a man named Orams into driving him to the caravan park and waiting for him in the car outside. He had also enlisted Mr Humphries to come along for support. When White returned to the car he was asked by Mr Orams how it went and he replied, ""Not very good, I've just bashed the cunt and I think he's dead"". Mr Orams asked, ""What have you done with him?"" to which White replied that he had tied him up and put tape around his mouth in case he woke up. He was not being completely truthful.

6In the ensuing hours White oversaw the transporting of Mr Zaiter's car to a clearing just off the Murwillumbah-Kyogle Road at Barkers Vale where packages of drugs were retrieved from it before it was torched. He also arranged for Serone and others to collect the body from the cabin at Chinderah. Ultimately the body was taken to Pinnacle lookout in the Border Ranges National Park where Mr Zaiter was unceremoniously stripped naked and thrown off into the bush.

7White later made jokes about the killing of Mr Zaiter. A witness said that he referred to Mr Zaiter as ""the bushman"" because that was where his body was, and he also referred to him as having reached ""the pinnacle of his life"".

8White, and his girlfriend, Jessica Birkensleigh, hurriedly left the Northern Rivers region and travelled to Victoria. There they established a new life for themselves which was funded by the proceeds of the drugs that had been stolen from Mr Zaiter.

9A long and difficult police investigation eventually established what had occurred. Mr Zaiter's remains, 12 bones, were located a year after the murder. They would probably never have been found but for the co-operation with the authorities of one of the people Mr White had enlisted to help recover the drugs from Mr Zaiter's car and then to dispose of the body. 

10Mr White disputed significant aspects of the Crown case but did not deny that he had killed Mr Zaiter. His version was that he had acted in self-defence, a claim the jury obviously rejected. He also disputed the contention that he had stolen some three pounds of speed from Mr Zaiter. The jury found Ms Birkensleigh guilty of being an accessory before robbery, so they were clearly satisfied that the robbery by White of Mr Zaiter had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Whether the quantity stolen was as much as three pounds seems to me to be unnecessary to resolve. It is clear enough that the quantity was not insignificant; police identified expenditure by White and Birkensleigh in Victoria amounting to some $130,000. I am satisfied that whatever was the quantity of drugs stolen from the deceased, it must have been substantial.

Seriousness of the offence

11A number of matters must be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the murder. Although disputed, I am satisfied that there was an intention to kill Mr Zaiter. I have earlier indicated that I am satisfied that once he was rendered unconscious he was bound and gagged so that if he was not already dead he would suffocate.

12The acts causing death were either a severe bashing, or a combination of such a bashing and suffocation. Either way, there was considerable violence.

13The robbery and incapacitation of Mr Zaiter was obviously planned. Mr White and Ms Birkensleigh were in the process of packing up in order to move to Victoria. It was the Crown case that they planned to finance their new life there with drugs that would be stolen from Mr Zaiter. The plan involved luring Mr Zaiter to the caravan park. The cable ties used to bind Mr Zaiter's hands and feet, and the tape placed over his mouth and nose were purchased by Ms Birkensleigh at White's direction the previous afternoon. After Mr White left the cabin, he sent a text message to Ms Birkensleigh which included ""job's done"". 

14Obviously Mr White had planned to inflict significant violence upon Mr Zaiter with a view to incapacitating him in order to enable the theft of his drugs. Mr White's motive was greed. But whether the killing of Mr Zaiter, as distinct from the robbery, was premeditated is problematic. Whilst I believe it might have been, I cannot make that finding upon the criminal standard of proof.

15The disposal of the body is an aggravating feature. First it was dumped in bushland beside a bush road and covered with sticks and branches. Later, White decided that he should do something more about it because his DNA might be on the body. Fuel was purchased before the body was retrieved and taken further into the wilderness. The body was then stripped naked and the tape and cable ties removed. Fuel was then poured over it, ostensibly to remove any traces of White's DNA. There was then the final indignity of the body being pushed over the cliff.

16This is a serious case of murder. The offender's moral culpability is at a high level. The fact that Mr Zaiter was a drug dealer does not diminish its seriousness and, I hasten to add, no-one has suggested otherwise. That fact does not reduce the significance of purposes of sentencing such as punishment, deterrence, denunciation and making the offender accountable for his actions.

The offender's personal circumstances

17Mr White was born in Melbourne in 1966, and so was aged 42 at the time of the offence and is now 46. 

18He has a criminal record in three states which includes convictions for assaults, stealing, receiving stolen property, possession of drugs, burglary, being armed so as to cause fear, threatening violence by the discharge of firearms or by some other act, and having weapons without a licence. These convictions span the period 1994 to 2002. He has been sentenced to imprisonment before. It means that he is denied the leniency that might otherwise have been extended to a person without such a record.

19Mr White was seen on 5 December 2012 by Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist, for the purpose of preparing a report for sentencing. Arranging for a psychological assessment for this purpose has been the cause of the delay in the sentence proceedings. 

20The history taken by Mr Watson-Munro included that Mr White's parents separated when he was aged 4. He enjoys a positive relationship with two sisters as well as his mother.

21He suffered from dyslexia. His upbringing and education were disrupted by constant moves between his parents' and grandparents' homes throughout Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. He claimed to have attended a dozen different primary schools as well as eight secondary schools. He left during Year 8 at the age of 14. I have no doubt these events would have significantly impaired Mr White's psychological development in his important formative years.

22Mr White worked for ten years for his father in a security door manufacturing business operated on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland. He later operated his own business manufacturing and selling security doors and vertical blinds in Victoria and Queensland. There followed a period of working in a panel beating business at Southport before he opened chocolate shops in Byron Bay and Broadbeach. Those businesses closed in 2007 and he told Mr Watson-Munro that he then became involved in buying and selling motor bikes. There was no reference to involvement in drug dealing; something he admitted in the course of his evidence at the trial.

23The history set out by Mr Watson-Munro included that Mr White had experienced three serious relationships, the last ending in about 2007 or 2008. He has a number of children.

24There are reported to be a number of physical and psychological health issues. I do not intend to downplay their significance to his general well-being but none appear to me to be particularly relevant to the assessment of sentence.

25There is also a history of significant drug abuse involving amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine and ""ice"" (which I take to mean crystal methamphetamine). It is said that from the age of 10 Mr White found cannabis provided an escape. He is also said to have been admitted to psychiatric hospitals because of breakdowns caused by drug use. The history also includes abuse of alcohol and prescribed medications.

26The history includes matters such as him experiencing ""ongoing stresses during the course of his last de facto relationship claiming that his partner was a stripper who was very paranoid and demanding of him. This added to his sense of anxiety and emotional isolation"". There is also a claim that ""Mr White became quite tearful stating that he has lost all which he has worked for during his life and that he feels additionally abandoned by the lack of support from former friends and family"".

27I find matters such as this a little difficult to accept, given the strong impression I obtained during the course of the trial, and which I have recorded in sentencing others, that Mr White ""was a devious and manipulative man"": R v Serone [2012] NSWSC 1232 at [27]. I also recorded in sentencing Ricky Humphries that I had no doubt that Mr White was ""a most belligerent, arrogant and manipulative person"": R v Humphries [2012] NSWSC 419 at [41]. I made that assessment with the benefit of having observed him throughout the trial and having heard him giving evidence. I remain of that view. It is confirmed by a number of matters including the manner in which Mr White enlisted others to do his bidding in carrying out the robbery of Mr Zaiter, recovering the drugs from Mr Zaiter's car, and disposing of his body. Clearly, Mr White is a very self-centred individual. It was submitted that the insight provided by Mr Watson-Munro's report warranted some amelioration of my conclusion on this aspect. I have given consideration to that submission but, in the end, do not accept it.

28This view I have formed about Mr White's personality does not mean that any greater penalty should be imposed upon him. It does mean that I have considerable circumspection in accepting some of the claims advanced by him in the sentencing context.

29Mr Watson-Munro's report includes that Mr White has symptoms of depression and anxiety for a variety of reasons. It is said, ""his depression has been galvanised by the fact that the deceased was one of his 'best mates'. He stated that he had been friends with him for 18 years and he feels a great deal for their family."" I cannot accept that for the reasons just indicated.

30Then, Mr Watson-Munro refers to a self-reporting questionnaire he administered to Mr White which he said ""confirms a diagnosis of Major Depression according to DSM-IV TR criteria"". At the conclusion of the report he purports to diagnose not only Major Depression but also Anxiety Disorder and Polysubstance Abuse Disorder, now in remission. I have earlier noted that Mr Watson-Munro is a psychologist, not a psychiatrist. Moreover, there is no reference to him having administered any tests, as the authors of other psychological reports often tendered in sentence proceedings do, to confirm the validity of the offender's responses to the self-reporting questionnaire concerning depression.

Assessment of sentence

31I have earlier mentioned how serious the crime is the offender has committed. It must be taken into account in the overall assessment that the maximum penalty is one of imprisonment for life and that there is prescribed a standard non-parole period of 20 years.

32I have mentioned some of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1900 (NSW). Another of those purposes is rehabilitation. One would hope with the passage of a significant period of time and advancing age that rehabilitation would flow; but forecasting that, and the likelihood of re-offending, at this point is otherwise difficult.

33I am not persuaded that there is any genuine remorse. It seems to me that Mr White feels sorry for himself and what he has lost and that is the extent of it.

34Credit must be allowed for a degree of co-operation with the Crown in the manner in which the trial was conducted. The defence of Mr White was conducted upon the basis that he accepted responsibility for the death of Mr Zaiter and it was conceded in counsel's closing address to the jury that a verdict of guilty of manslaughter was well open. 

35Mr White has been in custody since the date of his arrest on 4 September 2009 and so his sentence should be back-dated until then.

Victim impact statement

36A victim impact statement was provided by Ms Suzee Nader, the niece of the deceased, and it was read by Ms Joanne Nader. Once again I acknowledge the immense grief and loss that the family have suffered and I reiterate the condolences I have previously extended to Ms Nader and all who have been affected by the tragic brutality of the murder of their loved one.

Sentence

37Convicted.

38Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 24 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 8 years.

39The sentence will date from 4 September 2009. The offender will become eligible for release upon parole after the expiration of the non-parole period on 3 September 2033. The total term of the sentence will expire on 3 September 2041.

		15 December 2012",2012-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760694,Al Mosawe v R [2012] NSWCCA 275,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of attempting sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61P of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for an offence constituted by an attempt to have sexual intercourse without consent.

2He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 months imprisonment with a total term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.

3The applicant originally pleaded three grounds of appeal. However, Ground 2 was not pursued. The grounds which were ultimately argued were as follows:

Ground 1: Failure to recognise that the applicant's plea spared the complainant the ordeal of giving evidence.

Ground 3: Manifest excess.

4The relevant facts are as follows. On 14 November, 2009 the complainant went to Rosehill Racecourse to celebrate her 19th birthday. After the races she went with friends to the Rydges Hotel. The complainant had drunk moderately throughout the day and was not intoxicated. At about 9 pm, accompanied by two friends, she caught a taxi from the Rydges Hotel to the St Clair area. The applicant was the driver of that taxi. The applicant then drove the victim and her friends to various locations in the North-West so that the group could change with a view to going to Panthers.

5At some point, the complainant decided that she did not wish to go to Panthers and asked the applicant to drive her home and then return to take the others to Panthers.

6The complainant became the only occupant in the taxi and she sat in the front passenger seat. On the journey back to her home the applicant pulled the taxi over to the side of the road and put the handbrake on. The applicant lent over and kissed the complainant on the mouth. He inserted his tongue into her mouth during the kiss. At the same time the offender placed his right hand between the legs of the complainant. She was wearing a dress and he touched her upon her vagina on the outside of her underwear. The complainant pushed the applicant away and said ""what are you doing, what are you doing?"" and she closed her legs tightly, lifted her heels towards the seat and turned her knees toward the passenger door. The applicant then reached underneath her right leg and touched her on the outside of her vagina with his finger, attempting to insert his finger into her vagina. The complainant pushed the applicant's hand away and said ""leave me alone, don't touch me"". The applicant straightened back up in his seat.

7The complainant next tried to open the taxi door, saying ""I want to get out, let me out, I'm going"". The applicant replied ""I will take you home"". The complainant commenced to cry and the applicant started up the taxi. The complainant told him to stop near a friend's house, part way towards her house. She paid the fare and requested a receipt.

8The complainant contacted friends and told them what had happened, she then rang 000 to report the matter to police.

9The applicant was arrested at his home in Fairfield. He participated in an interview. He denied kissing or sexually assaulting the complainant. He stated to the police that all three passengers were very drunk.

Subjective matters

10The applicant was educated in Iraq where he was a secondary school teacher. He has a degree in literature. He worked in Jordan for five years before coming to Australia as a refugee. 

11The applicant was married in Australia and has two children. His wife speaks no English and has no family or support in Australia. The applicant was the sole income earner in the family and was paying off a mortgage on the family home. As a result of the commission of the offence the applicant has lost his job as a taxi driver and, until he was sentenced, was in receipt of Centrelink benefits.

12The applicant was imprisoned and allegedly tortured under Saddam Hussein's regime for political agitation. His imprisonment under the Hussein regime was said to be linked to his position as an academic and a minority Christian. 

13The applicant has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and a range of other psychological disorders for which he is being treated. The sentencing judge noted the opinion of the psychologist that these symptoms may have impacted upon the applicant's judgment at the time he committed this offence. 

14Apart from this disorder the applicant suffers from back pain from a disease in his lumbar spine for which he takes medication. He also has hearing loss. 

15The applicant was aged 48 at the time he was sentenced.

The remarks of the sentencing judge

16The applicant was originally indicted for an offence contrary to 61L of the Crimes Act, which alleged an actual assault. However, on the third day that had been allocated for the trial he pleaded guilty to the alternative count for which he was sentenced. In the circumstances the sentencing judge allowed a 10% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. 

17The sentencing juge found that the offence falls towards the lower end of the scale constructed for like offences. There was no violence and the incident was not planned. The incident was an attempt at digital penetration, which the offender ceased when he was requested to do so. The sentencing judge found that the applicant's plea ""does demonstrate some contrition"" and said that having ""heard from him, I find that he is remorseful and contrite.""

18The sentencing judge emphasised that the question of general deterrence loomed large in the applicant's case. Her Honour said:

""Members of the public have the right to feel safe and protected while using taxis, particularly late at night, often the only means of transport available. His offending behaviour constitutes a grave breach of trust owed to the members of the public. Passengers in taxi cabs have a rightful expectation that they will be conveyed home and that they will not be sexually assaulted on the way.""

19The sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances and accordingly varied the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the overall term. Her Honour also recognised the fact that the applicant has language difficulties and mental health issues will make his time in custody more onerous. Her Honour also recognised that the nature of his offence made it more probable than not that he will spend his time in custody in protection.

The appeal

20In support of the first ground of appeal it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that her Honour failed to recognise that the plea spared the complainant the ordeal of giving evidence, a finding which it was submitted should have been reflected in the finding with respect to remorse and contrition. The sentencing judge said after defining the fact that a 10% discount was appropriate for the utilitarian value of the plea ""no doubt the complainant was required to ready herself to give evidence at trial and of course that would have required her to relive her experience."" It was submitted that it is apparent from this remark that her Honour did not recognise the fact that, although the victim was required to ready herself for trial, because the applicant ultimately pleaded guilty she was spared the need to give evidence.

21I am not persuaded that the error has occurred. Having made the observation to which I have referred her Honour went on to say that she accepted that the plea demonstrated some contrition and, having heard from the applicant, she found him to be remorseful and contrite. To my mind that finding was open. The qualification that her Honour placed on the finding apparent from her remarks that the plea demonstrated ""some contrition"", appropriately reflected the fact that the plea came at a late stage and did not relieve the victim from reliving her experience in anticipation that she would have to give evidence.

22The maximum penalty for the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is 14 years imprisonment. Although the applicant ultimately desisted from his attempt to penetrate the victim, he did not cease his activities when he was first asked to do so. Having kissed the victim and placed his tongue in her mouth, acts which were greeted with significant protest from the victim, he continued to impose upon her by touching her vagina. He not only did this on one occasion but when the victim had made plain her opposition to his actions he not only touched her vagina but made an attempt to penetrate her vagina.

23Although her Honour found that the offence fell towards the lower end of the scale it nevertheless was a deliberate attempt by the applicant, which was persisted in, to have sexual intercourse knowing that the complainant was not consenting. 

24The applicant provided the court with reference to a number of cases where offenders were sentenced for similar offences. However, as may be expected the circumstances of each case differed, on occasions significantly. None of the cases to which we were referred involved a taxi driver who sought to take advantage of one of his passengers. 

25In R v Gretch NSWCCA, (11 December 1998, unreported) the offender pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The offender and the victim were previously in a domestic relationship and the offence occurred some time after the relationship had ended. During the course of an evening when the offender visited the victim's home he forced her on her back, removed her clothing and attempted penile penetration but was unable to obtain an erection. The offender was sentenced by this Court following a Crown appeal to 2 years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 1 year and an additional term of 1 year. Being a Crown appeal, that sentence must have been at the lowest end of the available range.

26In another case Raczkowski v R [2008] NSWCCA 152 the applicant returned to the home of his estranged wife and tied her up, saying he intended to engage in intercourse. He also threatened the victim with a pistol, which he pointed at her head. He subsequently untied his wife and removed her clothes but tied her to the bed post. In that position he attempted sexual intercourse but the victim prevented him from achieving penetration by kicking him with her unsecured leg. Following a struggle the applicant straddled the victim and ejaculated over her face. The offender was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years. 

27In the present case the applicant sought to take advantage of the fact that the 19 year old victim had entrusted her safety to the applicant anticipating that she would be driven safely to her home. In circumstances where she had no capacity to avoid the applicant's advances he, knowing that she did not consent, made repeated efforts to assault her and attempted to penetrate her vagina. By his actions the applicant committed a gross breach of the trust placed in him, instilling both alarm and fear in the victim. Although, as her Honour found, the offence fell at the lower end of the range, being an attack by a taxi driver on a passenger it required a sentence of imprisonment that both punished the applicant and marked out his offence for other taxi drivers who may be similarly inclined.

28Any one who travels in a taxi is entitled to expect that the journey will be completed without an unwanted sexual advance from the driver. The sentencing judge was conscious of the need to ensure that the applicant was appropriately punished and received a sentence that may operate to deter others from offending in a similar manner. Her Honour rightly determined that the applicant's behaviour constituted a grave breach of the trust owed by a taxi driver to members of the public.

29I do not overlook the fact that the applicant has been diagnosed with a mental condition that may have impacted on his judgment at the time he committed the offence. Her Honour expressly had regard to this issue. However, the offence was sufficiently serious to require a custodial term and I am not persuaded that the sentence that her Honour imposed was manifestly excessive.

30Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed.

31ROTHMAN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

32ADAMSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

2760696,R v Nguyen [2012] NSWSC 1583,"Ex Tempore Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 19 July 2012, Philip Nguyen, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the charge that he on 8 September 2010 at Bankstown in the State of New South Wales, did feloniously slay William Crews. This is a charge of manslaughter contrary to s 18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900; which was the first count on the indictment upon which he was arraigned before Latham J on that day. 

2The indictment contained two further counts being a charge of shooting at William Crews with intent to murder contrary to s 29 Crimes Act (count 2) and an alternative count of wounding William Crews with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act (count 3). He pleaded guilty to the third count. 

3Offences of unauthorised possession of a pistol contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 and supply of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1)/s 29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 were included on a Form 1. 

4At the time the pleas were entered, the applicant was represented by Stephen Hanley SC who was instructed by Christopher Watson, a solicitor. 

5Mr Hanley was admitted to the bar in December 1986 and has practised solely in criminal law. He has conducted numerous trials on behalf of accused. Mr Watson has practiced as a solicitor for 42 years predominately in the area of criminal law. 

6The Crown accepted the pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment. The applicant's trial that had been listed to commence on 8 October 2012 was vacated and proceedings for sentence were fixed for 9 and 10 October 2012.

7At the request of the Crown, the matter was listed before me on 3 October 2012 as the Crown had been informed that Mr Hanley and Mr Watson were no longer instructed by the applicant. The applicant told me that he intended to engage a private solicitor to withdraw his plea of guilty. On 9 October 2012, Ho Ledinh, a solicitor appeared on the applicant's behalf, the sentencing proceedings were vacated and procedural directions were made concerning the application to withdraw the pleas. 


8By a notice of motion filed on 8 November 2012, the applicant seeks leave to withdraw his pleas of guilty and to enter pleas of not guilty to all the counts on the indictment. 

9The court has the discretion to allow an accused to withdraw a plea of guilty at any time prior to the passing of sentence: Frodsham v O'Gorman [1979] 1 NSWLR 683.

10In R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; (2001) 121 A Crim R 472, Spigelman CJ at [32] summarized the circumstances that had been identified when the Court of Criminal Appeal had intervened to set aside a guilty plea:

where the appellant 'did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered': R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 233. 
where the plea was not 'a free and voluntary confession': R v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218 (at 220 D-E). 
the 'plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt': R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191. 
where there was 'mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt': R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 80. 
where the 'plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty ... some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt': R v Cincotta (Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60472 of 1995, 1 November 1995). 
the 'plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt': Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511; 186-187.
if 'the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt': R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 579 at 583.

11Each case depends on its own facts and a decision is to be made whether justice requires that a plea of guilty should be permitted to be withdrawn: Sagiv at 80

12When discussing the legal principles relating to a withdrawal of a plea where an accused is legally represented, Basten JA in Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 158 observed at [23]:
""It has long been established that, even after conviction, a plea may be changed and the conviction set aside if it be established that the appellant ""did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it"": see R v Forde [1923] 2 KB 400 at 403, discussed in R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 188. Where the accused is legally represented, the court will usually be entitled to rely upon a plea as having been given with an appreciation of the nature of the charge and with an understanding of what was being done. But there may be evidence which contradicts that presumption.""

13Basten JA noted at [27] the ""principles of restraint"" identified by Kirby P in Liberti v R (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122: 

""For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence ...

In some circumstances, the circumspection may be based upon a concern that changes in plea may involve an attempt to manipulate the system to delay a feared conviction and sentence."" 

14Before I commence a review of the evidence, I reiterate that I found the applicant to be fit to give evidence. He did not manifest any disability with comprehension, concentration or attention, nor did he indicate an inability to deal with lengthy questions, nor was there any sign of fatigue during the course of his evidence. However, my overall assessment of the applicant as a witness is that I found him in matters of significance, to be plainly dishonest and evasive. 

15In an affidavit sworn 8 November 2012, the applicant states that he was unable to afford private legal representation but had asked the Legal Aid Commission (the Commission) to transfer his file to Ledinh Lawyers, so that Mr Ledinh, a solicitor, could explain to him all aspects of his criminal matter in the Vietnamese language, but the Commission declined to do so. 

16The Commission had assigned the file to Mr Watson with Mr Hanley having been previously briefed. Mr Hanley had represented the applicant during the committal proceedings at Burwood Local Court, being instructed at that time by a solicitor with the Commission. 

17There were six conferences between the applicant and Mr Hanley and Mr Watson. According to the applicant, it was during a visit on 20 April 2012 that his legal representatives advised him to enter a plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter and suggested that if ""[he] agree to enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter, the Crown will drop a murder charge"": (par 12). The applicant states he was surprised at this advice, that he never thought that he would enter a plea of guilty to any serious criminal charge as ""[he] did not kill or did not have any intention to kill anyone"": (par 13). The applicant recounts that he said words to the effect (par 14):

""I cannot enter a plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter. I do not understand what is meaning of manslaughter?""

18There was no Vietnamese interpreter present during that meeting.

19The next visit by Mr Hanley and Mr Watson was on 26 April 2012 during which Kim Loan Ly, a Vietnamese interpreter was present. The applicant states (paras 16-17):

""Through the Vietnamese interpreter, Mr Hanley SC and Mr Watson, Solicitor, advised me to enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter charge. They advised me words to the effect that ""if I don't agree and insist to go to trial, the jury will certainly find me guilty of more serious charge, namely, shoot with intend (sic) to murder, and I will have to stay in the prison longer.""

I was confused as I had been in prison for almost two (02) years with no prospect of my matter to be resolved. My nerve system was almost broke down. I actually did not know what will happen to me in the future. I then agreed to their advised (sic). They asked me to sign some document that I cannot recall now. They then left."" 

20I interpolate here to refer to Mr Watson's affidavit, to which is annexed a three page document dated 26 April 2012 marked ""E"" that is signed by the applicant. The document provides detailed instructions from the applicant that he wishes to plead guilty to manslaughter and the offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act and for the offences of possession of an unauthorized firearm, and supply of a prohibited drug to be placed on a Form 1 and to be taken into account on sentence. 

21The document records the basis of the applicant's instructions to plead guilty to manslaughter being that the Crown accepts:

""1. It cannot disprove I was acting in self defence when I fired at Const. Crews; and, 

2. That self defence was excessive."" 

22Without detailing all of the document, it further records that: 

""I [the applicant] confirm that I have had explained to me by you the charges; what the DPP has to prove; a consideration of my prospects if I pleaded not guilty and any benefit I may receive by pleading guilty. I note your advice that I shall receive a reduction in the appropriate sentence for my plea of guilty. 

I confirm that you have not held out to me that I will receive any specific sentence if I plead guilty.""

23The document was admitted into evidence as Ex 5. 

24The third page of the document contains a statement by Ms Ly that she had translated the preceding pages from English into Vietnamese to the applicant, who had indicated he understood and agreed with its contents. 

25It was Ms Ly's evidence that during the course of the conference, she interpreted accurately whatever Mr Hanley said from English to Vietnamese and whatever the applicant said from Vietnamese to English. She translated the whole of the document (ex 5) to the applicant from English to Vietnamese which he appeared to have understood. 

26It is plain that this document of instructions is the document that the applicant says in his affidavit that he could not recall. Mr Hanley in his affidavit sworn on 13 November 2012 confirms that the document records the instructions that he took from the applicant on 26 April 2012, which is recorded in his handwriting. Mr Hanley read through those instructions which were then translated to the applicant by the interpreter and signed by them both. 

27Nine pages of handwritten notes that Mr Watson made at the conference on 26 April 2012 are annexed to his affidavit and marked ""D"". These notes accord with Mr Hanley's recollection of the conference. The notes reveal that Mr Hanley in a very careful way, explained to the applicant his legal position, including the issues of causation and excessive self-defence, the options of pleading not guilty or guilty, the range of a sentencing discount for a plea and two of the offences being placed on a Form 1. It is also apparent that the applicant was not told what to do, but was asked what it was that he wanted to do. The notes disclose that the applicant sought Mr Hanley's advice as to whether he should plead guilty but was told that he had to decide, that Mr Hanley could only explain the position to him, that if he wanted to go to trial that his legal representatives would ""try really hard"" for him to get the best result. Although there was some hesitation on the applicant's part, he decided to instruct his counsel to enter the pleas of guilty. 

28All of what was said by Mr Hanley to the applicant and by the applicant to Mr Hanley was translated by Ms Ly, as was the document of instructions (Ex 5). 

29I do not accept the applicant's evidence that only parts of the document of instructions were translated for him. 

30During his oral testimony the applicant denied that he knew when he entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter that he was saying that he had used excessive self-defence. He rejected the suggestion that the basis of his plea had been explained to him by Mr Hanley when he said (T28 10-11):

""He did not explain or give explanation to me on any matter at all"". 

31It is very clear from Mr Hanley's evidence which is supported by the conference notes and document of instructions that Mr Hanley explained to the applicant, amongst other things, the concept of excessive self-defence and the basis upon which the Crown would accept a plea to manslaughter. 

32It is convenient here to mention one of the arguments raised on behalf of the applicant this morning. 

33During submissions, Mr Ledinh appeared to contend that a jury could not find that the applicant's response in discharging his pistol was not a reasonable response in the circumstances that he perceived them to be. The Crown case is that any reasonable person in the position of the applicant would not have considered that it was necessary to act in this way in order to protect himself from serious harm. 

34Juries are often directed that in determining whether what an accused did was reasonable, to stand back and consider the response from an objective viewpoint. They are asked to consider what would have been a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be. 

35The Crown case statement (ex 10) discloses that both Constable Crews and Detective Senior Constable Roberts yelled out ""Police, put down the gun."" None of the Police officers had their firearms removed from their holsters. The other Police officer's were retreating to protect themselves. It is not appropriate on the basis of the Crown statement to give a detailed review of the evidence, but I am satisfied that a jury could capably find that the applicant's response in the circumstances he perceived them to be, was unreasonable. 

36I do not detect any error of principle in the way in which self-defence was explained to the applicant by Mr Hanley. I now return to a discussion of the evidence. 

37The applicant states in his affidavit that on his next court appearance, Mr Hanley and Mr Watson with a Vietnamese Interpreter visited him in the Court's cell complex, that he asked them: ""If I enter a plea of guilty to the manslaughter charge, do you know how long I will have to serve in the prison?"" The applicant said that he asked the question as he did not know what was the maximum penalty for manslaughter and they replied that they did not know. When he was brought into Court, he refused to enter a plea of guilty.

38Mr Hanley had, unsurprisingly, explained to the applicant during the conference on 26 April 2012 that he could not tell him what sentence that he would receive for manslaughter, but gave him a range of non-parole periods to which he might be sentenced. He had also explained to him that the maximum sentence for manslaughter was 25 years imprisonment. 

39Mr Hanley and Mr Watson had conferred with the applicant with the assistance of Mr Duong interpreter prior to his arraignment before Latham J on 4 May 2012. The applicant withdrew his instructions during that conference and as a result appeared, unrepresented before her Honour. When he was arraigned, he pleaded not guilty to counts 1 and 2 and guilty to counts 3, 4 and 5 and the matter was adjourned to 6 July 2012. 

40The indictment upon which the applicant was arraigned on that day included the offences contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act (count 4) and s 25(1)/s 29 Drug Misuse Trafficking Act (count 5) that were included on the Form 1 on 19 July 2012. The Crown did not accept the pleas of guilty in full satisfaction of the indictment. 

41Although no longer retained, Mr Hanley raised with Latham J his concerns about the pleas entered by the applicant. Mr Hanley was concerned that the plea of guilty to count 3, deprived the applicant of maintaining that he acted in self-defence in count 1 (manslaughter) and that the only issue at trial in relation to that count would be one of causation. The case was adjourned for a further call over on 6 July 2012 so that the court might be advised of the applicant's legal representation. 

42Upon returning to prison, the applicant contacted Mr Ledinh who visited him at the MRRC on 6 May 2012. He signed a letter to the Commission directing the Commission to forward his file to Mr Ledinh, but received a letter from the Commission advising him that if he did not co-operate with Mr Hanley and Mr Watson and insisted on transferring the file to another solicitor, then his grant of legal aid would be terminated. After being informed of the Commission's response, Mr Ledinh told the applicant he would not be able to assist him. 

43The applicant described being disappointed and feeling alone as no one would help him. He telephoned Mr Hanley and Mr Watson who said (para 25):
""If I do not agree to enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter, I will be found guilty by the jury at trial with (sic) more serious offence."" 

44Mr Hanley and Mr Watson visited him at MRRC with the assistance of Tung Son Trinh, an interpreter, on 27 June 2012. The applicant states that they advised him to enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter and he would receive a discount on sentence for the plea. According to the applicant, they also suggested he ""better"" not go to trial as he would be found guilty by the jury, serve longer in prison and not be allowed a sentencing discount. He then agreed to plead guilty to the manslaughter charge and entered the pleas on 6 July 2012. 

45All of the conversations between the applicant and Mr Hanley as well as the written instructions (Ex 5) were translated by the interpreter. The applicant then confirmed his original instructions and signed the document a second time as did the interpreter. Mr Watson's notes of the conference (annex F) disclose that the applicant's legal position was carefully canvassed with him on that day by Mr Hanley, that he was told that his legal advisers could only advise him, but was asked what he wanted to do, and he instructed his counsel to plead guilty. Mr Hanley insisted that the applicant confirm his written instructions which were then translated to him, after which the applicant confirmed them with his signature. 

46The applicant is mistaken about the date that the pleas were entered. The court's record reveals that the pleas were entered on 19 July 2012 which accords with Mr Hanley's recollection and Mr Watson's notes. The applicant's pleas were not entered for some three weeks after he re-confirmed his instructions. He was visited by Mr Hanley and Mr Watson with Cuc Dinh, an interpreter before he was arraigned, but did not demur from his intention to plead guilty. Mr Hanley met with him in the cell complex to confirm that he wished to proceed on the basis of the signed instructions, which he confirmed. 

47The applicant says in his affidavit that after being returned to prison, he was very worried and later on made a telephone call to Mr Ledinh, who visited him at the MRRC on 7 August and 3 September 2012. He said to Mr Ledinh (para 29): 

""I have very good reasons [to withdraw his guilty plea]. I entered a plea of guilty as I was advised that I will be allowed to discount on sentence. And that I will be found guilty by the jury if I insist to go for trial, and I will not be allowed to be discount on sentence. And that I will stay longer in the prison. All these made me confused and forced me to enter a plea of guilty to the offence that I never had any intention to commit at all."" 

48Mr Watson ceased to act for the applicant following receipt of a letter dated 17 August 2012 from him and a facsimile from Ledinh Lawyers dated 11 September 2012. The applicant's letter (annexure A) includes the following:

""As my English skills are of below advange (sic) and I did not understand what I was pleading guilty to by your instructions. In say (sic) and doing this I am also changing my plea of guilty to not guilty as I feel that I was mislead due to my lack of understanding skills with English."" 

49I reject the suggestion that there was misunderstanding on the applicant's part or that he was mislead because of any disadvantage in English. In all the conferences of importance, the applicant had the benefit of translation by competent interpreters. 

50There is an aspect of the applicant's oral evidence that it is convenient to mention. He was questioned by Mr Crown as to why he had entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on 19 July 2012. On this topic his evidence included the following (T 27 18-30):

""Q. Why did you enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter? 
A. INTERPRETER: After my request for funding to hire the best solicitor was refused I came to the conclusion that I entered a plea of guilty even though I was not quite aware of what the charge was or how serious or the degree of seriousness of the charge.

Q. I suggest to you that you entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter because you thought that you would get a lower sentence for doing that? 
A. INTERPRETER: At that time I was feeling like I was all by myself, no one was defending me, so I came to the decision of pleading guilty even though I'm not quite sure by doing that is there any discount or lessening of my degree of seriousness of the charge.""


51The applicant's testimony that as the Commission had refused to transfer his file to Mr Ledinh, that he felt he was by himself, that no one was defending him, he decided to plead guilty, lacks credibility. He had the benefit of senior counsel and a solicitor with many years experience in criminal law. Both Mr Hanley and Mr Watson had informed him that they were prepared to do their best for him if he decided to plead not guilty. 

52I do not accept that the applicant was advised at any time by Mr Hanley or Mr Watson that if he insisted on going to trial, the jury would certainly find him guilty. 

53I find that the applicant's pleas were freely and voluntarily made, without any undue or improper pressure by his legal representatives. In R v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273; (2001) 124 A Crim R 233, Ipp AJA said at [93] - [94]:

""I appreciate that in Maxwell v The Queen Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 511 that even the ""desire to gain a technical advantage"" may result in a plea of guilty not being an admission of guilt. With respect, however, I do not understand a ""technical advantage"" to apply to or include the situation where an accused person, without any undue or improper pressure, freely and voluntarily makes a decision to plead guilty to one offence, not because he believes that he is guilty, but because he thinks that this is a good way of avoiding the risk of being found guilty of other offences, or of receiving a reduced sentence, or of protecting his evidence with a view to bringing an appeal at a later stage.

As long as the decision to plead guilty was made freely and voluntarily, the decision stands. This is the necessary corollary of the principle laid down in Maxwell v The Queen at 511 that if the plea of guilty is genuine, and the accused person knows what he his doing, he may, for ""whatever reason"" insist on pleading guilty."" (emphasis in original)

54During submissions, Mr Ledinh referred to the issue of causation and submitted that it is a matter to be decided by a jury. 

55There is no doubt that the issue of causation of Constable Crew's death was a central consideration in determining whether to enter a guilty plea. The bullet fired by the applicant had struck the deceased in the left upper arm. The bullet fired by Detective Senior Constable Roberts had struck the deceased to the right side of the neck. It was from this injury that the deceased had died. 

56In the opinion of Dr Tibbits, an acoustics expert, the first shot was fired by the applicant's pistol. This opinion appears to be supported by the evidence of Tan Chung, and of Detective Senior Constable Roberts. 

57It is the Crown case that the act of the applicant which caused the death of Constable Crews was the presentation of the pistol and the pointing of it in the direction of the police. The Crown case is that this inevitably led to the Police drawing their own firearms and firing at the applicant, and that in the confines of an underground garage the applicant foresaw the reasonable possibility that someone might inadvertently be shot during the ensuing fight causing their death. 

58Mr Hanley explained to the applicant on a number of occasions the basis upon which he may be legally responsible for the crime of manslaughter. During his oral testimony, Mr Hanley gave the following evidence (T45 46-50; T46 1-14):

Q. Would you explain to the Court, in essence, how you explained that to him? 

A. Well, in relation to the manslaughter charge which was the most difficult one for him to comprehend, I had discussions with him in English and also with him an interpreter on a couple of occasions, explained to him that the basis of his culpability that the Crown were alleging is that because he had fired the gun and by then, when we were talking about him entering a plea, there is evidence that he fired first, that it must have been expectation that he would have returned there would have been returned fire possibly and people could have been killed or seriously injured. 

I tried to explain to him in relatively simple terms there was an English case called Pagett that seemed to be accepted here that where a police officer returning fire in the lawful execution of his duty and in selfdefence of himself or others, there would be no break in the causation. Because I understood that a difficulty that not only Mr Nguyen but even lawyers have is why he should be responsible and it was difficult at times to get that across to him but I was attempting to do it in a fairly simple fashion. 

59I do not detect any error in principle in the advice given by Mr Hanley. 

60It is a basic tenet of causation in homicide that an accused's conduct need not be the sole, direct or immediate cause of death. It is enough that the applicant's conduct contributed significantly to the death of the victim: Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; (1991) 172 CLR 378 per Brennan J at p 398; R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App R 279 at p 288. Where the death is not caused directly by the conduct of the accused but by something done by a third person, there may be a question whether the chain of causation has been broken. However, where the act of Detective Senior Constable Roberts in discharging his firearm was performed in the execution of his duty and in defence of himself and others, it is unlikely that act would operate as a ""novus actus interveniens"": Pagett at [289]-[290].

61The questions of causation and foreseeability would ultimately be for a jury to decide. These were matters that were explained clearly to the applicant by Mr Hanley for him to assess in deciding how to plead. 

62It is plain that the applicant had difficulty accepting that he was responsible for the deceased's death, but I am satisfied that he understood the careful explanations that had been given to him by Mr Hanley and having weighed the competing considerations, entered his pleas of guilty on 19 July 2012. 

63There is ample evidence on the Crown case statement that supports the charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act. 

64The Crown's concession that it was not in a position to disprove that at the time of presenting his firearm, the applicant considered that it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself in a situation where he thought that the men approaching him may well be people involved in the drug trade who were trying to ""rip him off"", was significantly to the applicant's advantage. 

65Furthermore, the acceptance by the Crown of the pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment and the inclusion of counts 4 and 5 on the Form 1 are matters in his favour on sentence. The offence contrary to s 29 Crimes Act that was not proceeded with, carries with it a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

66I find that the applicant did not enter his pleas as result of mistake or misunderstanding. He did so intentionally with appreciation of the charges and with full knowledge of all of the facts. The fact that he subsequently changed his mind is insufficient to permit him to withdraw his pleas. I do not permit the applicant to withdraw the pleas of guilty that he entered on 19 July 2012. 

Orders

67Accordingly, I make the following orders:

1. Application to withdraw pleas of guilty entered on 19 July 2012 denied. 


2. Listed in the arraignment list before Latham J on
1 February 2013 to allocate a Judge and date for sentence. 

3.Grant liberty to the parties to approach Latham J to obtain an earlier date. 

4.Bail refused.

		18 December 2012",2012-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760699,R v Milne [2012] NSWSC 1538,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  On 13 November 2012 Michael Milne entered a plea of guilty to one count of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth contrary to s 135.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Code"") by causing to be lodged income tax returns on 7 December 2006 for the financial years ending 30 June 2000, 30 June 2001 and 30 June 2005 containing false information in that they omitted income in the total amount of $928,574.
2Mr Milne was originally arraigned on 4 September 2009 at which time he entered pleas of not guilty to an indictment containing six counts, each of which was laid contrary to s 135.1(1) of the Code relating to a specified tax year, including the years 2000, 2001 and 2005, and each of which alleged that the Commonwealth had been defrauded by his failure to declare income either in his own name or in the name of Barat Advisory Pty Ltd, a company over which he exercised control. 
3His trial on that indictment was listed to commence before me on 12 November 2012.  Some months in advance of the trial he formally indicated his preparedness to cooperate with the Crown in the presentation of the evidence upon which it proposed to rely at his trial with a view to confining the issues in dispute.  Orders were made by consent reflecting that agreement.
4On 5 November 2012 I was informed by the parties that consideration was being given to reformulating the indictment, in effect to compress into one count four of the six counts upon which Mr Milne was originally arraigned.  
5On 13 November 2012 Mr Milne entered a plea of guilty to an indictment reformulated in that way.
6In considering the extent to which his plea of guilty will be taken into account in his favour on sentence, and whether his willingness to participate in the saving of court time when the matter was to proceed as a trial should also be taken into account, it is useful to set out a chronology of relevant events from the time of his arrest in February 2008.  The chronology will also provide a context for a consideration of the impact of delay on the sentence to be imposed.  In addition, because Mr Milne is already serving sentences of imprisonment imposed by Johnson J in December 2010 following his conviction after trial for other Commonwealth offences, s 19AD of the Crimes Act (Cth) is invoked.  
7Section 19AD of the Crimes Act (Cth) provides as follows: (1)  Where:(a)  a nonparole period (in this section called the existing nonparole period) has been fixed in respect of a federal sentence or federal sentences; and(b)  while the offender is serving the existing nonparole period, a court imposes a further federal sentence on the person;this section applies.
(2)  Where this section applies, the court must, after considering the relevant circumstances, including:(a)  the existing nonparole period; and(b)  the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned; and(c)  the antecedents of the person;do one of the following things:(d)  make an order confirming the existing nonparole period;(e)  fix a new single nonparole period in respect of all federal sentences the person is to serve or complete;(f)  where the court decides that, in the circumstances, a nonparole period is not appropriate-cancel the existing nonparole period and decline to fix a new nonparole period.
(3)  Where, under paragraph (2)(e), the court fixes a new single nonparole period, it:(a)  is to be treated as having superseded the existing nonparole period; and(b)  must not be such as to allow the person to be released on parole earlier then would have been the case if the further sentence had been imposed.
(4)  Where this section applies, the court must not make a recognizance release order.
(5)  Where, under paragraph (2)(f), the court declines to fix a new nonparole period, the court must:(a)  state its reasons for deciding that a nonparole period is not appropriate; and(b)  cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court.
8The application of s 19AD of the Crimes Act (Cth), and the related question of how totality principles should apply in this case, was the subject of considerable dispute in the sentence proceedings.  
9On Mr Milne's behalf, Mr Dhanji SC submitted that after taking into account all relevant matters under s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth), and after a proper application of totality principles, the sentence for the subject offending should not exceed three years having regard to the need for it to reflect some proportionality with the sentence imposed by Johnson J in December 2010.  Further, after taking into account the additional matters I am obliged to consider in s 19AD(2)(a)-(c) he also submitted that the sentence should be ordered to be served concurrently with the existing sentence, without any extension of the existing non-parole period.  In the Crown's submission that approach would fail to reflect the objective seriousness of the separate and distinct criminal conduct for which Mr Milne is to be sentenced and the need for him to be adequately punished for it.  In the Crown's submission a degree of accumulation between the sentence to be imposed and the existing sentence is required and, in order to reflect a proper ratio between the effective sentence and the non-parole period, it will be necessary to fix a new single non-parole period under s 19AD(2)(e).  
10Other matters relevant to the question of sentence were not the subject of the same degree of contention.  For example, although I am required to impose sentence referable to matters relevantly bearing upon Mr Milne's subjective circumstances in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth), it was not suggested by either counsel that I would come to any different findings to many of those reached by Johnson J, although clearly I am not bound by them.  I will refer later in this judgment to those findings and make clear at that time the extent to which my conclusions diverge from his Honour's as to some matters and where I am grateful to adopt his Honour's findings on others.  In that connection I note that the same body of testimonial evidence tendered on Mr Milne's behalf before his Honour was also tendered before me, including a testimonial from Dr Robert Hampshire.  Dr Hampshire gave evidence in the proceeding before me in his professional capacity as a consultant psychiatrist at the request of the Crown.  No objection was taken to the tender of his report.  
11Mr Dhanji submitted that the weight of his client's subjective circumstances including, importantly, the fact that he has recently been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, informs the sentencing discretion in such a way that, independent of totality principles, the imposition of a sentence that does not extend the time Mr Milne is to serve in prison is justified.  
12The Crown submitted that the weight of the opinions expressed by Dr Hampshire is diminished by reason of him having been the subject of disciplinary proceedings in 1994 with a restriction on his right to practice imposed at that time (albeit since lifted), and a further restriction imposed in 2010, following his diagnosis with hypertension, which he has recently applied to have lifted, as to which he is currently awaiting confirmation from the Medical Board.  The Crown submitted that even were I to give full weight to Dr Hampshire's professional diagnosis and insights, some extension of the time Mr Milne is to spend in custody was warranted, notwithstanding the fact that his custodial experience has been productive of a recognised psychiatric illness from which he did not suffer at the time he entered custody.  
The timeline to prosecution 
13In February 2008 Mr Milne was arrested and charged with the conduct comprehended by the count to which he pleaded guilty before me (an offence committed on or about 7 December 2006) together with other criminal conduct for which he was sentenced by Johnson J in December 2010.  He was released on bail following his arrest.  He has not spent any time in custody in relation to the offending the subject of this sentencing proceeding.
14On 13 July 2009, after defended committal proceedings, he was committed to stand trial in respect of all offences charged by the issue of court attendance notices following his arrest in February 2008.  In September 2009 an indictment containing multiple counts and drafted to comprehend all offences upon which he was committed for trial was filed in this Court.  In September 2009, following correspondence between the parties, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions agreed to sever the indictment and to proceed to trial on two indictments.  There were apparently sound reasons for proceeding first with the indictment which included a money laundering offence and a related breach of s 135.1(1) of the Code given the relative complexity of the evidence relating to proof of those offences and the legal issues to which they gave rise.  
15On 17 December 2010, after a trial that extended over four weeks, Mr Milne was sentenced by Johnson J to an effective term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months for a money laundering count contrary to s 400.3(1) of the Code, the subject of the first count on the indictment, and a breach of s 135.1(1) of the Code charged as the second count.  His Honour imposed a sentence of 3 years and 6 months on the second count which he partially accumulated on the sentence of 7 years for the money laundering count.  Mr Milne is currently eligible to be considered for release to parole on 16 September 2015.  
16On 28 February 2011 the trial on the second indictment, listed to commence before Johnson J, was vacated by consent.  Counsel informed me from the bar table that his Honour accepted that neither of the parties were in a position of readiness at that time.  On 2 December 2011 the trial listed to commence on 13 February 2012 was also vacated.  It is not clear why there was a delay of 12 months between the first application to vacate the trial and the second application, save only that it appears Mr Milne was having difficulties in securing private representation for his trial after retaining private counsel for his appeal against conviction and sentence heard in August 2011.  
17On 2 March 2012 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal at which time the second trial was listed to commence on 12 November 2012.  
18On 3 May 2012 Mr Milne's then solicitors filed a notice of motion seeking a permanent stay on the basis that he was unable to afford representation, an application which was abandoned in June on the issue of a grant of legal aid.  
19On 31 October 2012 (two weeks before the trial was due to commence before me) I was informed that the parties were in discussion with a view to Mr Milne entering a plea of guilty to a reformulated single count and the preparation of a fresh indictment in substitution for the indictment containing six counts which was to have been the subject of the second trial. 
The issue of delay and its impact on the principle of totality
20It was not submitted that the delay of six years from arrest to the date of sentence (which does not seem to me to be unduly lengthy) was the result of any dilatoriness by the Crown or obstruction by Mr Milne.  The investigation which resulted in Mr Milne's arrest appears to have been conducted with appropriate efficiency with the delay in the ultimate presentation of the reformulated indictment on 12 November 2012 a direct consequence of the need for the indictment to be severed and two trials ordered in the otherwise orderly progress of the criminal proceedings in this Court.  While the delay of two years from the severing of the indictment to the presentation of the reformulated indictment was undesirable, it is explicable.  That said, I accept that sentencing for an offence of some age calls for flexibility in approach, in particular where an offender has demonstrated some rehabilitative progress in the intervening period (see Blanco v R [1999] NSWCCA 121; 106 A Crim R 303 per Wood CJ at CL at [2]) or where an offender has been subject to some uncertainty as to their fate because of a lengthy postponement in the ultimate resolution of past criminal offending, whether as a result of interstate offending or for other reasons (see R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519-520).  As McColl JA (with whom Levine and Hidden JJ agreed) observed in R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130 at [33], the impact of delay on sentence will turn on the circumstances of each case.
21There was no evidence led in the proceedings before me that Mr Milne has made any particular progress since his incarceration towards his ultimate rehabilitation (or, for that matter, before that time), save perhaps for the fact that he has demonstrated a preparedness to assist other inmates gain educational qualifications through his work in the prison library.  It may be that his continuing lack of contrition (about which I will have something to say later) is impeding any progress he may otherwise have made.  On the other hand, the impact of his psychiatric condition which, in Dr Hampshire's view is directly referable to the difficulties Mr Milne has encountered as a man in his late 50s with a sub clinical psychiatric disorder making the transition to prison life, may either have retarded or camouflaged his progress.  
22Although in one sense Mr Milne was in a state of suspension following the issue of court attendance notices in February 2008 and the ultimate resolution of all matters by his plea of guilty to the reformulated charge in November 2012 - a state of affairs readily distinguished from cases (of which Kay is an example) where an offender has remained silent whilst his earlier offending was under investigation in the hope that his conduct would not ultimately attract a charge - Mr Milne could have been in no doubt that the offending, at one time the subject of six counts on the second indictment, would be prosecuted given the consistent position of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.  
23In the result, while I accept that there has been some potential for delay to have interrupted Mr Milne's rehabilitative progress, and although I propose to give some weight to the impact of an overhang of uncertainty as to the ultimate charges that would be proceeded with, I do not consider that delay will operate, independently of other considerations, to ameliorate the sentence to any significant degree.
24Delay has a more significant bearing upon the application of totality principles if I am of the view that the reformulated charge is of the same or similar character to either of the offences for which he has been sentenced and if they were committed in the same episode of criminality.  As Giles JA (with whom RS Hulme and Adams JJ agreed) observed in Wu v R [2011] NSWCCA 102; 211 A Crim R 88, in those circumstances the imposition of a further term of imprisonment, imposed cumulatively, needs careful consideration.  
25As to that issue, in Mr Dhanji's submission the offending the subject of these proceedings, and that charged in the second count in the trial before Johnson J, should be seen as ""forming part of a single, albeit multifaceted, episode of criminality"".  The Crown submitted that save for the fact that the conduct concerned dishonesty in the lodgement of tax returns containing false information, and that both counts were prosecuted as breaches of s 135.1 of the Code, the context in which those offences were committed were sufficiently dissimilar, and the criminality sufficiently distinct, that it is inappropriate to treat them as part of one course of conduct.  That being the case, the Crown submitted that although it would be open to me to moderate the degree of accumulation to account for the delay and its impact on Mr Milne as a serving prisoner (and, it was conceded, to some considerable degree), proper application of the principle of totality nevertheless requires an extension of the existing non-parole period.
The offending the subject of these proceedings 
26The Crown tendered a comprehensive statement of facts on sentence which was admitted without objection.  Although the facts were not agreed, Mr Milne accepted, through his counsel, they would form the basis of my factual findings for sentencing purposes.  What follows is a summary of those facts which I am satisfied are established beyond reasonable doubt.
27Mr Milne was the director and chairman of the Board of Directors of Talisman Technologies (""Talisman"") between January 2000 and December 2001.  The company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands where it had its registered offices.  Talisman's holding company Xhosa Ltd, was a company incorporated in Ireland.  
28In March 2000 Talisman's Board of Directors entered into a consulting agreement with Xhosa Enterprises (""Xhosa""), a company incorporated in Switzerland, under which Mr Milne would provide consultancy services to Talisman on Xhosa's behalf at the rate of US$200,000 per annum payable in equal monthly instalments. 
29Between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2000 Mr Milne received fees under the consultancy agreement in the amount of US$99,999.98 (equivalent to AU$171,273.58).  On 7 December 2006, when he lodged his tax return for the year ended 30 June 2000, he failed to declare that income.  He signed the taxpayer's declaration on the return to the effect that he had truthfully and accurately shown all his income for tax purposes, knowing that declaration was false.  The tax properly payable to the Commonwealth for the 2000 tax year on the omitted income was $73,669.89.
30Between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2001 Mr Milne received fees under the consultancy agreement from Talisman in the total amount of $357,301.08.  On 7 December 2006 when he lodged his tax return for the year ended 30 June 2001 he failed to declare that income.  He signed the taxpayer's declaration on that return, to the effect that he had truthfully and accurately shown all his income for tax purposes, knowing that declaration was false.  The tax properly payable to the Commonwealth for the 2001 tax year on the omitted income was $160,670.98. 
31On 8 July 2003 Mr Milne was appointed executive director/acting CEO of Global Technology Australasia Ltd and its subsidiaries.  On 10 January 2003 the company changed its name to Admerex Ltd (""Admerex""), a publicly listed company providing management software, management services and specialty applications to companies to better manage their receivables, loans, credit cards and other forms of credit.  On 21 December 2004 Admerex resolved to pay Mr Milne a fee of $400,000 for consultancy services provided to it.  At the meeting when that resolution was passed it was noted that Mr Milne would sever his links with Admerex, resign as a director of the company on 31 December 2004 and assume the role of corporate adviser based in the company's Sydney office. 
32On 5 January 2005 an amount of AU$400,000 was transferred from an offshore bank account in the name of Admerex (Ireland) Limited (a subsidiary of Admerex) which was opened on 23 December 2004 in the name of a nominee company.  Mr Milne signed the account opening documents.  He was one of two signatories to the account but effectively in control of it.  An equivalent amount was then transferred into another account where it was held in Mr Milne's name to satisfy Admerex's obligation to pay his consultancy fees.  
33On 6 January 2005 AU$400,000 was transferred to another offshore account.  Although a third party was authorised to operate the account Mr Milne was the beneficial owner of any funds held in that account.  Prior to the transfer of the funds no previous transactions had been conducted on the account.  On 7 January 2005, immediately following the transfer, $395,000 was withdrawn leaving a balance of $5000.  That same day Mr Milne tendered his resignation from the Board of Directors of Admerex and its subsidiaries effective immediately.  
34On 7 December 2006, when Mr Milne lodged his tax return to the year ended 30 June 2005 he failed to declare as income the $400,000 received from Admerex as consultancy fees.  Neither was it included in his income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2004 or 30 June 2006.  He signed the taxpayer's declaration on that return to the effect that he had truthfully and accurately shown all his income for tax purposes knowing that declaration was false.  The tax properly payable to the Commonwealth for the 2001 tax year on the omitted income was $181,134.02 
35The total income which Mr Milne failed to declare in the tax years 2000, 2001 and 2005 amounted to $928,574.66 and the total tax payable on the omitted income amounts to $415,474.89
36On 27 May 2005 Mr Milne engaged Grant Thornton Services (NSW) Pty Ltd (""Grant Thornton"") to provide advice and assistance in the lodging of his personal income tax returns and the business tax returns of his company Barat Advisory Pty Ltd (""Barat Advisory"").  Admerex was an audit client of Grant Thornton.  The officers of Grant Thornton agreed between themselves that it would be appropriate to coordinate that work with Mr Milne's personal tax affairs.   
37On 9 June 2005 William Shew wrote to Mr Milne (and to Barat Advisory) formalising Grant Thornton's retainer to prepare:(a)  books of accounts and financial statements for Barat Advisory for the years ending 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005;(b)  income tax returns for Barat Advisory for the years ending 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005; and(c)  personal income tax returns for Mr Milne for the year ending 30 June 2005 and all prior years as required.
38The letter also advised Mr Milne that it was his responsibility and that of the company to provide accurate and complete information within agreed time frames.  On 15 June 2005 Mr Milne acknowledged the contents of the retainer letter.
39On 9 August 2005 the Australian Taxation Office advised Mr Milne of his Tax File Number.
40On 12 September 2005 Stephen Thurn sent an email to Mr Milne's assistant listing a number of issues he and Mr Shew wanted to discuss with Mr Milne.  Under a heading ""Admerex"", he asked, ""What arrangements did Michael have with Admerex - salary/consulting fees/directors fees?  How much was earned?"".
41On about 1 October 2006 Colin Samuel, a manager with Grant Thornton, took over the review of the tax returns for both Barat Advisory and Mr Milne from Mr Thurn.
42On 27 October 2006 Mr Shew sent an email to Mr Milne in which he advised Mr Milne as follows:I have reviewed the figures to 30 June 2005 and have discussed the situation with Colin.  If I were the ATO I would have a hard time accepting the figures given no income has been derived (not saying that there is any income but we need to be prepared).
...
The key issue here is why you did what you did for no pay (ie consulting with Admerex, Barat Advisory work re Hamilton etc.)
I think it would also be good for your (sic) to build a timeline of events and transactions that support your financial position.  ie ... You provided consulting work to YY during the period - no fees charged because. (sic)
43On 31 October 2006 Mr Milne met with Mr Samuel and Mr Shew to discuss a timeline of his business and income earning activities between 1987 and 2006.  Mr Milne did not at that meeting, or at any other time, advise Grant Thornton that he had received income in the form of consultancy fees from Talisman or Admerex.  Further, he informed the accountants at that meeting, and at various other times, that he had no taxable income for the tax years 2000, 2001 and 2005.
44Grant Thornton resolved that it did not have sufficient reliable information from Mr Milne to allow them to prepare his tax returns for the 1999 to 2006 financial years and advised him accordingly.  Mr Milne requested that Mr Samuel email to him the blank tax returns for the relevant tax years.  
45Between about 10 November 2006 and 21 November 2006 Grant Thornton completed Mr Milne's personal details on page 1 of each of the income tax returns and forwarded further copies of the returns to him.
46Between about 10 November 2006 and 21 November 2006 Mr Milne forwarded his completed personal income tax returns to Grant Thornton with instructions that they should be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office.  Each of the income tax returns was signed by him.  Grant Thornton did not sign the income tax returns as tax agent for Mr Milne.
47On 29 November 2006 the Australian Taxation Office identified that Mr Milne had failed to sign the taxpayer's declaration, declaring that all the information he had given was true and correct and advised Mr Samuel of that fact.
48During the period between 29 November 2006 and 7 December 2006 Mr Milne signed the taxpayer's declaration on each tax return and returned them to Grant Thornton for lodgement with the Australian Taxation Office.
The facts upon which Mr Milne was sentenced by Johnson J on Count 2 on the indictment 
49The second count on the indictment at trial was in the following terms:Michael John Milne on or about 13 November 2006 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did, with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth, cause to be lodged an income tax return in the name of Barat Advisory for the year ending 30 June 2005 containing false information, namely that the net capital gain from the sale of shares in Admerex Limited was $4,597.00
50In his remarks on sentence (R (Cth) v Milne (No. 6) [2010] NSWSC 1467) Johnson J made the following findings of fact for sentencing purposes on that count: [177] The verdict of guilty in relation to the second count means that the jury was satisfied that the Offender dishonestly failed to include the capital gain from the disposal of the 48 Million Admerex shares in the income tax return of Barat Advisory for the year ended 30 June 2005. It follows that the Offender was found to have deliberately withheld information from the Grant Thornton accountants, notwithstanding the various efforts made by them to ascertain the facts relating to the financial dealings of the Offender and Barat Advisory, and the true circumstances surrounding the disposal of the 48 Million Admerex shares, in order to avoid the payment by Barat Advisory of capital gains tax. 
[178] The Offender intended to obtain a gain for Barat Advisory from the Commonwealth, by Barat Advisory keeping the capital gain derived from the disposal of 48 Million Admerex shares, and by Barat Advisory, not paying tax on that capital gain. 
[179] The jury was directed (Trial MFI40, paragraph 48) that the Crown must prove that the inference that the Offender acted dishonestly by deliberately not telling the accountants this information was the only reasonable inference available from the evidence, and that it was not sufficient for the Crown to prove that any omission or failure by the Offender to provide this information to the accountants was inadvertent or negligent or was based on an honest belief that he was entitled to rely on the advice of Ms Harley. 
[180] Accordingly, the jury's verdict leads to the stark conclusion that the conduct of the Offender in his dealings with the Grant Thornton accountants, over a period of months, was dishonest and deliberate, culminating in the signing by the Offender of the relevant return, to be lodged with the ATO, containing that false statement. 
[181] The dishonest statement was false in a gross respect in that the net capital gain from the sale of the Admerex shares was not $4,597.00, but a sum of at least $6.5 million.
Was the offending part of the one course of criminal offending?
51Unlike the situation in the proceedings before Johnson J where the Crown accepted that that there was some overlap in the criminal offending across the two counts on the indictment and, for that reason, there was a need to guard against the risk of double punishment (see [182]-[198] of his Honour's sentencing remarks), the conduct comprehended by the second count on the indictment before his Honour, and the conduct comprehended by the count to which Mr Milne entered a plea of guilty before me, does not overlap in that sense.  Separate offences were committed, albeit within weeks of each other, when four separate tax returns were lodged, three in Mr Milne's name and one in the name of the company he controlled.  That does not mean, however, that the separate offences might not be viewed as part of one episode of criminal offending.  It is necessary to identify such similarities and differences as are discernible between the offences, and the context in which they were committed, in order to resolve that question.  
52The offence with which I am concerned is characterised by Mr Milne acting dishonestly by deliberately failing to include in the personal income tax returns he prepared for lodgement, income in the total amount of almost $1 million from which he stood to gain directly by not having income tax levied against it.  By contrast, as his Honour's findings make clear, the second count on the indictment at trial involved the deliberate provision of false information to Mr Milne's accountants concerning the disposal of Admerex shares with the joint objective of minimising the payment by the company of capital gains tax and securing a financial gain for the company over which he exercised control.  In addition, although Mr Milne utilised the financial and accounting services of Grant Thornton for tax advice both on his own behalf and on behalf of his company (at least in part, in an attempt to conceal and facilitate his criminal objectives), because the accountants were apparently alive to the risk that he was not providing them with accurate information about his personal tax affairs they declined to prepare his personal tax returns.  In contrast, they were actively deceived by him into preparing the false return for the company.  
53Despite obvious differences in the particulars of charge and the precise mechanisms by which the offences were committed, I am satisfied that Mr Milne's dishonest dealings with his accountants from August 2005 to December 2006 (by which time each of the four tax returns were prepared and advice given in preparation for their lodgement), was part of the one course of criminal conduct, constituted by his deliberate dishonesty in causing to be lodged tax returns containing false information.  Were his personal tax returns lodged at a time proximate to the financial years ended June 2000, June 2001 and June 2005, and the company tax return also lodged relative to the 2005 tax year in which the Admerex shares were traded, I would likely have come to a different conclusion.  However, where, as here, the criminal conduct in offending against the revenue attaches to the time the tax returns were lodged, and where they were lodged within weeks of each other, I am satisfied the offending can be fairly described as comprehended by a single, albeit episodic, course of criminal conduct.  
54That does not dictate that a wholly concurrent sentences should be imposed or an order confirming the existing non-parole period should be made.  In the absence of any general rule that determines how sentences for multiple offences are to be served (see R v SBR [2012] NSWCCA 233 at [24]), the critical question in this case is whether, after determining upon an appropriate sentence in accordance with the legislative scheme in Part 1B of the Crimes Act (Cth), I am satisfied that the subject offending is sufficiently accounted for in the sentence imposed by Johnson J or, to put it another way, whether I am satisfied that the existing sentence embraces the total criminality involved across the course of offending in breach of s 135.1(1) of the Code.  If it does not, the sentencing discretion would miscarry were the sentences to be served concurrently (see R v AEM Snr; KEM; MM [2002] NSWCCA 58).
55Mr Dhanji submitted, and I accept, that it is not to the point to postulate what Johnson J would have done were his Honour to have sentenced Mr Milne should pleas of guilty have been entered to some or all of the charges on the second indictment, if for no other reason than different sentencing considerations intrude in this sentencing process.  What Mr Dhanji did submit was that the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour (that is, a sentence of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months) was of sufficient severity that there is little room for a further penalty to be imposed two years in to his existing sentence.  He relied upon a number of decisions of this Court where it was held to be within the discretion of a sentencing judge to impose a sentence of imprisonment for a later offence which did not extend an existing sentence.  
56In R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481 the respondent was serving a sentence of 22 years with a non-parole period of 13 years for multiple aggravated sexual assault offences.  He was subsequently convicted of a single count of sexual assault without consent of a child under 16 years and sentenced to a fixed term of 1 year that was ordered to be served wholly concurrently with his existing sentence.  The Crown appeal was dismissed.  The Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) said at [14]:There will be cases, of which, in Hidden J's opinion, this was one, where the criminality of offences committed by an offender is so great and the punishment imposed for those sentences is justifiably so harsh in order to reflect that criminality that there is little, or no, room for a further penalty to be imposed upon the offender to achieve an appropriate purpose of punishment in the circumstances of the particular case.  In the present case those circumstances included the relatively low criminality involved in the offence on the indictment having regard to the relationship between the applicant and the complainant, the age differential between them and the fact that intercourse was consensual.  It was also a highly relevant matter than any further actual punishment could not take effect until the expiration of the non-parole period fixed by Sully J some 15 years after the offences were committed.
57Their Honours continued at [18]:In light of the seriousness of the offences for which the respondent was sentenced by Sully J and the length of the sentences imposed upon him in order to promote the purposes of punishment in relation to those crimes, it was well within the discretion of Hidden J to determine that the principle of totality required him to order that the sentence for the offence before him be served completely concurrently with the sentences imposed by Sully J so as not to increase the period to be served by the respondent before he might be released to parole in 2015.
58Mr Dhanji also submitted that because the amount of unpaid tax in the amount of $415,474.89 represents approximately 20 per cent of the unpaid tax the subject of the second count on the indictment at trial - which was between $1.9 million and $2.4 million - or within the range of uncertainty between those two figures, the approach taken in R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [32] provides an additional basis for the imposition of a concurrent sentence.  
59The accused in that case (the respondent on the appeal) was charged with three offences contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act where, as a director of a body corporate, he presented false invoices with intent to defraud.  The total amount defrauded was $4.7 million.  The victim of the fraud was a finance company.  The offences were committed on separate occasions over a period of some months as part of a planned course of deception using forged documents and false statutory declarations.  The first offence concerned an amount of $787,000, the second $3.38 million and the third $315,392.  These funds were used in an attempt to restore a failing business operated by the respondent which ultimately went into voluntary liquidation with debts totalling over $18 million.  Against a statutory maximum of 10 years imprisonment the sentencing judge imposed concurrent sentences of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to be served by way of periodic detention.  The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the order for service of the sentence by periodic detention but rejected the Crown's submission that there was error in the order that the sentences be served concurrently.  As to that question, in Scott Howie J (with whom Grove and Barr JJ agreed) said at [32]:... In the present case, because the three offences were similar in the type of criminal conduct employed, they were part of a single course of conduct and because the Suncorp offence [the second count] was by far the most serious in that involved almost three quarters of the total amount of the loss occasioned by the offences, there was no error in the Judge determining that the sentence for the second count could embrace the total criminality of the three counts. If there were any error in this regard, it could only be that his Honour thought that 5 years was appropriate for each of the offences despite the considerable difference in the amount of money defrauded.
60Finally, in relation to the issue of totality, Mr Dhanji submitted that the impact of any extension to Mr Milne's existing sentence after a considerable part of the non-parole period has been served, is liable to have a disproportionate impact upon him which also justifies an order for concurrency.  In R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) said at [16]:The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship.  That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence.  As Malcolm CJ said in R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306:... the severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of the sentence.  Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year.  Similarly, while a sentence of seven years may be appropriate for one set of offences and a sentence of eight years may be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation.  Where both sets were committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences.
Part 1B of the Crimes Act (Cth)Section 16A(1)
61Section 16A(1) of the Crimes Act (Cth) requires me to impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.  There was no dissent by Mr Dhanji from the proposition that in the sentence to be imposed in this case appropriate weight must be given to the principle of general deterrence.  As the High Court recognised in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [63], a deliberate fraud on the revenue is a serious offence that affects the entire community such that a punitive and deterrent penalty should be reflected both in the imposition of a head sentence and the determination of the period of imprisonment an offender must serve in custody.  In Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24 at [296], the Court referred with approval to Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Gregory [2011] VSCA 145; 211 A Crim R 147 where the Victorian Court of Appeal (Warren CJ, Redlich JA and Ross AJA) stated at [57]:A sentence imposed for fraud upon the taxation revenue is intended to reaffirm basic community values that all citizens according to their means should fairly share the burden of the incidence of taxation so as to enable government to provide for the community, that the revenue must accordingly be protected and that the offender should be censured through manifest denunciation. When these considerations are not reflected in the responses of the courts, the criminal justice system fails to achieve its objectives.
62Where, as here, I am satisfied that Mr Milne was motivated by personal greed; where his conduct in causing the false tax returns to be lodged was planned, deliberate and deceitful, and where the tax evaded cannot on any view be described as insignificant, I am unable to conclude otherwise than that his offending is objectively serious.  Although the need for the sentence in those circumstances to reflect general deterrence might be sufficiently reflected in the sentence imposed, with the question of how it is to be served directed to other considerations, some of which constrain the sentencing exercise in this case, the need for the sentence to denounce Mr Milne's offending and to punish him for it cannot be overlooked.
63The Crown also invited me to take into account in the assessment of objective seriousness the length of time during which the income earning activity took place; the fact that the payments arose from what counsel described as ""related party consultancy transactions"" and the fact that the income was paid into offshore bank accounts which helped conceal the fact that the payments had been made and received.  While those features of the offending are of some contextual relevance, they do not, in my view, add materially to the objective seriousness of the offending constituted by Mr Milne's lodgement of three deliberately false income tax returns.  For avoidance of doubt, I am not able to conclude to the criminal standard that his income earning activities as a consultant over five years was undertaken with the intention that it would not ultimately be declared or that he set up a structure within which to perpetrate a deliberate fraud on the revenue at that time.  That said, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of receiving the income, and at all times thereafter, he was in no doubt that the payments received from Talisman and Admerex arose from personal exertion on his part and were declarable as income and that as at the date of lodgement of the returns he was being deliberately dishonest in failing to declare that fact.
Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth)
64Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth) requires me, in addition to any other matters that may have a particular bearing on sentence, to take into account certain specified matters to the extent that they are relevant and have application in the sentencing process.  Some of the itemised matters in s 16A(2)(a)-(p) might loosely be described as bearing upon an offender's subjective circumstances whilst others focus on the offence itself.  
65Dealing first with those matters material to the offence, s 16A(2)(a) requires me to take into account its nature and the circumstances of its commission.  These are reflected in the findings of fact I have made above and I do not repeat them save as to emphasise that the offending constituted a serious breach of Mr Milne's obligation as a tax payer to share the burden of tax for the benefit of the common good.  
66Section 16A(2)(c) of the Crimes Act (Cth) requires me to consider whether the offence forms part of a course of conduct, consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character, and, if so, to take into account that course of conduct.  For the reasons expressed above, I regard the offending constituted by the filing of deliberately false personal income tax returns as part of a course of conduct which included lodging a deliberately false income tax return in the name of Barat Advisory a few weeks earlier.  
67The principles in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, and the many authorities that have confirmed its application, require me to impose a sentence for the subject offending which properly reflects all relevant considerations before questions of concurrency or accumulation arise, and this is so whether or not the offences represent discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality and whether the sentences are imposed at the same or different times.  In addition, sentences must bear a proper relationship to each other having regard to their different degrees of criminality.  I acknowledge the sentence to be imposed in relation to the present offence must bear a proper relationship to the sentence on the second count at trial, in particular, given the differences in quantum and the relative lack of sophistication in the offence with which I am concerned, as compared to the high degree of sophistication in the mechanisms employed by Mr Milne in committing the offence he was convicted of at trial.  In that regard I note Johnson J made the following findings:I accept that, in this case, the Offender utilised the advantages of his considerable resources, experience and expertise in business and finance, and established and misused a sophisticated offshore structure for the specific purpose of avoiding payment by Barat Advisory of a substantial amount of tax.  This course of conduct commenced in June 2004 and continued until November 2006.  (At [257]).
The Offender's course of criminal conduct may be characterised appropriately as being planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation a sustained period of deception by the Offender of the Grant Thornton accountants, culminating in the operative lie to the ATO contained in the Barat Advisory tax return filed in November 2006.  (At [247]).
68Section 16A(2)(e) of the Crimes Act (Cth) requires that I take into account any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence.  The loss to the revenue of the amount of $415,474.89 is substantial.  Mr Dhanji did not submit otherwise.  
69Section 16A(2)(j) requires me to take into account the deterrent effect that any sentence may have on Mr Milne and s 16A(2)(k) the need to ensure that he is adequately punished for the offence.  In light of the sentence he is currently serving (in the imposition of which Johnson J took account of the need for specific deterrence) I propose to give the need for the sentence I impose to deter him from further offending only minimal weight.  He has 2 years and 9 months to serve on his existing non-parole period before he will be eligible for release to parole at which time he will be 60 years of age.  Although he may still earn an assessable income upon his release, he is unlikely to take the risk of a further fraud of the revenue by under declaring that income or other offences of dishonesty.  The more significant consideration is to ensure the sentence imposed satisfies the legislative requirement that the sentence is sufficiently punitive in keeping with the overwhelming weight of authority to similar effect.  
70There was no material before his Honour and no material in the proceedings before me indicative of any expression of contrition or remorse.  I do not regard the consent orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in September of this year as indicative of any contrition on Mr Milne's part as may have been the case were he to have offered to make good the loss to the revenue by this offending, irrespective of whether proceedings were commenced against him for a pecuniary penalty order.  Moreover, save only to the extent that the consent orders might reflect cooperation on his part, s 320 of the Proceeds of Crime Act (Cth) expressly prohibits regard being given to the making of the pecuniary penalty order when passing sentence or its terms.  As to that question I accord minimal weight to the fact that consent orders were entered as reflecting any genuine willingness on Mr Milne's part to cooperate with the authorities given the date of lodgement of those proceedings and their ultimate resolution.  (I note Johnson J took the then pending proceedings into account in Mr Milne's favour as he was entitled to since orders had not been made at the time of sentence.)
71As I indicated earlier in these reasons, Mr Milne's subjective circumstances in December 2010 differ only from his subjective circumstances in this sentence proceeding by reason of his having been a serving prisoner over the last two years, a state of affairs which has, predictably enough, impacted on him most directly and on his family indirectly.
72The testimonials tendered before his Honour and identified by him at paragraph [200] (which, as I have noted, were also tendered before me) were supplemented in the proceeding before me only by a letter dated 30 November 2012 from Mrs Milne directed to her current circumstances, and those of their children, and what she claims to be the added hardship she will suffer were her husband's release date redetermined.  
73In addition to the personal testimonial Dr Hampshire prepared for the purpose of the earlier sentence proceedings, he prepared a forensic report for these proceedings directed to Mr Milne's current mental functioning and mental health which, as I noted earlier, the Crown submitted should not be afforded the weight that might otherwise attach to a report from a consulting psychiatrist in sentence proceedings.  I do not regard the current or past restrictions on Dr Hampshire's practice as a consultant psychiatrist as undermining the weight of his professional opinion.  The Crown did not submit that Dr Hampshire's relationship with Mr Milne (both predating the offences and continuing to the date of the report) had any material bearing on the weight I should give his evidence.  In the body of his report Dr Hampshire acknowledged his friendship of long standing with Mr Milne and his family and, for that reason, that the report was not wholly impartial.  He went on to say, however, that he had self consciously straddled what he described as ""the difficult world of writing an accurate and honest forensic psychiatric report for someone that I know and have known prior to the charges and have had as a friend"".
74In his evidence in chief he was asked the following question:In terms of the prior relationship that you had with Mr Milne are you able to tell us how that, if it did at all, impacted on your capacity to write a report of this nature?
75After describing Mr Milne as a person who was somewhat guarded when speaking of his ""inner world"", Dr Hampshire said: Do I think I was disadvantaged by knowing him previously?  No.  It is different seeing someone for a one-off consultation and seeing a friend as a therapist, that would be difficult.  If anything I felt that advantaged him in his trust.  I hope I have done my best to him in what I have written.
Dr Hampshire's report and evidence
76Dr Hampshire's report dated 28 November 2012 was prepared on the basis of a consultation with Mr Milne on the day of the report and from his visits with him on two earlier occasions, at Mrs Milne's request, because of her concerns about her husband's mental health.  
77In the course of the consultation, and having regard to Dr Hampshire's full appreciation of the factual matrix preceding Mr Milne's incarceration and the impact on his family after that date, he noted that Mr Milne was markedly thinner having lost approximately 20 kilograms; that he was unshaven and malodorous; that he spoke in a monotone and had a significant psychomotor retardation.  Although there was no evidence of formal thought disorder, Dr Hampshire reported that his affect was flat and blunt but his cognitive testing remained within normal limits.  
78Dr Hampshire concluded the following diagnoses were available utilising DSM IV TR Operational Criteria: (i)  Recurrent panic attacks, which have their origins in a very serious motor vehicle accident Mr Milne suffered when he was 30 years of age, having triggered a post-traumatic stress disorder with fears associated with being confined in the relatively airless environment of police transit vans; and(ii)  A major depressive disorder.
79Dr Hampshire did not suggest that there was any risk of further decompensation or any aggravation of Mr Milne's mental health or functioning because of his custodial environment although he did opine that Mr Milne is at risk of an overvalued idea of suffering physical harm in prison which, coupled with other thought patterns which he holds with ""unshakeable conviction"", does suggest that they may be delusions of a paranoid type connected with the related diagnosis of a severe depressive illness, as to which he reported as follows:This man is suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder (and recurrent Panic Attacks) using the DSM IV TR Operational Criteria.  His depression warrants pharmacotherapy at the least, and in my opinion whilst he remains incarcerated he should be reviewed by the Forensic Psychiatric Department at Long Bay Hospital with a view to admission since there may be a psychotic element to his depression, however he would not accept this form of therapy and a schedule would not be effective or operational unless he were to become frankly psychotic.
80He concluded, in summary:Mr Milne's incarceration appears to have had a marked detrimental effect on his psychological health which appears to have worsened in the last six months to the state that he now has a Major Depressive Disorder with pre-psychotic features and an increased fear of but not frequency of Panic Attacks...
81In considering the interrelationship between Mr Milne's, character, age and antecedents in s 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act (Cth) for sentencing purposes, I have both different evidence from that which was before his Honour, in particular on the issue of Mr Milne's mental health.  I have also come to a different view on the question of the significance of what I am prepared to regard as his prior good character despite the fact that he comes before me as a convicted person.  Unlike his Honour's findings at [217]-[221], I am not persuaded that Mr Milne's good character either enabled him to commit the fraud on the revenue perpetrated in his own name or that it rendered its commission any easier or less liable to detection.  On the other hand, the predominant need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence does displace, to some degree, the advantage he can claim by his previous good character.  
82I accept, as did his Honour, that prior to his arrest and over the course of his professional life Mr Milne was a hard-working businessman who provided well for his family and who was regarded by many in the business world as honest and honourable.  Although, as I have noted, there is no evidence before me of Mr Milne's rehabilitative progress over the past two years, I do not come to any different view to that of his Honour as to Mr Milne's ultimate prospects of rehabilitation as he progresses through the balance of his sentence.  I also accept that there is no prospect of his reoffending upon his eventual release given his age and life circumstances.  These findings will be taken into account on sentence in his favour.  
83Section 16A(2)(n) of the Crimes Act (Cth) requires me to take into account the probable effect that any sentence under consideration would have upon an offender's family or dependents.  As Johnson J observed at [223], and as I expressly endorse, ""it is the regrettable and almost invariable consequence of the imprisonment of a father that adverse consequences will result to his family from that imprisonment"".  His Honour went on to note that at common law the hardship experienced by family members as a result of imprisonment of an offender must be exceptional before it can be given substantial weight, a requirement that has been held to apply in the case of Commonwealth offenders (see R v Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369; 166 A Crim R 124).
84In Mrs Milne's letter dated 30 November 2012 she details the hardship which she and her children have suffered over the last two years including that Mr Milne has missed his daughter's 18th birthday and his son's 21st birthday.  She expresses concern about the impact of her husband's criminal convictions and imprisonment on her daughter's tertiary education, in particular her poor academic performance culminating in her decision to defer her studies, and the difficulty she has found in finding meaningful work since that time.  (I note in Dr Hampshire's report that he has referred Mrs Milne's daughter to a colleague who treats her with a neuroleptic medication for a syndrome which he suggested may include a differential diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.  There is nothing to indicate that this referral postdated Mr Milne's conviction or that her condition has been aggravated by his current circumstances.)  Mrs Milne also says that the pressure she has been subject to over the criminal and related proceedings have had a ""huge psychological effect"" necessitating psychiatric care.  (In Dr Hampshire's report, he refers to Mrs Milne's increasing insomnia and that he has prescribed her sedatives.  That is the only evidence suggestive of the need for psychiatric care.)  Mrs Milne's son who was enrolled at Bond University until his father was sentenced has also abandoned his studies in order to support himself and to contribute financially to the family.  Mrs Milne has re-entered the workforce and has secured some part-time work but is finding her changed financial circumstances difficult to adjust to and, as a consequence, has had to borrow money from family and friends.  She also sets out in some detail the impact of the forfeiture proceedings brought by the Commonwealth against her as the second defendant to those proceedings.  While this has doubtless been productive of hardship in a material sense, it has little weight on the sentence to be imposed for her husband's offending.  Mrs Milne expresses particular concern that her husband may be reclassified within the prison system if his non-parole period is extended and her concern at how he and the family will cope both mentally and physically were he to face a longer prison sentence.
85I accept that there would inevitably be an adverse effect on Mrs Milne and her children were there any extension of his non-parole period, if for no other reason than their lives are, in some sense, on hold until his release and the family can make decisions as to their future as a family unit.  I also accept that after the imposition of the sentence by Johnson J the family appears to have proceeded on the assumption that the non-parole period his Honour imposed would likely see Mr Milne's release from custody at the expiration of that period.  It must be said, however, that with the resolution of other criminal proceedings pending at that time and with no suggestion that the prosecution would not proceed at a later time, that expectation was necessarily a qualified one.  Nonetheless, I take into account that the hardship suffered by Mr Milne's family, which his Honour acknowledged at the earlier sentence proceedings as ""substantial"", has materialised and that the effect of an extension to his period in custody will render that hardship more acute. 
The plea of guilty 
86Given the lateness of the plea, after all necessary preparations and arrangements for a trial were well underway (albeit is an abbreviated manner), and what the Crown submitted was a certain inevitability in convictions resulting from a jury trial and Mr Milne's likely recognition of that fact, the plea of guilty does not significantly mitigate the sentence to be imposed in this case.  Mr Dhanji sought to persuade me that the lateness of the plea was as a result of charge negotiations which the Crown engaged in at a late stage of proceedings after he was briefed and had the opportunity to review the evidence and render advice to his client.  He submitted that it would not have been reasonable for Mr Milne to have entered a plea at any earlier stage where he would have suffered the forensic prejudice of pleading guilty to six counts and being exposed by that to a penalty for at least two counts which have not been the subject of the rolled up charge.  Although I am not satisfied that the plea of guilty reflects, unambiguously, Mr Milne's willingness to facilitate the course of justice, instructing his lawyer to engage in plea negotiations which were ultimately productive of the Crown abandoning altogether two of the substantive counts on which he was arraigned, with the plea of guilty being entered to a rolled up count, will attract a reduction in sentence which, it being a Commonwealth offence, I am not required to quantify (see Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247; 173 A Crim R 458).  I will also take into account his willingness to shorten the length of trial in the event that charge negotiations were unsuccessful.
Determination of an appropriate sentence
87The maximum penalty for an offence against s 135.1(1) of the Code is 5 years.  Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, Mr Milne's subjective circumstances, in particular his compromised mental health; other matters in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth) to which I have made express reference including the issue of proportionality and the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence and contain a measure of punishment, I impose a sentence of 2 years imprisonment. 
88In coming to that determination I have considered comparative sentences in schedules prepared by the Crown, however the somewhat unique circumstances that arise in this sentence proceeding have meant that they are a very general guide only.
89Despite the length of the effective sentence of 8 years and 6 months imposed almost two years ago, I consider that there remains scope for a further penalty to be imposed for the subject offending and that partial accumulation is warranted.  In my view, it cannot be fairly said that the sentences imposed by Johnson J, either individually or after accumulation, were ""so harsh"" that there is no scope for the sentence I must impose to meet the dictates of punishment or that the existing sentence embraces Mr Milne's total proved and admitted criminality.  I am fortified in that view by the consideration given to the sentence by the Court of Criminal Appeal in dismissing the sentence appeal:[298]  In determining the sentences for each count, the structure of the sentences and the non-parole period, the trial judge here gave consideration to the relevant principles to which we have made reference. In addition, his Honour carefully assessed the actions of the appellant, the duration of those actions and the degree of separate criminality involved in each offence (paragraphs 257-262 ROS).  Applying the correct principles to those matters, the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant's conduct involved serious criminality and that his offences should be characterised as ""serious examples of money laundering and tax evasion"" (263 ROS).  The trial judge took into account the maximum penalties involved and the subjective circumstances of the offender together with other matters outlined in the sentencing decision. 
[299]  We conclude that the sentences imposed by his Honour in all their manifestations were open to him and that they were not manifestly excessive.  We also consider that the structure of the sentences was one that was open to his Honour to make, having regard to all the matters we have discussed. 
90Applying principles of totality in the context of the delay occasioned by the need to prosecute Mr Milne in two separate curial processes, and after taking into account the existing non-parole period as I am required to do under s 19AD(2)(a) of the Crimes Act (Cth) and reflecting again on the nature of the offence and his antecedents, I am satisfied that accumulation of one year on the existing sentence is appropriate and a new single non-parole period should be fixed.  
91It is necessary to fix a new non-parole period (as provided for in s 19AD(2)(c) of the Crimes Act (Cth) as the revised minimum period Mr Milne is to spend in custody to reflect the deterrent and punitive objectives of sentencing moderated by the combined weight of his subjective circumstances, including his current psychiatric condition, as a serving prisoner.
92Michael John Milne I sentence you to imprisonment for 2 years to date from 17 June 2018 and to expire on 16 June 2020.  That will result in an effective sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 6 months for all of the offending that has been prosecuted on indictment at trial and in the sentence proceedings before me.  I fix a new non-parole period of 5 years to date from 17 December 2010 and to expire on 16 December 2015.
93I am conscious that I have disturbed the ratio between head sentence and non-parole period imposed by Johnson J.  The relatively modest extension to the non-parole period is in recognition of the interrelated impact of delay and the need to apply principles of totality in the context of a sentence imposed two years ago.
94I am required by law to explain to you the effect of this sentencing order.  The effect of the order I have made is that you will serve a period of imprisonment of not less than 5 years, that is, three months more than the 4 years and 9 months Johnson J imposed on 17 December 2010 with a period under supervision in the community to follow upon your release from custody.  As Johnson J informed you:If a parole order is made, it will be subject to conditions, and it may be amended or revoked. In particular, it may be revoked if you fail without reasonable excuse to fulfil those conditions, in which event you may be returned into custody, pending further review and possible re-release, depending upon your behaviour and response to any rehabilitation opportunities which may be offered whilst you are in custody.

		25 January 2013",2012-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760701,Kuehne v R; Humphries M v R; Humphries A v R [2012] NSWCCA 270,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Fullerton J in draft.  I agree with her Honour's conclusion that the nature of relevant evidence did not justify the ""consciousness of guilt"" direction given by the trial judge and for that reason there has been a miscarriage of justice.  However, in those circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider whether the ""consciousness of guilt direction"" had the effect of infringing the appellant's right to silence and for that reason gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.  I would prefer to reserve my opinion on that issue for an occasion when it must be decided.
2I also agree with the reasons of Latham J.
3I agree with Fullerton J that the appeal should be upheld and a verdict of acquittal should be entered in relation to each of the appellants.  However, as her Honour explains the circumstances of this case are unusual.  A decision as to the appropriate order in any other case will depend upon the particular circumstances of that case.
4LATHAM J:  I have had the considerable advantage of reading Fullerton J's judgment in draft.  I gratefully adopt her Honour's summary of the evidence and the trial process.  I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour and with her Honour's reasons with respect to the impugned direction.  I prefer to express no view with respect to the alleged infringement of the appellants' right to silence.  The disposition of the appeal turns upon a fundamental confusion generated in the trial between the credibility of the account given by the appellants in their respective interviews with police on the one hand, and the legitimate inferences that could be drawn from a combination of circumstances on the other.
5As Fullerton J has noted, the Crown's submission at trial when the question of a consciousness of guilt direction was first raised was that such an inference could be drawn from the combination of a number of circumstances, including the absence of each appellant from their usual place of residence for a period of days after the incident, their presentation to the police together on the same day and their respective uniform accounts of being assaulted by the complainants.  The submission was that, rather than make a timely complaint to police about serious assaults committed upon them, their conduct supported the conclusion that the appellants had jointly manufactured their account.  So much might be accepted.  However, the next step in the Crown's submission, that these circumstances legitimately gave rise to an inference that the appellants acted as they did and said what they said to police out of a consciousness of guilt, ought to have been rejected by the trial judge.
6As I observed in McKey, the categories of post offence conduct that have been recognised as legitimate indicia of a consciousness of guilt are not closed, but before any post offence conduct can so qualify, it must bear a particular character.  It must be capable of constituting an admission against interest.  It must be capable of meeting the conditions analogous to those discussed in Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 applying to lies.  The relevant conduct must be precisely identified and proved by evidence, it must be concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence and it must be carried out in circumstances in which the explanation for the conduct is a realisation of guilt on the part of the accused.  The type of conduct referred to in McKey, such as flight, destruction of evidence and attempts to influence witnesses, meet all of those conditions.
7In this case, even assuming that the Crown had pressed the whole of the circumstances surrounding the appellants' conduct in support of consciousness of guilt reasoning (which was not done in the closing address), the appellants' conduct was not capable of constituting an implied admission.  To the contrary, it was the essence of their defence at trial.  Whether the jury accepted their explanation for the delay in going to the police was a matter that went to the credibility of their account generally, but a consciousness of guilt direction potentially converted their defence into a plank in the prosecution case and thereby deprived it of appropriate consideration by the jury.
8For these reasons, the trial fundamentally miscarried.
9FULLERTON J:  Each of the appellants Mark Humphries, Arthur Humphries and Anthony Kuehne, appeal their conviction following a trial in the District Court on a charge laid under s 111(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 that on 31 July 2009 they broke and entered a house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation, in circumstances of aggravation in that they were armed with a pistol. 
10Mark Humphries also appeals his conviction on a charge that he fired the pistol in a manner likely to endanger the safety of Jason Hill, an occupant of the house, contrary to s 93G(1)(c) of the Crimes Act. 
11Anthony Kuehne was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment to date from 12 October 2010 with a non-parole period of 2 years to expire on 11 October 2012.  He was released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.  Arthur Humphries was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment commencing on 24 December 2009 with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring on 23 December 2012.  Mark Humphries received a total effective sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 19 December 2014.   
12There is no application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on any of the appellants.  
The afternoon and early evening of 30 July 2009
13The house allegedly broken into was the home of Justin Ryan and his partner, Joanne Ewart.  They had both attended the funeral of Mr Ryan's aunt earlier that day with various friends and family members including Steven Cuthbert, the deceased's son, and Jason Hill, one of his cousins.  A wake was held at Mr Cuthbert's house.  In the early evening a number of people, including Steven Cuthbert, Justin Ryan, Joanne Ewart and their adult daughter Kristy, went to a nearby hotel where Mr Cuthbert became involved in a fight with a hotel patron.  It was common ground that he was heavily intoxicated and that security personnel intervened.  The appellants Arthur Humphries and Anthony Kuehne, who were drinking at the hotel, informed security staff that Steven Cuthbert's behaviour was likely explained by his recent bereavement and offered to drive him home.  Arthur Humphries and Steven Cuthbert had been friends when they were teenagers.  He told police he also knew Arthur's brother, Mark Humphries, and knew of his brother Anthony Kuehne.
14Some time later on 31 July Steven Cuthbert returned to the hotel and became involved in another fight.  The appellants Arthur Humphries and Anthony Kuehne interceded on his behalf a second time.  On this occasion they drove him to Justin Ryan's home in a car Arthur Humphries had borrowed from a friend, Natalie Chambers, earlier in the day.  Justin Ryan and his partner left the hotel at the same time.  Arthur Humphries dropped Steven Cuthbert's partner, Laura Ferguson, at his mother's house on the way to collect their children before he drove to Mr Ryan's home.  Jason Hill and Ray Thompson, another of Steven Cuthbert's cousins, were already at the house.  They had also attended the wake and the hotel earlier that evening.  Aside from Laura Ferguson, all the people at the house at the time of the incident were intoxicated. 
The fight in the kitchen at Justin Ryan's house 
15It was common ground that the appellants Arthur Humphries and Anthony Kuehne were invited inside by Steven Cuthbert.  There was, however, an issue as to whether Justin Ryan had agreed that anyone should be invited back to his house after the group left the hotel.  He gave evidence that he did not know either of the appellants and had not seen them at the hotel earlier.  Other evidence suggested that he had not only seen them but had taken offence then at what he believed was Anthony Keuhne's interest in female members of his family. 
16Whilst a number of the occupants of the house were in the kitchen taking photographs, Justin Ryan punched Anthony Kuehne to the head with sufficient force that he fell (or almost fell) to the ground.  Arthur Humphries then became involved in the fight, apparently in defence of his brother.  Justin Ryan admitted punching Anthony Kuehne because of the attention he was paying to his partner, Ms Ewart, and his sister-in-law.     
17It was the prosecution case that Steven Cuthbert broke up the fight in the kitchen and told the appellants to leave.  He said they left but threatened to return.  He claimed that Arthur Humphries said, ""You hurt my brother, you hurt me.  We'll be back"".  
18Aside from Ms Ewart, who was not available to give evidence at the trial and whose statement given to police on the night was read to the jury with an accompanying warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995, the occupants of the house gave evidence denying that the fight in the kitchen moved to the front yard of the house; that anyone other than Justin Ryan was involved in the fight; that Arthur Humphries was assaulted with a shovel and the car he was driving was damaged; or that anyone in the house used or presented any weapons at any time.  
The appellants return and the pistol is discharged 
19It was the prosecution case that Arthur Humphries and Anthony Kuehne left the house after the fight and returned a short time later with their brother Mark who was armed with a gun.  Justin Ryan, Steven Cuthbert, Jason Hill and both Kristy and Laura Ferguson gave evidence to the general effect that the three appellants came into the house through the closed but not locked front door; that Arthur directed Justin Ryan outside; that in an attempt by some of the male occupants of the house to wrestle Mark Humphries to the ground the gun was discharged and that Jason Hill was shot in the stomach in the process.  
20Steven Cuthbert gave evidence that his forehead was split and his skull fractured when he was struck with the bottom of the gun when he tackled Mark Humphries.  He said that three shots were fired with the first two fired in quick succession and the third when he was struck by the butt of the gun.  Justin Ryan gave evidence that the gun was pointed at him as Mark Humphries came in through the door and that the gun was fired once.  He said that a couple of days later his partner found a bullet in the lounge room and a bullet hole in the wall which was given to police.  
21Laura Ferguson said the gun went off as it fell to the floor.  Ray Thompson gave similar evidence.  Jason Hill also gave evidence of hearing only one shot which he said hit his stomach although he do not realise it at the time only noticing a bruise on his stomach a couple of days later.  He said he did not notice he had been shot, he did not feel any pain or see any blood and did not tell police he had been shot until weeks later because he was drunk on 30 July and for the following two days.  He said he was being treated with morphine for ""something else"" which might have masked the pain.
22There was no medical evidence led at the trial confirming that the bruising to his stomach was consistent with a gunshot wound.  The shirt which he claimed was damaged when the bullet struck him was not analysed to confirm the presence of gunshot residue.  
The 000 calls
23In the 000 call placed on the night at 12.01am Joanne Ewart said that people had come into the house with a gun and that the gun was thrown on the ground and she had thrown a towel over it.  She said that three men, who she did not know, had turned up in a car that was parked out the front of her house.  She provided the registration number of the car and later said she had photographs of the men on her phone.  She said the men had come to the house after having drinks at the Bidwill Hotel and they had later returned with a gun.  She said that she was in her car when they pulled up behind her.  She said:[They] went in the front door, I heard a bang.  [They] come out, they turned around, there was a big punch on... The gun was dropped in the hallway and they were off.  The gunner ran... There was two others, but there was three guys...
24She said that there was also another shooter that was on the run; he ran up the street and was wearing a white jumper.  She said she put a shovel through the window of their car.  
25The 000 operator also spoke to Kristy Ferguson who said that the gun was discharged inside the house.  She later told the operator that there were ""three white guys"", two of whom ""walked through the house without us knowing"".  She said they were swearing.  She said it (the gun shot) ""just got my uncle...  My uncle screamed..."".  When asked by the operator if she knew whether anyone was shot she said:I don't know.  But when the gun went off, I heard my Mum scream, someone's been shot, and then when I got out there, when I went out there, I hear my Mum say my Dad got shot, my Dad got shot, Steven got shot, Steven got shot.  
(Kristy Ferguson's parents are Justin Ryan and Joanne Ewart.  Steven Cuthbert is her uncle.)
26Investigating police attended the house shortly after midnight and declared a crime scene.  They canvassed the area and spoke with neighbours, none of whom claimed they heard a gunshot, including two neighbours who also called 000, to report ""a brawl"" where people were armed with sticks, someone was being beaten and a car at the front of the house was being smashed. 
The police investigation 
27The crime scene officer who conducted a thorough investigation of the premises did not find a cartridge case, bullet fragments or any bullet impact damage.  A .22 single shot pistol of an unknown brand, with no visible serial number and with no cartridge in the chamber was given to police at the scene.  A ballistics expert gave evidence that some parts of the pistol were homemade and fitted to part of a commercially manufactured barrel.  Nonetheless, the pistol was in working order and capable of firing a single .22 calibre bullet, which had to be manually reloaded after each firing.  Under testing the cartridge only partially ejected from the chamber and jammed altogether on two of three tests.  
28The ballistics expert confirmed that the bullet handed to police some days after the incident had been fired from the pistol and, contrary to what he would have expected were the bullet to have impacted with a hard surface when discharged, it was not significantly damaged.  He considered the only scenario in which the undamaged bullet could have struck the body of a person without penetrating the skin would be if the ammunition had malfunctioned.  
29It was the Crown case that after the gun was discharged in the house the fight with the three appellants continued on to the front lawn by which time Anthony Kuehne had armed himself with a shovel (which Jason Hill said he was struck with) before a car collected the three men and drove away.  A shovel was found inside the house which was later subjected to forensic testing which confirmed the presence of Justin Ryan's DNA on the handle of the shovel.  His fingerprints were also detected on the front window of the car that Arthur Humphries was driving.  The DNA results were not available until after Justin Ryan had given evidence.  He was not available to be recalled. 
30Under cross-examination each of the principal Crown witnesses denied they had lied when they claimed the appellants returned to the house armed with a gun to cover up the fact that Justin Ryan's unprovoked attack on Anthony Kuehne in the kitchen got out of hand when other family members became involved resulting in Arthur Humphries being assaulted with a shovel and the car he was driving damaged with weapons of various kinds.  Justin Ryan denied that the pistol handed to police belonged to him or that the bullet he claimed to have found two days later was planted by him to incriminate the appellants.  Jason Hill denied that he joined with other Crown witnesses to give false evidence about being shot because he was concerned that he might be charged by police for his role in the events of the night.  
The cases for the accused
31The appellants did not give evidence at their trial.  They each relied on the accounts they gave police when they attended the police station on 5 August 2009 and they were arrested.  After being cautioned in conventional terms, they agreed to be interviewed.  During their respective interviews they were each invited to offer an explanation for the delay in informing police they were the victims of an assault by Justin Ryan and other members of his family five days earlier.  On the Crown's application, and over defence counsel's objection, the fact of delay was left to the jury as conduct capable of supporting an inference of guilt.  
Anthony Kuehne's ERISP 
32Anthony Kuehne described being assaulted in the kitchen after he was falsely accused of making unwanted advances towards Justin Ryan's partner and his sister-in-law.  He told police that he did not know the name of the man who first hit him.  He described him as tall, solid and Aboriginal.  (His brother, Arthur, also described the man in similar terms.  It was not in issue that they were describing Justin Ryan.)  He said the fist fight progressed into the front yard where other occupants of the house armed themselves with makeshift weapons, including a shovel and iron bars.  He said his brother, Mark, was driving down the street with his wife and child when he saw the fight.  He said at that time he was fighting in defence of himself and his brother, Arthur.  He said Mark did not have a gun when he arrived and he did not hear any guns being discharged. 
33He said he was punched and hit on the back of the head and in the ribs but was not hit with any weapon.  He sustained a black eye, a graze under his eye (which he claimed had healed) and a lump behind his ear.  He said his brother Arthur's mouth was ""busted"", that he had missing teeth, a black eye, chipped tooth and bruises on his ribs and arms. 
34Anthony told police that he stayed away from his home after the incident because he was frightened of repercussions.  He said he had heard that ""[Justin Ryan] and all his cousins and all the Kooris in Mount Druitt are arming up and they're coming looking for us"".  He said that although he had received a beating from the people in the house, he said when incidents like that happen, ""I don't ring the police or get the police involved"".  When he was asked whether he thought of calling the police he said, ""Not really ... I don't call the cops and dob on people"".
Arthur Humphries' ERISP 
35Arthur Humphries told police that he intervened in the fight in the kitchen by offering to fight the person who had punched his brother.  He said as he was walking through the house on his way outside he was hit in the face with a shovel and then hit with a pole.  He said his teeth were knocked out and his bottom tooth went through his lip.  He said as he tried to get into the car that he had borrowed, someone smashed the windows.  He also said that his brother Mark, who lived around the corner, pulled up in a car and that he intervened in the fight and was also assaulted.  He said his brothers extracted themselves from the fight and were driven away by Mark's partner, leaving the car that he had driven to the house parked on the street in a damaged state.  He said that he drove past the house the next day but that the car was no longer there.  He said he informed Natalie Chambers that her car was missing and that some days later she told him that police wanted him for questioning over the incident.  
36He said he did not seek any medical attention because he did not believe in doctors.  He said he had never been to a doctor or taken medication in his life.  He said he did not think of going to the police to complain about being assaulted or the damage done to Ms Chambers' car.  He said, ""I'm not that sort of person.  I get jumped, I get bashed, I cop it on the chin ... I'm not a dog"".  He was also asked the following questions and gave the following answers:Q Did you think about calling the cops from Deborah's car just about your car?A No.  I don't think about that sort of thing.
Q Were you not worried about the ...A Like I said ... after I got bashed I'm a bit busted, a bit sore.
Q Yeah.A I couldn't drink so I just wanted to go home to my kids and lay down and try to eat and clean myself up a bit.

Q OK.  So ... this is maybe the fifth day since the incident.  Why has it taken five days for you to come in and see us?A 'Cause I only just heard from Nat, she owns the car, she said she was talking to the police or something saying, yeah, what's happened to my car, it's gone missing from this house.  She said one of the detectives turned around and said your car was used in a home invasion or something.  I said, ""What?  Used in a home invasion?""  'Cause she went off at me.  I said, ""Home invasion, I'm there drinking.""  I said, ""I got jumped out the front.""  I told you what happened.  She goes, ""Well, the police said they're looking for you.""  I said, ""Looking for me?  Right.  Well, I'll go walk in.""  I said, ""I've got nothing to hide.""
Mark Humphries' ERISP 
37Mark Humphries told police that he was at home with his partner when they left with their eight-week old infant to buy some nappies at a local service station.  He said his partner was driving toward the service station when he saw a fight in the front yard of a house in a neighbouring street and the car his brother had been driving earlier that night parked near the house.  He said he got out of the car and saw both his brothers on the veranda with seven to ten men beating them with shovels and other weapons.  He said he told his brother to get into the car, but that the group then turned on him and started to attack him so he told his partner to drive away.  He said he did not have a gun and did not hear a gun discharge but heard a bang associated with a car being struck.  He said when his partner came back he and his brothers somehow ended up in the car and they drove off.  
38He said he had loose teeth, a scrape on his side, bruises and scratches on his back, grazes on his legs, cuts and a black eye.  He did not seek medical attention because he did not have a family doctor and had not seen a doctor in years.  He was questioned as to why he did not inform the police earlier than 5 August and gave the following answers:Q Did you call the police?A No.
Q Why not?A Because I've never called the police.  I've never been one to call the police.  I've never told on anyone in my life and it's just never been in my culture to call the police.
Q Yeah.A Like...
Q Did you think for this, this occasion it might warrant it?A Um...
Q If what you're saying...A Yeah.
Q ...is that your brother's at a house and he's just getting absolutely flogged senseless...A Yeah.
Q Yeah.A I've never called the police in my life.
Q OK.A Like, it's something I just don't do.
39Other evidence bearing upon the issue of delay in reporting the incident was led in the Crown case.  Stacey Roach, a former partner of Anthony Kuehne, gave evidence that Anthony and Arthur Humphries came to her home in the middle of the night.  She said Anthony had blood on his face, and Arthur had a tooth missing, a cut in front of his mouth, bumps on his head, and blood on his face.  Arthur told her that he was hit in the face with a shovel during a fight.  She told him he needed to see a doctor.  She told Anthony to leave and that Arthur left with him.  Anthony told her he was going home.  Later, she phoned to make sure he had arrived home.  
40The following Saturday (2 August), she said Anthony telephoned her and asked if he and Arthur could stay with her.  They stayed for two nights.  She said the three appellants and Mark Humphries' partner, Deborah Baxter, came to her home the following week and that the decision was made to speak to police.
41Carina Archer confirmed that she was in a relationship with Anthony Keuhne at the time of the incident.  She said that on the morning of the incident she woke to find Anthony in bed but she did not know when he had arrived.  He had a scratch on his eye and told her he had been in a fight.  She said he did not stay long before leaving and saying that he was going to stay at Stacey's house.  She agreed that it was unusual for him to stay away from her house for long.
42On the night of the incident Steven Cuthbert told police where he understood the appellants were living.  For several days police attempted to locate the appellants without success.  Detective Sergeant Bayliss agreed that on 4 August he spoke with Deborah Baxter (Mark Humphries' partner) and asked her to pass on a message to the three appellants that police wanted to speak with them.  On 5 August he asked another person to pass on a message to the same effect.  At about 8.30pm that day the appellants attended Mt Druitt police station together.  They were arrested and agreed to be interviewed.
The grounds of appeal 
43Although grounds of appeal filed by each of the appellants were slightly differently worded, in essence it was jointly submitted on the hearing of the appeal that the trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge's direction that the delay of five days before the three appellants presented at the police station and gave their account of events may be used by the jury as evidence that they were conscious of their guilt of the offences charged.  
44The conflict between the evidence of the occupants of the house and the appellants' accounts to police (with evidence in the Crown case capable of both supporting and contradicting the competing versions) attracted a direction from the trial judge that were the jury to regard their accounts as a reasonably possible version of events they were entitled to be acquitted.  Her Honour did not, however, direct the jury that even were they to reject those accounts they would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of the Crown witnesses (that they returned to the house armed with a pistol and that Mark Humphries discharged it) in order to return verdicts of guilty.  Although a direction in these terms was not sought, on the appeal it was submitted that in a trial that was essentially word on word and where the appellants relied upon the accounts given in their ERISPs to raise a doubt as to their guilt, to erroneously direct the jury that the five day delay in providing their accounts could be used by the jury as evidence of their guilt was such that it was not open to the Crown to rely upon the application of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (Wilde v R [1988] HCA 6; 164 CLR 365).
The application by the Crown for a consciousness of guilt direction
45Prior to the commencement of closing addresses the Crown prosecutor confirmed her intention to seek a direction from the trial judge that the appellants' ""post-offence conduct"", constituted in part by what was said to be the delay in going to police and complaining of being attacked, could be used by the jury as evidence that they were each conscious of their guilt of the offences charged.  At that time the Crown also intended to rely upon the fact that the appellants had stayed away from their respective homes in the days after the incident, and their failure to seek medical treatment for their injuries, together with the fact of delay, as capable of amounting to a consciousness of guilt.
46The Crown's intention to rely on this body of evidence for that purpose was made clear earlier in the trial when defence counsel objected to the Crown leading evidence of the enquiries that police had made to locate the appellants in the days following the incident at Justin Ryan's house.  Her Honour admitted that evidence, limited at that time to the creditworthiness of the accounts each of the appellants had given to police of their involvement in the events of the night and their conduct in the days that followed.  It was not submitted on the appeal that the evidence was wrongly admitted for credit purposes.
47In the course of argument later in the trial as to whether a consciousness of guilt direction would be given and, if so, what components of the post offence conduct relied upon by the Crown were capable of being considered by the jury for that purpose, the trial judge noted that the fact that five days had elapsed before the appellants presented themselves at the police station was already in evidence.  It was not only obvious from the chronology of events proved in the Crown case but each appellant had been offered the opportunity by the interviewing police to explain the delay (and each had given an explanation for it), without counsel submitting that the ERISPS should be edited to excise this line of questioning as undermining the appellants' right to silence.  From that it might safely be assumed that counsel had apparently accepted that the fact of delay was relevant to the jury's assessment of whether what the appellants told police was a reasonably possible version of events.  The only remaining question before closing addresses was whether the fact of delay (either alone or in combination with other post offence conduct) was also capable of supporting an adverse inference from which guilt might be inferred.
48During the course of argument on that question her Honour was referred to Petty & Maiden v R [1991] HCA 34; 173 CLR 95 and to what this Court observed in Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; 196 A Crim R 472 as the limits of permissible comment on inconsistencies between an accused's account to police and the evidence given by an accused at trial.  Defence counsel submitted that the consciousness of guilt direction sought by the Crown, based as it was upon the five day delay in the appellant giving his account to police, contravened the prohibition on a jury drawing an adverse inference from the exercise of the right of each of them during that period not to speak to police, whether to volunteer their accounts as innocent victims or to answer questions as suspects.  
49Her Honour was not persuaded that to leave the issue of delay as consciousness of guilt infringed the appellants' right to silence when they had chosen to break their silence by participating in an ERISP.  She distinguished the prohibition on drawing an inference from silence in Petty on the basis that it was ""a completely different factual scenario"" to the case she was considering where the appellants had broken their silence but not given evidence at trial.  She was also satisfied that simply because the appellants had each proffered an explanation as to why they did not approach police earlier did not disentitle the Crown from seeking a consciousness of guilt direction.  Her Honour held (and correctly) that those explanations were for the jury to weigh and consider in determining whether, with the directions she proposed to give, they would draw an inference of guilt.
50Her Honour ruled on the objection in the following way: I am with the Crown to the extent that she is entitled to have a consciousness of guilt direction but I would have thought that relates to the gap of five days.  That is I think where the consciousness of guilt should relate.  Other matters are matters for argument that the jury might think the failure to get medical attention was a relevant factor, but I don't understand it to be a consciousness of guilt argument.  I would limit the consciousness of guilt to simply the gap [of five days] ...
51Despite a ruling in her favour, in the Crown's closing address she did not urge the jury to use delay to support an inference of guilt: ... What the Crown says in relation to those interviews are that the three accused have made up what is in their interviews and you will not accept it.  
On the accuseds' versions they would have you believe that they were victims of a serious assault by Steven Cuthbert and his cousins using shovels, poles, baseball bats.  If that were the case you might think that they would have made a timely complaint about it.  The fact is it took five days from immediately after the incident until they presented themselves at Mount Druitt Police Station at about 8.30pm.
52The Crown then referred to the efforts to locate the appellants during that time and said:Her Honour will give you directions of law just how you can use this conduct of the accused in that five day period.
53She took the jury through the ERISPs and referred to the evidence of Stacey Roach and Carina Archer, then submitted:And despite the three accused saying they were the victims of this assault, they don't seek medical attention, they don't report this vicious attack, which they say occurred with the use of a weapon, poles, whatever, including the damage to Arthur Humphries' car that he borrowed, they don't go back to their homes.  These are all matters for you, the judges of the facts.
54In responding to the Crown address it is not surprising that defence counsel did not refer expressly to the issue of delay as capable of being used by the Crown as positive evidence of guilt and the need, in those circumstances, for the jury to approach the particular appellant's explanation for the delay with caution before drawing that inference. 
55Counsel for Mark Humphries did not refer to the issue of delay at all.  Counsel for Anthony Keuhne concentrated on where his client was before presenting to police as bearing upon his credit, the Crown having submitted that he told lies about his whereabouts.  He also submitted that although there was no obligation on his client to report having been assaulted by people at the house he went to the police with his brother when he learned that police wanted to talk to them.  
56Counsel for Arthur Humphries addressed what she said was the Crown's criticism of her client for not having sought medical attention and his delay in reporting the assault by submitting that he decided to wait for his mouth to heal before going to a dentist and, in any event, he was under no obligation to report the fact that he had been assaulted, or to speak to police at all about the events of the night.
57Notwithstanding the addresses of counsel, and without revisiting the question whether a consciousness of guilt direction was still called for, the trial judge directed the jury as follows:The next matter, members of the jury, is this topic of what has been referred to as consciousness of guilt.  As you know, all the accused went to the police voluntarily at about 8.30pm on Wednesday 5 August and that as you know was almost five days after the alleged offence which as you also know, occurred just after midnight on 31 July.
The Crown relies on that evidence as being capable of, and in fact supporting the Crown case, supporting the prosecution case.  Because the Crown prosecutor argued that, that gap of some four plus days, was because each accused knew he was guilty of the offences.  He was conscious of his guilt or he recognised his guilt of this offence or these offences in the case of Mark Humphries.
(As noted above the Crown had not ultimately advanced that submission.)
58After referring to the explanation for the delay each appellant had given in his record of interview, her Honour continued:Again it is for you to decide what evidence you accept but before you use the evidence on which the Crown relies, that is, this gap of four to five days, as consciousness of guilt and as support for the Crown case, you must be satisfied that the reason the particular accused whose case you are then considering did not go to the police earlier, was a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth.  You must be satisfied that the evidence establishes that the reason for that delay was a consciousness of guilt of these specific offences charged.  It is only if you are satisfied that the evidence points unequivocally to a consciousness of guilt of the offence or offences, and not some other offence or fear of being unjustly accused, or the reasons advanced by the accused in the interview that this evidence can be used, that is this evidence of the gap in time can be used by you in support of the Crown case.
If you are satisfied that the evidence does point unequivocally to a consciousness of guilt, then you are able to use it in support of the Crown case.  If you are not so satisfied, that is, if there is a reasonable possibility that the accused whose case you are then considering, delayed for the reason that he gave in the interview or reasons that he gave in the interview, or for some other reason, that is the fear of being unjustly accused, then you would put that evidence to one side, the evidence about the delay in going to the police and you do not use it in any way against the accused.  In other words, you just put that piece of evidence to one side and go back in essence to the eye witnesses and the account of the incident of that night.
59Following a request for a further direction to emphasise the right to silence, the trial judge directed the jury as follows:Members of the jury, just going back to one matter you will recall in terms of when I talked to you about consciousness of guilt and the accused attending the police station on 5 August you will recall that was voluntarily done.  Of course they were under no obligation to attend the police station on that day, nor in fact to speak to the police.  But having spoken to the police, of course it is now evidence that you can consider.
60On the appeal it was submitted that although the trial judge directed the jury that the appellants were under no obligation to attend the police station or provide information to police, her direction that guilt could be inferred from their delay in volunteering their accounts was both logically inconsistent with the exercise of their right to silence up until that time and likely to be confusing given the way the parties had put their respective cases in closing addresses.  The Crown submitted that the direction, properly analysed, was not an adverse comment about the appellants having failed to answer questions or provide information before they agreed to be interviewed by police (her Honour's directions on the appellants' right to silence being unambiguous) and that there was therefore no breach of the prohibition on comment for which Petty remains the seminal authority.  Rather, so the Crown submitted, the focus of the direction was on the failure of the appellants to make a timely complaint as victims of an assault.
Was the direction an infringement of the right to silence?
61For the purposes of the appeal, I have not found it necessary to decide whether the consciousness of guilt direction given in this case had the effect of infringing the appellants' right to silence, and for that reason the direction should not have been given (the submission of defence counsel at trial and the approach taken by the appellants' counsel on the appeal).  However, since I am of the view that the direction had that potential, I will outline in a summary way my reasons for coming to that view.  
62Where it is said the right to silence has been infringed in the context of a criminal trial it is critical to identify with precision where and how that has occurred (RPS v R [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620; 113 A Crim R 341 at [630]).  Although I accept that the right to silence under consideration in this case does not fall squarely within the categories of immunity identified by Lord Mustill in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office; Ex parte Smith [1993] AC 1; [1992] 3 All ER 456 at [30]-[31] although it may fall within category six (referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in Jones v R [2005] NSWCCA 443 at [70]), it seems to me that the election by each appellant to give an account to police on 5 August following their arrest, and at that time to forego the immunity from being compelled to answer questions or provide information, must be coexistent with the unqualified right that they had not to speak to police or provide information until they decided otherwise.  That being the case, it follows that to invite the jury to infer guilt from the appellants not presenting themselves to police for questioning earlier than 5 August, even with the knowledge that police wished to speak with them, is to invite the jury to infer guilt from their silence in contravention of the principle laid bare in Petty where Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ said: A person who believes on reasonable grounds that he or she is suspected of having been a party to an offence is entitled to remain silent when questioned or asked to supply information by any person in authority about the occurrence of an offence, the identity of the participants and the roles which they played. That is a fundamental rule of the common law which, subject to some specific statutory modifications, is applied in the administration of the criminal law in this country. An incident of that right of silence is that no adverse inference can be drawn against an accused person by reason of his or her failure to answer such questions or to provide such information. To draw such an adverse inference would be to erode the right of silence or to render it valueless...
That incident of the right of silence means that, in a criminal trial, it should not be suggested, either by evidence led by the Crown or by questions asked or comments made by the trial judge or the Crown Prosecutor, that an accused's exercise of the right of silence may provide a basis for inferring a consciousness of guilt. Thus, to take an example, the Crown should not lead evidence that, when charged, the accused made no reply. Nor should it be suggested that previous silence about a defence raised at the trial provides a basis for inferring that the defence is a new invention or is rendered suspect or unacceptable.
63In Sanchez, Campbell JA (with whom Latham and Harrison JJ agreed) approved of the following extract from Jones and noted as follows:[54] An important qualification of the extent to which the ""right of silence"" prohibits comment at a trial upon failure of an accused to give his account of the facts at an earlier time is stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Jones at [75]:Of course, if the accused chooses to break his or her silence and give an explanation before trial which is inconsistent with an account given in evidence, the inconsistency may be used by the prosecution, both to attack the accused's credit, and as consciousness of guilt.
[55] What is meant by ""break his or her silence"" here is that the accused, during official questioning, chooses not to exercise the third type of right of silence [in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office; Ex parte Smith, namely an immunity possessed by a suspect who is being interviewed by police not to answer questions], and in the course of answering the question gives an account that is inconsistent with his or her evidence at the trial. To similar effect is R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 111 per Mahoney JA, 114-115 per Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Badgery-Parker J agreed).
64It is true to say that the appellants ""broke their silence"" when they agreed to be interviewed following their arrest.  However, the qualification on the prohibition on comment to which reference is made in the above extract did not come into play in this case because as the appellants did not give evidence at trial there was no issue of inconsistency which might have legitimately attracted adverse comment in the way suggested by McClellan CJ at CL in Jones.
Was the fact of delay capable of amounting to consciousness of guilt?
65Whether or not the consciousness of guilt direction had the effect of infringing the appellants' right to silence in this case, in my view the delay in attending at the police station was not capable of rationally supporting the inference of guilt for which the Crown contended and the direction under challenge should not have been given for that reason.
66In McKey v R [2012] NSWCCA 1 Latham J (with whom Whealy JA and Hislop J agreed) accepted at [26] that the legitimacy of the Crown's reliance upon inferences capable of being drawn from an accused's post offence conduct as amounting to a fear of the truth or a consciousness of guilt has long been recognised.  Categories of so called ""post offence conduct"" typically include flight, lies, interference with evidence or witnesses, or other proven conduct of an accused.  Although on the appeal the Crown was unable to point to a case where a delay in giving an account to police (not otherwise associated with evidence of flight or other potentially incriminating behaviour) was admitted as consciousness of guilt, reliance was placed upon McKey as exemplifying the principled approach that should be followed when the admission of evidence of consciousness of guilt is in issue, an approach which the Crown submitted was followed by the trial judge in this case.  
67In McKey the issue was whether the accused's failure to robustly deny guilt when first confronted with an allegation of child abuse by the family of the complainant, and to ""protest his innocence from the rooftops"" thereafter, was relied upon by the Crown in such a way as to invite consciousness of guilt reasoning and not simply as a factor bearing upon his credibility as a witness.  Her Honour was satisfied it did invite reasoning of that kind and that the trial miscarried, there being no adaptation of an Edwards direction given by the trial judge to guard against the jury drawing an unjustified inference adverse to the accused, (particularly where, the case being word on word, the jury might well have looked for evidence tending to support the allegation).  As I read her Honour's judgment at [43], she did not express a concluded view that the conduct upon which the Crown relied in McKey, if properly analysed at trial in accordance with the approach of the High Court in Edwards, would have been admitted as evidence capable of constituting a consciousness of guilt of the offences charged.  
68Her Honour did observe that where the Crown intends to rely upon an accused's post offence conduct as evidencing consciousness of guilt, the evidence must be capable of rationally supporting an inference of guilt of the crime charged before it is admitted for that purpose and, as part of that enquiry, the conduct must be identified by the Crown with precision and its capacity to constitute an implied admission of the offence charged made patent.  
69I am satisfied that enquiry was not undertaken with sufficient rigour by the trial judge in the present case.  The Crown did not identify with any clarity how the delay in presenting to police supported an inference of guilt (of each of the appellants of the offences charged) save as to submit that it was capable of revealing they had each concealed their guilt.  The trial judge's directions were to the same effect.  The circularity in that reasoning deprived the evidence of the essential requirement that the conduct under consideration, together with other circumstances and events, is capable of rationally supporting an inference of guilt.  If the issue of delay in this case had that capacity it would follow that in every case where an accused, knowing or believing that they are suspected of having committed an offence, did not promptly give an exculpatory account to police, the Crown would be entitled to seek a consciousness of guilt direction.  The absurdity of that proposition exposes the flaw in the Crown's argument at trial and the Crown's submissions on appeal.  
70In this case, isolating the fact of delay as ""post offence conduct"", divorced from the related (and potentially more telling) fact that the appellants appeared to have been in each others' company for five days before going to police to give largely identical accounts of the incident, deprived the bare fact of delay of sufficient weight for the purpose which the Crown contended, that is, as positive evidence of guilt.  I do not intend to suggest that even were those additional features of the appellants' post offence conduct taken into account by the trial judge, that the evidence would necessarily have attracted a consciousness of guilt direction.  It is sufficient for present purposes that the fact of delay alone did not meet the test of admissibility.
The proviso 
71The Crown submitted that even if the direction has resulted in a miscarriage of justice the proviso under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied since, on an independent review of the evidence properly admitted at trial, this Court would be satisfied, to the criminal standard, that the appellants' guilt had been proved.  In this case, where the credibility of the Crown witnesses was under direct and sustained challenge (in part because of the police investigation which raised questions as to when and where the firearm was discharged and by whom), I find myself unable to reach the necessary degree of satisfaction that the appellants' guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, even allowing for the fact of delay to negatively impact upon the credit worthiness of their accounts to police. 
Should a retrial be ordered?
72The quashing of a conviction ordinarily attracts an order for a retrial subject always to the broad discretion conferred under s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act as to whether, in any particular case, the interests of justice require a new trial (see Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [648]-[649] per McClellan CJ at CL).  In this case, since Anthony Kuehne has served the non-parole period imposed following his conviction and Arthur Humphries is likely to be released to parole before any retrial could be convened, I am satisfied that there is no utility in ordering a new trial on the only count on the indictment with which these appellants were charged.  
73Despite the fact that Mark Humphries' non-parole period does not expire until December 2014, I would not order that he be retried on either of the counts with which he was charged.  Although the second count, which alleged that he discharged the firearm, was not dependent upon his participation in a joint criminal enterprise with his brothers, his joint possession of the gun with his brothers was particularised as a feature of aggravation in proof of the first count which the Crown did allege was committed as a joint criminal enterprise.  In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, and despite the separate offending with which he was charged by reason of the allegation that he discharged the firearm (he jointly possessed with his brothers), to isolate him as one of three co-offenders, and to order that he be retried in isolation from his brothers on both counts, would be contrary to the interests of justice.  I am encouraged to that view by noting that he has served a substantial proportion of the effective non-parole period of 5 years imposed after partial accumulation of the two sentences. 
74I propose the following orders:1.  Appeal upheld.2.  The convictions of each of the appellants be quashed.3.  Verdicts of acquittal be entered for each of the appellants.**********

2760703,Ihemeje v R [2012] NSWCCA 269,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.
2HIDDEN J: I acre with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J: The applicant applies for an extension of time for leave to appeal and for leave to appeal on sentence.
4The applicant stood trial on 22 March 2010 before Puckeridge DCJ and a jury in respect of an indictment with eleven counts which alleged that the applicant dealt with various amounts of money or property that was proceeds of crime and was reckless as to the fact that the money or property was proceeds of crime.
5The trial concluded on 6 May 2010. The jury returned a verdict of guilty to Counts 7 and 8. In respect of the other nine counts the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
6The two counts on which the applicant was found guilty involved the laundering of a total of $592,809 which had been obtained by frauds on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (""CBA"") and Westpac Banking Corporation (""WBC"").
7The maximum penalty for Counts 7 and 8 - offences under s 400.4(2) of the Criminal Code (Cth) - is 10 years imprisonment and/ or a fine of $66,000.
The sentences
8On 26 August 2010 the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 5 years and 7 months (commencing on 4 May 2010 and expiring on 3 December 2015), with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months (commencing on 4 June 2010 and expiring on 3 January 2014). The individual sentences are:
""Count 7: 5 years imprisonment (commencing on 4 May 2010 and expiring on 3 May 2015)
Count 8:  5 years 6 months imprisonment (commencing on 4 June 2010 and expiring on 3 December 2015)""
The facts
9The applicant was the proprietor of CC Money Exchange, a foreign exchange business located in Sydney. The applicant received $592,908 in fraudulent funds which he converted into US or Euro currency and then handed back to the others involved in the fraud. To hide the true recipient of these funds the applicant filed AUSTRAC reports (in purported compliance with the statutory requirements) in which he provided false details of a non-existent recipient. 
10The applicant was audited by AUSTRAC in February 2002 and also October 2006. There was also evidence that the AUSTRAC officers visited the applicant in September 2001. The AUSTRAC visit and audits were conducted with a view to informing the applicant of his obligations as a ""cash dealer"" under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) including the reporting of significant cash transactions, required for cash transactions over $10,000, and suspicious transactions. 
Count 7
11This count related to fraudulent funds transferred into a bank account called ""Fredrick Okafor trading as City Electronic and Computer Services"". The bank account was controlled by Fredrick Okafor, an associate of the applicant.
12The applicant assisted Mr Okafor to open the account on 9 June 2005 by vouching for him with respect to the St George Bank's 100 point identification check. On 11 August 2005 a St George Bank investigator, contacted the applicant to inform him of the bank's concerns about a suspect transaction involving $62,700 which had been transferred from Mr Okafor's bank account to the applicant's bank account in August 2005. From that date onwards the applicant was on notice with respect to any further dealings concerning Mr Okafor's bank account.
13At about 11.00 am on 6 March 2006, an unidentified male ""runner"" of Asian appearance, who was a member of an identity crime syndicate, attended the Burwood branch of the CBA. At this location the runner, purporting to be John Fung, approached CBA staff and requested a transfer of $280,000 from a CBA account in the name of Jogumo Pty Ltd into a St George Bank account in the name of Fredrick Okafor trading as City Electronic and Computer Services. The runner produced a counterfeit NSW driver's licence as identification for the transaction. The licence was in the name of the director of Jogumo Pty Ltd, John Fung, the legitimate authorised signatory to the account, but bore the image of the runner. CBA staff processed the transfer and the runner left the branch.
14Later that day, an amount of $280,000 was received into the St George Bank account in the name of Fredrick Okafor trading as City Electronic and Computer Services.
15Subsequently, but also on that day, an amount of $280,000 was transferred from the St George Bank account in the name of Fredrick Okafor trading as City Electronic and Computer Services into the applicant's WBC business account in the name of CC Money Exchange. 
16The next day, on 7 March 2006, amounts of $135,869.56 and $135,254.63 were withdrawn from the applicant's WBC business account and deposited into the accounts of City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd and American Express respectively. 
17City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd received an amount of $135,869.56 into its WBC account which, at the request of the applicant, it converted into US dollars. Later that day the applicant attended the Town Hall branch of City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd and collected US$100,800 in cash.
18American Express received an amount of $135,254.63 into its bank account which, at the applicant's request, it converted into EURO currency, to be collected that same day in cash. Later that day the applicant attended an American Express office in Sydney and collected EUR€82,600 in cash.
19The applicant then filed a significant cash transaction report with AUSTRAC as required by statute. That report stated falsely that on 6 March 2006 he had paid an amount of $280,000, made up of EUR€82,600 and US$100,800, to a Henry Edward Havey. The report gave the following details for Henry Edward Havey, each of which was false as the evidence revealed that no person of such name exists: 
(a)date of birth: 18 March 1962;
(b)address: a property in Granville, NSW;
(c)identification produced: UK passport; and
(d)occupation: director. 
Count 8
20Darren Mark Cranshaw was a ""runner"" employed in the identity crime syndicate of which Jonathan Marven was also a member. Mr Cranshaw and Mr Marven fraudulently transferred $315,000 from the bank account of a company in the name of Boomdell Pty Ltd. The money was transferred from the Boomdell account to a bank account controlled by Robert Chibwe, an associate of the applicant.
21At about 12.10 pm on 27 April 2006, Mr Cranshaw attended the Martin Place, Sydney branch of WBC where he completed a withdrawal and deposit slip for the amount of $315,000 to be transferred from an account in the name of Boomdell Pty Ltd to a WBC account in the name of Robert Chibwe trading as Auscam Investments.
22Mr Cranshaw presented false identification in the form of a counterfeit NSW driver's licence. The licence was in the name of William Sheridan, the legitimate authorised signatory to the Boomdell account, but bore the image of Mr Cranshaw. This transfer was processed by a teller and Mr Cranshaw left the branch.
23At about 12.15 pm on the same day, $315,000 was transferred into a WBC account in the name of Auscam Investments, which was controlled by Mr Chibwe.
24At about 1.24 pm on the same day, Mr Chibwe attended the Market and Clarence Street, Sydney branch of WBC. At this location, Mr Chibwe withdrew $270,270.27 from the Auscam Investments account and deposited these funds into the WBC account in the name of City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd.
25At about 2.17 pm on the same day, Mr Chibwe attended the Surry Hills branch of WBC where he withdrew $42,538.70 from his Auscam Investments bank account and deposited these funds into the WBC account in the name of City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd. He left the branch at about 2.30 pm. CCTV footage from the bank shows the applicant in the vicinity of the bank during the time that Mr Chibwe was at the branch conducting these transactions.
26Call charge records indicate that on that day, 27 April 2006, the applicant telephoned Mr Chibwe on six occasions between 9.08 am and 1.35 pm. 
27On 27 April 2006, the applicant contacted City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd and advised that an amount of money would be transferred into the City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd bank account and that the he required the money to be converted into US and EURO currencies, to be collected in cash.
28On the same day, City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd received an amount of $270,270.27 into its WBC account which was converted into US dollars and another amount of $42,539.70 which was converted into EURO currency. Later that day the applicant attended the Town Hall branch of City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd and collected US$200,000 and EUR€25,000 in cash.
29The applicant filed a significant cash transaction report with AUSTRAC as required by statute which stated falsely that on 27 April 2006 he had paid out an amount of $312,808.97, made up of US$200,000 and EUR€25,000 to a Maxwell Howard. The report gave the following details for Maxwell Howard, each of which was false as the evidence revealed that no person of such name exists:
(a)born: 22 April 1966;
(b)address: a property in Parramatta, NSW;
(c)identification produced: NSW Drivers Licence; and
(d)occupation: builder.
30According to the evidence of Mr Marven, the applicant met with members of the identity crime syndicate later that same day, 27 April 2006, in a café in Sydney. The applicant handed to a syndicate member a paper bag containing 60% of the proceeds from the fraud in cash in US and EURO currency. The remaining 40% was retained by the applicant as his share of the proceeds of the crime.
Grounds of appeal
31The applicant relies on five grounds of appeal which will be considered in turn.
Ground 1: the sentencing process miscarried
32Section 19AB(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) provides that when sentencing a federal offender for two or more federal offences at the same sitting and the sentences in aggregate exceed three years, the court must fix a single non-parole period in respect of that sentence or those sentences. Since the non-parole period must apply for all the sentences it must commence from the date of the first sentence.
33The applicant contended, and the Crown accepted, that the sentencing judge did not correctly apply s 19AB(1)(d) in that his Honour stipulated that the non-parole period ought commence on 4 June 2010, which was the date on which the term for Count 8 commenced, rather than 4 May 2010, which was the date on which the term for Count 7 commenced.
34It is accepted by the parties that this Court ought adjust the non-parole period to commence on 4 May 2010 and to expire on 3 December 2013. This adjustment will be reflected in the orders of the Court set out below. 
Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in taking into account matters on which the applicant had not been convicted
35As appears from the narrative set out above, the applicant was charged with 11 counts, but convicted of only two: Counts 7 and 8. The sentencing judge referred in the Remarks on Sentence to the evidence in the Crown case generally. However, in my view, a fair reading of these remarks demonstrates that his Honour was referring to the other counts only by way of overview. They are not referred to as aggravating circumstances or affecting the objective criminality of Counts 7 and 8.
36Any speculation that facts pertaining to the other counts was taken into account was, in my view, put to rest when the sentencing judge expressly eschewed reliance on any matters pertaining to counts other than Counts 7 and 8 in the following terms in the Remarks on Sentence:
""That the jury were unable to agree on the other nine counts in the indictment is not a matter I consider to be taken into account in the objective criminality in respect of count seven and eight.""
37Accordingly, in my view, this ground fails.
Ground 3: the sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis of findings that were not open to him in respect to the charges the applicant was being sentenced on
38The provision of the Criminal Code (Cth) under which the applicant was charged and convicted was s 400.4(2), which relevantly provides:
""400.4  Dealing in proceeds of crime etc. - money or property worth $100,000 or more
...
(2) A person is guilty of an offence if:
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and
(b) either:
(i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or
(ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and
(c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and
(d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years, or 600 penalty units, or both.""
39The applicant submitted that the following extracts from the Remarks on Sentence indicate that the sentencing judge failed to appreciate the requisite mental element for the offence and accordingly took into account facts that were inconsistent with the jury verdict:
""That essential element of recklessness involved the jury in finding that the accused was consciously aware at the relevant time of each of the Counts 7 and 8 that the money referred to in each of those counts was the proceeds of crime."" (ROS, 2)
""On the finding of the jury as to recklessness the jury has found beyond reasonable doubt that the amounts, or that the prisoner was consciously aware as at 7 March 2006 that the money which was converted into Euros and American dollars was the proceeds of crime."" (ROS, 5)
""In my summing up the jury was directed that the onus on the Crown was to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was consciously aware at the relevant time of the Counts 7 and 8 that the money referred to in each of those counts was the proceeds of crime."" (ROS, 11)
40The Crown accepted that these passages did not correspond with the requisite fault element for the offences charged and in respect of which the applicant was convicted. Nonetheless it submitted that the sentencing judge may be taken to have properly directed the jury as to the requisite fault element for the offences, since no challenge was made to the convictions. The Crown, in substance, acknowledged that the identified passages contained some looseness of language which misstated the fault element, but submitted that, when taken as a whole, the Remarks on Sentence were redolent with references to recklessness and statements of the correct fault element which indicated that the sentencing judge appreciated the correct fault element, and applied it.
41The Crown instanced the following passages:
""It is important to keep in mind that the offences which the jury have found the prisoner guilty are offences that the prisoner was reckless as to the fact that the money, or property, was proceeds of crime. In my summing up the jury was directed that the onus on the Crown was to prove beyond reasonable doubt the element of recklessness in each count.""
""The jury also had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed that there was a risk that was substantial that is a substantial risk that the money was the proceeds of crime and that having regard to the circumstances known to him at the time... that it was unjustifiable for the accused to deal with the money.""
42The Crown also submitted that it ought not be inferred that the sentencing judge misapprehended the relevant legislative provision since the associated provisions do not use the words ""conscious"" or ""aware"".
43Section 400.4 provides for dealing in the proceeds of crime where the money or property is worth $100,000 or more. Section 400.4(1) requires the person to believe the money or property to be the proceeds of crime or that the person intend the money or property will become an instrument of crime. Section 400.4(2), of a breach of which the applicant was convicted, simply requires either the money or property to be the proceeds of crime or there to be a risk that it will become an instrument of crime and the person to be reckless as to these matters. Section 400.4(3) requires either the money or property to be the proceeds of crime or there to be a risk that it will become an instrument of crime and the person to be negligent as to the fact of these matters.
44Although it is regrettable that in the Remarks on Sentence the sentencing judge at times used language which did not correspond with the mental element for the offences with which the applicant had been convicted, it ought not be inferred that his Honour did not have in mind the correct provision, or the requisite mental element. That the sentencing had conducted the trial with a jury and directed the jury without error as to the elements of the offence is a powerful indication that the passages on which the applicant relies were no more than momentary slips such as can occur in the atmosphere of a busy courtroom.
45The Remarks on Sentence, unlike the summing up, are the oral reasons of the decision-maker, and ought be read as a whole. Where there is apparent inconsistency in the remarks care should be taken to ascertain whether the inconsistency is indicative of error in substance or mere laxity in expression. In my view, the passages identified by the applicant which are set out above fall into the latter category.
46Accordingly, in my view, this ground ought fail.
Ground 4(a): the sentencing judge erred in his findings regarding respective roles and Ground 4(f) the sentencing judge erred in failing to apply the principles of parity
47The principles of parity apply not only where co-offenders are charged with the same offence but also where, as here, offenders are not charged with the same offence. However, in the latter case, as the High Court said in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 (Green) at [30]-[32]:
""... there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant.
... The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.
A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.""
48These two grounds depend, in substance, on the respective roles of the participants in the offences of which the applicant was convicted. Other participants were charged, convicted and sentenced. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence which was, on its face, more severe with respect to the applicant than was imposed on other participants. Yet specific reference was made in the Remarks on Sentence to the role played by the other participants referable to the applicant.
49The applicant referred to the sentences imposed on Mr Marven, Mr Cranshaw and Mr Chibwe as being relevant to his own sentence. The respective sentences and material factors are set out in the table below.
Offender/ relevant mattersOffencesRelevant sentenceApplicant/ was tried and convicted.Two offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime: Criminal Code (Cth) s 440.4(2).On Count 7, 5 years imprisonment (4 May 2010 - 3 May 2015). On Count 8, 5 years 6 months imprisonment (4 June 2010 - 3 December 2015). Cumulative sentence of 5 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months (4 May 2010 - 3 December 2015).Mr Marven/ pleaded guilty and gave evidence against applicant.24 offences of using a false instrument with intent: Crimes Act 1900 s 300(2). Two offences of having false instrument with intent to use same: Crimes Act 1900 s 302. 26 offences of obtaining or attempting to obtain money by deception: Crimes Act 1900 s 178BA. One offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime: Crimes Act 1900 s 193B(2). One offence of possessing a false document: Criminal Code (Cth) s 145.2.One of the offences of obtaining money by deception related to the sum of $315,000, which concerned the same incident as the applicant's Count 8. On that offence and taking into account matters on a Form 1, Mr Cranshaw was sentenced to a total term of four years and a partially concurrent non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment and a parole period of 1 year and 9 months. Total aggregate head sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.Mr Cranshaw/ pleaded guilty.37 offences of using a false instrument with intent: Crimes Act 1900 s 300(2). One offence of having false instrument with intent to use same: Crimes Act 1900 s 302. 23 offences of obtaining money by deception: Crimes Act 1900 s 178BA.One of the offences of obtaining money by deception related to the sum of $360,000, which included the $315,000 relating to the applicant's Count 8. On that offence and taking into account matters on a Form 1, Cranshaw was sentenced to a 3-year term, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment with a parole period of 1 year. Total aggregate head sentence of 3 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.Mr Chibwe/ was tried and convicted.One offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime: Criminal Code (Cth) s 440.4(2).This count related to his role in transferring funds from his bank account to the City Forex bank account at the direction of the applicant. This count corresponds to Count 8. Head sentence of 2 1/2 years to be released on recognisance after serving 1 1/2 years.
50In order to determine whether there has been any infringement of the principles of parity such as would require this Court's intervention, it is necessary to examine the findings made by the sentencing judge as to the role each played and the reliance placed by the sentencing judge on the Remarks on Sentence made by the sentencing judges of other participants.
51The sentencing judge described Mr Cranshaw as a ""runner"" and Mr Marven variously as an organiser of the runners, someone who ""co-ordinated the runners"" or ""syndicate co-ordinator"".
52This Court's decision in Cranshaw v R [2009] NSWCCA 80 (Cranshaw), an application for leave to appeal against sentence, which was allowed, was before the sentencing judge. In Cranshaw, this court summarised the respective roles of Mr Cranshaw and Mr Marven as follows. 
53Mr Marven was found to be a ""syndicate head"" who would provide to Mr Cranshaw fake or counterfeit identity documents, a cheque, an account deposit slip and details of the account on a sheet. The information sheet would include the details of company accounts, including the company name, account numbers, address and account holders' names. A separate sheet of specimen signatures was also supplied.
54Generally speaking, Mr Cranshaw would enter a bank with a counterfeit NSW driver's licence bearing his photograph and the details of a legitimate account holder. The offender would then deposit a counterfeit cheque to confirm that the account was still operating and unobstructed. He would then prepare another counterfeit cheque to withdraw cash from the account. This Court reproduced the following remarks of the sentencing judge on Mr Cranshaw's role, at [21]:
""The offender's role was to act as a runner to facilitate the actual contact with the bank. It is important to understand that he did not have anything to do with the actual production of the false identity documents, or the obtaining of personal information, with respect to the identities that were used. His role was to adopt the identity when the defrauding was attempted face to face at the bank. Much like a drug courier, he was to be the fall guy if things went wrong. In that role, he protected those in the syndicate who were principally responsible for perpetrating the frauds.""
55The sentencing judge referred to the following remarks on sentence in respect of Mr Chibwe:
""... though planned, that offender's [Mr Chibwe's] actions were not particularly sophisticated, in that he used his own name and personal details in effecting that planning and that spoke of his limited role in a wider enterprise.""
56The sentencing judge contrasted the applicant's role with that of Mr Chibwe and observed:
""There was less chance of the prisoner [the applicant] by his actions in changing the monies paid into his accounts in Euros and American dollars in the trail of money being followed. He did in fact have an active role and I accept that it was a significant role.""
57As referred to above, Mr Marven gave evidence in the instant sentence hearing that in respect of the transaction the subject of Count 8, the applicant had had in his possession 100% of the proceeds of the transaction, in the order of $310,000, of which he handed over 60% and retained 40%, some $124,000, as his share of the proceeds of the crime.
58It can thus be seen that in the hierarchy of criminality, the applicant was higher up than Mr Marven, who was in turn higher up than Mr Cranshaw and Mr Chibwe. The applicant's risk of detection was markedly lower than that of the others and his material gain can be inferred to be substantially higher.
59The sentencing judge had regard to the sentences that had been imposed on Mr Marven and Mr Cranshaw when he sentenced Mr Chibwe and the applicant. The due proportion between the criminality of each offender having regard to the position of each in the hierarchy was considered by his Honour in the following terms:
""It is submitted by the Crown that the [applicant's] role was higher than that of Chibwe, as on the findings of the jury the [Applicant] supervised or directed Chibwe. I consider that Chibwe's role was less significant as I have previously indicated. So far as Marven and Cranshaw and their sentences, I also consider that they are not matters in which the principles of parity should apply. Marven co-ordinated the runners as he has been found by the sentencing judge and Cranshaw was a runner.""
60I consider that his Honour's reference to the principles of parity not applying ought be taken to be a reference to the differential in criminality of the relevant participants, since, as referred to above, it is accepted that the principles of parity are not confined to situations where different sentences are imposed for the same offence, but extend to different sentences on persons engaged in the same enterprise, although charged with different offences: Green at [30], per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
61The Crown relied on the following matters as increasing the objective seriousness of the applicant's conduct and distinguishing him from Mr Marven and Mr Cranshaw:
(a)The applicant's filing of intentionally false returns with AUSTRAC in an attempt to avoid detection;
(b)His supervisory role over others; and
(c)His role in converting the proceeds of crime into foreign currency in an attempt to avoid detection.
62I accept that these were factors which had the effect for which the Crown contended. Two further significant matters distinguished the applicant from the other offenders under consideration: first, he alone withdrew cash and was responsible for its safe-keeping whereas others were responsible for the documentation relating to transfers; and secondly, his remuneration represented a very substantial proportion of the proceeds of the transaction.
63The applicant pointed to the fact that both Mr Cranshaw and Mr Marven were convicted of a significantly higher number of offences than was the applicant. I do not consider this matter of itself to be particularly germane since I consider that a comparison of their respective roles leads to the conclusion that Mr Marven and Mr Cranshaw were lower in the hierarchy than the applicant; the number of offences may simply be a reflection of the greater risk of detection. Furthermore, both received significant discounts on sentence by reference to their pleas of guilty and the assistance they provided. There is no evidence of their remuneration.
64I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge misapplied the principles of parity when determining the applicant's sentence in light of the sentences that had been imposed on Mr Marven, Mr Cranshaw and Mr Chibwe. The sentence imposed on the applicant paid, in my view, due regard to his level of criminality as revealed by his role, his responsibility and his remuneration.
65The applicant also relied on the principle of totality and referred to Horne v R [2011] NSWCCA 225 (Horne). The applicant submitted that Mr Horne's offences were similar to those of the applicant and that the applicant's sentence was too high, having regard to the sentence imposed on Mr Horne.
66The sentence imposed on Mr Horne was as follows.
Offender/ relevant mattersOffenceRelevant SentenceHorne/ pleaded guiltyTwo offences of use false instrument with intent contrary to s 300(2) of Crimes Act 1900; also took into account 84 Form 1 offences of obtaining money by deception, using a false instrument or recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime.3 years 6 months term, with non-parole period of 2 years 4 months.Three offences of obtaining money by deception under 178BA of Crimes Act 1900.Fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months.One offence of making false instrument under s 300(1) of Crimes Act 1900.Fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months.One offence of participating in a criminal group under s 93T of the Crimes Act 1900.Fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months.Two offences of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime under s 193B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900.Fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months.One offence of using a forged Commonwealth document under s 145.1(5) of the Criminal Code (Cth); also took into account 17 offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth).Fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years.Effective total head sentence of 4 years, 2 months and a non-parole period of 3 years.
67The sentencing judge in Horne relied on Cranshaw. This Court considered the proportionality between Horne's criminality and that of Cranshaw in Horne at [12]-[15], and said:
""In Cranshaw the offender had been sentenced by another District Court judge for a large number of offences under s 178BA and s 300(2) of the Crimes Act . In Cranshaw the offender had been a ""runner"" for a criminal group and Judge Lakatos found that the facts in Cranshaw were ""substantially similar, if not almost identical, to the prisoner's criminal offending here"". Cranshaw also had not had any relevant prior criminal history and had had a significant drug problem. He also had entered early pleas of guilty and had provided substantial assistance. 
In Cranshaw the sentencing judge had held that he should adopt a starting point for the aggregate sentence of seven years and should allow a combined discount of 45 per cent for the early pleas of guilty and the assistance, thus arriving at a total head sentence of three years 10 months.
In the present case the sentencing judge considered that the applicant's offending had been somewhat more serious than Cranshaw's offending. The applicant's offending had taken place over a longer period of time and had involved more money and the applicant, having moved to Queensland, had returned from Queensland and sought out a person higher in the group so that he could commence re-offending.
Having regard to these differences in the two cases, the sentencing judge selected a starting point for the aggregate sentence of 7 1/2 years, and not 7 years. The sentencing judge then allowed the same combined discount of 45 per cent for the early pleas of guilty and the assistance, arriving at a rounded-off figure of four years two months for the total head sentence. His Honour then fixed a total non-parole period of 3 years.""
68Given the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant's criminality was greater than that of Mr Cranshaw, I do not consider that there is any lack of proportionality between the sentences imposed on Mr Horne and Mr Cranshaw on the one hand and the applicant on the other. The sentence imposed on the applicant was undiscounted, since there had been neither plea nor assistance. To the extent to which there were fewer offences, I repeat the observations I have made above with respect to parity.
Ground 4(b): failing to find hardship and/ or failing to consider the effects of hardship
69The applicant relied on the evidence that he and his wife have a son, Samuel, born on Christmas Day 2006, who has complex cardiac problems. The applicant's wife, who is Samuel's mother, suffers from hypotension.
70The sentencing judge said in the Remarks on Sentence:
""I accept that the prisoner's wife will experience hardship as a result of any custodial sentence but do not consider that hardship should have any effect on the custodial sentence to be imposed in view of the seriousness of the crimes involved. The hardship which the prisoner has caused to his wife is a result of his own conduct.""
71His Honour referred to R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 in support of the proposition that it is only in highly exceptional circumstances that a court should be much influenced by hardship and otherwise justified term of imprisonment would cause to third parties. I do not consider that any error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach, which was open to him on the basis of authority and the evidence. Accordingly, in my view, this ground fails.
Ground 4(c): failing to take into account prior good character and other favourable subjective circumstances
72Pursuant to s 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the Court must take into account the character, antecedents, age, means and physical and mental condition of the applicant in imposing a sentence.
73The sentencing judge rejected the Crown's submissions to the contrary and found the applicant to be a person of good character who had been a hard working member of the community who had given assistance to the Nigerian community of which he is a member. 
74The applicant has not persuaded me that there is any basis for the suggestion that his Honour did not take into account his positive finding of good character when sentencing the applicant.
Ground 4(d): failing to take into account matters under s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
75The applicant accepted that this Act did not apply since the relevant offences were Commonwealth offences. Nonetheless the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge failed to make findings that that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation although such findings were open. Such matters are mandatory relevant considerations under s 16A(2)(n) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
76The difficulty for the applicant with respect to this ground is that the matters relied upon as ameliorating at the sentence hearing were confined to the applicant's good character, the hardship by reason of his son and the assistance he had given authorities regarding the assault on him in prison (referred to below). Mr Jeffreys, who appeared for him at the sentence hearing, did not make a positive submission about rehabilitation. This was hardly surprising in circumstances where the pre-sentence report, which was tendered by the applicant, contained the following passage:
""The offender disagreed with the statement of facts pertaining to the offences. He stated that he performed the foreign exchanges after having followed the correct procedures and at the time, he was unaware of the fraudulent nature of the transactions and the individuals involved. Mr Ihemeje denied any involvement in the offences and maintains that he is innocent of all charges. The offender appeared to minimise his offending behaviour and laid blame on other parties involved.""
77I do not consider that error has been shown. It is not for a sentencing judge to go through all factors listed in applicable legislation where no submissions have been made about them and the evidence does not support the proposition for which an applicant might later contend on appeal to this Court. In my view, this ground fails.
Ground 4(e): failing to make allowance for assistance by the applicant in relation to assault or its effects on him
78This ground relates to two violent assaults perpetrated on the applicant while he was in custody. On the first occasion, 8 June 2010, the applicant reported the matter to prison officers. On the second occasion, 10 June 2010, the applicant lost consciousness as a result of the assault. When he regained consciousness he identified his assailant.
79The applicant was subsequently put in protective custody. 
80In the Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge referred to the applicant's co-operation with prison authorities and the circumstance that he has been, and may in the future be, in protective custody. His Honour noted that the Crown accepted that these matters were to be taken into account in determining the head sentence.
81His Honour determined a non-parole period which was of the order of 64%. This is consistent with an appreciation that the period spent in custody was likely to be more onerous for the applicant by reason of the assaults and the assistance he had provided in identifying his assailants.
82I do not consider the applicant to have identified any respect in which his Honour's discretion to take these matters into account has miscarried. Accordingly, in my view, this ground fails.
Ground 5: the sentences imposed were unduly harsh and severe
83The reasons I have set out above in relation to parity and proportionality are also relevant to this ground. I do not consider that the applicant has established that the sentence imposed on the applicant is manifestly excessive. Although it is higher than the sentences imposed on other offenders involved in the transaction that formed the subject of Count 8, this is in my view appropriate having regard to the applicant's greater criminality.
84The applicant referred this Court to Du Randt v R [2008] NSWCCA 121 and two unreported decisions of District Court judges. The Crown also drew the Court's attention to R (Cth) v Nguyen; R (Cth) v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 331 and R v Guo; R v Qian [2010] NSWCCA 170 (Guo and Qian).
85The facts of these cases were substantially different from the facts of the instant case and provided less helpful comparators than did the sentences imposed on Mr Marven, Mr Cranshaw and Mr Chibwe. For example in Guo and Qian, the relevant offences were committed when employers paid their workers in cash but did not withhold money for tax and superannuation. As reprehensible as such conduct undoubtedly is, it is not, in my view, in the same area of criminality as the instant case such as to make a comparison between the sentences imposed helpful.
86Sentencing decisions for money laundering offences may provide assistance by way of general sentencing principle for this class of offence, but do not, in my view, necessarily establish a range of sentence. As Barr AJ said in R v Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195 at [41]:
""Notwithstanding the gridlike structure of the subsections, their graded component parts and maximum sentences, they comprehend such a wide range of criminality that there is bound, I think, to be an appreciable variation in the length of sentences within and between them. It seems to me, without undervaluing the importance of the principal differentiating factors - minimum value of money or property and state of mind - that each case will have other variables that bear on sentence. Perhaps the most important will be an exact appreciation of what the offender did, what acts he performed and with what authority and over what period of time. The total value of money or property involved will be important, and whether the money or property belonged to the offender or to another. The degree of planning or deceit that led to the commission of the offence and whether actual loss resulted, and the extent of such loss, will be important.""
87It would, in my view, be at odds with the principle of general deterrence if the sentences for the perpetrators who run a lower risk of detection and whose rewards are relatively higher were not concomitantly higher than the sentences imposed on persons lower in the hierarchy and whose criminality is accordingly lesser.
88I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed on the applicant lie outside the proper range. Accordingly, in my view, this ground fails.
Orders
89For the foregoing reasons, only the first ground of appeal has been made out. I would grant leave to appeal but allow the appeal, only to the extent to which it is necessary to make the adjustment to the commencement of the non-parole period.
90Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(2)Allow the appeal.
(3)Adjust the non-parole period fixed by Puckeridge DCJ to commence on 4 May 2010 and to expire on 3 December 2013.
(4)Otherwise confirm the sentences imposed by Puckeridge DCJ.

2760705,CJ v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 258,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Hall J.

2HALL J: By a judgment of the District Court given on 24 March 2011 in a judge-alone trial, the appellant was convicted of 21 charges on an indictment, particulars of which are set out below.

3She was sentenced to a total effective term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years.

4On 11 April 2011 a Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed in respect of the judgment. The Notice lapsed on 11 October 2011.

5By application for an extension of time dated 16 December 2011, filed on 19 December 2011, the appellant applied for an extension of time within which to appeal. The grounds for the extension were set out in the affidavit of Christopher John Watson, barrister, sworn on 19 December 2011. 

6In the circumstances, including the fact that the Crown did not oppose the application for an extension of time, the hearing of the appeal proceeded on the basis that the extension sought by the appellant should be granted.

Appellable error established
7At the hearing of the appeal on 24 July 2012, the submissions on the issues arising from the two grounds of appeal in due course focussed upon a failure by the trial judge to consider parts of the expert medical evidence adduced in the defence case at trial. In particular, the evidence of Dr Nielssen (consultant forensic psychiatrist, retained by the appellant) was relevant to findings of fact made by the trial judge which findings were central to his Honour's determination that the appellant had failed to establish the defence of mental illness. 

8The Crown, in my respectful opinion, towards the end of submissions fairly and properly conceded that error had been established based upon the trial judge's omission to evaluate the totality of the relevant medical evidence. In those circumstances, the Crown conceded that the appropriate course was for the proceedings to be remitted back to the District Court and a new trial date set.

Orders
9On 24 July 2012 this Court made orders in the following terms:
(1) Appeal allowed.
(2) Convictions quashed.
(3) The matter be remitted to the District court for retrial.
(4) The Court to give reasons at a later date.
(5) The matter to be relisted before the Court of Criminal Appeal on Thursday 26 July for the purposes of the hearing of a bail application, if made.

10In accordance with Order (4) this judgment sets out the reasons for the Court's abovementioned orders.

The Crown case
12The Crown case was that at all material times the appellant worked at a primary school for boys and that she, from May 2007, was employed at the school as a weekend ""housemother"".

13The Crown alleged that whilst employed in 2009 the appellant committed the abovementioned offences against a number of complainants who were then Year 6 students.

14The Crown observed in its written submissions that the occurrence of the various incidents was not in issue and that the central issue was whether the appellant had available the defence of mental illness.

The defence of mental illness
15Section 38(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Mental Health Act"") provides as follows:

""38 Special verdict

(1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.""

16The expression ""mental illness"" is not defined by the provisions of the Mental Health Act and accordingly is determined in accordance with the rules enunciated in R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718 (those rules are described below).

17The onus was upon the appellant to establish the defence of mental illness on the balance of probabilities. The trial judge made a finding that the appellant at the time of the alleged offences suffered from a mental illness, namely, Bipolar I Disorder. However, the trial judge also made a finding that the appellant, as at the time of the alleged offending, knew that her various acts were both legally and morally wrong: Judgment dated 10 December 2010 at page 33. 

18Consequentially it was determined that the defence of mental illness had not been established 

Evidence at the trial
19Reports and oral evidence were provided by the following witnesses: 

(a)Dr Richardson (the appellant's treating psychiatrist);

(b)Professor Greenberg (forensic psychiatrist - retained by the Crown);

(c)Michelle Player (clinical psychologist); and

(d)Dr Nielssen (consultant forensic psychiatrist - retained by the appellant).

20The Crown tendered a brief of evidence in one folder that became Exhibit A. The folder contained psychiatric reports relied on both by the Crown and the appellant. Another folder, Exhibit B, contained transcripts of interviews with the complainants as well as statements from other witnesses and other documents.


21An eleven page ""Statement of Alleged Facts"" became Exhibit C in the proceedings. That statement contained the factual matters in relation to each of the offences charged.

Grounds of Appeal
22In the conviction appeal, the appellant relied upon the following grounds:
Ground 1(a): In determining the central issue of whether or not the appellant was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the commission of the offences giving rise to a defence of mental illness, his Honour failed to consider a vast amount of material admitted into evidence relevant to this issue.
Ground 1(b): Upon proper consideration of all relevant evidence, the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable in that his Honour erred in not finding that the appellant was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the commission of the offences which gave rise to a defence of mental illness.

Appellant's Submissions
Ground 1(a)

23It was submitted that the trial judge's consideration of the factual material was limited to the Statement of Alleged Facts and the material that emerged out of the histories provided to various practitioners by the appellant. It was submitted that his Honour did not have regard to the material forming Exhibit B. The contents of that exhibit, it was argued, were of real significance in providing the factual basis for the expert opinions. 

24Furthermore, it was contended that the evidence as a whole was highly relevant to the consideration of the defence and that a failure to consider all of the evidence gave rise to an error of law amounting to a substantial miscarriage of justice. The submissions were supported by reference to the decision of the High Court in Cesan v the Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358, in particular that of French CJ at [71]-[74].

25The issue as to the claimed failure by the trial judge to consider relevant evidence is taken up in the discussion below concerning Ground 1(b). In that context the failure to take into account some of the evidence given by Dr Nielssen on relevant matters overlaps the issues arising in respect of Ground 1(b). 

26As to the evidence on factual matters the transcript records exchanges between the trial judge and counsel for the accused as to the Statement of Alleged Facts and whether that Statement was to be taken as setting out the agreed facts for the purposes of the trial. It is sufficient to state that a reading of the transcript establishes that the accused's counsel accepted and proceeded upon the basis that the abovementioned Statement set out for the purposes of the trial the primary facts surrounding and constituting the alleged offences.

27To the extent that Ground 1(a) may suggest that the trial judge was required to treat the Statement as other than an Agreed Statement of Facts and required him to establish relevant primary facts from the material from which the Statement was derived, I do not regard Ground 1(a) as raising a valid or proper ground of appeal. 

Ground 1(b)
28This ground raises for consideration the issue as to whether the trial judge erred in law in failing to have regard to relevant evidence including, in particular, the evidence relevant to the issue as to whether or not the appellant had established, on the balance of probabilities, that she did not know that what she had done was wrong.

29In support of this ground of appeal a number of matters were relied upon in the appellant's submissions, including the following:

(i) It was contended that his Honour erred in his understanding and analysis of the evidence of Dr Richardson. His Honour made a finding to the effect that Dr Richardson expressed the opinion that the appellant knew what she was doing was wrong but that she was unable to control herself. In accordance with the principle stated in Willgoss v R (1960) 105 CLR 295, his Honour then proceeded to determine that in those circumstances the defence of mental illness was not made out: Appellant's Written Submissions at [55].

(ii) Contrary to the trial judge's statement as to what opinion was expressed by Dr Richardson, it was submitted that, as expressed in his reports and in oral evidence, he had in fact stated that the appellant did not know that what she was doing was wrong ""in any real sense"" or ""at all"": Appellant's Written Submissions at [56]. 

(iii) When the ""ultimate opinion"" of Dr Richardson was properly understood, it was submitted that the conclusion reached by the trial judge was not open and that his Honour ought to in fact have found, by a proper application of the principles of Willgoss and Sodeman v The King (1936) 55 CLR 192, that the appellant did not know that what she was doing was wrong: Appellant's Written Submissions at [57]. 

30It was submitted that the trial judge also erred in relation to the evidence of Dr Nielssen. In that regard the following matters were relied upon: 

(i) Dr Nielssen's opinion was that the appellant did not know that what she was doing was morally wrong. On that basis the defence of mental illness was available to the appellant. 

(ii) Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Richardson were of the opinion that the appellant had been in a manic state at the time of the alleged offending. In addition there was some evidence that she may have suffered from ""irresistible impulses"" so as to not know that what she was doing was wrong at all: Appellant's Written Submissions at [64]. 

(iii) The failure by the trial judge to provide any reasons or adequate reasons as to why he did not accept the medical evidence in the defence case, which it was submitted was capable of establishing the appellant as being in a manic state at the time of the commission of the offences, so as not to know that what she was doing was wrong.

(iv) Although the trial judge rejected Professor Greenberg's opinion to the effect that the appellant had not suffered from a Bipolar Disorder Type 1 disease (or any disease of the mind), the trial judge notwithstanding, proceeded to accept Professor Greenberg on the question as to whether or not the appellant knew that what she was doing at the time of the offences was wrong.

(v) Professor Greenberg had effectively linked the absence of a mental condition, such as a Bipolar Disorder Type 1, with his opinion that the appellant did not suffer from a defect of reason. This fact necessarily reduced the weight to be accorded to Professor Greenberg's opinion on the critical issue upon which the issue of mental illness turned, particularly so in light of the trial judge's affirmative finding that the appellant did in fact suffer from such a disorder at the time of the alleged offending.

Crown's submissions
Ground 1(a)
31The Crown's contention was that the trial judge had taken particular steps to ensure that the parties accepted that the Statement of Agreed Facts was in fact an agreement as to the underlying facts, including those relevant to the mental illness defence.

32The Crown rejected criticism of an alleged failure by the trial judge in not taking into account factual circumstances beyond those agreed.

33In its submissions, the Crown emphasised that there was no dispute concerning the happening of the events, the relevant dates and the type of conduct engaged in or the place where the incidents occurred. As the not guilty plea had been entered on the basis of the claimed mental illness, it was submitted that it was not necessary for his Honour to have made further reference to the contents of Exhibit B.

34Accordingly it was submitted that in the circumstances in which the trial was conducted, the trial judge was able to proceed on the basis that the Statement of Alleged Facts had been accepted for the purpose of the trial as a statement of agreed facts and that his Honour then correctly proceeded to turn his attention to the real facts at issue, namely, whether or not the appellant was entitled to a special verdict.

Ground 1(b)
35As the Crown observed, the defence had to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant was, at the time of the commission of each and every act:

(a) Labouring under a defect of reason caused by a disease of the mind.

(b) With the consequence that the appellant did not know the nature and quality of her acts, or

(c) If she did know, she did not know that it was wrong.

36The Crown observed that it was never in contest that she knew the nature and quality of her acts and that the issue of mental illness was to be resolved by reference to the four expert witnesses called at trial.

37In relation to issue (c) (as set out above) the Crown made a number of submissions including the following:

(i) There was no evidence that the appellant exhibited, other than at the time of the acts constituting the alleged offences, symptoms indicative of Bipolar Disorder.

(ii) The ""concession"" made by the appellant's counsel, namely ""...there is certainly nothing in the brief of the boys saying anything about the accused appearing to be odd or anything like that. There is nothing of that."": Crown's Written Submissions at [19] confirmed that the boys did not in fact notice or record anything that would indicate that the appellant was acting or behaving strangely or out of the ordinary during the happening of any of the incidents. The Crown submitted:

""[21] By making this concession, by agreeing to the 11 page statement of facts by silence, and by the admission through Doctors Richardson and Nielssen that the appellant was an unreliable historian, his Honour was thereby able to proceed on the basis that the agreed facts were exactly that and proceeded to turn his attention to the real fact in issue, namely, whether or not the appellant was entitled to a special verdict.""

(iii) The appellant's statement to Dr Richardson that ""she knew what she was doing was wrong"". This statement, the Crown contended, coincided with Professor Greenberg's opinion where he said that she had both understood the nature and quality of her acts and that she knew that what she was doing was wrong.

(iv) Dr Richardson made significant concessions in the cross-examination, as recorded at [33] of the Crown's Written Submissions. 

(v) The Crown observed that in determining whether the appellant did not know that what she was doing was wrong, the trial judge relied upon the following matters:

(a) The fact that the appellant had never said to any of the psychiatrists that she did not know that what she was doing was either legally or morally wrong. Additionally, she agreed that she said to one of the victims, JP, that what she was doing was "" on her"" and, if she was found out, she would go to jail.

(b) That there was no evidence of her behaving in an abnormal manner in the period over which the offences were committed. She was able to continue working at her normal skill level. There was nothing to indicate that her behaviour was otherwise abnormal. That was contrary to the way one would be likely to find someone who was in a manic state.

(c) That she was careful not to be caught with the boys, for example, when she went to the campsite, she went after dark and turned off a torch because she did not want anyone to see her approach. The trial judge referred to evidence of other instances of this type of behaviour.

(d) In speaking with the doctors, the appellant minimised her own involvement by telling the doctors that the boys had started the sexual behaviour. Reference was made to a couple of entries on Facebook where Dr Nielssen was asked whether that meant that she knew it was wrong and not right, and she answered ""Yes, it sounds like it.""

(vi) That the conclusion reached by the trial judge was entirely open on the evidence and it was based upon a careful analysis of the medical evidence undertaken by him.

(vii) In relation to the question of irresistible impulse, the Crown stated that there had been no reference to that concept in any of the medical reports. It was introduced by the Crown to Dr Richardson in cross-examination when he was asked whether the appellant demonstrated an irresistible impulse. Dr Richardson said she did.

(viii) An irresistible impulse is not a defence per se: Attorney-General for South Australia v Brown (1960) AC 432 at 23 and Sodeman v the King (supra).

(ix) As the appellant was an unreliable historian it was necessary, as Dr Richardson conceded in cross-examination, to have regard to the surrounding circumstances. When the trial judge did this he came to the conclusion that the appellant knew that what she was doing was wrong. His Honour found that the previous and contemporaneous acts of the appellant were to be preferred to medical theory. That approach afforded the best way to assess the environment and circumstances in which the appellant was operating.

38The Crown submitted that on an analysis of the evidence, including the evidence on the above matters, the trial judge reached the conclusion that the opinion expressed by Professor Greenberg was to be preferred to that of both Dr Nielssen and Dr Richardson in relation to the opinions they expressed that she did not know that what she was doing wrong.

Consideration
39In this case where the Crown has established, beyond reasonable doubt, the elements of each of the crimes charged, the issue for determination at trial was whether the appellant had available to her the defence of mental illness, as to which she bore the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v R [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659 at 664-665.

40If a finding was made that the appellant suffered from mental illness according to the accepted test as at the time she is alleged to have committed the relevant acts, then the trial judge would have been required to return a special verdict that the appellant was not guilty of the charges by reason of mental illness: s 38(1) of the Mental Health Act. 

41The defence of mental illness must be determined in accordance with the M'Naghten rules laid down in R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718. Those rules provide that every person is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his or her crimes, until the contrary is proven. To establish the defence of mental illness, it must be proved upon the balance of probabilities that at the time of committing the act alleged in the indictment, the appellant was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of her acts, or if she did know it, that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong. It has been held that a person does not know that what he/she was doing was wrong when he/she does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons, or when he/she cannot reason with some modest degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he/she is doing: R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190.

42In R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108, the relevant principles were summarised by RA Hulme J at [19]-[21]: 

""[19] In relation to the concept of a 'disease of the mind' which produces such a defect of reason, the law requires that the accused's state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition. The condition may be temporary or of long standing. It does not matter whether it is curable or incurable. It must result in the function of the reason, memory or understanding of the person being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what she was doing, in that she did not know the physical nature or quality of her acts, or did not know that those acts were wrong, that is, wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.

[20] As to whether the accused did not know the acts to be wrong, the question is whether the accused could be said to know, in the sense of appreciating or understanding that the acts were wrong, if through a disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind she could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people, would make that act right or wrong.

[21] A final matter to observe is that if through a disordered condition of the mind the accused could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it would be open to find that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong."" 

43In the proceedings before the trial judge, his Honour referred to the M'Naghten test and quoted well-known passages on the test formulated by Dixon J (as his Honour then was) in R v Porter, supra, at 198-190: Judgment at pp 10-11.

44The trial judge, at pp 11-12, also referred to the judgments of the High Court in Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 56; 86 CLR 358 at 367, Sodeman v R (supra) at 215 and Willgoss v R (supra) at 295.

45His Honour's analysis of the mental illness defence unsurprisingly turned to a significant extent upon the expert medical evidence adduced at trial together with evidence of the factual matters concerning the alleged offences as set out in the Statement of Alleged Facts. 

46The Crown case was that the appellant did not suffer, in the relevant period, from a mental illness. If mental illness was established then the Crown contended that she did not lack the capacity to understand that what she did on each occasion was wrong.

47In order to support its case, the Crown tendered the detailed report of Professor Greenberg dated 27 May 2010. Professor Greenberg also attended for cross-examination. 

48There were two principal issues in relation to the defence, both of which were the subject of conflicting expert opinion evidence. The first was the issue of diagnosis. The second, depending upon the answer to the first, was the issue of the appellant's capacity to understand that her alleged acts were wrong. In the discussion that follows each of these two issues will, for convenience, be referred to as ""the First Issue"" and ""the Second Issue"".

49In relation to the First Issue, Professor Greenberg's evidence was:

1) That the appellant did not suffer from a disease of the mind. Professor Greenberg considered her to have what he described as ""severe personality dysfunction"" and as ""personality disorder"": Professor Greenberg's Report 27 May 2010, respectively at pp 19 and 21

2) That the appellant did not suffer from a ""Bipolar I Disorder"", ""Bipolar II Disorder"" or ""Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)"": Professor Greenberg's Report at p 21

3) That the appellant did not suffer from ""a disease of the mind"" during the relevant period: Professor Greenberg's Report at p 22.

50On the Second Issue, Professor Greenberg's evidence was that, in his opinion, the appellant understood ""... the wrongness of her actions during that time"": Professor Greenberg's Report at p 23.

51Professor Greenberg's evidence on both issues conflicted with the expert evidence of the two consultant psychiatrists called in the defence case, Dr Richardson and Dr Nielssen. Both diagnosed the appellant as having been mentally ill in the relevant period. In particular they considered:

(i) That the appellant suffered from a disease of the mind throughout the relevant five-month period, being Bipolar I Disorder.

(ii) That the Bipolar I Disorder during that period resulted in the appellant being in a manic state 

""... racing and disorganised thinking during which she was unable to recognise that her actions were morally wrong or to reason with sense and composure about the consequences of her actions."": Dr Nielssen's Report of 22 December 2009 at p 7. 

52Dr Richardson expressed a similar opinion in his report dated 9 July 2010, at p 2.

53The trial judge, on the First Issue, accepted the opinion evidence of Dr Richardson and that of Dr Nielssen, that is that, contrary to the opinion of Professor Greenberg, the appellant had suffered in the relevant period from a Bipolar Disorder Type I condition, which his Honour observed, 

""... is a manic depressive illness"": Judgment at p 10.

54On the Second Issue, the trial judge, however, concluded: 

""... I prefer the opinion expressed by Professor Greenberg to that of Dr Nielssen so far as knowing what was she was doing was wrong in accordance with the legal definition ..."": Judgment at pp 31-32.

55His Honour also said that he did not agree with Dr Richardson's opinion and stated: 

""... I prefer the Professor's opinion having analysed the evidence and having set out earlier parts of that analysis. I found his opinion to be logical and soundly based. I was not as confident of Dr Nielssen's opinion ..."": Judgment at p 32. 

56The full passage from the judgment from which this quote is taken as follows:

""I have given reasons as to why I do not agree with the opinion of Dr Richardson, who supports the defence. I prefer the Professor's opinion, having analysed the evidence and having set out earlier parts of that analysis. I found his opinion to be logical and soundly based. I was not as confident of Dr Nielssen's opinion. It seems to me that, at least in part, he based it on the bizarre nature of the accused's behaviour and therefore concluded that she must have been suffering a manic episode. I do not agree with that finding. I do not agree with the finding that she did not understand what she was doing was morally wrong, and I do not believe it can be made, on any basis, once you start to analyse the evidence of what she was doing, and what she herself has said."" (T at p 32)

57Two fundamental matters arise concerning the judicial method employed by the trial judge in arriving at his ultimate conclusion that the defence of mental illness had not, on the balance of probabilities, been made out:

1. The trial judge proceeded upon the basis that Professor Greenberg's opinion should be accepted on the Second Issue over that of Drs Richardson and Nielssen, notwithstanding that the opinion expressed by Professor Greenberg on the First Issue (that the appellant did not have a disease of the mind) was rejected. As indicated in the above discussion the trial judge accepted the evidence of Drs Richardson and Nielssen that the appellant had suffered a Bipolar I Disorder.

2. Professor Greenberg's opinion as to the First Issue, however, constituted a significant basis upon which his Honour proceeded to analyse the Second Issue. The trial judge, however, did not explain how Professor Greenberg's opinion on the First Issue could not or did not affect or impact on the validity of his conclusion on the Second Issue.

58Professor Greenberg's opinion on the Second Issue relied to a significant extent upon evidence on the following matters:

(a) The appellant's apparent ability to carry on with her work duties in the relevant period.

(b) That if she suffered from a high mood state, consistent with Bipolar Disorder, that that would have been noticeable to others, including fellow employees.

(c) Statements made by the appellant and her conduct were indicative of what might here be termed furtiveness or an awareness of wrongdoing, eg, hiding behind tree when the Headmaster was reportedly approaching, telling one boy that if anyone found out she would go to jail, etc: See Professor Greenberg's Report last pp 23-24.

59The evidence of Dr Richardson, and particularly the evidence of Dr Nielssen, addressed each of the matters (a), (b) and (c) above. Both considered the particular matters that provided the context in which each was to be considered.

60Whilst the trial judge referred to the fact that he had had regard to all of the evidence, his Honour did not address the evidence given by Drs Richardson and Nielssen on each of the matters referred to in (a), (b) and (c) above. The trial judge failed to explain the basis for according the significance he attached to the evidence of Professor Greenberg on the Second Issue in light of contrary evidence given by Drs Richardson and Nielssen on those particular matters (which evidence is discussed below).

61In particular the trial judge did not identify any basis for not accepting the evidence Dr Nielssen on the matters in [58] (a), (b) or (c) above. 

Analysis undertaken by the trial judge
62The trial judge set out several references to the evidence given by each consultant psychiatrist. The specific references in that respect are to be found at pp 22-26 of the judgment. 

63The trial judge then commenced his analysis by identifying factors that pointed in the direction of supporting the mental illness defence and to those he considered pointed the other way. His Honour posed for himself the question:

""What evidence is there which would assist me to know that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong?"" (T at 27)

64Reference was then made to four aspects of the evidence that pointed in favour of the defence:

(1) That the appellant's behaviour was ""totally bizarre, especially for a female. Dr Nielssen said he had never heard of a behaviour of this type before, although I have got to say Professor Greenberg said he had."": Judgment at p 27-29.

(2) Dr Nielssen's evidence to the effect that in his clinical experience the people in a ""manic state"" do try and hide what they are doing providing examples of patients engaging in sexual activity but ensuring at all relevant times that they did so in private.

(3) Evidence that the appellant had gone on ""... a spending spree which was consistent with manic behaviour..."".

(4) Dr Nielssen's expressed opinion that that appellant did not know what she was doing was legally or morally wrong: Judgment p 28.

65The trial judge then proceeded to refer to a number of matters that pointed in the opposite direction. These were clearly matters to which his Honour gave considerable weight. They were matters that had been raised by Professor Greenberg. However, as observed above, his Honour failed to refer to the evidence of Dr Nielssen on each of the matters which, if accepted, would diminish the significance that Professor Greenberg had attached to them. They were as follows:

(1) That as he understood it, the appellant had never said that she did not know that what she was doing was either legally or morally wrong. However, having said that his Honour also observed that the appellant had given a history to Professor Greenberg in which she said ""... that she did not understand the wrongness of her actions at the time."": Judgment p 28.

(2) Certain statements made by the appellant. These included:
(i) The appellant's statement to JP that what she was doing was ""severe on her"" and if she was found out she would go to jail;
(ii) The appellant's statement that she felt what she had done was the wrong thing by God, her parents and the school. (However, it was also noted that there was also some mention that she did not understand the wrongness of her actions): Judgment p 28.


(3) His Honour considered the appellant's general appearance or presentation to others did not reveal that the appellant seemed to be manic or that her behaviour in life in general was abnormal. In particular, his Honour noted that she continued to work apparently at her normal level of skill. There was no evidence of the appellant behaving in an abnormal manner at home and that she apparently continued to do housework. It was noted that there was an absence of certain symptoms which some doctors had said would be likely to be found in someone in a manic state. There was also no evidence of her seeking sexual partners when she was away from the school.

66The trial judge discussed the above matters as pointing against mental illness: Judgment at pp 28-31. Two of the matters to which Professor Greenberg gave particular emphasis were:

(1) The apparent ability of the appellant to lead a ""normal"" life during the period of the alleged offending. Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that this was inconsistent with the proposition that she did not understand that what she was doing was wrong: Professor Greenberg's evidence at T 21.

(2) Statements and conduct by the appellant which it was said indicated awareness and an attempt by her to avoid detection: Professor Greenberg's Report 27 May 2010 at p 23.

67As discussed above, Dr Nielssen addressed each of these matters. In particular, he explained why he did not consider they undermined his opinion on either the First or Second Issues. Earlier in his judgment the trial judge described Dr Nielssen as ""a well-qualified psychiatrist and respected psychiatrist ..."": Judgment at p25. The failure to refer to Dr Nielssen's evidence on those particular matters appears to be an inadvertent omission.

68As to the first, the trial judge observed:

""As I see it, certainly in the facts given to me, if you take out the bizarre sexual behaviour with the boys, there is no evidence of her behaving in an abnormal manner during the period over which these offences were committed; that is, her behaviour in life in general. She was able to continue working. She was able to, apparently, work at her normal level of skills. There is nothing in the boys' evidence, once you take away the sexual behaviour, which would indicate she was behaving in an abnormal manner. There was no evidence she was behaving in an abnormal manner at home. She apparently continued to do her housework and there was not evidence of some of the symptoms, which the doctors expressed the view, that you would be likely to find in someone who was in a manic state."" Judgment at p 28-29.

69In evidence in chief, Dr Richardson was referred to Professor Greenberg's report (third paragraph, p 23) in which he stated that persons with Bipolar Disorder were impaired in terms of occupational functioning during periods of mania. Dr Richardson observed that whilst persons who suffer from the disorder invariably have severe impairment in their social world and in occupational functioning during periods of mania, he said in relation to the appellant's occupation: 

""... but it wasn't a particularly onerous position as housemother in this boarding school. It's not likely that people were looking over her shoulder or even suspecting what was going on. So I think in that - in an environment in which she wasn't being closely watched it could be easily got away with those big issues."" (T 30 November 2010 at p 8).

70He was then asked the question:

""Q: Sir the examples that the Professor is talking about where [CJ] made numerous entries into the hospital records which were in the Professor's opinion coherent, neat and with recorded temperatures, that's not necessarily something that indicates that Bipolar Disorder is not present?

A: I think that's a small matter that she's able to complete, take someone's temperature and write it down on a piece of paper neatly. She could well have been able to do that and still have been quite manic."" (T p 8).

71Dr Nielssen said that whilst usually a major manic depressive episode prevented a person from doing their job he added:

""There's a number of very successful people with bipolar, for example a number of actors and writers and business people some well-known who really profited from their periods of elevated mood."" (T 2 December 2010 at p 63). 

72Dr Nielssen was asked about work entries that had been made by the appellant and as to whether they were significant on the issue of her ability to function. He replied: 

""A: I mean, it doesn't make any difference, you know, she knows what day it is, she knows how to get home, she knows what she's supposed to be doing, they're pretty coherent entries on the whole, perhaps a little bit long which is consistent with hypomania, they tend to talk a lot.

Q: But they're coherent, appropriate, indicating as far as we can tell that she was treating and dealing with these students in an appropriate, apparently professional fashion?

A: Yes.

...

Q: Yes; are all these notes inconsistent with mania, do you think?

A: Well, not inconsistent, I think you can still go about your normal roles, but they don't concern the presence either. (T p 76).

73On the issue as to whether the manic symptoms would be apparent to others, Dr Richardson was asked:

""Q: Similarly, the Professor talks about that no other staff member noted any hypomanic symptoms such as grandiosity, pressured speech or excessive involvement in pleasurable activities in that period.

A: They might well have been oblivious, it would depend on how well they knew [the appellant] most people who have got an elevated affect just come across as being good fun to be with. People aren't suspicious that their mood is falsely elevated. They tend to radiate good humour, so people see them as well as they do themselves ..."" (T p 8). 

74Dr Nielssen was asked:

""Q: And I think what Professor Greenberg also had to say is a descriptor of manic episode under Bipolar Disorder would be so evident to people around the person that those characteristics would stand out. Is that your understanding of manic episodes?

A: No, not necessarily, certainly not to a lay person. A lay person may just see you as being in an abnormally good mood, not that it was hypomanic. They might see you as seeing yourself very happily, very cheerily, being very busy, very energetic, talking about holiday plans or shopping plans or a lay person may not recognise the person to be hypermanic because there's no clear abnormality of the form of thought unless you try and engage in a long conversation and find the person can't keep on the one topic, it may not be evident to people around you that you are hypomanic."" T 53.

75He gave evidence to the same effect at page 62 of the Transcript.

76Dr Nielssen also gave the following evidence:

""Q: So you can in your typical day to day pattern of normal roles apparently function normally to everybody, but just this one area of behaviour where you can't reason?

A: I think most people would have noticed that she was in a good mood, but to a lay person that's all they would, might have appeared."" T 76

...

""Q: And if somebody worked at a school for 2 years and this occurred in the second year and no-one noticed when the person changed in mood in the second year, would that give you pause in relation to your diagnosis of the mania?

A: Yeah, small difference, usually some signs of elevated mood but just depending how closely people paid attention to her."" T 77

77In relation to the significance, if any, to be attached to particular statements made by the appellant and what may be described as displaying furtive conduct by her or conduct to avoid detection, Professor Greenberg's analysis was accepted by the trial judge and was relied upon for the proposition that such conduct was inconsistent with Bipolar Disorder Type 1. The trial judge set out, at page 30 of the Judgment, a number of instances of conduct by the appellant referred to by the trial judge as: 

""... she was being careful that she was not caught with the boys."" Judgment at p 30. 

78The trial judge then added: 

""... I need to take that into account, together with those matters set out when Professor Greenberg questioned her at p 10 of his report and that there she stated that what they were doing was severe on her; if anyone found out she would go to jail. She stated that JP was under-age and that she would get into trouble but did not care."" Judgment at p31

79The trial judge a little later then stated his conclusion:

""Having reviewed all those matters and having to consider the evidence totally, and particularly having read, on a number of occasions, the evidence, particularly of Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg, and also considered the evidence of Dr Richardson, I have reached the conclusion that I prefer the opinion expressed by Professor Greenberg to that of Dr Nielssen as far as knowing that what she was doing was wrong in accordance with the legal definition."" Judgment p31-32.

80Before stating that conclusion, however, the trial judge did not refer to the evidence of Dr Nielssen specifically directed to the issue of furtive or ""avoidance"" conduct.

81Dr Nielssen stated that patients who suffered from Bipolar Disorder and who engaged in sexual activity with others, in his experience, took steps to do so in circumstances that would maintain privacy around such activities. He additionally stated that a person suffering from Bipolar Disorder may have some awareness that a particular act was wrong in the sense of being a ""legal wrong"" without having the ability in the manic state to appreciate that it was ""morally wrong"". He said that he had been aware of the fact that the appellant had sought to hide what was going on. He was asked:

""Q: To go to a secluded place and have sex with one or more of the boys; does that affect your opinion regarding her knowledge of wrongfulness or wrongdoing?

A: No it doesn't. I mean, it does indicate an awareness that other people would disapprove. It indicates an awareness of the nature of the act but her perspective in a very elevated and enthusiastic state is that it is not morally wrong and that is the distinction I would make.

Q: On one occasion she indicated to one of the boys I think that if she was caught, something along these lines, if she or they were caught, she'd go to jail because the boys were underage?

A: Yes.

Q: What do you have to say about that?

A: Well again it does indicate her knowledge of a legal wrong of the behaviour but my experience of the mental illness defence that is not the test to be applied here. The policeman at the elbow test is not a test of mental illness defence."" T 59-60.

82A little later Dr Nielssen explained that the appellant had: 

""... some knowledge it was legally wrong but in her state she wasn't able to recognise it was morally wrong ..."" T 60 lines 30-33.

83He was then asked:

""Q: Where is the correlation with [the appellant] with that type of example? [Referring to the 'policeman at the elbow test']

A: Well, the mentally ill person is unable to reason with a sense of composure at the time, they are mentally ill at the time, and their behaviour is due to mental illness and the suicide attempts are due to the effects of mental illness. If there had been someone there to pull them up, they might not have done but they did it."" T 60 lines 40-46.

84In cross examination it was put to Dr Nielssen that the appellant had acted so as to avoid detection:

""Q: On page 2 with respect to Count 1 at paragraph 6, the accused said: 'We've got to do it in some place secret, some place safe, like safe'. Now as I understand your evidence, you say that the accused could say this yet still think that it was not wrong what she was doing?

A: Well, not morally wrong but legally wrong. Again I use the analogy of the manic females in psychiatric wards. They don't have sex in the open areas, they go to the bathroom or to their rooms."" T 67.

85Dr Nielsen was again asked about activities such as turning off the torch, pulling curtains closed, shutting doors, her concern that the victim not tell anyone. He was asked:

""Q: Isn't that consistent with knowledge of moral wrongfulness?

A: Again, I rely on the defect of reason associated with abnormally elevated mood, where there's an abnormal optimum enthusiasm, racing thoughts, lack of capacity to stop and reflect on how wrong it is in a moral sense. There's an awareness it's illegal, that other people disapprove but have trouble to follow, but in the manic state just think it's a good idea at the time.

Q: There can still be the thought that it is a good idea with an understanding of the moral wrongfulness, can't there?

A: Yes, I can see how that might be the case in the person who wasn't manic. But the loss of judgment and the loss of her capacity to reason that's associated with this kind of mental illness is overawing and deprives you of that moral judgment."" T 68 lines 17-20.

86The evidence of Professor Greenberg did not deal with the specific considerations which Dr Nielssen considers were of importance in the evaluation of the appellant's mental condition. In particular, he did not make the distinction between ""legal wrongfulness"" and ""moral wrongfulness"" as the basis for the test of mental illness. 

Conclusions 
87The judicial method to be applied in resolving conflicting expert evidence required the trial judge to consider and take into account Dr Nielssen's evidence on the matters on which Professor Greenberg had placed particular reliance. In several of his answers Dr Nielssen, as an experienced forensic psychiatrist, drew upon his clinical experience of treating patients with Bipolar Disorders. Consideration of his evidence based on that experience was essential in a proper evaluation of the mental illness defence.

88The failure by the trial judge to consider the evidence of Dr Nielssen on the issues discussed above raises the question as to the adequacy of the basis upon which the trial judge proceeded in saying that he preferred the opinion of Professor Greenburg over that of Dr Nielssen on the issue of the appellant's knowledge of the wrongfulness of her actions. 

89In summary, there are two difficulties associated with the trial judge's stated preference for Professor Greenberg over Dr Nielssen. First, as earlier noted, Professor Greenberg proceeded throughout upon the basis that the appellant did not have a mental illness at the time of the alleged offences. Accordingly, his opinion on the question of ""wrongfulness"" was at the least influenced by his firm opinion to that effect. This was significant in a case in which an affirmative finding was made that the appellant had suffered from a mental illness in the relevant period.

90Second, the trial judge relied upon matters raised by Professor Greenberg as being inconsistent with an inability in the appellant to understand that the alleged acts committed by her were ""wrong"" without taking into account the contrary views expressed on those matters by Dr Nielssen. In such circumstances, a statement preferring one expert witness' opinion over that of another does not satisfy accepted principles of judicial decision-making.

91In Alchin v Daley [2009] NSWCA 418, Sackville AJA, with whom McColl and Young JJA agreed, observed:

""[35] ... 

(iii) The extent and content of the reasons will depend on the particular case and the issues under consideration, but it is essential to expose the reasoning on a point critical to the contest between the parties ... see Soulemezis v Dudley, at 259, per Kirby P; at 280, per McHugh JA. This may require the judge to refer to evidence which is critical to the proper determination of the issue in dispute (at [62]): Beale v GIO (1997) 48 NSWLR 430, at 443, per Meagher JA.""

In that case it was stated:

""Accordingly, the content of the obligation is not the same for every judicial decision. No mechanical formula can be given in determining what reasons are required. However, there are three fundamental elements of a statement of reasons, which is useful to consider. First, a judge should refer to relevant evidence. There is no need to refer to the relevant evidence in detail, especially in circumstances where it is clear that the evidence has been considered. However, where certain evidence is important or critical to the proper determination of the matter and it is not referred to by the trial judge, an appellate court may infer that the trial judge overlooked the evidence or failed to give consideration to it.': North Sydney Council v Ligon 302 Pty Ltd (1995) 87 LGERA 435. Where conflicting evidence of a significant nature is given, the existence of both sets of evidence should be referred to."" (Emphasis added).

92The judicial duty to provide reasons may have a particular content where a trial judge is required to resolve differences of opinion between properly qualified reputable experts. In a passage which has been frequently cited with approval in New South Wales, in Flannery v. Halifax Estate Agencies Limited [2000] 1 WLR 377 (at 381 - 382; 377 - 378), Henry LJ said:

""It is not a useful task to attempt to make absolute rules as to the requirement for the Judge to give reasons. This is because issues are so infinitely various. For instance, when the Court, in a case without documents depending on eye-witness accounts is faced with two irreconcilable accounts, there may be little to say other than the witnesses for one side were more credible ... but with expert evidence, it should usually be possible to be more explicit in giving reasons: see Bingham LJ in Eckersley v. Binnie (1988) 18 Con LR 1 at 77 - 78: 

'In resolving conflicts of expert evidence the Judge remains the Judge; he is not obliged to accept evidence simply because it comes from an illustrious source; he can take account of demonstrated partisanship and lack of objectivity. But, save where an expert is guilty of a deliberate attempt to mislead (as happens only very rarely) a coherent reasoned opinion expressed by a suitably qualified expert should be the subject of a coherent reasoned rebuttal, unless it can be discounted for other good reasons ...' 

...

[w]here the dispute involves something in the nature of an intellectual exchange, with reasons and analysis advanced on either side, the Judge must enter into the issues canvassed before him and explain why he prefers one case over the other ...

[See Moylan v. Nutrasweet Co. [2000] NSWCA 337; Mistral International Pty Ltd v. Polstead Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 321; Archibald v. Byron Shire Council (2003) 129 LGERA 311; Wiki v. Atlantis Relocations (NSW) Pty Ltd (2004) 60 NSWLR 127 at 136 [60] - 138 [68]].

93It is plain, having regard to the issue in dispute and the conflict in the expert evidence, that it was critical for the trial judge to analyse and evaluate the evidence of each witness before determining whether or not the appellant had discharged the onus upon her to establish the mental illness defence.

94An evaluation of the whole of the evidence required particular consideration of the statements made by the appellant which, taken at face value, could be construed as acknowledgements by her that she understood that what she was doing was wrong. However, there was expert evidence, in particular, that of Drs Richardson and Nielssen, that established that such statements may properly be taken as retrospective statements rather than as statements reflecting the appellant's state of mind contemporaneously with the particular acts in question. 

95Likewise a complete understanding of the medical evidence was critical in evaluating and determining the nature and/or level of knowledge or understanding of the appellant and whether or not any awareness of the legal wrongness of her acts was sufficient in the circumstances of the case to also establish that she knew that her acts were also wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons as against ""wrong"" in the legal sense of that term. A further or related consideration was whether or not the appellant, in the manic phases of her disorder, was or was not able to reason with a modest degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what she was doing: Sodeman v the King (supra) at 215 per Dixon J (as his Honour then was); Stapleton v the Queen (supra) at 367 (per Dixon CJ, Webb and Kitto JJ).

96The failure by the sentencing judge to analyse all of the evidence, in my opinion, constituted appellable error resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

97For the above reasons, as earlier noted, the Court made orders allowing the appeal and quashing the conviction and remitting the proceedings to the District Court for retrial. 

98In pronouncing its orders on 24th July 2012, the Court omitted to make an order in respect of the appellant's application for an extension of time. The error in this respect represents a slip or omission. The appeal was argued and dealt with upon the basis that an extension of time should be granted, the Crown not opposing the same. The Court accordingly should correct the error pursuant to the power conferred by s 12(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and Rule 36.17 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005. 

99I propose the following orders:
(1) The period for which the appellant's notice of intention to appeal has effect is extended to 19th December 2011.
(2) That the following orders of the Court made on 24 July 2012 be confirmed:
(1) Appeal allowed.
(2) Convictions quashed.
(3) The matter be remitted to the District Court for retrial.

100CAMPBELL J: The reasons of Hall J express why I joined in the orders of the Court pronounced on 24 July 2012 and I have nothing to add, save that I agree with order (1) proposed in [99] of his Honour's reasons.

2760707,R v Purtill [2012] NSWSC 1475,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR: The offender was found guilty after trial on 15 June 2012 of the murder of John Garda on 8 February 2010 at Lennox Head on the north coast of New South Wales.  The offender killed the deceased by cutting his throat with a knife.  The murder took place at the offender's home, which the deceased had visited alone that afternoon.  He was 60 years old at the time of his death.  He died at the scene from the wound to his neck and his body was later taken from the premises and buried in a bush grave by the offender and his brother.  The offender was arrested on 26 February 2010 and has remained in custody since that time.
2The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  In the event that a determinate sentence is imposed, a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies.  In proceeding to determine the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by considering whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 20 years. Similarly, I am not required to make an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]).  The relevant statutory provisions generally, and the provisions of ss 55B(2), 54B(3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in particular, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment is reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]).   The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"".  It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27] and [31]).
3I acknowledge that my fact-finding role is that described in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587.  I am required to find the facts material to the sentence.  To the extent that my findings are based on facts led at the trial, they must be consistent with the verdict of the jury.  Any findings of fact that are adverse to the offender must be found beyond reasonable doubt.  Matters in mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202.  A judge's finding of facts upon which the sentence is based is ""both what was necessarily implicit in the jury verdict and on his/her own impressions"": R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [196].
Background facts
4The deceased was a businessman with interests in the Byron Bay area.  On the afternoon of 8 February 2010 he went missing.  This was not reported to the police until two days later.  One of the last people to have seen him before his disappearance was a local real estate agent in Byron Bay with whom the deceased had met at about 4.00pm.
5The offender lived at that time with his partner Tanya Barbaro and their young child in a house owned by the offender in Blue Seas Parade, Lennox Head.  He was then almost 39 years of age.  Sometime on 8 February 2010 Ms Barbaro left the family home with their son and checked into accommodation at the Byron at Byron resort at nearby Suffolk Park.  They spent the night of 8 February 2010 at that resort.   Later during the afternoon of 8 February 2010 the deceased visited the offender's home.  A car similar to one owned by the deceased was seen parked on the lawn outside the house.
6Lily Richardson was a young woman who lived in a flat downstairs at the same address.  She rented the premises from the offender.  She arrived home at approximately 2.15pm on the afternoon of 8 February 2010.  She saw a man fitting the description of the deceased in the kitchen of the offender's house as she walked from the street to the lower rear of the premises where she lived.  She entered her flat and watched a DVD.
7Lily Richardson knew Warren Purtill, who is the offender's older brother.  He visited Ms Richardson's flat at about 3.30pm and they watched a DVD together.  Not long after this Ms Richardson heard raised voices coming from the offender's house upstairs.  She heard the offender yelling ""you fucking cunt"" a few times and then a thud like something hitting the floor.  She heard similar sounds after that and then the sound of another male voice screaming out apparently in pain.  Ms Richardson continued to hear the offender yelling.
8At this point Warren Purtill got up and ran up the back stairs at the outside rear of the premises and knocked on the offender's kitchen door.  He asked to be let in.  At this point all the noise coming from the upstairs premises stopped.  Warren Purtill then came back down the stairs and told Ms Richardson to keep all of her doors and windows closed.  He told her to stay inside.  Shortly thereafter the offender's kitchen door slid open.  Ms Richardson then overheard a conversation between the brothers taking place upstairs but she could not discern what was being said.  A short time after this Ms Richardson noticed blood coming through the ceiling of her flat from upstairs.  She immediately rang a friend and asked to be picked up.
9Ms Richardson returned to the flat the following day and spoke to Warren Purtill.  He did not tell her the truth about what had occurred the previous day.  In due course Warren Purtill was charged with, and later pleaded guilty to, being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased.  That occurred after Warren Purtill gave an undertaking to give evidence in proceedings against the offender.  Warren Purtill was later sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and received a discount in return for his undertaking.  He gave evidence at the trial of the offender.  His evidence was the only independent account of what took place from the point when he was let into the offender's premises following the commotion about which Ms Richardson gave evidence.
10Warren Purtill said he heard banging and crashing coming from upstairs and someone screaming at the top of his voice saying, ""I'll kill you, you fucking cunt"".  He went upstairs and banged on the kitchen door and said, ""It's me, Wozza, open up"".  All went quiet inside the house, except Warren Purtill said that he could hear the sound of someone rummaging around.  As he started to walk away the offender called out, ""Is that you Warren?""  Warren replied, ""Yeah"".  The offender said, ""Are you there alone?""  Warren said, ""Yeah"", and then the offender opened the door.
11When Warren entered the kitchen he saw blood everywhere.  The offender told him to have a look around the corner.  When he did so he saw the deceased lying on the floor up against a white counter.  His eyes were open but he was dead.  Warren asked the offender what had happened.  The offender said that the deceased had tried to kill him.  Warren said that they had to call the police.  The offender replied, ""We can't call the cops, this guy hangs around with heavy hitters.""
12The offender had cuts to both of his hands, one of which was severe. Warren said that blood was spurting from the wound.  He bandaged the offender's hand.  Warren went to the bathroom to use the toilet but the toilet bowl was smashed.  There was blood everywhere in the bathroom as well.
13The offender and Warren Purtill talked over the next few hours.  The deceased's car was parked nearby.  Warren Purtill took the deceased's car keys from his shorts and drove his car to South Ballina where he parked it beside a hotel.  He also took a number of the deceased's credit cards from inside the vehicle.  He caught a taxi to the offender's home, stopping on the way to collect his canvas swag.  Upon his return the offender and Warren Purtill placed the deceased inside the canvas swag and loaded it into the rear of Warren's utility.  Warren then drove the body to a remote location approximately three kilometres south of Broadwater.  The offender travelled in the vehicle with him and directed him where to go.  Warren dug a shallow grave and placed the wrapped body of the deceased in the grave and covered it with sandy soil.
14Warren Purtill and the offender returned to the offender's home in the early hours of 9 February 2010.  The offender left for Brisbane later that day to stay with his family.  Warren Purtill stayed at the premises for several days and cleaned it.  He used chemicals and water to clean up blood and broken household items.  He purchased a new toilet to replace the one that had been broken when the deceased had been killed.  He installed the new toilet and disposed of the old one.
15On 10 February 2010 Warren Purtill returned to the deceased's vehicle and drove it to another location in South Ballina.  He left it there with the keys in the ignition.  On 12 February 2010 he returned to the car and drove it to the Pacific Fair shopping centre in Broadbeach, Queensland, where he left it in the car park.  In the days that followed Warren Purtill made a series of purchases using the deceased's credit cards.  Suspicions were raised concerning these transactions and the police were contacted.  
16On 16 February 2010 Warren Purtill was arrested and charged with fraud and larceny offences arising from the taking and use of the credit cards.  He was interviewed and told police that he had found the cards in a rubbish bin in Lennox Head.  He denied knowing the deceased.  He was refused bail.  On 17 February 2010 police executed a search warrant at the offender's home.  Some of the items purchased by Warren using the deceased's credit cards were located there.  Warren's utility was examined the following day and returned a positive test for the presence of blood.
17On 19 February 2010 Warren Purtill pleaded guilty in the Local Court to larceny and seven counts of obtaining a benefit by deception.  He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment commencing on 16 February 2010.
18On 26 February 2010 the offender attended Lismore Police station and handed investigators a map depicting the location of the body of the deceased.  He declined to participate in an interview with the police.  The deceased's body was located at the place indicated on the map.  The deceased was dressed in underpants and shorts and socks but was not wearing a shirt.  A surgical glove was on his right hand.  An autopsy revealed that a wound to the neck caused the death of the deceased.  The wound was relatively superficial at the front and much deeper on the right side and back.  The wound was consistent with having been inflicted by a knife using moderate force.  There was also a wound on the cheek but there were no injuries consistent with a struggle having occurred.  There were no defensive wounds on the deceased.  Death occurred on or around 8 February 2010.
19A later search of the offender's home located blood with the deceased's DNA profile.
20On 2 February 2011 Warren Purtill pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased, contrary to ss 18 and 349 of the Crimes Act 1900.  He was sentenced by me on 21 May 2012: see R v Purtill [2012] NSWSC 566.  He agreed to give evidence for the Crown at his brother's trial for the murder of the deceased.
The trial
21The offender gave evidence at his trial.  He denied that he killed the deceased but said instead that it was his brother who had done so.  It is apparent from the jury's verdict that they rejected the version of what occurred given by the offender.  Although not a complete record, the following extracts from the offender's evidence at the trial give a fair representation of what he said:
""Q.  5.30 or 6pm.  What happened?  From the time Jack arrives, if you could just take us through what happened? A.  He just came in, sat down and we had a beer and we were just chatting for a few minutes about different things.  And then I sort of had   I was little bit annoyed that   I asked him about meeting my brother and that and he sort of brushed it off.  And then, I don't know, we sat there for a couple of minutes and then he went into the bathroom, went into the toilet, and he was in there for a long time.  And I thought it was a bit weird and I sort of went up to the   I went sort of near the bathroom and I could hear him shuffling around in there.  And I said, ""Hey bro, what are you doing?""  He goes, ""Oh nothing mate, nothing.""  And then I thought he was up to something and I went and grabbed a key.  There's this little slot in the door and you can just pop the, pop the door open.  He had it locked because I did try and I popped it open...
...
Q.  What if anything to do with the bathroom on the outside? A.  I just opened it, opened it, unlocked it so I could get in, opened the door. 
Q.  Did you get in? A.  Yes, I did. 
Q.  What did you see inside the bathroom? A.  I walked in and Jack was standing there with a pair of gloves on, shuffling around with a bum bag.  And I just knew he was doing something dodgy.  I just sort of spun out.  I said, ""What are you fucking doing here cunt?""  I said that a couple of times and, yeah, I just went off my head at him. 
Q.  Do you remember anything else you said to him? A.  Just.  I just went, I just went off at him.  I was swearing abuse at him.  I said, ""What are you fucking doing, you must be doing something with my fucking brother.""  You know, ""You're getting in the shit"" because I didn't want any drugs allowed in my house.  And then, yeah, then I sort of went towards him.  I went for his bum bag.  He was sort of messing around with that as I came in the door.  I went towards his bum bag and he was sort of pushing me, pushing me out of the way and I slipped and hit the dunny toilet bowl.  I sort of hurt my rib a bit.  And I was, yeah, I sort of got really I was, you know, I sort of screamed a bit.  I hurt my rib.  And then I sort of got up, sat on the edge of the bath and I was in quite a bit of pain.  Still cursing at Jack and then, yeah. 
Q.  So you are still in the bathroom? A.  Yeah, yeah.  I was sitting on the edge.  I was sort of looking, I was sitting on   I was sitting on the edge of the bath next to the bathroom cabinets and stuff.  I sort of was looking in there because I thought he might have stashed something in the drawers.  I was sort of going through that and having a look to see if he was stashing anything in there. 
Q.  Did you find anything in those drawers?A.  No, there was nothing there.  Then I heard a knock at the door.  
Q.  Which door was that? A.  I just assumed that it was the front, the front door and opened the door and there was no one there and then I heard a knock at the back door.  I just heard a knock again and it have been the glass doors, the glass sliding door at the back of the house.  So I went to that.  I could hear Warren saying, ""Kev, Kev"" you know.  To me Wozza   I sort of   as I was coming towards the back door the door slid open and Wozza goes, ""Are you all right, are you all right"".  I said, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah"" and  
 DENNIS
Q.  How would you describe Warren's mood at that time? A.  He was a bit   it seemed he was worried about   I don't know, he was just sort of, ""Are you all right?""  He must have heard me   he must have heard us having a bit of an argument there, yeah. 
Q.  What, if anything, did you say in response to Warren asking you if you were all right? A.  Yeah, I said, ""yeah"", I said I was all right. 
Q.  Was there any other conversation between the two of you? A.  He was asking me, ""Where's Tanya?"", you know, ""Where's Tanya?""  I said, ""Staying down at Byron tonight"" and, yeah, and then he sort of   I sort of   I knew that they were doing   I said to him, ""What are you fucking cunts doing?""  And Warren just went, ""Oh"" you know, he sort of shrugged it off and then I sort of said, ""Whatever you cunts are doing, fucking do it, fuck off out of my house"".  I went out towards the front door and I thought Warren must have come with someone, some guy or whatever, because he'd been hanging around with this bloke up the top of the road.  I went out the front to see if he was there, there was no one there.  The way Warren was, like he was going   he was quite aggressive towards Jack and that and then I just sort of didn't want to know about it. 
Q.  You went outside; how long were you outside for? A.  Only a few minutes, a couple of minutes.  I just let them do whatever they were doing.  I'd sort of been out there   I sort of went to do the rubbish.  Tanya was always hassling me about   anyway, I went to pull the rubbish bin, it was rubbish day the next day.  I didn't really get to do it and then I came back inside and I saw Warren and Jack standing there and I saw Jack with blood coming from his neck.""
22The offender had previously given evidence that he had expected the deceased to come to his house on the day of the murder in order to pay Tanya for some cleaning work that she had done for the deceased.  Instead of a mundane visit, the deceased was to meet a violent death.  According to the version given by the offender, that occurred when his brother Warren entered the house without warning coincidentally while the offender had gone outside to attend to the garbage.  When he returned he was confronted with the deceased in an apparently mortally wounded condition standing beside his brother.  He said this:
""Q.  Could you just describe in some more detail where Warren and Jack were?  You say you had seen them when you came back inside? A.  There's like a little hallway in my house where the kitchen is.  I came in and then you come into the lounge room, got the lounge room there and the kitchen, and I sort of came around into the kitchen area, sort of at the end of the island bench, and they were standing there, sort of facing sort of towards the back door, back sliding door. 
Q.  And who was facing in what direction? A.  Warren they were sort of both facing the back. 
Q.  How were they positioned relative to each other? A.  Well they were side by side.  Jack.  Warren was facing directly towards the back door and Jack was sort of facing the back but on the side a bit.  I think he was closest to me on this side and Warren was on the other side. 
Q.  If you were to look at them, who was on the left, who was on the right, what was the position? A.  If you're facing the back door, Jack was on the left I think and Warren was on the right, if you're facing the back.  Not facing north, south. 
Q.  You saw them in that position; what, if anything, were they doing? A.  Warren had a pair of two knives in his   I looked down, I just saw a couple of knives in his hand. 
Q.  You're doing something with your hands, can you just describe that in words? A.  He had hold of knives.  Like he had two knives in his hand like that. 
Q.  You're indicating your right hand wrapped around. A.  I don't know which way, whatever, but he just had hold of knives. 
Q.  You're indicating two hands together? A.  Yes. 
Q.  Are you able to further describe how Warren had his two hands together? A.  Not really, no.  All I could notice, there was two knives in his hand, holding a pair of knives. 
Q.  What was Jack doing? A.  Jack was sort of standing there, sort of holding his wrists. 
HIS HONOUR
Q.  Holding whose wrists? A.  Warren's wrists. 
DENNIS
Q.  What happened next? A.  I just sort of.  I was in a bit.  I just saw the knives, I grabbed hold of the knives and they were actually facing.   All I could see was just basically I could see blood and I just spun out and I just saw the knives, I grabbed the knives and actually they were facing upwards, I didn't notice at the time, and I grabbed on to them pretty tight and that's how I got the wound.""
23That evidence contained the offender's explanation for the severe wound to one of his hands.  It conveyed the notion that he grabbed the upturned and exposed blade of a large knife with the palm of his unprotected hand.  It is unsurprising that the jury would appear clearly to have rejected that explanation.
Disposal of the deceased's body
24I have already outlined the circumstances in which the offender disposed of the body of the deceased. The Crown submitted that these actions constituted an aggravating factor.  On behalf of the offender, it was submitted that this was not so because his actions in this regard were ""post factum"".   It was further submitted that such actions were limited in any event. 
25It is well established that an offender's treatment of a deceased's body can amount to an aggravating factor: see for example Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126; R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315; (2006) A Crim R 126. This principle has been extended to cases where the treatment of a deceased's body by an offender did not involve any form of mutilation: R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170; R v Dong [2010] NSWSC 1242. By its very nature, any such treatment will necessarily be after the event. 
26In my view, the offender's treatment of the deceased's body, which on his own admission was carried out in an effort to avoid detection, is an aggravating factor. However, the degree of aggravation is obviously less than would have been the case had there been evidence of mutilation. In addition, accepting the evidence of Warren Purtill, the disposal and burial of the deceased's body was largely if not almost exclusively carried out by him with the offender as a willing but otherwise passive assistant.
Reasons for the offending
27As with much of what emerged in the trial, the reason for the offender's fatal attack upon the deceased remains a mystery.  It has been submitted on behalf of the offender, with which submission the Crown emphatically agrees, that the death of the deceased appears to have been the result of a drug transaction that went wrong.  It was submitted on behalf of the offender that there had been a sudden and unexpected disagreement about drugs.  The Crown accepted that formulation.  Beyond that apparently uncontroversial and general description of what might have occurred, however, no clear reason emerges as to why or in what interpersonal setting the offender killed the deceased. 
28Evidence from Mr Zohar Kohavi suggested that he had supplied the deceased on the day that he was murdered with a quantity of cocaine with an approximate value at that time of $86,000.  No cocaine was found at the offender's house following extensive forensic examination of the premises.  No traces of the drug were detected upon the deceased.  The fact that the deceased was discovered wearing a surgical glove was proffered as evidence of drug handling, but no other material gave any particular support to that suspicion.
29Nor is the picture clarified in any way by the offender's own evidence.  His version of what occurred is wholly at odds with facts that the jury must have found in arriving at its verdict.  The offender did not give evidence at his sentencing proceedings and in that sense at least must be taken to have adhered to the version of events originally given by him in evidence.
Conclusions as to objective seriousness
30The Crown contended that the offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  The offence was not planned and it was not premeditated.  It clearly enough involved the use of a weapon.  There was no provocation.
31It was conceded on behalf of the offender that the nature of the injury that caused the death of the deceased suggested on its face an intention to kill, viewed objectively from a position more than two years after the event.  Mr Dennis of counsel on behalf of the offender submitted however that the evidence of a struggle in the house, of which there was much, gave rise to the prospect of at least some doubt about the precise way in which the deceased was killed.  
32This has to be contrasted with the fact that the evidence also suggests that a right-handed assailant cutting his throat from left to right at a position behind the deceased fatally wounded him.  The offender is right handed.  Moreover, notwithstanding the evidence of a struggle, the body of the deceased showed no signs of injuries consistent with defending some kind of ongoing attack.  It was unlikely that the deceased could have continued to wrestle with the offender once the injury that ultimately caused his death had been inflicted, rather lending support to the proposition that his throat was cut at or towards the end of the altercation.
33The wound to the deceased was very severe.  It was long and deep and its infliction required at least moderate force.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in the circumstances that the offender cut the deceased's throat from behind using a kitchen knife of the sort described by Warren Purtill in his evidence. I am also satisfied that the offender inflicted that wound upon the deceased with an intention to kill him.
34I accept even notwithstanding that finding that the offence falls into the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type.
Subjective features
35Mr Sam Borenstein examined the offender on 10 August 2012 and he reported in writing the following day.  The offender was born in Brisbane, the youngest of three children.  His parents separated when he was about 12.  The offender described his father as ""a violent alcoholic"".  The offender and his mother left the family home at the time of the separation and the other two children stayed with their father.  Ultimately the offender's brother joined them but his sister remained with her father.
36The offender described his childhood as ""pretty tough"".  His father was particularly violent towards Warren Purtill although the offender himself also experienced some of this.  He returned to live with his father when he was about 14 and then began smoking marijuana with his father who was a heavy user.  Warren moved out at this time.
37The offender attended between four and five different schools and was described by Mr Borenstein as ""academically challenged"".  The offender recalls being told that he was dyslexic and suffered from attention deficit disorder.  He had difficulty reading and writing.  He read his first books in gaol. He completed Year 10 in Brisbane.
38The offender said that his sister was a lesbian and that he used to go out with her frequently to gay bars.  He experimented with his own sexuality and moved in with a gay bouncer who brutally raped him.  The offender was apparently then taking Rohypnol between the ages of 16 and 17 and eventually left the man who sexually abused him.  The offender was again later bashed and sexually abused by the same man when confronted on the street.  The offender described the man as ""very violent"".
39The offender sought refuge on Hamilton Island at the age of 17 where he became an apprentice chef.  While there he met an older woman with whom he remained in a relationship for five years.  They moved to Sydney and he took on a variety of jobs in the food and hospitality industry.  They then moved to Byron Bay where he opened a restaurant.  His partner met someone else and he continued to run the restaurant for about four years.  He developed a dependence on alcohol and illicit substances.
40The offender developed a heavy addiction to cocaine.  He travelled to Austria at the age of 26 for treatment where he stayed for some three months.  He told Mr Borenstein that his treatment in Austria saved his life.
41Upon his return to Australia the offender worked as a chef in bars and clubs in the Sydney area and lived off the proceeds of a successful sale of his Byron Bay restaurant.  He continued with his recreational use of drugs.  He confesses to always having had a problem with alcohol.  He conceded that he was an alcoholic.  During this time he had only occasional contact with his family although he remained quite close to his sister.
42The offender has not been the subject of any formal psychological counselling or therapy.  He has, however, participated over the years in self-development and self-improvement courses, including meditation.  Meditation and his therapy in Austria helped him successfully to overcome his cocaine habit.
43The offender said that he had had ""a lot of relationships"".  He has had three long-term relationships.  The offender told Mr Borenstein that he had a seven-year-old son from a relationship with a violent and aggressive alcoholic.  He also has a son aged two and half years from his relationship with Tanya Barbaro.
44The offender described suffering from anxiety, particularly in gaol.  He has completed a computer course since his incarceration and plans to complete his Higher School Certificate.  He maintains hope concerning his future.  His hobbies include woodwork, furniture restoration and home renovation.
45According to Mr Borenstein, the offender did not display any serious symptoms of psychiatric disorder such as psychosis.  His thought processes and content appeared to be normal.  There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance such as delusions or hallucinations.  The offender presented as cognitively intact.
46Mr Borenstein expressed the opinion that there was nothing in the offender's criminal or personal history to indicate violence or aggression.  He requires in-depth psychological therapy.

Contrition and remorse
47As I have earlier indicated, the offender did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings.  He maintained his innocence in what he is reported to have said to Mr Borenstein.  He has never accepted, as far as the evidence before me reveals, any responsibility for a role in the death of the deceased whatsoever.  No submissions were made on his behalf concerning either the existence or extent of any contrition or remorse that may have been discernible in the offender.  I am satisfied that he is wholly unremorseful and that he remains in a continuing state of denial about any part played by him in the murder of the deceased.
Aggravating factors
48The use of a weapon is an aggravating factor but not something that I consider should be further counted against the offender.  This is because I have already factored it into my assessment of where this offence lies in terms of its objective seriousness.
Mitigating factors
49As already noted, the offence was unplanned.  It was decidedly out of character, viewed in terms both of the offender's criminal history and in terms of the testimonial evidence led on his behalf at the sentencing proceedings.  There was also a considerable and helpful degree of co-operation to the authorities provided by the offender in terms of pre-trial disclosure: he effectively directed the police to the location where the body of the deceased was buried.
50The offender also has no criminal record of any particular relevance.  I note that the Crown submitted that the offender's record had ""some relevance"" but in the overall scheme of this offender I am unable to accept that submission or make use of it in any meaningful way in my determination of a proper sentence to be imposed upon him.  
General and specific deterrence
51The violent murder of the deceased has never been explained.  The offender's past foretold nothing of the events that took place at Blue Seas Parade in February 2010.  Just as there was nothing that suggested this offence would be committed, neither is there anything, including in my view even this particular offence, which suggests that the offender remains at risk of reoffending.  
52I do not consider that the offender will present any assessable or identifiable risk to the community of reoffending upon his release.  The very nature of this crime is particularly idiosyncratic.  It does not represent or form part of an existing chain or course of criminal conduct.  It appears to have occurred spontaneously and reactively to circumstances that remain unexplained.  The need for specific deterrence is therefore low.  The prospects for rehabilitation are in my view correspondingly high.
53In formulating that opinion I am aware that the offender continues to maintain his innocence and that he holds firm to the prospect that this will be recognised in the appeal he proposes to pursue.  That suggests a fundamental and continuing lack of insight with respect to the strength of the evidence against the offender at his trial and with respect to the frankly incredible account that he gave of what occurred when the deceased was killed.
54The gratuitous and unexplained nature of the offence warrants general denunciation.  Any sentence imposed upon the offender should reflect the gravity of the crime.
Special circumstances
55At the time of his arrest the offender was drinking five to ten schooners, four to five nights a week.  Mr Borenstein has referred to recreational drug use and a difficult childhood.  There are also some matters of a personal nature and a need for ongoing therapy.  This is also the offender's first full time custodial sentence
56The offender is currently housed at the Multi Purpose Unit at the Goulburn Correctional Centre where he has been since 21 October 2012.  He is classified as remand bed placement.  He has been managed with Special Management Area Placement at his own request, which was submitted upon his original reception on 21 February 2010.  The offender's current placement is based upon fears he has expressed for his own safety.  Details of these fears are scant, beyond a submission from counsel on his behalf that he fears some form of retribution from his brother, whom he attempted to inculpate at the trial, and Mr Kohavi who allegedly supplied the drugs to the deceased, who remains unpaid, and who is therefore allegedly vulnerable himself to others for their loss and potentially disgruntled and correspondingly vengeful.
57The consequence of his current protected status is that the offender is released from his cell for some hours less than otherwise would be the case if he were free to circulate among the general prison population and his current access to activities is also reduced.  This imposes a hardship upon him that means that his imprisonment will be more onerous than if he were not classified in this way.
58It must be noted that the fears said to have been expressed by the offender for his own safety relate only to his brother, who is due for consideration for release on parole on 15 May 2013, and Mr Kohavi, whose current prison term was not clarified, but which I understand is not extensive.  In these circumstances it is difficult to structure a sentence for this offender that effectively accommodates any hardship that he is likely to endure in the short term, having regard to the sentence that I am minded to impose.  Clearly enough, the concerns that the offender has expressed do not easily translate, if they translate at all, to a factor attracting variation of the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods.  I propose to take account of the fact that the offender will remain restricted and in protection for a short time.  However, I do not consider that this is a matter to which I can give any particularly great weight.
59I find in particular that none of the matters to which I have been referred in this context amounts in my opinion to special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
Provocation
60There was no evidence of provocation led at the trial and the defence of provocation was not left to the jury.  Even though Warren Purtill gave evidence that the offender told him that the deceased had tried to kill him, the offender wholly disavowed that version of events in the way that I have previously described.  Counsel for the offender nevertheless sought to rely upon provocation as a factor mitigating the objective criminality of the offence.  He did so according to the following principles.
61Section 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that evidence of provocation may be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor in sentencing.  In R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739, Hoeben J stated at [50]:
""[50] While provocation in law was not open to the degree that may have reduced murder to manslaughter, that is not to say that the question of provocation is not of relevance for an assessment of the prisoner's objective criminality. There were as I have found circumstances which did amount to provocation, albeit that they did not reach the level required to reduce murder to manslaughter, and accordingly provocation can be taken into account as mitigating the objective severity of the conduct of the prisoner.""
62To like effect in R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951, Studdert AJ considered that, while not amounting to a defence, evidence of provocation in combination with the offender's personality disorders and chronic anxiety had an impact upon his ability to exercise self-control.  At [39] his Honour said this:
""[39]... I find that what the deceased said, and her decision to replace him as a director and to ask him to leave the business altogether impacted on the self control of the offender and that there was a measure of loss of self control when this crime was committed. In making this finding I have regard to the medical evidence which I accept as to the offender's personality disorder and his chronic anxiety state. Those disorders accounted in part for the impact on the offender's self control.""
63A necessary precondition to the offender's reliance upon provocation in this way is evidence of some form of provocation in fact.  In the present circumstances, counsel for the offender sought to argue that evidence suggestive of a struggle between the offender and the deceased, in association with the offender's contemporaneous exclamation indicating anger or outrage, was at least consistent with some level of provocation.  Rhetorically speaking, why would the offender have killed the deceased as he did if not because of some form of provocative behaviour or words directed at him by the deceased?
64As superficially attractive at one level as that submission appears to be, it must in my view yield to the fact that it cannot be fairly reasoned or inferred from what little supporting material there is about it.  On the contrary, any conclusion about the existence or otherwise of some form of provocation favouring the offender exists at no higher than the level of speculation.   I am not in the circumstances satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has established that provocation is available as a mitigating factor to be considered for the purposes of his sentence.
Findings
65I am satisfied, consistently with the jury's verdict, of the following facts beyond reasonable doubt.  The deceased attended the offender's home for the purposes of some drug-related transaction, involving the sale or the supply by the deceased to the offender of a quantity of drugs, probably cocaine.  In circumstances that remain largely unexplained, a violent disagreement erupted between the two men.  The offender ultimately killed the deceased by cutting his throat violently from behind using a large knife.  I find that in doing so the offender intended to kill the deceased.  The offender's partner Tanya Barbaro had earlier been told to go to a nearby resort in order for her to be absent from the premises when the drug transaction was to take place.  The offender's brother and Lily Richardson who were together in the flat downstairs overheard the commotion and what I find was a violent struggle between the offender and the deceased that culminated in his death.  Warren Purtill went upstairs and was eventually let into the house by the offender at some time shortly following the death of the deceased.  The deceased was then seen by Warren to be lying as described by him on the kitchen floor against an island bench.  Neither the offender nor Warren called the police.  Warren took charge of disposing of the body of the deceased by wrapping it in his canvas swag and driving with the offender to a nearby bushland setting in his utility where the deceased's body was buried.  Warren spent several days cleaning the house and disposing of what remained of the deceased's possessions and his car.  The offender left for Queensland and ultimately approached police with information about the location of the deceased's body.
Victim impact statement
66A victim impact statement from the sister of the deceased was read aloud to the Court by her daughter.  She spoke of her own reaction to the death, as well as that of the extended family.  All of these people would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in various and personal ways.  The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for them and the rest of the family.  Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and friends who remember him.  I am, however, mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.
Conclusions and orders
67I have already indicated that I accept that this offence falls to be considered as an offence in the middle range of seriousness for offences of its type.  Such a conclusion does not thereby lead to the automatic imposition of the standard non-parole period for murder.  All factors in favour of and against the offender have to be considered and included in the process of reasoning that leads to the calculation of what is a proper sentence in this case.  I have approached the matter in that way.
68It follows from the findings that I have made that the deceased met an unexpected and particularly violent death.  The reason for the offender's attack upon him remains unexplained and, except in the most general and speculative way, inexplicable.  The only living witness to the events that occurred is the offender, whose version of events is patently incredible, and whose continued silence means that what actually happened may never be known.  
69Kevin Malcolm Purtill, for the murder of John Garda I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 28 years consisting of a non-parole period of 21 years commencing on 26 February 2010 and expiring on 25 February 2031 with a balance of term of 7 years commencing on 26 February 2031 and expiring on 25 February 2038.  The first date upon which you may be eligible for release on parole is 26 February 2031.

2760716,Kemp v R [2012] NSWCCA 281,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J: I agree with Adamson J.
2HARRISON J: I agree with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J: The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company, contrary to s 35(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act.
4Offences under s 35 of the Crimes Act have a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parol period of five years. Offences under s 93C of the Crimes Act have a maximum penalty of 10 years with no applicable standard non-parole period.
5The Sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences:
(1)for the s 35(1) offence, a total sentence of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, commencing 15 June 2011;
(2)for the s 93C offence, a fixed term of 12 months commencing 15 June 2011.
6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed for the s 35(1) offence. He takes no issue with the sentence for affray. The single ground of appeal is that the Sentencing Judge erred in his application of the principle of parity that resulted in disparity between the sentences that the applicant received and those imposed on his co-offenders.
The facts
7The facts surrounding the offences were established by an agreed statement of facts and closed circuit television footage that depicted parts the incident from various angles.
8At approximately 2.45 am on 10 April 2011, the victims, Tim Thorton (Thorton) and Kent England (England) were waiting for a northbound train at Gosford Railway Station together with Phil Scaturchio (Scaturchio).9 10At the same time the applicant was standing on an adjacent platform amongst a group of people including the co-offenders, Bradley Hendry (Hendry), Bryce Black (Black) and Shane Wilson (Wilson). This group started to argue with England. When the argument started, Thorton was seated approximately 10 metres from England. Scaturchio had left the area to purchase a drink.
11At 2.50 am the males in the applicant's group other than Sebastian La Rosa (La Rosa) made their way to the platform where England and Thorton were. La Rosa remained for the time being on the adjacent platform but continued to ""abuse the victims.""
12The applicant, the co-offenders and an unknown male approached England from behind and surrounded him. At about this time Thorton stood up and went towards England to help him. The Sentencing Judge described Thorton's actions in the Remarks on Sentence (ROS) in the following terms:
""Mr Thorton is seen on the CCTV to approach in a reasonable manner, hands out in clearly what was an effort to placate the other young men"".
13At this point La Rosa ran across the railway tracks and joined the applicant and the other co-offenders.  Hendry punched England to the face causing him to fall backward. La Rosa and the applicant then moved towards England whilst the remaining four males surrounded Thorton. England got to his feet and was then punched by La Rosa in the face, causing him to fall to his knees, holding his face. La Rosa then began to kick England several times to the body.  
14At the same time, Wilson grabbed Thorton by the T-shirt and spun him around. Hendry then punched Thorton in the stomach. Wilson grabbed Thorton again by the neck of his T-shirt, shoved him backward and punched him in the stomach.
15The applicant then ran up to Thorton, pushing one of his other attackers aside and punched him with a closed fist to the face. Thorton, who was taken unawares by the applicant, was thrown backward off his feet. He struck the back of his head when he landed on the concrete platform. The applicant continued running straight up the stairs and exited the platform, followed by Hendry.
16Thorton was knocked unconscious and was bleeding from the back of his head and ear. Wilson walked over to Thornton, who was lying on the ground unconscious, and slapped his chin. The unidentified male and Wilson then ran from the scene via the stairwell. La Rosa returned to his original platform.
17As a result of the assault Thorton was conveyed to Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH) and was found to have a fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and loss of hearing in his right ear.
18A medical report dated 3 June 2011 from Dr Stuart Browne, a rehabilitation medicine specialist from RNSH's Brain Injury Clinic, described Thorton's injuries as follows:
""Tim Thorton has suffered right ear deafness from this injury (referring to the assault). His vision was initially blurry, but has now improved. His balance continues to improve (he reported falling when getting out of bed). He sleeps excessively, although this has not changed compared to before his injury. He describes no new cognitive problems, although is aware of forgetfulness. He has not suffered any seizures. He reports normal smell ability...
Tim Thorton has suffered a significant traumatic brain injury secondary to an assault about two months ago. His recovery has been positive so far, although there are ongoing issues:
1. deafness - right ear2. Post-traumatic seizure risk3. Depression - intercurrent4. Chronic / neuritic pain (pre-TBI)5. Mild disinhibition?6. Balance impairment - mild7. Unemployed.""
19In a victim impact statement Mr Thorton described initial difficulties walking in hospital and other problems with balance, deafness in his right ear, his memory having ""drastically deteriorated"", blurry vision, nightmares, flashbacks and resulting effects in social situations.
The applicant's antecedents 
20The applicant, who was born in October 1992, was 18 at the time of the subject offences and 19 when he was sentenced in December 2011. 
21He has a short but serious criminal history. At the time of the commission of the subject offences he had been on parole for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wound person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, which he had committed on 22 December 2009 and to which he had pleaded guilty. The Facts Sheet was in evidence before the Sentencing Judge (who as it happened had sentenced the applicant for these offences). 
22The applicant had stolen the wallet of a youth he had known for a number of years. The victim contacted the applicant with a view to having the wallet returned. The applicant brought a knife with him to the assignation and threatened the victim with it. As the victim was trying to run away he tripped and fell backwards. The applicant stabbed the victim, who was using his hands to shield his face, in his left torso. The applicant asked the victim whether he wanted ""any more"" and the victim told him that he could keep the wallet. 
23He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for the assault, which commenced on 23 December 2009 and 2 years' imprisonment commencing on 11 January 2010, consisting of a non-parole period of 9 months and a 15 month parole period. On 10 April 2011, when the subject offences were committed, he had been on parole for about 6 months, and had a further 9 months on parole. His parole would, but for its revocation have expired on 15 January 2012. 
24The applicant's parole was revoked because of the subject offences.  He was taken into custody on 15 April 2011 where he remained until he was sentenced on 8 December 2011. 
The applicant's subjective circumstances
25The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. The applicant's father, Alan Kemp, deposed to his subjective circumstances. A report of psychologist, George Dieter, dated 29 September 2011 was also tendered.
26Alan Kemp gave evidence that after being released on parole the applicant had been working with him in his building business as well as commencing his own business. He said his son had expressed some remorse for the offence and, in particular the severity of the victim's injuries, and that his son's attitude to work was better since his release from custody. He said that he expected the applicant would return to the parental home upon his release from custody and that his son's incarceration was emotionally trying.
27The applicant told Mr Dieter that he had a relatively normal childhood with his parents in their home at Pearl Beach.  He had a particular interest in sports and played baseball and rugby league until the age of 16, when drug-taking started to interfere with that and other aspects of his life. He changed his peer group and ""started to hang out with older peers, most of whom had dropped out of school and were 'just hanging around', as well as having been in trouble with police and the law.""
28The report stated that the applicant had started to fall behind at school from Year 3 and ultimately did not complete Year 10.  Instead he commenced working with his father.  This change was said to have coincided with an increased use in marijuana that had commenced at the age of 14.  The applicant reported that the habit ""took over and controlled"" his life.
29The report also noted that the applicant had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of 16 which had been medicated with Risperdal and that whilst in custody he had been prescribed Lithium, a drug normally associated with the treatment of psychotic symptoms and Bipolar Disorder.  A Personal Assistance Inventory was conducted by the psychologist who concluded that a Substance Abuse Disorder was a ""possible"" explanation for the applicant's behaviour.
Applicable principles
30The relationship between the principles of consistency and parity can be distilled into the following propositions:
(1)The goal of consistency in sentencing is to be obtained by a consistent application of the appropriate principles established by the legislature or otherwise applicable under the general law: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [77]-[78].
(2)Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect: Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608, cited with approval in Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28] (Green & Quinn). 
(3)Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is a fundamental element in a rational and fair system of criminal justice: Green & Quinn. 
(4)In relation to co-offenders consistency finds expression in the parity principle. In relation to offenders who are not co-offenders, it finds expression in the principle of consistency in sentencing: see Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at 588-589, cited with approval in Green & Quinn at [30], per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ and at [119]-[123], per Bell J with whom Heydon J agreed.
31The plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green & Quinn explained the rationale for intervention by an appellate court, citing Gibbs CJ in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606, who said, at 610:""...the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""
32The plurality in Green & Quinn articulated the principles to be applied by an appellate court if it considered that there was an unjustified disparity, which include, relevantly, the following:
(1)An appellate court has the power to reduce a sentence that is not manifestly excessive in order to correct a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender. 
(2)The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria.
(3)An appellate court ought not intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise. 
(4)An appellate court deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.
The applicant's argument
33The applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge failed to have regard to the principle of parity. He placed particular emphasis on the following passage from Quinn, at [30], which is, accordingly, set out in full:
""In Lowe v R ([1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606) and in Postiglione v R ([1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295) this court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v R ([2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540), there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""
34The applicant contended that, since the question was one of substance rather than form, the Sentencing Judge ought to have had regard to the fact that the applicant and his co-offenders could have been charged with the joint enterprise of assaulting the victim. He submitted that had that charge been laid and proved, then the co-offenders and the applicant would have been convicted of the same offence. Although the applicant accepted that, even in that event, it did not follow that they ought receive the same sentence, he contended that the substantive identity of offence ought to have been given greater weight on the basis of the parity principle.
35The disparity principally relied upon is that between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed on La Rosa.
Reasons
36The material before the Sentencing Judge included the statement of facts for each of the co-offenders and the sentences which each received. Each was dealt with in the Local Court. Each pleaded guilty. 
37The transcripts of their sentence hearings, which were available to this Court, were not available to his Honour, but I do not consider that anything turns on that. The sentences imposed on the co-offenders were as follows:
Co-offenderChargesMaximum penalty on indictmentMaximum penalty for summary offenceSentence WilsonCommon Assault2 years12 monthsSection 9 bond for 18 months + $600 fineCommon Assault2 years12 monthsCSO 150 hoursHendryCommon Assault2 years12 monthsConcurrent CSOs 200 hoursCommon Assault2 years12 monthsBlackAffray10 years2 yearsSection 9 bond for 18 monthsLa RosaAssault occasioning actual bodily harm5 years2 yearsConcurrent terms of 3 month non-parole period and 9 month balance of term commencing 26 September 2011Affray10 years2 years
38The facts sheets in respect of each offender were generic and accordingly substantially similar, although the charges were different.
39Black, who was born in July 1992, had no relevant prior history and was charged only with affray. Wilson, who was born in September 1990, had no relevant prior history and was sentenced on the basis that he had punched Thorton in the stomach when he was upright and slapped his chin when he was lying unconscious on the ground. Hendry, who was born in August 1991, had no relevant prior history and was sentenced on the basis that he punched England in the face and Thorton in the stomach. La Rosa, who was born in March 1990, had a relevant prior history of violent offences but was not on parole or conditional liberty when he committed the subject offence. He was sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm to England and affray.
40It is evident from the comparison that the applicant's sentence was more severe than those imposed on his co-offenders. The question arises whether the disparity was a result of a failure on the part of the Sentencing Judge to correctly apply the principle of parity or whether the difference was a product of the greater objective criminality of the applicant's conduct, of the fact that the subject offences were committed while he was on parole for a violent offence and of his subjective circumstances. The former would indicate error; the latter would amount to a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.
41The following passage in the ROS reflects the Sentencing Judge's consideration of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders:
""The Court has been provided with a set of facts in relation to four of the other young men, all of whom were dealt with in the Local Court, none of whom were charged with this particular offence.  Each of those statements of fact relative to each individual also includes the criminal history of the respective offender.  Parity does not strictly apply because those matters were dealt with in the Local Court and one of those individuals faced a s 35 'in company' count. In my view, the fact that the offender was already on parole for a serious act of violence which had brought him before me here at Gosford District Court when he was aged seventeen means that his subjective material further differentiates him from the others notwithstanding that one of the other four, Mr Larossa [sic], also has a criminal history involving violence.  It appears to me that Mr Larossa [sic] was rather fortunate to receive a sentence of twelve months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three months.  Nevertheless, when one looks at the video, it was this offender that escalated the violence significantly by striking the victim in the way and in the circumstances which he did.""  [Emphasis added].
42This passage shows that the Sentencing Judge had regard to the relative objective seriousness of the applicant's conduct by comparison with his co-offenders and to the fact that the applicant committed the subject offence while on parole. Although his Honour said that the parity principle did not strictly apply, I consider that this observation ought be understood as an acknowledgement that each of the offenders had been involved in the same criminal events, although none apart from the applicant had been charged with an offence under s 35 of the Crimes Act and none but the applicant had been dealt with by indictment. His Honour's consideration of the need to differentiate the subjective material pertaining to the applicant from that of the other offenders is also, in my view, a powerful indication that he considered that the respective criminality of the participants ought be addressed in a holistic way to ensure both consistency and parity.
43I consider that his Honour gave adequate consideration to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders when sentencing the applicant.
44Further, even though it would appear to have been open for the Crown to charge the applicant and each of the co-offenders with a joint illegal enterprise, the acts of each individual participant would have been a material consideration in sentencing each offender, on the assumption that each would either have pleaded guilty or been found guilty. As James J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed, said in R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [28]-[29]:
""If this conduct by other persons was done in the carrying out of a joint criminal enterprise to which the respondent was a party, then the respondent was to be sentenced for that conduct under the principle that a party to a joint criminal enterprise is to be sentenced for the full range of the criminal acts done by any of the parties to the joint criminal enterprise in the carrying out of the enterprise R v Cotter & Ors [2003] NSWCCA 273 especially per Carruthers AJ at 90. 
However, the respondent was not necessarily to receive the same punishment as would have been appropriate if he had himself personally performed all of those acts. In each case it depends on the circumstances whether a person who is criminally liable for an act as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory should be regarded as equally culpable, less culpable or even more culpable than the person who actually performed the criminal act. See the discussion by the High Court in GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198 especially at 209 [23]. 
45On this analysis, the objective seriousness of what the applicant did was substantially greater than that of his co-offenders. Although they, too, were participants in the assault of Thorton and England, it was the applicant who delivered the blow which knocked Thorton to the ground and caused him to suffer grievous bodily harm. The Sentencing Judge was not only entitled, but obliged, to have regard to the extent of the harm to the victim: Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at [29]; s 21A(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
46That the applicant assaulted Thorton when Thorton's capacity to withstand attack had already been compromised by others in my view increased, rather than ameliorated, the relative objective seriousness of his conduct.
47It is also significant that the applicant committed the offence when he was on parole for another violent offence for which he had served a custodial sentence. The Sentencing Judge had a discretion to backdate the commencement of the sentence where parole in respect of an earlier offence is revoked by reason of the commission of a further offence: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 111. His Honour exercised the discretion substantially in the applicant's favour by backdating the sentence for the subject offences to 15 June 2011 which took account of all but one month of the loss of parole. It would have been open to his Honour to commence the sentence for the subject offences on 15 January 2012, when the term of the earlier sentence would otherwise have expired. The favourable exercise of discretion by the Sentencing Judge is a factor to be taken into account in considering whether the principles of parity have been correctly applied.
48The other material matter is that the applicant and the co-offenders were not mature men. They were on the cusp of adulthood. When sentencing offenders in that category, a sentencing judge might impose a non-custodial sentence on a first offender in the hope that it will have a salutary effect on the offender's future conduct and that he will not re-offend. However, when an offender comes before a court for sentencing for a similar offence in respect of which a lighter sentence has been imposed in respect of a prior offence, it is a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion to impose a harsher sentence, particularly when the offender is still on parole for the earlier offence. 
49These circumstances explain why the Sentencing Judge was evidently concerned about the leniency apparently extended to La Rosa, which appeared to him to be at odds with the respective criminality in light of La Rosa's prior criminal record. However, although La Rosa had a prior criminal record which included offences of violence he was not on parole or any other form of conditional liberty at the time of the subject offence. His Honour was careful to record that the applicant had not kicked Thorton when he was down. I take this to be a distinction which the Sentencing Judge considered ought to be recorded because of the apparent similarity between La Rosa's conduct and the applicant's, although the harm to the respective victim was, different materially.
50That his Honour commented on the relative leniency of La Rosa's sentence as compared to the one he proposed to impose on the applicant demonstrates a concern, rather than a disregard, for the principles of parity and consistency.
51The Sentencing Judge appears to have considered that the sentence imposed on La Rosa was, if anything, lenient. I do not consider the sentence imposed on La Rosa to be excessively lenient although I do not disagree with the Sentencing Judge's observation that La Rosa was, in the circumstances, fortunate.
52Sentencing requires a judgment to be made not only of relative criminality and subjective circumstances, but also of the relative consequences of actions. On one view there is a similarity between the act of the applicant in punching Thorton in the head and the act of Hendry and La Rosa doing the same to England. It could be argued that La Rosa's action was more serious because he subsequently kicked England when he was down. There is, however, a significant distinction: it was the applicant's blow that caused grievous bodily harm to Thorton. While it may have been a matter of chance which blow on which victim had that effect, the actual consequences of the offender's actions are, for reasons given above, a material consideration in sentencing. That Thorton suffered really serious injury as a result of the applicant's blow is, in my view, sufficient to justify the greater sentence imposed on him, particularly when compared with La Rosa's sentence.
53I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(1)Dismiss the appeal.

2760737,McLaren v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 284,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with McCallum J.
2BELLEW J:  I agree with McCallum J.
3McCALLUM J:  Steven McLaren seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to attempted murder, contrary to s 30 of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment.  There is a standard non-parole period for the offence of 10 years.  
4The applicant was sentenced by Berman DCJ to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years and a balance of term of 3 years (a total sentence of 8 years).  His Honour stated that he had reduced the sentence by 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea, indicating that the sentence would otherwise have been a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months and a balance of term of 4 years (a total sentence of 10 years and 8 months).  
5I note that the remarks on sentence record the learned sentencing judge as having stated that the standard non-parole period for the offence is eight years.  As stated above, the relevant period is in fact 10 years, not eight.  Neither party addressed that issue in submissions.  I doubt whether the sentencing judge, who has substantial experience both in the criminal law and as a judge, proceeded on the incorrect basis recorded.  Having regard to the sentence imposed and in light of his Honour's findings of fact, I think it is more likely to have been either a typographical error or a slip of the tongue during the remarks on sentence.  
6The victim of the offence was Mr Barry Harrison, who suffered from advanced motor neurone disease.  Mr Harrison was virtually unable to do anything for himself and required constant care.  At the time of the offence, the applicant had been Mr Harrison's live-in carer for a period of about seven months.  Prior to taking on that role, the applicant had been on a disability pension for some 20 years, having had long-term psychiatric illness, including a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Upon assuming the role of carer for Mr Harrison, the applicant qualified for a carers' pension from Centrelink.  
7To all appearances, the applicant took to the role of carer with competence and enthusiasm.  Mr Harrison described him as a man who, until the night of the offence, had been ""full of so much caring"" and said that he was a nice man and a gentle man who ""just went over the edge"".  Mr Harrison's ex-wife similarly spoke of the applicant's performance in the role (before the commission of the offence) in glowing terms, describing him as ""an angel from heaven"".  Another carer who did the day shift said that the applicant was ""the best thing that had happened"" to Mr Harrison.  
8As time went on, however, Mr Harrison became increasingly ill with a chest infection and the applicant was getting increasingly less sleep.  Unbeknownst to those around him, the applicant had also stopped taking his medication.  
9Owing to respiratory problems, it was necessary for Mr Harrison to sleep at an angle, with his head raised above his chest.  The applicant had been told that, if placed horizontally, Mr Harrison would die.  On the night of the offence, the applicant deliberately lowered the top of Mr Harrison's bed as low as it would go, believing it would kill him.  He later told police that he had intended to kill Mr Harrison, explaining that he (the applicant) was ""at breaking point"".    
10The applicant was 54 years old at the time of the offence.  In his youth he had qualified as a mechanical engineer employed by BHP; married a primary school teacher and had three children.  At the age of 28, the applicant had a psychotic episode and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He spent several weeks in hospital and was unable to return to work after that time.  He spent the next 20 years on a disability support pension and, later, working in a sheltered workshop as a welder.  
11In 2004, the applicant and his wife separated and the applicant became unable to hold his position at the sheltered workshop.  He was again admitted as a psychiatric patient.  He remained under psychiatric treatment for several years, including a further psychiatric admission.  
12In late 2009, the applicant completed a six-week course as an assistant in nursing for the care of aged or bedridden people.  In early 2010, a counsellor introduced him to Mr Harrison and he accepted the role of being Mr Harrison's carer.  According to the statement of facts relied upon in the proceedings on sentence, the applicant was ""about to be homeless"" at that time and the carer position was a live-in position.  The applicant was required to assist Mr Harrison with all physical requirements except for a period of about four or five hours each day, when Mr Harrison received home care assistance.  An aspect of the applicant's role was that he was required to be on call throughout the night.
13The applicant continued to see his regular psychiatrist, Dr Weiss, during the first half of 2010.  Dr Weiss noted that the applicant was ""very positive"" about his new role as carer for Mr Harrison.  However, the applicant did not reveal to Dr Weiss that he had become non-compliant with his medication.
14Dr Weiss's final consultation with the applicant before the offence was on 15 July 2010.  It was not until December 2010, after the commission of the offence, that Dr Weiss became aware that the applicant had become non-compliant with his medication.
15In about July 2010, the applicant started to complain to his daughter that he was not getting a break from caring for Mr Harrison.  She encouraged the applicant to speak to Mr Harrison about his concerns.  He did not heed that advice, and his complaints continued.
16On 2 October 2010 the applicant complained to his daughter that he had not been getting a lot of sleep because Mr Harrison was unwell and was getting him up to go to the toilet a lot during the night.
17The offence occurred on the evening of 4 October 2010.  Mr Harrison had at that stage been sick for a while.  He was dry retching very badly in the afternoon and thought he might need to go to hospital.  However, early in the evening, his condition started to improve.  He warned the applicant that it might be a difficult night, requiring him to get up a few times.
18It was during that night that the applicant decided to place Mr Harrison horizontally.  The applicant told police that he had been thinking about what a bad day it had been and thought ""poor Steve, I've got to get out of this situation, why don't I change the position of the bed, and Barry will die very quickly because there's so much mucus and he's worn out and I won't have to continue to feeling trapped with Barry"".
19When the applicant lowered the bed, Mr Harrison woke almost immediately.  He called out for help for a number of hours.  The applicant heard his cries for help and walked outside where he could still hear Mr Harrison calling out.  He later told police that he had stood on the corner of the street and smoked a lot of cigarettes while Mr Harrison called for help.  He then went back inside the house where he closed some doors and turned on the television so that he could not hear Mr Harrison.  He said that it made him feel terrible but he was hoping that Mr Harrison would die quickly.  He told police that he felt trapped.  He could not go and save Mr Harrison because then he would have to explain why he had done what he had done.
20Mr Harrison survived the ordeal but was not discovered until 8.30 the following morning.  By that time, he had spent many hours in great discomfort and grave fear.  He in fact died not long after that evening, but it is not, and cannot be, suggested that the applicant's conduct caused his death. 
21The first ground of appeal is:
The Sentencing Judge erroneously attributed weight to the appellant's apparent state of mind when making findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence.
22This ground may be disposed of briefly.  It flows from the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 as to the effect of s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which applies to offences that carry a ""standard non-parole period"".  Importantly, a standard non-parole period is defined in the Act as representing the non-parole period for an offence ""in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" for offences in the table of standard non-parole periods: see s 54A(2) of the Act.
23Section 54B(2) provides:
When determining the sentence for the offence (not being anaggregate sentence), the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.
24In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [62], the Court of Criminal Appeal had held that s 54B(2) was expressed in ""mandatory terms"".  In that context, the Court held that the procedure mandated by the section required the sentencing judge to assess the objective seriousness of the offence at hand by comparing it with the putative offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (that being the notional measure of seriousness of offending for which the standard non-parole period was prescribed).  Importantly for present purposes, the Court in Way allowed that matters personal to the offender, including mental state at the time of offending, would affect that assessment: at [86]-[88].   
25In Muldrock, the High Court rejected the analysis in Way.  The Court said (at [27]):  Section 54B(2) and s 54B(3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence.  In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts:  the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period.  The latter requires that content be given to its specification as ""the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"", Sentencing Act, s 54A(2).  Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender.  The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders.  It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending (emphasis added).
26The applicant was sentenced before the decision in Muldrock was handed down.  Unsurprisingly in that context, the learned sentencing judge undertook the task required by a proper application of the principles in Way of stating how the offence before him compared to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  In doing so, again perfectly in accordance with the principles stated in Way, his Honour took into account aspects of the applicant's mental state at the time of offending in reaching the conclusion that the offence was ""slightly below the middle of the range"".
27The appellant contends that his Honour's conclusion may now be seen to have entailed error in that the decision in Muldrock renders impermissible any consideration of the applicant's state of mind in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence at hand.
28In my view, that submission misconceives the effect of the decision in Muldrock.  The phrase ""objective seriousness"" in Muldrock at [27] where it appears in the underlined sentence in the extract above refers specifically to the definition in s 54A(2) of the Act as to what a ""standard non-parole period"" denotes.  That is the ""concept"" referred to in the previous sentence of that paragraph.  The point there made by the High Court, as I would understand it, is that there is no sense in attempting to place the offence at hand (with all its features, including matters personal to the offender where relevant to an assessment of the nature of the offending) at a point along a purely hypothetical range which, of its nature, is ignorant of those matters.
29The decision in Muldrock does not, however, derogate from the requirement on a sentencing judge to form an assessment as to the moral culpability of the offending in question, which remains an important task in the sentencing process.  That this assessment is also sometimes referred to as the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence perhaps contributes to the misconception.  I do not understand the High Court to have suggested in Muldrock that a sentencing judge cannot have regard to an offender's mental state when undertaking that task (as an aspect of his or her instinctive synthesis of all of the factors relevant to sentencing).
30It may be accepted that the sentencing judge in the present case articulated his findings in accordance with principles that have since been overturned.  In assessing the significance of that circumstance, it must be borne in mind that the impugned finding (his Honour's conclusion as to how the offence before him compared to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness) is one that, following Muldrock, is no longer required to be undertaken: at [25].  
31In any event, the determinative last step for this Court when considering a ground of appeal alleging Muldrock error is to form an opinion as to whether any less severe sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  It was acknowledged at the hearing of the present appeal that the sentence imposed was within the range of appropriate sentences on the strength of the evidence before the sentencing judge.  It follows inexorably that this Court would not intervene on the Muldrock ground alone: cf R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186 at [33]-[34] per Hunt AJA; R S Hulme and Johnson JJ agreeing at [50] and [57] respectively.
32Ground 2 is:
A miscarriage resulted from the absence at the sentence of ""fresh evidence"", being a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, of 26 May 2012.
33Notwithstanding the formulation of that ground, it was conceded at the hearing of the appeal that the further report of Dr Nielssen dated 26 May 2012 did not meet the requirements to be classified as ""fresh evidence"" (T2.11).  The applicant nonetheless contended that the Court should exercise its residual discretion to admit and consider the new material so as to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  
34It is necessary to explain the circumstances in which that contention is made.  Two psychiatric reports were relied upon by the applicant at the proceedings on sentence.  One was a report dated 10 February 2011 prepared by the applicant's treating psychiatrist, Dr Weiss (exhibit C).  The other was a report dated 16 February 2011 provided by Dr Nielssen (exhibit B).  Importantly for present purposes, although Dr Nielssen's report post-dated that of Dr Weiss, Dr Nielssen had not seen Dr Weiss's report at the time he finalised his own report.  However, the applicant was not in a position to put forward any evidence as to why that was the case.  There appears to be no better explanation than that there was a slip-up.  
35The relevant chronology in respect of that material is as follows.  Dr Weiss is a consultant psychiatrist who first treated the applicant in 2004, when the applicant was admitted to hospital as a psychiatric patient for about a month.  He was diagnosed at that time with a major depressive episode, bipolar affective disorder and gambling disorder.  Dr Weiss noted that the applicant had a past history of mania with psychotic features and had been on antipsychotic medication for many years.
36The applicant's mental state became stable after several years but in 2008 he was again admitted to hospital with acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms due to overwhelming stress at work.
37His mental state slowly improved again with strengthened medication, coupled with extended clinical treatment.  With encouragement from a counsellor, he obtained his qualification in aged and disabled care towards the end of 2009 and obtained his employment with Mr Harrison in early 2010.
38Dr Weiss saw the applicant twice after he began working for Mr Harrison. On the first occasion, in March 2010, Dr Weiss noted that the applicant's affect was ""very bright with good reactivity"".  
39Dr Weiss saw the applicant again in July 2010.  That was the last time he saw him before the commission of the offence.  On that occasion, Dr Weiss recorded ""mental state improving"" and provided a prescription for Lamictal.  Dr Weiss was not aware at that time that the applicant had become non-compliant with his medication.
40The offence was committed in early October 2010.
41After the commission of the offence, Dr Nielssen was asked to see the applicant, evidently for the purpose of determining whether he had a mental illness defence.  The material made available to Dr Neilssen included Dr Weiss's reporting letters, including the letter in respect of the consultation in July recording the applicant's supposed improved mental state.  Dr Neilssen saw the applicant only once, in November 2010, whilst he was in custody. 
42Dr Nielssen's report recorded the following in respect of Dr Weiss's records:
The letters from Dr Weiss confirmed the history of treatment with mood stabilising medication, antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, as well as ECT, for schizoaffective disorder.  At the last consultation before his arrest on 15.7.10, Dr Weiss noted ""mental state improving"" and printed a prescription for Lamictal.
43On the strength of those records and the history given to him by the applicant, Dr Nielssen did not think the applicant was suffering from any mental illness at the time of the offence that was causally connected with his offending.  Dr Nielssen said: 
I did not elicit symptoms of active mental illness associated with his behaviour towards Mr Harrison or that his conduct was due to the effects of an acute episode of mental illness.  However, it does seem clear that Mr McLaren has a residual disability arising from his illness, particularly in the area of coping with stress or the expectation to perform at a certain level when compared to his premorbid function.  Prior to the onset of illness he had achieved a good pass in the Higher School Certificate and had completed some tertiary training and was working full time and supporting a young family.  For twenty years after the onset of illness he worked in a sheltered workshop at well below his potential and his employment since leaving that workshop appears to have been unstable because of difficulty coping with the pressure of new positions.  Hence it seems likely that Mr Harrison's demanding condition and the associated sleep deprivation caused him significant distress.  Sleep deprivation is known to trigger symptoms of mood disorder.  Chronic mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder are also associated with an increased tendency to act on impulse and impaired capacity for problem solving.
44His report concluded with the following statement:
I believe the effects of Mr McLaren's circumstances and his underlying chronic mental illness resulted in significant impairment in his capacity to control his actions and his perception of the seriousness and likely consequences of his conduct.
45As already noted, at the time of his last consultation with the applicant, Dr Weiss was unaware that the applicant had become non-compliant with his medication.  His note as to the applicant's ""mental state improving"", relied upon by Dr Nielssen, was made in that context.  
46In early December 2010, the applicant was granted bail and went to see Dr Weiss.  It was then that the applicant reported that he had stopped using lithium and lamotrogine twelve months earlier.  That additional information prompted Dr Weiss to revisit some of his earlier observations.  He stated:
The absence of these drugs, destabilised the Bipolar Disorder and was out of control.  It was my impression based upon the mental state described above that Mr McLaren had been cycling and was in a mixed state over the early part of 2010.  Prior to the attempted murder it is my opinion that the symptoms had exacerbated into mania and grandiosity mixed with despair and depression.  This menial state resulted in impairment of judgment and a desperate need to find a ""final solution to the problem"".
I note in my correspondence to his GP after the consultation in December, that ""Steve's affect was very bright and animated.  In hindsight, it would appear that he was hypomanic.  He described himself as being able to work long hours and meet all of the demands of his charge without question"".
This was in marked contrast to his presentation on this occasion, in which he displayed symptoms of a Major Depressive episode.  It is not possible for me to comment on Mr McLaren's mental state at the time of the alleged attempted murder.  However, it is my opinion that the Bipolar Disorder was out of control in the first six months of 2010 due to non-compliance with medication and the emerging psychosis with grandiose Ideation.  This was exacerbated by to (sic) the increased demands placed upon him after Barry developed a chest infection increasing his level of dependence and need for care.
47Dr Neilssen's report as an expert witness was prepared in ignorance of those revised observations.  As already noted, Dr Neilssen's opinion was expressly based on the observation recorded by Dr Weiss as at July 2010 that the applicant's mental state was improving and that a prescription had been provided on that date.
48The sentencing judge accepted Dr Nielssen's opinion, noting that it was not challenged by the Crown.  He stated ""this means that the offender's moral culpability is substantially reduced and reduces also the effect that general deterrence should have on the sentence I will impose upon the offender"".  
49However, his Honour noted that the sentence must bear a reasonable relationship to the objective gravity of the offending.  His Honour said ""that principle does not cease to apply in a case where an offender's moral culpability is reduced because of mental illness and in this case the offender well knew what he was doing was seriously wrong.  He well knew that Mr Harrison was suffering for six hours and his sole motivation was, I repeat, a selfish one"".
50The judge later repeated the remark that the offender ""well knew"" what he was doing.
51The Crown did not dispute the applicant's contention that, at the time sentence was passed, Dr Nielssen had not seen the report of Dr Weiss dated 10 February 2011, even though that report pre-dated the report of Dr Nielssen tendered at the proceedings on sentence.
52After the applicant was sentenced, Dr Nielssen became aware that Dr Weiss had revised his opinion following upon his learning that the applicant had become non-compliant with his medication.  In light of Dr Weiss's further opinion, Dr Nielssen revised his own opinion, importantly concluding that the applicant was mentally ill at the time of the offence.  That was contrary to the basis on which the applicant was sentenced.  Dr Nielssen's revised opinion (set out in a letter dated 26 May 2012) was as follows:
Based on the further information from Mr McLaren's treating psychiatrist, I now believe that on the balance of probabilities Mr McLaren was mentally ill at the time of the offence.  Based on the additional information, rather than any account of his own symptoms that Mr McLaren was able to provide, it seems likely that he was affected by a defect in reason in the form of severely impaired judgment, decision-making and impulse control arising from a mixed state of mania and depression, and that he was unable to reason with sense or composure about the likely consequences of his actions or consider the alternative courses of action that were available to him.
53On the strength of the evidence that was before the sentencing judge, it was plainly open to his Honour to conclude, as his Honour did, that the applicant ""well knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong"".  However, I do not think it is possible to reconcile that finding with Dr Nielssen's further opinion that the applicant was ""unable to reason with sense or composure about the likely consequences of his actions or consider the alternative courses of action that were available to him"".
54The restrictions upon the reception of evidence of events occurring after sentence has been imposed are well known.  The relevant principles are conveniently summarised in the judgment of Latham J in Stumbles v R [2006] NSWCCA 418 at [7] to [8].  Her Honour there emphasised that special and unusual circumstances are required to justify departure from the general principle.  The applicant acknowledged the sound policy reasons lying behind the general prohibition on the receipt of such evidence.  It was submitted, however, that this is an exceptional case such as to warrant departure from the general position, in accordance those principles. 
55The applicant identified the subsequent event in the present case as being Dr Nielssen's receipt of Dr Weiss's report.  As already noted, it was frankly acknowledged at the outset of the hearing that Dr Weiss's report was constructively available to the applicant at the time of sentence (in the sense that it existed and could have been reviewed by Dr Neilssen).  The simple fact, however, is that Dr Nielssen did not see it.  Upon reviewing that report, whereas he had not previously thought that the applicant was suffering from mental illness causally connected with the commission of the offence, he came to the opinion on the balance of probabilities that the applicant was mentally ill at the time of the offence.  Dr Neilssen's earlier, contrary opinion was based on the incorrect premise that the applicant's mental state was improving as at July 2010, only a few months before the commission of the offence, and in ignorance of the additional significant information that the applicant had in fact been non-compliant with his medication since the beginning of the year.
56In my view, those circumstances indicate that, through no fault on the part of the learned sentencing judge or either psychiatrist, the sentencing process miscarried.  Further, in my view, the circumstances are sufficiently special to warrant reception of Dr Nielssen's further report, notwithstanding the fact that it is not ""fresh evidence"" in the strict sense.  The opinion evidence before the sentencing judge provided a proper foundation for his Honour to take a stern view as to the offender's moral culpability, articulated in the finding that the offender ""well knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong"".  That finding, however, cannot be reconciled with Dr Nielssen's further opinion.
57It remains to consider whether, on the strength of that additional evidence, a less severe sentence should be imposed: cf s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  I have concluded that it should.  The applicant's moral culpability must be seen as significantly less than was found to be the case on the strength of the incomplete evidence before the sentencing judge.  Rather than ""well knowing"" that what he was doing was seriously wrong, and being selfishly motivated, the applicant may be seen in the light of Dr Nielssen's further opinion to have been acutely affected in his sense and reason by a spiralling mental state, which saw his judgment severely impaired.
58It must be acknowledged that there were other factors contributing to the objective seriousness of the offending, as noted by the learned sentencing judge.  In particular, his Honour noted the vulnerability of the man in the applicant's care, the extent of his suffering as he called in vain for help, the fact that the applicant ignored those calls over a lengthy period and the breach of trust which the offence represented.  Those are important factors which must be given due weight, and which point inexorably to the need for condign punishment by the imposition of a period of full-time imprisonment.
59However, as serious as the applicant's offending was, once it is viewed through the prism of his unhappy psychiatric history and his severely impaired mental state at the time of the offence, in my view it may be concluded that a less severe sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed.   
60The order I propose is that the sentence passed at first instance be quashed and, in lieu thereof, that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 17 April 2011 and expiring on 16 April 2014 and a balance sentenced of term of 2 years expiring on 16 April 2016.  The first date on which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 16 April 2014.

2760757,R v Castle [2012] NSWSC 1603,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  On 17 January 1998 Wayne Joseph John Castle (""the offender"") killed Jennifer Maree Smith.  He has pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
Jennifer Smith
2Jennifer Smith was 32 years old when she died.  She was the second eldest of six children raised in a loving family environment in Moree.  I have been told that she was beautiful, creative, sporting and academically gifted.  She lived life with zest, burned bright and was full of life and wonder.  She took combined degrees of Arts and Law at the University of Sydney but pursued her love of literature and worked as a freelance journalist.  She was evidently a remarkable and much loved young woman.
3The tragedy of the taking of such a life has had a profound and permanent effect upon the lives of many people.  The pain and grief described in the victim impact statements of Jennifer's mother, sisters and brother is beyond comprehension.  I thank them once again for providing such an illuminating insight into the life of their beloved daughter and sister.  I can well understand the sentiments that have been expressed about the offender and the sentence that should be imposed.  Clearly their suffering has been made manifestly worse by the delay in knowing what happened to Ms Smith and who was responsible.  There are, however, constraints upon the manner in which I can exercise my sentencing discretion:  R v Previteria (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge what has been said and, whilst I do not pretend to fully appreciate the extent of the family's suffering (and I doubt anyone could), I offer sincere condolences on behalf of the Court, and personally.
Circumstances of the offence
4The facts of the offence can be stated succinctly.  On the evening of Friday 16 January 1998, Jennifer Smith met up with family and friends for dinner.  The group proceeded to attend a number of establishments in Newtown and, from about 2.00am, she and her brother Andrew went on to other places in Kings Cross and Darlinghurst.  At about 4.30am they parted ways, Ms Smith telling her brother that she intended to see a friend who lived in Hordern Street, Newtown.  
5At about 4.50am Ms Smith knocked on the door of the friend's home but there was no answer.  She walked around the corner and down King Street until she arrived at a shop where she purchased a kebab.  She then walked back to Hordern Street.  A man crossed King Street and entered Hordern Street behind Ms Smith.  A scream was heard.  A witness in King Street went to the corner of Hordern Street to investigate.  He saw Ms Smith standing in the gutter wrestling with a man.  Other witnesses heard Ms Smith yelling at the man to leave her alone.  The witness called out, ""Leave her alone you bastard.""  He then saw the man hit Ms Smith with a swinging arm.  This caused her to fall behind a parked car, which obscured the witness' view.  The assailant then walked off.  The witness attempted to raise the alarm (I have not been told how) but to no avail.  He did not check on Ms Smith's condition; instead he boarded a bus in King Street and left.
6Ms Smith was found lying in the gutter in Hordern Street at about 5.45am.  She was deceased.  Her body was taken to the morgue at Glebe where she was later formally identified by family and friends.  A post mortem examination found widespread bruising over the back of the head, an extensive break of the bottom of the skull, a blood clot over the surface of the brain, and a laceration of the upper lip.  Various samples were taken but they were not tested for DNA.  Fortunately they were stored.
7Police established that Ms Smith's handbag was missing.  Video security footage from an ATM in King Street showed that at 5.15am Ms Smith walked along King Street towards Hordern Street.  14 seconds later a man approached the ATM and gave the appearance of conducting a transaction.  He looked over his shoulder in the direction of Ms Smith and then back to the machine.  He looked a second time, this time leaning backwards, enabling him to see around a wall and further along King Street.  He then stepped away from the ATM and walked along King Street in the direction of Ms Smith.  Although he was at the ATM for some 20 seconds, he did not attempt to make any transaction.
8Police identified the offender as the man at the ATM.  They interviewed him as a suspect on three occasions in April and May 1998.  He confirmed that he was the person in the video security footage but denied any involvement in the death of Ms Smith.  He denied having seen her and denied following her.
9In July 1998 the offender gave police a pair of shoes that he claimed to have worn on 17 January 1998.  They were scientifically examined but no traces of blood were detected.  They were not tested for DNA but remained in police custody.
10At the conclusion of an extensive police investigation into Ms Smith's death a coronial inquiry was held in September 1999.  Many witnesses gave evidence, including the offender.  He maintained the version he had earlier provided to the police and denied any involvement in the death of Ms Smith.  The coroner terminated the inquest and referred the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  The DPP determined that there was insufficient evidence to commence a prosecution.
11In 2008 the Unsolved Homicide Team of the NSW Police Homicide Squad established a task force to further investigate the matter.  A DNA profile not belonging to Ms Smith was found on her fingernail clippings.  It matched a DNA profile obtained from the offender's shoes.
12The strike force then undertook physical and electronic surveillance of the offender, and an undercover operation.  There were a number of meetings between undercover officers and the offender, culminating in him making a confession to an officer on 18 April 2011.  I heard evidence in camera as to the methodology employed in this operation.  In short, the offender was tricked into making the confession; it certainly was not the product of any regret or remorse.   He told the operative that he had taken Ms Smith's bag, destroyed evidence, and that he had deceived the police in 1998 by giving them shoes that he had not in fact worn on 17 January 1998. 
13The offender was arrested on 2 May 2011 and charged with murder.  On legal advice he declined an offer to be interviewed.  A DNA sample was taken.  Analysis supported the proposition that he was Ms Smith's assailant.
14A year later an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the DPP.  That plea was entered and he was committed to this Court for sentence.
Sentencing for manslaughter
15As the Crown has accepted the offender's plea to manslaughter in lieu of the murder charge it is appropriate that I point out an important difference between the two offences.  They both, of course, involve the unlawful taking of a human life and that is the primary feature taken into account in sentencing.  Murder, speaking generally, involves the commission of an act which causes death that is accompanied by an intention either to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm, or is done with a realisation of the probability that death will result.  Manslaughter, on the other hand, in a case such as the present, is the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act which results in death.  An assault is unlawful.  It will be dangerous if it exposes the victim to an appreciable risk of sustaining serious injury.  That is what the offender has pleaded guilty to.  He assaulted Ms Smith by punching her in the course of robbing her of her handbag.  Clearly, it exposed her to the risk of, and did in fact result in, a serious injury being sustained. 
16I do not know how much has been explained to the large number of family and friends of Ms Smith who are present today about the approaches to sentencing for murder and manslaughter.  I would expect that there has been an explanation to some extent.  I would simply emphasise that the maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for the term of a person's natural life and for manslaughter it is imprisonment for 25 years.  The law provides that the maximum penalty for any offence is reserved for cases that fall within the worst category of objective seriousness.  
17Manslaughter is an offence that can be committed in an enormously wide variety of circumstances.  Cases in which a victim sustains an unintended head injury after falling to the ground because of a punch are, regrettably, not uncommon.  Although all cases must be determined upon their own unique facts and circumstances, there are types of manslaughter that are more objectively serious.
18Sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales show that the median sentence imposed for murder in the past eight years is 22 years imprisonment and 80 per cent of sentences imposed have ranged from 18 years to in excess of 25 years.  By contrast, for manslaughter the median sentence is 7 years and 80 per cent of sentences have fallen in the range of 4½ years to 12 years.  The sentence I will impose in this case is not derived from any analysis of statistics.  I mention them only to illustrate that there is a substantial difference in sentencing for manslaughter as opposed to murder.
Seriousness of the offence
19It is my duty to impose a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence.  In assessing that I have taken a number of matters into account.  They include that it was not committed with anything more than a modicum of forethought.  It was more opportunistic than planned.  The act which resulted in death was a single punch that had the consequence, not specifically contemplated by the offender, of Ms Smith falling to the ground and striking her head.  It was, however, done in the course of a robbery and that is a significant matter.  And, after Ms Smith must obviously have been in a gravely distressed condition on the ground, the offender thought only of himself and callously left her lying in the gutter, literally for dead, in order to avoid his own detection and apprehension.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offence entailed ""a cowardly attack upon a vulnerable female in the early hours of the morning for financial gain"".  That is an apt description. This is a serious example of manslaughter committed with a single punch.
Circumstances of the offender
20The offender was born in 1958 and so he was aged 40 at the time of the offence and is now 54.  
21He has a criminal history that commences with him being arrested at the age of 21 for three offences of demanding money with menaces and one of armed robbery.  He was sentenced to a total term of 7 years imprisonment.  There follows convictions for supplying a drug, various types of fraud (and many of them), stealing, assault, contravening apprehended domestic violence orders, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and drug possession.  He served another prison sentence at the age of 37 for about 15 months.  He was released in January 1997 but was back in gaol again for a little over a month in May-June 1997 before being released on a community service order.  This is a record which denies to the offender the leniency that would otherwise be extended to a person without previous convictions.
22The offender was seen by Dr Richard Furst, a forensic psychiatrist, at Long Bay Correctional Centre on 1 November 2012 for the purpose of preparing a report that was tendered at the sentence hearing.
23The history provided by the offender to Dr Furst included that he is single with no dependents.  He had been married in 1978 and again in 1987 but the marriages did not last. He had two further serious relationships.  He subsequently lived with his mother in Forest Lodge and then, after she died in 2007, on his own in Glebe.  His father had passed away in 1987, a sister died at birth, and his older brother died in about 2002.  
24The offender had worked as a storeman, cleaner and kitchen hand.  He was receiving a disability support pension in recent years as a consequence of cervical spine problems and nerve compression.
25The offender was educated to Year 10 level.  There was nothing eventful about the circumstances of his upbringing. 
26There have been no issues with alcohol but there have been with illegal drugs.  He smoked cannabis and used amphetamines.  There were periods of abstinence but it seems he relapsed when he was depressed or feeling under stress.  He resumed using cannabis and amphetamines after he was released from gaol in 1997 and continued using until around 2000.  He told Dr Furst that his brother was ill after he was released from gaol but that he felt abandoned by him which added to feelings of depression.  He used drugs in order to cope.  He told Dr Furst ""I was always there to help everybody, but no one was there for me.  I feel like I have been used all my life.""
27The offender also told Dr Furst that at around the time of the offence he had just lost a cleaning job, had no money, and was feeling depressed.  He could not recall much of the offence aside from grabbing the handbag and the victim falling.  He could not recall hitting her, but accepts that he did.  He presumes that he must have been motivated by wanting money.  He was under the influence of drugs but Dr Furst said that there was no indication that he was unaware of his actions or their wrongfulness.
28He said that he denied involvement to the police because he was scared.  He destroyed the handbag and disposed of it because he was fearful of being caught and returned to gaol.   Ever since he found out that Ms Smith had died he experienced some depression; he had questioned himself as to why he had done it.  He found his appearance at the Coroner's Court stressful, telling Dr Furst of having been chased by people with cameras.  He said, ""In my head I knew I had been punished.""
29Dr Furst's report includes:
""He expressed remorse about his actions and said he 'felt for the victim's parents,' especially given the losses of a number of close family members he endured himself.""
30Later in the report he wrote:
""[The offender] found it hard to talk about the incident in question as he was quite tearful.  He was flat and depressed in his mood.  He said, 'I am devastated the woman is deceased.  If I had known she was hurt, I wouldn't have left her there'.  He appeared to be quite remorseful about the events, regretted his actions and expressed much guilt.""
31The offender provided the Court with a letter expressing his regret for the death of Ms Smith (Exh 3). He wrote that the ""shame, sorrow and guilt"" would remain with him forever.  He also gave evidence at the sentence hearing to that effect. 
32The offender has been in custody since his arrest.  He has found employment both at Parklea and Long Bay gaols. He has not engaged in any counselling or seen a psychiatrist.  He has not been provided with any antidepressant medication.  He said in his evidence that he had no close relatives.  There was a person who visited him in gaol but not very often.
33He has a number of physical ailments.  He suffered a neck injury in 1995. There were inconsistent accounts given to Dr Michael Fearnside, a neurological surgeon, and in evidence as to the cause of this but nothing turns on that.  He suffered another neck injury when he was hit by a car in 2008.  He said that he was in constant pain in his legs and arms.  A report by Dr Fearnside confirmed that the offender has cervical spine problems and is sufficiently impaired to prevent him working.  There is also a suggestion of thyroid and prostate issues, and the possible need for a knee replacement.
34Dr Furst was of the opinion that the offender was depressed, and had unresolved grief and guilt issues.  He felt that by virtue of the depression and psychological problems a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon the offender than for the average inmate.  He suggested that he should receive psychiatric assessment of his depression and need for antidepressant medication, and that he should receive psychological counselling. Another suggestion was that the offender attend a relapse prevention program for his substance abuse issues. It was Dr Furst's assessment that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation were ""reasonable"". 
Assessment of sentence
35I have already mentioned that I must determine a sentence that is proportionate to the objective gravity of the offence.  There are some other matters that have to be taken into account.
36General deterrence is a significant matter, particularly in light of the fact that the death of Ms Smith was the result of a physical assault committed in the course of a robbery of a woman in a vulnerable situation.  Punishment, denunciation and making the offender accountable for his actions are also relevant considerations.
37The offender must be given credit for his plea of guilty.  It was common ground that the plea was entered at a relatively early stage and that there should be a reduction of the sentence of 25 per cent. 
38I have doubts about the offender's claim of being genuinely remorseful.  I acknowledge that he said things to that effect to Dr Furst as well as in his evidence and in his letter (Exhibit 3).  However, he told Dr Furst that if had known that Ms Smith was hurt he would not have left her there.  The fact is that he flattened her with a single punch and she struck her head.  It would have been plain to all but the most self-absorbed individual that she had been hurt.  
39The offender said in his evidence that he had carried the guilt and the shame for what he had done for a long time.  He told Dr Furst that it had ""not sat right with him ever since he found out the victim had died"".  He also said that ""he felt for the victim's parents especially given the losses of a number of close family members he endured himself"".  These close family members included some who had died many years ago.  If that experience prompted him to think about Ms Smith's parents, he would have experienced such thoughts for much of the past 14 years.  But when in early 2011 he was made aware that the police were reinvestigating the incident by being asked to provide a DNA sample, he refused. 
40Remorse involves a genuine acceptance of responsibility.  The fact that the offender only confessed when he was tricked into it, and did not openly acknowledge that he had any involvement in the death of Ms Smith until after he was charged, makes a claim of being genuinely remorseful very difficult to accept. I do think he realises that he has done a dreadful thing and feels guilty. His letter included:
I sincerely hope that the family and loved ones of Ms Smith will find it in their heart to understand my grief and sorrow for their loss.
It is my impression that he is looking for absolution to assuage his own feelings of guilt. His primary concern is for himself; I am not persuaded that there is a true empathy for the plight of Ms Smith and her family. 
41It was not submitted that I should find that the offender's rehabilitation prospects are any more than ""reasonable"".  If he engages in the types of relapse prevention programs suggested by Dr Furst there will be a reduced likelihood of re-offending.
42It was not submitted that I should adopt the opinion of Dr Furst and take into account that the offender's time in custody would be more onerous because of his depression and physiological issues. Even if that were to be the case (of which I am not convinced) it would not be a matter of any great significance. There also does not appear to be any basis to conclude that imprisonment will be more burdensome because of his various physical ailments. I note in this respect his evidence that he has been working while on remand.  
43The offence occurred in 1998, and if sentencing patterns had changed since then it would be necessary for me to have regard to the sentencing patterns prevailing at the time of the offence:  R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368.  However in Scott v R [2011] NSWCCA 221, James J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, held (at [67]) that sentencing patterns for manslaughter in 2000 were not significantly different to what they were in 2010.  Having regard to that conclusion, I do not believe it could be said that there would be any significant difference between sentences imposed in 1998 and 2012.
44It was submitted by Mr Stratton SC that I should find that there are special circumstances and thereby reduce the proportion of the sentence that is represented by the non-parole period.  I have considered that submission but, with respect, do not accept it.  
45The sentence will be backdated so as to take into account the time the offender has been held in custody since his arrest.
Sentence
46Convicted.
47Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years 8 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 10 months.
48The sentence will date from 2 May 2011.  The offender will become eligible to be released upon parole after the non-parole period expires on 1 January 2017.
49That is a sentence of 7 years 6 months to expire on 1 November 2018.  If not for the offender's plea of guilty it would have been one of 10 years.

2760758,Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 286,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J that leave to appeal should be refused, with respect to both conviction and sentence. There are two aspects of the matter which invite further observations.

Rule 4
2Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules requires that an applicant obtain leave from this Court before raising a ground of appeal in respect of directions to the jury and decisions in respect of evidence, where no objection was taken at trial. The issue as to the operation of the rule in the present case arises from the fact that the applicant, following a short adjournment to allow her to obtain medical assistance, failed to return to the Court. The trial proceeded in her absence.

3The challenge to the decision of the trial judge (Payne DCJ) to proceed with the trial after the applicant had decamped was not shown to be erroneous, for the reasons given by R A Hulme J. However, as this Court noted at the hearing of the appeal, a question could have arisen as to the role of counsel who had been appearing for the accused at the trial. He continued to act in her interests, a course as to which no issue was raised at trial or on the appeal. Nor was any issue raised as to what explanation as to his role might have been given to the jury, if any, in those circumstances. Nothing having been said to the jury as to his continuing role, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to comment on whether anything should have been said in the particular circumstances of the case.

4The issue has a further and collateral aspect, namely whether r 4 applies where the accused was no longer present when directions were given to the jury and, arguably, was no longer represented by her counsel or solicitor.

5Again, because there was no discussion of this issue on the appeal, it is undesirable to say more than is strictly necessary for the disposition of the appeal. However, there is no reason to suppose that the rule is not engaged. Where the accused has voluntarily absented herself from the trial, thereby rendering it impossible for her to take objection in a timely fashion to things which occurred in her absence, leave is nevertheless required to allow such grounds to be run on appeal. The underlying rationale of the rule is that the verdict of a jury should generally not be subject to challenge on the basis of an alleged error which might have been rectified at the trial had it been raised. If it be appropriate for the trial to proceed in the absence of the accused, who has deprived herself of the opportunity to participate, the rationale holds and the rule will operate.

6Two further questions arise. First, assuming that counsel's instructions were withdrawn when the applicant absented herself, what significance should be given to the steps taken by counsel thereafter? To the extent that counsel did intervene and raise issues, that course would satisfy the rationale for r 4, whether or not in legal terms he continued to have instructions to act. To the extent that he did not raise a matter, r 4 will require that the applicant obtain leave to raise it on appeal.

7Secondly, there is a question as to the approach to be taken in respect of an application for leave in such circumstances. There is no short answer to that question. It may well depend upon an assessment of how counsel continuing to appear identified his or her role. If diligent in continuing to pursue the interests of the accused, particularly with respect to matters of law as to which the absence of the accused and her ability to give further instructions would have been of limited or little significance, there is no reason not to address the question of leave as if the trial had proceeded in a regular way in the presence of the accused and in circumstances where she continued to be represented. In relation to the directions given in this case, Judge Payne was assiduous in seeking the assistance of both counsel in formulating directions to the jury and there is nothing to suggest that counsel briefed for the applicant was other than diligent in addressing the issues as they arose. Accordingly there is no reason to depart from the usual approach to the grant of leave in such circumstances.

Was the applicant driving at the relevant time?
8The charge of dangerous driving occasioning death, of which the applicant was convicted, required that the applicant was driving the vehicle ""at the time of the impact"" which occasioned the death. The issue which required careful direction to the jury was whether the applicant was driving at the time of impact, in circumstances where the deceased, who had been a front seat passenger in the car, had grabbed the steering wheel one or two seconds before the impact occurred. 

9The prosecution case was based, at least in part, on the following propositions:

(a) it was the erratic and dangerous driving of the applicant, causing a loss of control of the vehicle, which led the deceased to intervene to regain control of the vehicle;
(b) although the applicant may have lost control in the sense that her actions were ineffective, she nevertheless was in a position at all times to exercise control and management of the vehicle, and
(c) even when the deceased grabbed the steering wheel she remained able to control the vehicle by operating the brakes and accelerator.

10The applicant contended that even if, due to the influence of alcohol, she was driving erratically and therefore dangerously, the deceased intervened, thereby taking control of the vehicle from the applicant, and the impact occurred as a result of the deceased's intervention. If the deceased's intervention prevented the applicant exercising control and management of the vehicle and thus caused the vehicle to be steered into the pole, the applicant would be not guilty. 

11The jury rejected the separate defence that the death was ""not in any way attributable"" to the influence of alcohol on the applicant: s 52A(8). That finding was consistent with acceptance of proposition (a). It would also have been inconsistent with any suggestion that the deceased's intervention was based on a mistaken belief, because the applicant was in fact exercising effective control over the movement of the vehicle.

12In this context, the phrase ""control and management"" has a potential ambiguity. Where no person other than the person in the driver's seat is attempting to exercise control of the vehicle, the driver's attempt may be ineffective and the vehicle may in fact be ""out of"" control. The person does not thereby cease to be ""the driver"", nor cease to be ""driving"" the vehicle: see Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; 173 CLR 572 at 577-578, set out by Adams J at [23] below.

13The analysis may be different where it is said that the person in the driver's seat is not in control because of a circumstance for which he or she is not responsible, such as a mechanical defect in the vehicle, an unforeseeable medical affliction of the driver or the intervention of a third party. However, these events are not of the same class and it is sufficient to focus on the last. If the intervention of the passenger is a natural and foreseeable consequence of the dangerous driving, the imposition of that act between the dangerous driving and the impact, like the period of sleep in Jiminez, does not in a practical sense break the causal link between the dangerous driving and the impact. That may be so whether or not the act of intervention left the person in the driver's seat with no power to control the vehicle or a limited power by using (most relevantly) the brakes.

14The matter was left to the jury in the present case on the basis that, if, at the time of impact, the applicant had no power to control the movement of the vehicle in any way, the jury should acquit. Arguably that direction was unduly favourable to the applicant. In any event, I agree with R A Hulme J that the judge's directions were adequate in this respect.

15The principal specific complaint was that no direction was given as to the need for the acts of the applicant to be ""conscious and voluntary"". It may be accepted that no direction was given in those terms, but that was because there was no putative loss of consciousness, nor involuntary act of the applicant. The act of the deceased was not to be characterised as an involuntary act of the applicant.

16It is true that Judge Payne gave directions in terms of the need to be satisfied that the applicant was ""the driver"" at the time of the impact, but that conformed to the statutory language. Usually the ""driver"" will be the person ""driving the vehicle"", unless the person's actions were not conscious and voluntary. That exception not being engaged, the direction could aptly focus on ""the driver"" or ""driving"", or both.

17ADAMS J: 
Introduction
I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of R A Hulme J in draft. I agree with his Honour as to Grounds 2, 3 and 4. With respect, however, I am unable to agree with his Honour as to Ground 1 which, in my view, should be upheld and a new trial ordered. Before dealing with the substance of this ground, I wish to discuss the significance of the applicant's absconding before completion of the trial.

The position of counsel

18During her cross-examination, the applicant indicated in emphatic language that she would not answer any further questions. The court adjourned. During the adjournment she conferred with her solicitor. Mr Carty, her counsel, informed the court that the applicant told the solicitor that ""she can't continue, she's had enough, she needs a doctor ... [and if she does not see a doctor] she's going to kill herself"". The trial was further adjourned to enable counsel to speak with the applicant and her mother. On resumption, Mr Carty sought an adjournment to (this being Thursday) the following Tuesday so she could seek medical assistance. The luncheon adjournment was imminent, so the learned trial judge adjourned the trial to 2.15pm to permit the applicant to attend a doctor, making it a condition of her bail that she was to remain in the company of her mother. Her solicitor also proposed to accompany her. When the court reconvened at 2.25, the applicant did not appear. Mr Carty informed the court that the applicant did not attend the Aboriginal Medical Service and had ""effectively run off"". The trial judge ordered the issue of an arrest warrant and continued with the trial. There was no further evidence to be taken and the next substantive matter was addresses.

19It cannot be doubted that the applicant's conduct necessarily terminated the retainers both of her solicitor and her counsel. It was reasonable - and, indeed, quite proper for Mr Carty to have continued in the role of amicus curiae (though he was by no means bound to have done so) in respect of the appropriate disposition of the proceedings, in particular whether the jury should be discharged or the trial continue in the absence of the applicant. When the application to discharge the jury was refused, her Honour asked Mr Carty whether he had submissions to make on the directions. This enlistment of his assistance in this regard was also within his role as amicus. However, he also addressed the jury. He could not do so as the applicant's counsel. In my opinion, the fact that he was no longer her counsel but was appearing as amicus curiae should have been made clear to the jury. By not doing so, they were left to suppose that the applicant was still, through her counsel though personally absent, participating in the trial. This was not the case. It is of course commonplace for the jury not to be informed of matters that are not germane to their consideration of an accused's guilt or otherwise but it is quite another for them, in effect, to be misinformed about an important aspect of the trial. To my mind, the status of counsel is such an important matter. It follows also that, when Mr Carty made submissions as to the directions that had been or should be made to the jury, he was not doing so as the applicant's counsel in any sense, but as amicus curiae.

20This issue was not the subject of any ground of appeal and, quite properly, not addressed by either counsel. However, it is an important issue that, to my mind, warranted mention. I hasten to add that what occurred did not prejudice the applicant and, of course, did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. There is, however, one presently relevant consequence that results from the status of counsel, which is that Rule 4 does not apply to his failure to seek any particular direction. No doubt, Mr Carty made such submissions as he thought necessary or desirable in respect of the judge's directions and, as amicus, it was right that he should assist the judge as best he could. However, he was not appearing for the applicant and the basis for Rule 4, in effect, that a party is bound by the manner in which the case is conducted by his or her counsel, cannot apply when counsel in question is not that of the party. 

Was the applicant the driver at the time of the impact?

21It is unnecessary for me to set out the material facts, which have been comprehensively narrated in the judgment of R A Hulme J and which I gratefully adopt. 

22The fact that the accused must be driving the vehicle at the time of impact is essential by virtue of the language of s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, which creates the offence. What might be called the culpable facts - being under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug, driving at a dangerous speed or in a dangerous manner - are all specified as having to occur at the time of the impact which caused either death or grievous bodily harm.

23""Driving"" is a term in common parlance. Accordingly, whether any conduct in relation to a vehicle amounts to driving is a question of fact. In Jiminez v R [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572, the only feature of the applicant's driving alleged to be within s 52A is that he drove the car whilst tired and drowsy and had fallen asleep. The majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) said (omitting references) - 

9. If the applicant did fall asleep, even momentarily, it is clear that while he was asleep his actions were not conscious or voluntary (an act committed while unconscious is necessarily involuntary) and he could not be criminally responsible for driving the car in a manner dangerous to the public. The offence of culpable driving is, in this respect, no different to any other offence and requires the driving, which is part of the offence, to be a conscious and voluntary act ... 

10. Upon the evidence, it appears that there was a short period of time after the applicant fell asleep and before the impact during which the applicant awoke and attempted to regain control of the car. It was not suggested that, while he was attempting to regain control, the applicant was driving dangerously. Drivers are often confronted with an emergency which requires them to take steps to avoid an accident. Even if the evasive action fails to avoid the accident it does not necessarily amount to driving in a dangerous manner ... 

11. The offence of culpable driving as it applies in the present case requires a motor vehicle to have been driven in a manner dangerous to the public at the time of the impact which occasioned death. Even if the motor vehicle was not being driven dangerously at the precise moment of impact, a preceding period of driving in a dangerous manner may be so nearly contemporaneous with the impact as to satisfy this element of the offence. Contemporaneity is a question for the jury. 

12. In the South Australian case of Kroon (1990) 52 A Crim R 15, at p 18, King C.J. observed that an offence such as culpable driving requires the relevant driving to have been voluntary and that driving while asleep does not constitute a voluntary act. Thus, he said, ""a driver cannot be convicted of causing death or bodily injury by dangerous driving in respect of a period during which the driver is asleep"". But he went on to say ibid, at pp 18-19 - 

""Every act of falling asleep at the wheel is preceded by a period during which the driver is driving while awake and therefore, assuming the absence of involuntariness arising from other causes, responsible for his actions. If a driver who knows or ought to know that there is a significant risk of falling asleep at the wheel, continues to drive the vehicle, he is plainly driving without due care and may be driving in a manner dangerous to the public. If the driver does fall asleep and death or bodily injury results, the driving prior to the falling asleep is sufficiently contemporaneous with the death or bodily injury ... to be regarded as the cause of the death or bodily injury.

... The cases must be rare in which a driver who falls asleep can be exonerated of driving without due care at least, in the moments preceding sleep.""

As King C.J. recognizes, where the question is whether a driver who falls asleep at the wheel is guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, the relevant period of driving is that which immediately precedes his falling asleep. Not only must the period be sufficiently contemporaneous with the time of impact to satisfy the requirement of s.52A but the driving during that period must be, in a practical sense, the cause of the impact and the death. The relevant period cannot be that during which the driver was asleep because during that time his actions were not conscious or voluntary. And, for the reasons which we have given, if the driver's actions upon waking up amount to no more than an attempt to avoid an accident, it cannot be that period of driving.

13. The manner of driving encompasses ""all matters connected with the management and control of a car by a driver when it is being driven"" R. v. Coventry (1938) 59 CLR, at p 639. For the driving to be dangerous for the purposes of s.52A there must be some feature which is identified not as a want of care but which subjects the public to some risk over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by persons who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention ... Although a course of conduct is involved it need not take place over any considerable period ... Nor need the conduct manifest itself in the physical behaviour of the vehicle. If the driver is in a condition while driving which makes the mere fact of his driving a real danger to the public, including the occupants of the motor vehicle, then his driving in that condition constitutes driving in a manner dangerous to the public. In the same way, driving a motor vehicle in a seriously defective condition may constitute driving in a manner dangerous to the public ... even though the defect does not manifest itself until such time as the vehicle is out of the control of the driver. But it should be emphasized, and it must always be brought to the attention of the jury, that the condition of a driver must amount to something other than a lack of due care ... before it can support a finding of driving in a manner dangerous to the public. Driving in that condition must constitute a real danger to the public.

It will follow, as it seems to me, that two elements are necessary before the statutory requirement is satisfied: the first is that the accused must be physically in control of the vehicle; and the second is that, at the material time (which might be some time before impact but sufficiently contemporaneous with it as to satisfy the condition that it be ""at the time of impact""), the accused's driving is conscious or voluntary. 

24Jiminez was concerned with the manner of the appellant's driving and whether that driving at the time of impact was within the proscription. As is clear from para 9 set out above, the question was not whether the appellant was driving. Plainly he was. The question was whether that driving was a conscious and voluntary act. If he was asleep the answer was in the negative. If he was awake and trying to regain control, he was not driving dangerously at that point. The reference to temporality was made in that context, namely where a driver's dangerous driving has brought about an immediate danger of impact but, at the time of impact, the driver is attempting to avoid the result which his or her dangerous driving has brought about. In Jiminez, the driving whilst drowsy was the dangerous driving which led to sleep and thus the loss of control which the appellant was attempting to correct at the time of impact. Another example is speeding around a corner, leading to the loss of control of the vehicle and an impact whilst the driver is attempting to regain control. At the time of impact, the driver is not driving dangerously but the connexion between the dangerous driving and the impact is so direct and immediate as to render the driver liable under the section. It should be noted that where the dangerous driving arises, not from the manner of driving but from the intoxication of the driver, the mere fact that the driver was attempting to regain control would not, of course, be material.

25In this case, even if the applicant was attempting to regain control, if she was driving at the time of impact, her intoxication meant that she had committed the offence. However, the veering of the vehicle into the pole which caused the impact was not the act of the applicant at all but that of the deceased. This is not analogous to the sleeping driver who suddenly wakes up and attempts to regain control. The mere fact, if it be the fact, that the deceased decided to take control of the steering because he feared that the applicant would herself cause an accident does not make his steering into the pole any more the act of the applicant. It may readily be accepted that the vehicle was being driven dangerously in a general sense when the deceased took over the steering but it could not be said that the applicant had lost control at that point. The car was proceeding as she was directing it. If it were out of control, say skidding off the road, and the deceased was attempting to regain control before the impact, the connexion between the driving which led to the loss of control and the impact with the pole could have been regarded as such as to conclude that the applicant was driving dangerously at the time of impact. But there is no evidence that would support this case. 

26If the time frame were such that the applicant might have thought to apply the brakes and decided not to do so, then she might have fairly been regarded as being in control of the forward movement of the car. The evidence of Ms Allen that the applicant put her foot on the accelerator in mistake for the brake - which was necessarily suppositious, especially as she said she did not notice anything about the speed - must be considered with great caution in light of the objective evidence about the time that would have been taken from the commencement of the veering to impact. Furthermore, it is evident that, as the passenger, she could not possibly have seen the applicant do this. In this respect, the applicant's evidence was that she attempted to put her foot on the brake but it happened so quickly that she was not sure whether she had put her foot on the brake or the accelerator. With respect, I do not accept that the applicant's evidence amounted to a concession that she was able, in the circumstances, to control the vehicle by use of the brake. Indeed, it was to the opposite effect. If the evidence permitted the conclusion that, although there was sufficient time to have applied the brake and the applicant chose not to do so, then the conclusion that the applicant was relevantly in control of the vehicle might have conceivably been open (though I doubt it). Otherwise, the ability to touch the brake was as relevant as her ability to touch the radio. 

27Even assuming that, although the applicant did not have control of the steering, she was nevertheless driving if she were able to apply the brake or the accelerator, the crucial question was - in the circumstances here - whether the momentary ability to do so amounted to control of the vehicle. The question of whether the applicant was driving could not be answered simply by asking whether she could apply the brake and the accelerator. The judge directed the jury (the paragraphs are mine, for reference) - 

[1] A person is the driver of a vehicle if she has management and control over its movement, whether by use of the accelerator or gears, brake or steering wheel, or simply by releasing the brakes and allowing gravity to operate. The essence of driving is the use of the driver's controls to direct the movement of the vehicle.

[2] ... The Crown says - and it is the position - that you are entitled to and should look at the manner of driving up to the deceased taking hold of the steering wheel. If you find factually beyond reasonable doubt that he only took hold of it to correct a situation because of her lack of control, she is still the driver, as she still has management and control over its movements. [Emphasis added.]

[3] The issue, though, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in this case is: are your satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the grabbing of the wheel and at the time of impact she still had management and control of the vehicle ... 

The judge then repeated the Crown case (which was endorsed as correct by the italicised phrase) and added - 

[4] ... The issue ... put in a particular way, is are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was in fact still the driver and had the management and control at the time of the grabbing of the wheel and at the time of impact. If there was a reasonable possibility that what the deceased did meant that she was no longer the driver, that she did not have management and control, you would find her not guilty.

[5] Put another way, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was still the driver despite the grabbing of the wheel. If there is a reasonable possibility, to repeat, what the deceased did meant she was no longer the driver, that she did not have management and control, you would have to find her not guilty of both offences. 

[6] Further, if there is a reasonable possibility that the accused had ceased to have management or control over the movement of the motor vehicle, then you would conclude she was not the driver in a legal sense and she would have to be acquitted 

[7] If you accept as a reasonable possibility that the deceased grabbed the wheel and pulled it to the left and denied her the management and control of the vehicle, she would not be the driver and she would have to be found not guilty of both offences.

[8] ... [The] Crown says ... you are entitled and should look, the Crown says, at the manner of driving up to [the deceased] taking hold of the steering wheel. If you find factually he only took hold of it to correct a situation because of lack of control, the [applicant] is still, the Crown says, the driver as long as she still has management and control over its movement.

[9] In short then - and you must take account of all the directions I have given in respect of this aspect of the case - even if the deceased grabbed the wheel for some reason, the issue is are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown, the applicant still had management and control of the vehicle at that time and up to the time of impact.

28There appeared to be two bases upon which the jury were able to hold that the applicant was driving the vehicle at the point of impact. The first (see para [2] above) was that, if the deceased took hold of the steering wheel because the applicant had lost control - that is, I think, was driving in a dangerous manner, as distinct from the vehicle being out of control - then she was still the driver at the point of impact. (However, as I have pointed out above, although the applicant's control of the vehicle was to steer it erratically, there was no evidence that she had lost control.) This argument focussed on the reason for which the deceased grabbed the wheel. The same argument was put in para [8] although, somewhat more ambiguously. This way of considering the case was stated by the judge, in effect, as being correct. In my respectful opinion, it could not have been correct. The reason for which the deceased grabbed the wheel could not affect the question whether the applicant still had control - ie, was driving or put more correctly, whether the course of the vehicle was her act - at the time of impact. If the applicant was already driving toward the pole and the deceased grabbed the steering wheel in an attempt, unsuccessfully, to avoid it, that would (applying the reasoning in Jiminez) direct attention to the immediately previous dangerous driving which could be regarded as having continued to the time of impact. However, this was never the case put by the Crown and was not open on the evidence. The second basis for concluding that the applicant was the driver of the vehicle at the time of impact was that, although she could not steer, she would still be the driver if she used (or could use) the brake and accelerator. The trial judge directed the jury, in effect, that this was sufficient (see para [1]). Repetition of the requirement that the applicant must be acquitted if there was a reasonable doubt about her being the driver at the time of impact did not in any sense qualify the direction as to what being a driver (or having ""management and control"") entailed. However, as I have mentioned above, this access needed to be relevant in the sense that she had an opportunity to apply the brake in a way that would have affected the driving, in short, gave her control of the vehicle. If she had that opportunity and did not apply the brake, then this amounted to driving, or having management and control in the sense explained in para [1]. In my respectful opinion, it was essential to place this possibility in the context of the time between the grabbing of the wheel and the impact. That it was momentarily possible could not mean that she had control and management of the vehicle. The two modes put to the jury of determining the applicant's guilt were, with respect, significantly in error. 

29Mr Carty, submitted that it would be incorrect to direct the jury that, if it thought that the deceased was justified in grabbing the wheel, the applicant would remain the driver even though management and control was taken from her. Mr Carty did not take issue with the direction that a person is the driver if he or she had management and control over its movement, whether by the use of the accelerator or gears, brake or steering wheel. However, as I have pointed out above, it was essential that this be considered in the context of the facts here, namely whether she had opportunity to control the vehicle after the deceased grabbed the steering wheel. Nor did counsel seek a redirection as to whether the driving at the time of impact was the act of the applicant. Although these points were not made by counsel, in my view Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules does not apply for the reasons given above. Even if it did, the misdirections are in my view so fundamental as to require a grant of leave to raise them on appeal.

30R A HULME J: Ms Michelle Williams was found guilty on 7 April 2010 of two offences following a trial before her Honour Judge Payne and a jury in the District Court at Tamworth. The offences were of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death and aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The circumstance of aggravation in each case was that she was driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol present in her blood.

31The offences are contrary to s 52A(2) and (4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the prescribed maximum penalties are imprisonment for 14 years and 11 years respectively.

32Ms Williams absconded during the trial, and that is the subject of one of the grounds of appeal. She was subsequently apprehended on 10 June 2011 and was charged with an offence of failing to appear in accordance with a bail undertaking, contrary to s 51(2) of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW). She pleaded guilty to that offence. 

33For the offence against the Bail Act her Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of eight months specified to commence on 10 June 2011. For the grievous bodily harm offence there was a sentence of 3 years imprisonment, with a non-parole of 18 months commencing on 10 December 2011. For the offence involving death there was a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 10 June 2013.

34The total effective sentence imposed was one of 8 years with a fixed term/non-parole component of 5 years.

35Ms Williams now applies for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence.

Facts

36The offences occurred on Sunday 10 August 2008. The applicant went to a house in Warral Road, Tamworth shortly after midday. She consumed alcohol there with Ms Cecilee Allan throughout the afternoon and into the evening when Mr Darren Reid arrived.

37At about 9.30pm there was a need to get more soft drink to mix with the bourbon that was being consumed. The applicant drove her car, with Mr Reid sitting in the front and Ms Allan in the rear, to a block of flats in Green Street. Mr Reid alighted and procured the soft drink.

38A collision occurred on the return journey. The applicant's car left the roadway and collided with a power pole. It was later revealed that she had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.282mg/100ml.

39Ambulance and police officers were called and promptly attended the scene. Once extricated from the vehicle Mr Reid was taken to hospital where he was placed on life support. Regrettably it became necessary to turn off his life support and he died on 13 August 2008.

40Ms Allan suffered significant abdominal injuries. She underwent a laparotomy. Postoperatively, she was in a serious but stable condition. She was discharged from intensive care on 15 August 2008. She required two operations. The first was to remove her injured bowel and the second six months later was to reconstruct the bowel. There was evidence in the trial that the injuries sustained by Ms Allan ""represented serious life threatening trauma requiring urgent surgery and intensive care and nutritional support"". There was also evidence that following the second surgery she would be ""relatively well ... although given the extent of bowel removal she may require nutritional supplementation and is at risk of adhesive bowel obstruction in the future"". 

41Four women who were walking along the roadway in Green Street at the time of the collision gave evidence. It varied in detail to some extent but was generally to the effect that they became aware of a car approaching from behind them. They were concerned about its speed and path of travel to the extent that they thought it necessary to immediately get off the road and onto the nature strip. They described the car as weaving or swerving to and from the incorrect side of the road a number of times until it went up onto the nature strip on the left hand side and collided with the power pole. Ms Allan's evidence was to similar effect.

42Both Ms Allan and the applicant gave evidence that Mr Reid had grabbed the steering wheel and turned it to the left just before the car left the roadway. In sentencing the applicant, the judge described this as an act of ""self-preservation"". 

43The applicant gave evidence that she was driving normally, despite her high blood alcohol concentration. She denied driving in the manner described by the four pedestrians and Ms Allan. As she was driving up Green Street she looked at her speedometer and saw she was travelling at about 54 km/h (the applicable speed limit was 50 km/h). She said Mr Reid grabbed at the steering wheel and she remonstrated with him and he pulled his hand away. She continued driving up the road and he did it again. She said:

Q. Then what happened?
A. We got up the road a bit and we got up the road like, I don't know about 150 metres probably, yep and we was driving along and next minute he just like jumped across and grabbed the steering wheel and just went jumped across on top of me like that and just like pulled the car into, smashed the car into the pole.

...

Q. What did you do when he grabbed the wheel?
A. Like I remember saying ""Fuck off."" Yeah and that was it. You know that's all that I can remember now.

...

Q. Now did you try and pull the steering wheel back?
A. Just no.

Q. Why not?
A. Because he just like grabbed it, just like, no I didn't have a chance to.

Q. You didn't have a chance to?
A. No.

Q. And what about, did you try and do anything to avoid the collision or could you do anything to avoid the collision? 
A. No its just come across, it just like happened.

44This was to be contrasted with the evidence of Ms Allan:

Q. You said that, Darren took his seatbelt off and then he grabbed the wheel?
A. Yes.

Q. What exactly did you see him doing?
A. I think he was trying to straighten it.

Q. Well he took the seatbelt off, you became aware of that?
A. Yes.

Q. And then?
A. And then we've just - he's grabbed it the wrong way and then we spun and then I don't know and then we went out of control.

...

Q. Did you see any part of Darren's body make contact with Michelle's body?
A. I think he touched her arm.

Q. You think he touched her arm with which part of his body?
A. This his arm. Like, cause she's had her hands doing the wheel and I think as he went across he's just touched her arm like that.

...

Q. Did you see Michelle doing anything when Darren leant across and grabbed the wheel?
A. Like she said, I think she said ""Fucking let go"" or something.

...

Q. She's still got hold of the steering wheel?
A. Yes. She never let go of the steering wheel.

...

Q. When he grabbed the wheel did the car change direction?
A. Yes.

Q. Which way did it go then?
A. We hit the driveway or something, cause we hit something really hard and then we spun for a while and then I just remember hitting something really hard and it must've been the pole. And then I couldn't breathe.

...

Q. Did you notice anything about the speed of the vehicle after Darren grabbed the wheel?
A. No cause it was all - we was all freaking out, all three of us and he put his - and then she put her foot down on the accelerator instead of the brake which she didn't mean - she meant to put her foot on the brake. She just lost control of the car and then we just spun and that's what I mean by spinning and I don't know where we spun, but I remember like it felt like dirt, so that must've been the front lawn. (emphasis added)

Ms Allan was challenged in cross-examination about the last answer above:

Q. And you wouldn't know whether she put her foot on the accelerator or the brake or whether she was able to put her--
A. No sorry yes I do--

Q. Foot on the accelerator or the brake, I suggest?
A. I do because the car started revving, because when you changed gears in an automatic you can hear it when it's being - when you flatten your foot on the accelerator you can hear it revving over so it can change the gears, like the revs are being over, too far over, you know what I mean, she was over revving it, for too over revved to change gears. Do you know what I mean?

Q. All right, well-
A. She got her revs up too fast.

Q. Well you said--
A. So it revved out.

Q. You said that she tried to hit the brake but hit the accelerator?
A. Yes.

Q. So why - on what basis do you tell the court on oath that she tried to hit the brake but hit the accelerator?
A. Because she was freaked out, I could tell she wanted to hit the brake.

Q. How could you tell?
A. Because the way she put her foot flat on the accelerator.

Q. Well did you see her put her foot flat on the accelerator?
A. No but I heard the car--

Q. You couldn't have seen that, could you?
A. No--

Q. You couldn't have seen her feet at all?
A. No I didn't see it. I didn't see it.

Q. Because even if you were seated in the middle of the back seat your view was obscured by Darren Reid who leant right across, that's right isn't it?
A. I don't know. I didn't see her do it but I know that - I just know because I was there--

Q. I suggest to you that the vehicle did not accelerate when the vehicle took a sharp turn to the left?
A. Well how come we went faster into the pole.

Q. Well I'm suggesting to you that the speed--
A. We wasn't going 60 into a pole, we went faster into the pole.

45In cross-examination, the applicant said she had both hands on the wheel when Mr Reid grabbed the steering wheel; she tried to gain control of the car, but she could not do anything (AB 526). She attempted to put her foot on the brake, but she was not sure if she hit the accelerator instead because ""it happened that quick"" (AB 527).

46There was expert evidence to the effect that the applicant's driving had left no marks on the roadway in Green Street up until tyre (""yaw"") marks commencing at a point some 16 metres from the power pole. It was accepted by both sides that this indicated the approximate point where the car suddenly turned to the left in the direction of the pole. The speed of the car was estimated to be ""not less than 59 kph at the time of losing control"" (according to Senior Constable Clout), or between 52 and 61 kph (according to an expert called in the defence case). Accordingly, the time that elapsed from when Mr Reid grabbed at the steering wheel to the point of impact was about one second.

Grounds of appeal

47There are four grounds of appeal against conviction. Leave pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) is required in respect of the first, third and fourth grounds as they concern matters which were not the subject of objection at the trial. Leave is required in respect of ground two as it does not involve a ""question of law alone"": s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The grounds are:


Ground 1. The presiding judge misdirected the jury with respect to the issue of 'driver'.

Ground 2. The presiding judge erred in ordering that the trial proceed in the absence of the accused.

Ground 3. The presiding judge erred in putting the full evidence of Dr Judith Perl to the jury.

Ground 4. The presiding judge misdirected the jury in relation to the role of the Crown Prosecutor.

Ground 1 (misdirection with respect to the issue of ""driver"")

48Before referring to the manner in which the prosecution and defence cases were presented and the directions given to the jury by the trial judge it is appropriate to note the terms of the s 52A. It provides, relevantly:

52A Dangerous driving: substantive matters

(1) Dangerous driving occasioning death

A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle: 

(a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug, or

(b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or

(c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.

A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.

(2) Aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death

A person is guilty of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death if the person commits the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.

[S 52A(3) and (4) are in identical terms except that they refer to grievous bodily harm rather than death]

...

(7) Circumstances of aggravation

In this section, circumstances of aggravation means any circumstances at the time of the impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm in which:

(a) the prescribed concentration of alcohol was present in the accused's breath or blood ...

(8) Defences

It is a defence to any charge under this section if the death or grievous bodily harm occasioned by the impact was not in any way attributable (as relevant): 

(a) to the fact that the person charged was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug or a combination of drugs, or

(b) to the speed at which the vehicle was driven, or

(c) to the manner in which the vehicle was driven.

(9) Definitions

In this section:

...

prescribed concentration of alcohol means a concentration of 0.15 grammes or more of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood. ...

49The essential elements the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt in order for the applicant to be found guilty were:


1. A vehicle was involved in an impact

2. The impact occasioned the death or grievous bodily harm of another person

3. At the time of the impact the applicant was driving the vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor

4. The prescribed concentration of alcohol was present in the applicant's breath or blood.

50In his opening address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor referred to the essential elements of the offences and then said that he anticipated that there would be an issue as to whether the applicant ""was actually the driver when the passenger grabbed the steering wheel"". He foreshadowed his ultimate submission that she was the driver ""because she occupied the driver's seat, she was the one in control of the movement of the car, being the person who was still in control of the braking system on the car and the accelerator, for means of putting the car in motion and keeping it in motion"".

51The prosecutor also anticipated that there would be an issue as to whether the death of Mr Reid and the grievous bodily harm to Ms Allen were not in any way attributable to the applicant being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

52The prosecutor's anticipation of the issues was borne out in the opening address of counsel for the applicant and both issues were the focus of counsels' closing addresses.

53The trial judge put the ""driver"" issue to the jury as one as to whether the applicant was ""driving"" the car at the exact moment of impact. I will say something later about whether this was necessary. Her Honour's direction included:

A person is the driver of a vehicle if she has management and control over its movement, whether by the use of the accelerator or gears, brake or steering wheel, or simply by releasing the brakes and allowing gravity to operate. The essence of driving is the use of the driver's controls to direct the movement of the vehicle. (emphasis added) (AB 48)

54In the course of relating that direction to the manner in which the Crown and defence had pitched their respective cases, her Honour said (and repeated it in similar terms a number of times):

Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was in fact still the driver and had the management and control at the time of the grabbing of the wheel and at the time of impact? If there was a reasonable possibility that what the deceased did meant that she was no longer the driver, that she did not have management and control, you would have to find her not guilty. (AB 49)

55There was quite a deal of discussion about the terms of the directions to be given to the jury on the issue of ""driver"". This occurred immediately after counsels' closing addresses had been made and also during the course of the summing up. The applicant's absconding brought the evidence phase of the trial to an end and, after the judge had determined to continue the trial in her absence, the addresses immediately followed. Whether counsel for the applicant gave consideration to his continued involvement in the trial is not apparent. But whether he regarded himself as continuing to act on instructions, or upon some amicus basis, it would appear that he applied himself diligently to the tasks at hand in advancing and protecting the applicant's interests. His address and submissions and his conduct of the case for the applicant generally, notwithstanding her absence, were not the subject of any criticism by counsel now appearing.

56The first extract from the summing up that I have set out above was read verbatim in draft and the essence of the second extract was also read in draft in the absence of the jury. Counsel for the applicant expressed his approval. (AB 42-44) The only issue taken by counsel was in resisting the jury being reminded of a Crown submission. Her Honour did remind the jury of that submission, but in the second of the paragraphs extracted below, she negated it:

If you find factually he only took hold of [the steering wheel] to correct a situation because of a lack of control, then Miss Williams is still, the Crown says, the driver as long as she still has management and control over its movement.

In short then - and you must take into account all of the directions that I have given in respect of this aspect of the case, even if the deceased grabbed the wheel for some reason, the issue is are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown Miss Williams still had management and control of the vehicle at that time and up to the time of the impact. (AB 63)

Driving is a conscious and voluntary act

57A person must be acting consciously and voluntarily to be the driver of a motor vehicle: Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 577. It was submitted for the applicant that the directions of the trial judge were deficient in not referring to this requirement. In my view the point is implicit in the directions that were given and there was no error. It is unsurprising that counsel at trial did not suggest to her Honour that there was the deficiency now claimed by different counsel. 

Can a person be a ""driver"" without being able to steer?

58It was also submitted that the directions on the element of ""driver"" were deficient because there was an absence of a direction that if the accused had lost the ability to steer the vehicle she was no longer the driver.

59The ability to steer a vehicle is not, on my research (no authority was cited by either party in relation to the proposition), an essential aspect of a person being a ""driver"". 

60""Drive"" is defined in s 3(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) as including being ""in control of the steering, movement or propulsion of a vehicle"", but there is nothing that extends the operation of that definition beyond that Act. ""Drive"" is not defined in the Crimes Act. Perhaps the legislature could consider including such a definition to avoid uncertainty and to promote legislative consistency. As the point was not raised in the submissions for either party I will say no more about it.

61There is a wealth of cases in which the concept of ""driving"" has been examined and the factual permutations are almost infinite. Many of them are civil cases concerned with third-party insurance and there are statements to be found in some of them to the effect that in that context a more liberal approach to interpretation than in penal cases may be taken: see, for example, Ricketts v Laws (1988) 14 NSWLR 311 at 315 per Kirby P. I will confine my reference to the following.

62In R v Affleck (1992) 65 A Crim R 96, the defendant only had control over the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals while another man had control of the gear stick and yet another man was steering. A charge of negligent driving was dismissed by a magistrate but the prosecution appealed. It was held by Smart J (at 98) that having ""control over propulsion, that is, over the mode of moving and stopping the vehicle"" was ""sufficient to make him the driver"". He added that if he was wrong about that, the three men were together ""driving"" the vehicle. His Honour cited in support of the latter proposition some cases in which it had been held that more than one person may be the driver of a vehicle: Ricketts v Laws at 314, per Kirby P; Langman v Valentine [1952] 2 All ER 803 at 805; and Bassell v McGuiness (1981) 29 SASR 508 at 522. 

63In Police v Thompson [2006] SASC 20; (2006) 45 MVR 37, the accelerator pedal became stuck after being depressed and the respondent's car careered out of his driveway, across the road and collided with a stump on the other side. A magistrate dismissed a drink driving charge on the basis that the respondent's actions were not voluntary. Vanstone J allowed a prosecution appeal, holding that there was no issue of voluntariness and that the respondent was driving because he maintained the ability to operate all the functions of the vehicle, including the brakes, steering and transmission. In other words, being denied the ability to operate one of the functions normally required for driving did not exclude the respondent from being the ""driver"". The applicable legislation in that case was s 5(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (SA) which provided that ""drive includes being in control of"".

64The jury's verdict in this case involved a determination in favour of the Crown that the applicant maintained management and control of the car, at least in terms of controlling its means of propulsion (both in terms of accelerating and braking), up to the very point of impact. The applicant conceded as much in her evidence. No complaint was raised by counsel at trial as to the terms of the direction. Counsel had ample opportunity to consider in advance the directions the judge proposed to give to the jury and he positively supported them.

65That, in my view, is sufficient to dispose of this ground of appeal. I would refuse leave pursuant to Rule 4 to rely upon it. However, there are some additional observations I wish to make.

66It is doubtful whether it was necessary to pose the issue as one requiring the jury to determine whether the applicant was the ""driver"" at the exact moment of impact. This appears to have placed an onus on the Crown above that which is required by the section. In reality, the directions given to the jury would seem to have been unnecessarily and erroneously favourable to the applicant.

67A person charged with an offence of dangerous driving occasioning either death or grievous bodily harm does not have to be shown to have been voluntarily and consciously managing and controlling the movement of the vehicle at the exact moment of impact. In Jiminez v The Queen, the applicant fell asleep and lost control before the car left the roadway and collided with trees. It was held (at 578):

The offence of culpable driving as it applies in the present case requires a motor vehicle to have been driven in a manner dangerous to the public at the time of the impact which occasioned death. Even if the motor vehicle was not being driven dangerously at the precise moment of impact, a preceding period of driving in a dangerous manner may be so nearly contemporaneous with the impact as to satisfy this element of the offence. Contemporaneity is a question for the jury. (Citation of authority omitted) (emphasis added)

68It seems to me that the issue in the present case could well have been confined to that posed by s 52A(8). There was really no dispute that the Crown had established each of the elements of the offence. It was common ground that she was the driver in the period leading up to about one second prior to the impact. It could hardly be suggested that this was not sufficiently contemporaneous. She was grossly intoxicated and there was no dispute that her driving ability was ""very substantially impaired"" (Dr Perl, a pharmacologist, was not cross-examined about her opinion as to this). The real issue was whether the death and grievous bodily harm were not in any way attributable to the applicant's intoxication because of the intervention of the deceased.

69In her summing up to the jury, Judge Payne set out the defence in s 52A(8). After restating the elements of the offences, her Honour told the jury:

[I]f you were satisfied of those four matters beyond reasonable doubt, if that was so, you should find the accused guilty of each offence, unless the accused has satisfied you that the death... and the grievous bodily harm occasioned by the impact, was not in any way attributable... to the fact that the accused was under the influence of intoxicating liquor... It is sufficient if she establishes that on the balance of probabilities. (AB 50)

70Clearly the jury was not satisfied of that on the balance of probabilities.

71In my view, if there was error in the directions given by the trial judge it was error which favoured the applicant by giving her a prospect of acquittal to which she was not entitled. There was no miscarriage of justice.

Ground 2 (error in continuing the trial in the absence of the accused)

72It is necessary to refer to events which immediately preceded the applicant absconding. 

73The trial commenced on Monday 29 March 2010. It was the week leading up to Easter. The Crown closed its case on the morning of Thursday 1 April. The applicant gave evidence which commenced at 9.41am. Her evidence in chief was relatively short (some 12 pages of transcript). The Crown Prosecutor commenced to cross-examine her. There are 17 pages of transcript of that cross-examination before the applicant responded to a question with:

You know what, you know what, I'm not answering any more of your questions, hey, I told you what happened, you know that's what happened. (AB 528)

74She was told by the trial judge that she had to answer the prosecutor's questions which she did for a short period but then responded to another question with:

No you know what, I don't care because I'm not going to answer any more of your fucking goddamn questions because that's what happened. (AB 530)

75The applicant repeated that she would refuse to answer any more questions; she maintained her innocence; she said she did not care if she was found guilty; she said ""I don't give a fuck if I go to gaol"". This tirade continued for some time, despite attempts by her Honour, defence counsel, and an unidentified speaker (seemingly her mother) to have the applicant desist. Ultimately her Honour directed the sheriff's officer to take the jury out. There was discussion with counsel and then a short adjournment was taken.

76Counsel for the applicant made an application that the jury be discharged. After some discussion the judge indicated she was not disposed to grant the application, but this appears to have been a tentative view and she made no formal ruling. In the course of ensuing discussion, her Honour was informed that the applicant ""had a complete melt down"", that she could not continue, and she needed to see a doctor.

77The judge indicated she would stand the matter down until after lunch in order to permit the applicant to attend upon a doctor but warned:

And if she doesn't attend the trial will continue in her absence and that's what the law is, the trial can continue and I'll issue a warrant for her arrest.

78She reiterated a short time later, ""to make it crystal clear"", that the trial would proceed if the applicant did not reappear.

79Bail conditions were imposed. They required the applicant to remain at all times in the company of her mother. It was noted that her solicitor would also accompany her. She was to proceed directly from the court to either the Tamworth Base Hospital or the Aboriginal Medical Service and return by 2.15pm.

80Upon the resumption, defence counsel informed her Honour that the applicant had not attended either the hospital or the medical service but had absconded. He sought an adjournment until the following Tuesday which was granted. The question of whether to discharge the jury was deferred until then. 

81When the trial resumed on the Tuesday the judge heard submissions on the question of discharging the jury. She refused the application and gave an ex tempore judgment. 

82When the jury were brought into court they were directed not to ""speculate in any way concerning [the accused's] absence and certainly not draw any adverse inference to her from that absence, but certainly the trial will be proceeding"". Counsel then addressed and the judge gave her summing up. 

83In the course of the summing up the judge directed the jury to ""put to one side"" the incident during the cross-examination of the applicant when ""she became extremely upset"" and ""emotions got the better of her"". She also directed the jury ""not to draw any bad or adverse inference to her in respect of that behaviour in the witness box"". (SU 5)

84Her Honour also reminded the jury of her direction that they ""should put to one side the circumstance that Miss Williams is not now present"" and that they ""must not speculate as to why she is not in attendance"" and that they ""must not draw any bad or adverse inference to her as to why that is the position"". (SU 6)

85In the ex tempore judgment on the application to discharge the jury her Honour acknowledged that the issue was a discretionary one. She took into account the stage the trial had reached, the age of the matter, the fact that some of the witnesses had been required to travel some distance to attend, and that the accused had been put on notice that the trial would continue in her absence if she failed to return after being permitted the indulgence of leaving the court to seek medical treatment. She expressed the view that any prejudice to the accused could be cured by directions to the jury.

Submissions

86It was contended for the applicant that the trial should not have continued. The jury might have engaged in speculation regarding her absence. She had not completed her evidence. And there was no opportunity for her counsel to re-examine her on matters raised during the cross-examination. 

87It was submitted that there would have been no disadvantage to the Crown if the trial was aborted and the jury discharged. All of the prosecution witnesses had given their evidence and so a further trial could be conducted by way of placing the evidence of any witnesses before a fresh jury by way of transcript. I interpolate that, given the challenge to the credibility and reliability of some of the prosecution witnesses, it is doubtful that such an approach at a further trial would have been appropriate.

88Reference was also made to some evidence given by Ms Allan about the applicant's character and history of driving which was described as gratuitous and prejudicial. Ms Allan volunteered on a number of occasions that the applicant's manner of driving on the occasion in question was the same as it was on previous occasions when she had driven whilst drunk.

89This was one of the factors relied upon by counsel at trial in support of his application for the jury to be discharged. Her Honour, however, accepted the Crown submission that it was a matter that ""can more than adequately be dealt with by appropriate direction to the jury"". The judge gave such a direction at the end of the summing up by telling the jury to ""put that evidence completely out of your mind and focus only on the manner of driving at the time on this particular day"". No further direction was sought.

90No issue has been taken with the reasoning disclosed in her Honour's judgment refusing the application to discharge the jury. The submission for the applicant is understood to be that the decision to continue the trial was simply one that was not available in the proper exercise of her Honour's discretion.

91The Crown submitted that the applicant had made a deliberate choice to absent herself from her trial. Reference was made to a community interest in the completion of the trial, particularly because it was concerned with a death. The only disadvantage to the applicant identified in the written submissions on her behalf was the inability for her to complete the cross-examination and to be re-examined. However, it was submitted that such disadvantage was the product of her conscious and deliberate decision to abscond. Accordingly it was submitted that there were public policy reasons which militated in favour of continuing the trial in her absence. Reference was also made to the fact that the applicant's counsel had remained in the trial. He addressed the jury and advanced the applicant's interests in terms of making submissions as to her Honour's summing up.

Consideration

92In Jamal v R [2012] NSWCCA 198, Hidden J referred (at [35]) to what he described as ""longstanding authority affirming that, generally speaking, an accused should be present at every stage of a criminal trial"". His Honour went on to refer to some cases in which there has been an exception to that general proposition, one of which was R v McHardie & Danielson [1983] 2 NSWLR 733. In that case there was an issue as to whether the trial judge had erred in failing to discharge the jury when one of the accused (McHardie), having escaped from prison, did not appear. The Court found (at 742) that absconding on bail during a trial amounts to a waiver by the accused of his right to be present at the trial, and similarly so in the case of an accused who escapes from lawful custody.

93The Court looked at the following matters in the course of considering whether there was error in the exercise of the discretion by the trial judge in permitting the trial of McHardie to continue: most of the Crown case against McHardie had been given by the time of his escape; it was a very cogent case; a great deal of time of the Court, jury, and witnesses, had been expended up to that stage. Another factor was that the co-offender Danielson who was jointly charged desired the trial to proceed. Their Honours concluded in relation to this ground (at 745):

Notwithstanding the general principle that at an indictable offence trial before a judge and jury the accused's presence is normally a prerequisite to a fair trial, his failure to appear after the trial has started, through his escape from lawful custody, can correctly be described and found to be a waiver of his right to be present at his trial; that the trial judge has a discretion as to whether he should continue his trial, or discharge the jury.

...

We hold that no error has been shown in the exercise of the judge's discretion to continue the trial, and that on an overall view of the trial, no miscarriage of justice has been shown in the matter now being considered.

94In R v Jones [1998] SASC 7021; (1998) 72 SASR 281 it was held (at 294-295) that a Court may proceed with a trial in the absence of the accused in circumstances where the accused has waived a right to be present; such a waiver could be constituted by an escape from custody or breach of bail or where without good excuse or explanation the accused absents him or herself from the proceedings. The rationale for this principle was said (at 295) to be that otherwise an accused who was on bail and who believed at some time during the trial that his or her prospects of acquittal were remote could absent himself or herself and thereby force a new trial. If that was the principle it would be necessary to revoke the bail of all accused persons at the outset of their trial which would be an unfortunate and unfair consequence.

95Later in Jones it was said that the first matter which must be considered in the exercise of the discretion is whether the accused has voluntarily absented himself or herself and whether such absence indicates a waiver of the right to be present during the whole of the proceedings. The next matter to be ascertained is whether counsel would remain during the continuation of the trial (at 296). Other matters to consider are the strength and nature of the Crown case, the defence insofar as it has been disclosed, the length of time over which the case has run and will run, the prejudice that the accused might suffer, the risk of a miscarriage of justice, the inconvenience to the victims and the witnesses and the impact upon the administration of justice (at 297). A further matter ""a trial judge must always consider"" is the fundamental right of an accused to be present at his or her trial and that the discretion to continue at the trial should only ever be exercised sparingly (at 297).

96In my view it has not been established that there was error in the exercise of the trial judge's discretion to order the continuation of the trial in the absence of the applicant. This was particularly so given the late stage at which the applicant absconded, with little left for which the applicant could have had any input and particularly having regard to the warning that the trial judge had given as to the consequences of absconding. The other matters her Honour took into account were of the type considered relevant in R v McHardie & Danielson and R v Jones. The conclusion to continue the trial was one that was open to her Honour. Her judgment was based upon correct principle, it was unaffected by any extraneous matters, there was no mistake as to the facts, and she took into account all material considerations: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.

97No error has been established. I would refuse leave to rely upon this ground.

Ground 3 (error in reminding the jury of Dr Perl's evidence)

98During the course of her summing up the judge reminded the jury of the evidence given by expert witnesses. She referred to the evidence of Dr Perl, a pharmacologist, Dr Breusch, a forensic pathologist, and Constable Clout and Mr Grant Johnston, both of whom were traffic collision investigators. Her Honour's summary of the evidence of the latter three was brief but she reminded the jury of the majority of the evidence of Dr Perl.

99It was submitted that, given intoxication was not in dispute, it was inappropriate for her Honour ""to reinforce matters not in issue in the case so as to prejudice the [applicant] in the eyes of the jury"". It was submitted that whilst this on its own may be thought to have little merit, it may have compelled the jury to focus on the applicant's considerable intoxication rather than upon the important issue as to whether she was the ""driver"".

Consideration

100Her Honour's reference to the evidence of Dr Perl occupies less than two pages of transcript of the summing up. It did involve reference to the majority of her evidence, but that is because it was relatively brief and there was no cross-examination. 

101Dr Perl's evidence concerned the level of impairment of the applicant's ability to drive. In my view that was a significant matter for the jury to take into account because of the reliance of the applicant upon the defence in s 52A(8). For the jury to consider whether the death and the grievous bodily harm occasioned by the impact was not in any way attributable to the fact that the applicant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, her level of impairment was an important consideration.

102The essential elements of the offences were the subject of clear directions by her Honour. The jury were told that there was no dispute in relation to any of them apart from the necessity for the Crown to prove that the applicant was ""the driver"". In the way the trial was conducted, that was obviously the most significant issue and I cannot accept that her Honour's review of the evidence of Dr Perl distracted the jury from it.

103In my view this ground has no merit and it is unsurprising that counsel raised no complaint about the matter at trial. Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Ground 4 (misdirection as to the role of the Crown Prosecutor)

104At an early stage of the summing up the judge gave the jury directions about the respective roles of judge and jury. In the course of this she said:

My role is to ensure that there is a fair trial to both the Crown, who prosecutes on behalf the whole community, and on behalf of the accused. (AB 28)

105A little later (one page of transcript) her Honour said:

You have very important matters to decide in this case, important not only to the accused but also to the whole community. (AB 29)

106It was submitted that by identifying the Crown as prosecuting on behalf of the community and by identifying the jury as part of the community there was a distinct possibility that the jury would align their role and responsibilities as inextricably linked to those of the Crown. It was submitted that this was ""an improper exercise to undertake as it disadvantaged the [applicant]"".

107Arguments similar to those advanced under this ground were considered by this Court in Skipworth v R [2006] NSWCCA 37 at [32]-[49] and Makarov v R (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 292 at [107]-[112]. On both occasions the point was found to have no merit. I agree with and adopt what was said in those cases and come to the same conclusion in this case.

108Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Conclusion as to appeal against conviction

109None of the grounds have merit. Leave to appeal against conviction should be refused.

Application for leave to appeal against sentence

110Leave was sought to rely upon two grounds of appeal against sentence. They were:


Ground 5. The presiding judge erred in not properly considering the issue of the deceased grabbing the steering wheel and causing the vehicle to lose control.

Ground 6. The presiding judge erred by accumulating the sentences imposed so that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive.

Ground 5

111It was submitted that the grabbing of the steering wheel by the deceased was a ""very powerful mitigating factor which reduced the applicant's otherwise high moral culpability"".

112Reference was made to her Honour saying that she accepted the Crown's submission that Mr Reid grabbed the wheel out of self-preservation (AB 84). It was submitted that there was no evidence to support such a conclusion.

113The Crown submitted that the finding was open to her Honour. The judge rejected a submission that there was no erratic driving before the accident. The actions of Mr Reid could only have arisen out of fear or panic occasioned by his perception of the applicant's driving. His conduct did little to ameliorate the seriousness of the applicant's conduct as it was that conduct that induced Mr Reid's action.

Consideration

114The statement by her Honour which is said to be erroneous appeared in the context of her Honour considering the objective seriousness of the offences. 

115Her Honour first referred to the blood alcohol reading of 0.282 and concluded that it was ""exceedingly high"" and for that reason alone made ""this a serious example of the aggravated offence"". Her Honour then referred to the evidence of Dr Perl that the applicant's driving ability was ""very substantially impaired"". She also referred to the nature of the injuries sustained by Ms Allan; that the collision occurred in a suburban street at a time when it would be expected that there would be other road users and pedestrians; the applicant's erratic driving involved swerving from side to side; and the ""not ... insignificant length of trip"". 

116It was in the course of referring to these features that her Honour said:

I also accept the Crown's submission Mr Reid grabbed the wheel out of self-preservation. The real relevance of this is in relation to it being consistent with my view that the car was swerving. The witnesses described it variously as fishtailing but going from side to side as it went down the road, ultimately off to the left and into the power pole.

117Counsel for the applicant submitted that there could be other explanations for the deceased having grabbed the steering wheel other than self-preservation. To my mind it is difficult to envisage a sensible alternative explanation, although whether Mr Reid was acting sensibly cannot necessarily be assumed. Nevertheless I am of the view that the finding made by her Honour was one that was well open to her to make. The primary cause of the applicant's vehicle colliding with the power pole was the fact that she was driving with an extremely high blood alcohol concentration and she was driving erratically. The evidence of those two factors was overwhelming. 

118There is no merit in this ground.

Ground 6 (accumulation of sentences resulting in a manifestly excessive overall sentence)

119The written submissions for the applicant in relation to this ground commenced by accepting the accumulation by six months of the sentences for the driving offences upon the sentence for the Bail Act offence. But it was then submitted that her Honour should have ordered that the sentences for the driving offences run concurrently, ie they should both have been specified to commence on 10 December 2011. The basis for this was that ""there was only one single driving incident"".

120Counsel referred to other cases in which concurrent sentences had been imposed: R v Dunlop [2001] NSWCCA 435; R v Rayner [2002] NSWCCA 309; R v Reeves [1999] NSWCCA 269; and R v Black NSWCCA 23 July 1998, unreported).

121The Crown submitted that there was no general rule that there should be concurrent sentences imposed for offences that are committed within a single act. If wholly concurrent sentences do not adequately reflect the total criminality of the conduct, the appropriate aggregate sentence is ordinarily achieved by making the sentences wholly or partially cumulative. 

Consideration

122The judge was correct when she said:

Keeping in mind the principle of totality, the criminality in respect of the offences require some accumulation.

123The judge was required to determine the sentences for the individual sentences before considering questions of cumulation or concurrence and the principle of totality: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 624. She was required to consider whether the total sentence properly reflected the totality of criminality, including whether the sentence for one offence could comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] per Howie J; and R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 196 A Crim R 38 at [52] per Hall J.

124The fact that there have been some cases in which concurrent sentences were imposed does not support the proposition that the judge was wrong to accumulate the sentence for one offence upon the non-parole period for the other offence. Imposing concurrent sentences in this case would have failed to recognise and reflect the fact that the applicant's criminal conduct resulted in the death of one person and the serious bodily harm to another.

125Sentencing in cases of multiple offences of dangerous driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm arising from a single incident of driving usually result in partially or wholly accumulated sentences in order to reflect the harm caused to multiple victims: see, for example, R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [23] per Hunt AJA; Richards v R [2006] NSWCCA 262 at [78], per McColl JA; and Duncan v R [2012] NSWCCA 78 at [40] - [41] per Basten JA. 

126The accumulation of sentences where there are multiple victims is not a recent phenomenon. In R v Wilkins (1988) 38 A Crim R 445 a single episode of driving caused the death of three persons and grievous bodily harm to a fourth. The sentencing judge accumulated one of the sentences upon others. Lee CJ at CL said (at 449) that to make all the sentences concurrent ""would make the law a laughing stock.""

127It was contended in written submissions for the applicant that there was ""an unreasonable accumulation of the sentences"". This raises a question as to whether a total term of 7 years 6 months and total non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was unreasonable.

128The starting point is to accept the correctness of her Honour's characterisation of the applicant's moral culpability as being very high to the point that it amounted to an abandonment of responsibility. 

129Her Honour took into account a number of subjective matters which called for some moderation of the sentences to be imposed. For example, she remarked that the applicant ""has had a very difficult life and one unfortunately similar to many Aboriginal women"". The applicant's history included sexual abuse as a child; intellectual functioning in the borderline range; depression, panic and post-traumatic stress disorders; and ongoing problems with alcohol abuse. She had five children, three of whom lived with her who were aged 3, 5 and 14. Her Honour accepted that she was remorseful and had taken responsibility for her offending behaviour.

130On the other hand, the applicant had never held a driver's licence in this State but had a number of prior driving offences. Her record in Queensland was described as ""fairly long"", although she had only been imprisoned once, for a period of one month. The driving record prompted her Honour to conclude that the applicant had an attitude of disobedience to the law which warranted greater weight to be given to retribution and personal deterrence. General deterrence was also taken into account, with ""slight"" moderation on account of the applicant's mental health issues.

131It was necessary for the judge to impose sentences which were individually, and overall, proportionate to the objective seriousness of the offences. It has not been established, in my view, that the total effective sentence exceeded the boundaries of her Honour's discretion.

Conclusion as to sentence

132There is no merit in either of the grounds of appeal against sentence. I would refuse leave to appeal.

Orders

133I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal against conviction refused.

2. Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

		15 March 2013",2012-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760792,New South Wales Crime Commission v Peter Geoffrey Martin [2013] NSWSC 15,"Judgment (ex tempore - REVISED 15 JANUARY 2013) 

1HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks a restraining order pursuant to section 10A(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Recovery Act). For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make such an order.

2There has been some controversy, in first instance judgments, as to whether it is necessary for reasons to be given for the making of a restraining order. That controversy was canvassed by Davies J in NSW Crime Commission v Younan [2012] NSWSC 13. I agree with his Honour's analysis, and with his conclusion that reasons should be given. I adopt his Honour's reasoning, and I shall not repeat what his Honour said. 

3By s 10A(5) of the Recovery Act, the Court is to make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating certain things. Relevantly for present purposes, that affidavit must state that the officer suspects that the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in serious crime-related activity or activities. Subsection (5) adds, as an additional requirement, that the Court be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.

4In this case, the application is supported by a statement of facts and circumstances (see UCPR r 1.26, read in conjunction with Sch 10) and an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn today.

5Mr Spark deposes that he is an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10A(5). He deposes to holding a suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or activities, namely, manufacture of a prohibited drug of an amount greater than or equal to the commercial quantity. That is a ""serious criminal offence"" within s 6(2)(b) of the Recovery Act.

6Mr Spark sets out the grounds of his suspicion. In brief, he deposes that:

(1) he made enquiries of a police officer;
(2) the police officer sent him a ""facts sheet"" in relation to the defendant;
(3) the police officer stated that the investigations had been carried out under his supervision and that he believed the contents of the facts sheet to be true; and
(4) further enquiries that Mr Spark directed to be made showed that the defendant had been arrested and charged with offences (of a kind described in the facts sheet), including the serious crime-related activity to which I referred earlier.

7The facts sheet is annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit. There is no need to go into its detail. I am satisfied that it, attested by the police officer's statement of belief in the truth of its contents, forms a reasonable basis for the suspicion that Mr Spark swears he has formed. 

8Mr Spark's affidavit also shows that the defendant is proprietor, as tenant in common with another person who appears to be a co-offender, of two parcels of real estate. The restraining order is sought in respect of the defendant's interest in each of those parcels of real estate. 

9Inevitably, the administrative enforcement of the restraining order may affect the interest of the other proprietor, at least in a practical sense. The court was informed that as a matter of administrative convenience, the Crime Commission would lodge a caveat. The effect of that caveat, even if directed only to the defendant's interest in the parcels of real estate, would be to prevent any dealings until the caveat was discharged. That however is a matter for the defendant and the co-proprietor, who can make application if they wish. I express no view as to whether a restraining order under s 10A(1) of the Recovery Act would give the Crime Commission, in whose favour it is made, a caveatable interest in the land.

10The affidavit shows also that the defendant holds two bank accounts with a certain bank. They are also items of property in respect of which the restraining orders sought will operate.

11The summons also seeks, among other things, orders for the examination of the defendant and the co-proprietor of the real estate to whom I referred. The court was informed that some judges will make those orders ex parte and others will not. I fall into the latter category. Having intimated that position in the course of submissions, the court was informed that the application would not be pressed ex parte.

12I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the restraining orders sought, but not the examination orders. They can be pressed at a later time, when the defendant (and the other person sought to be examined) have had an opportunity of considering their position.

13I note that the plaintiff by its solicitor gives to the court, on behalf of the State, the usual undertaking as to damages. I make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 as amended of the form of order, amended and initialled by me and dated today's date. I direct that those orders be entered forthwith. I hand the documents back.

14I adjourn the summons for hearing to 15 April 2013.

2760814,Rv Dejong; R v Tuimauluga; R v Puru; R v Zechel [2013] NSWDC 29,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Home invasions are all serious offences but some are worse than others. The offence I am about to describe is getting close to the worst kind of offence of that type.

2As will be obvious when I recite what occurred on 4 July 2011, the four offenders for sentence today carried on their terrifying and violent conduct in the presence of not only frightened adults but also in the presence of children. Common decency and humanity might have led to these offenders altering their behaviour once they became aware that they were going to commit their serious, violent, and terrifying conduct in the presence of young children. One might have thought they would immediately turn and leave, but they did not. They persisted in what they had planned to do. They deserve to go to gaol, each of them, for a long time, simply to reflect the objective gravity of their criminal conduct.

3What occurred on 4 July, or more accurately I suppose the following morning, on the fifth, is set out in a statement of the primary victim of that offence, a Mr Ty Cruickshank. He was living with his girlfriend and her four children in a home at Woodberry. One of his girlfriend's children was not there that morning but another child was. There were thus four children from age two or three to age ten present in the home. Also was another adult, Mr Cruickshank's girlfriend's brother.

4Everyone appears to have been asleep at 3 o'clock in the morning when there was a loud bang coming from the front door. Mr Cruickshank looked towards the doorway and saw a person standing in the wide open doorway. He was carrying a rifle. He came over and pointed the rifle at 
Mr Cruickshank's head and said, ""Shut up."" Three other men then came through the front door.

5Mr Cruickshank got up - he had been lying on a mattress in the lounge room - and his girlfriend woke up and said something. The first man who had come in, the man armed with the rifle, pointed the rifle at Mr Cruickshank's girlfriend's head and pulled the trigger. The rifle was only a few inches away from her face when he did that. The trigger just clicked and no projectile was discharged. One can only imagine the terror that must have been felt by Mr Cruickshank and his girlfriend when that occurred.

6It was clearly an action designed to ensure that the occupants of the house would comply with the demands of the invaders, through creating awful feelings and apprehension.

7The men then began yelling and demanding property, money, phones and wallets. Not content with simply making verbal demands, the men - and I interpolate here to say that no one has suggested that there should be any distinction between the actions of one offender as compared to another - took some meat from a freezer, and a money tin containing coins. Others of the invaders were going throughout the house, searching for property. 

8One of the men hit Mr Cruickshank in the face with either his fist or the bottom part of the rifle. 

9Mr Cruickshank's girlfriend's brother was discovered and he too was asked for money and phones. The offenders collected computers but made further demands for cash and wallets. Mr Cruickshank told them that they had everything. He says in his statement, 

""By that time they had already taken the meat from the freezer, the money from the money tin, a few old mobile phones, the two laptops from my room and another laptop which was in the lounge room."" 

He had nothing left to give and yet the offenders were not satisfied.

10Given what he had previously seen, the firearm pointed at his girlfriend and the trigger pulled, the fact that he could not satisfy their further demands must have only added to the terror which he felt.

11Still, the invaders continued. One of the them lifted up the mattress that Mr Cruickshank and his girlfriend had been sleeping on. He lifted up the lounge chairs and checked under the fish tank. And they kept making further demands for drugs and money.

12It was then that Mr Cruickshank noticed that one of the other men - when I say ""one of the other men"" I mean one of the men not holding the rifle - was also armed. He had a knife in his left hand and a taser in his right hand. The knife appears, from the description he gave, to have been a particularly threatening looking weapon. Mr Cruickshank had the knife pointed at him. He was told to put the laptops in the laptop bag but before he did so, cleverly, the invaders wanted to make sure that they could use the laptops and that there was no password protection. In fact, so careful were the invaders, so rational was their thinking, that Mr Cruickshank was made to turn on the computer to show that it was not password protected. Still the invaders continued.

13They made a demand for the car keys because they wanted to search the car. The man with the taser then turned it on. There was a blue spark at the front and it made a loud electrical noise. Both Mr Cruickshank and his girlfriend, not surprisingly, became even more apprehensive at this turn of events. The man with the taser walked towards them, pointing the taser at them and saying, ""Do you fucking want it?"" Then they left with a parting shot. One of the men said, ""If we find out you've got more money, we'll be coming back"" and they left the house.

14I am sure that the value of the property taken from Mr Cruickshank and his family is of little importance to them when compared to the terror that they suffered but it is to be noted that the invaders took three laptop computers, about six or seven mobile phones, most of which did not work, and about $330 in cash, along with a few old ipods and USB sticks.

15It appears, as far as the children were concerned, that only the youngest, aged two or three, was actually present in the lounge room where most of the events I have described took place. The ten year old remained in a bedroom but it appears that she was aware of what was going on. The invaders cannot suggest that they were not even aware that the two year old was there because at one stage they suggested that her face be covered. This was relied on by the offenders, or at least some of them as suggesting that they retained a modicum of decency and feelings towards the young child. I find that difficult to accept. Even if such actions do show a small amount of compassion, it is swamped, it is overwhelmed by the inhumanity that they otherwise displayed early that morning.

16The offenders were arrested not long afterwards. Police stopped a motor vehicle for a random breath test. Three of the offenders were inside the vehicle at the time. Police noticed that they were trying to hide things and so they searched the offenders and the car. Incriminating items were found, including weapons, including the taser and they were all arrested and taken to the police station.

17Mr Puru, the man who was not in the car, was arrested a short time later.

18The maximum penalty for the offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal is twenty-five years imprisonment. It carries a non-parole period of seven years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in formulating the appropriate sentences in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

19The maximum penalty is reserved for offending in the worst category of offending. Of course it is always possible to imagine criminal conduct worse than any other criminal conduct, so that is not the test as to whether particular criminal activity comes within the worst category of offending. It has to be said that the behaviour of the four men that morning is approaching the worst category of offending of this type.

20Mr Cruickshank's injuries appear to have been less than are commonly occasioned through home invasions and there was limited actual violence but, as I hope to have made clear, the intense fear that must have been occasioned in the residence of the home that morning is enormous.

21The four offenders, of course, all have different backgrounds. Some are relatively old and have nothing approaching offending of this seriousness on their criminal histories. 

22Mr Tuimauluga is now thirty-nine years of age. He was born in New Zealand to Samoan parents. He came with his parents to Newcastle, they were seeking employment opportunities and an improved standard of living. He is the eldest of six children and he is the only one in his family to have a criminal history.

23His parents clearly loved him, although they would discipline him physically in a way which, I venture to suggest, would not be accepted in modern society but Mr Tuimauluga himself accepted that they engaged in that discipline because they loved him and because he was behaving badly.

24There is no suggestion that what I would describe as excessive discipline of a physical kind metered out to Mr Tuimauluga when he was a child played any part at all in his decision to commit this offence.

25Mr Tuimauluga's criminal history reveals no other offending remotely as serious as this. There is no offence of break, enter and steal. There is an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm but that cannot have been too serious because he was dealt with by a fine of $300.

26Mr Tuimauluga has done much in his past that he is entitled to be proud of. He spent seven years as a youth worker and is a matter of great shame to him that he now, in custody, runs into some of his former clients. He also has a good work history. He was working in the mining industry earning good money at the time he committed this offence.

27There is one particular dark aspect of Mr Tuimauluga's life. It concerns the death of his sister. It is suggested that Mr Tuimauluga took this particularly badly and that this was a factor in him using excessive quantities of alcohol and drugs at the time the offence was committed.

28Mr Tuimauluga says he told a psychologist who interviewed him for the purposes of these proceedings that he has no memory of what he did. In particular, he has no memory of being involved in this offence. It is for that reason, I am told, that his plea of guilty came quite late and only around the time that his trial was due to commence.

29Of course, that does not affect the circumstances of the utilitarian benefit because of the late plea is reduced. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about 10 per cent to affect the utilitarian value of his plea.

30The explanation for the late plea is also put forward as explaining why a man who says he is remorseful can still only admit what he has done at a late stage. It is suggested that it was only after Mr Tuimauluga spoke to his co-offenders, who told him that he was involved in the offence, that he accepted that he was and thus pleaded guilty.

31I accept that Mr Tuimauluga is remorseful for what he has done. He did not give evidence (and in fact no offender gave evidence) saying he was sorry but in Mr Tuimauluga's case I accept, based on the contents of the psychological report, that he is sorry for what he did and, indeed, he has difficulty understanding why he might have done such a terrible thing.

32Given Mr Tuimauluga's lack of memory, there is some degree of speculation as to the circumstances that led to him becoming involved in the offence. For example, the psychologist writes:

""I further suggest that if Mr Tuimauluga's co-accused suggested they engage in criminal behaviour, Mr Tuimauluga would have perceived backing out as a sign of weakness and suggestive that he was not a real man.""

33It is entirely speculative as to whether it was Mr Tuimauluga's co-accused who suggested they engage in criminal behaviour or Mr Tuimauluga himself. No material I have read suggests that one version should be favoured over the other.

34In contrast to Mr Tuimauluga, when I turn to Mr Zechel I know very little about him. No evidence was called on his behalf and he did not give evidence either. There was no pre-sentence report prepared in relation to him. I know only what appears in the material tendered by the prosecution.

35Mr Zechel is fourty, has a criminal history which suggests that his offending on this occasion is out of character and I know little else about him. 

36Ms Moen, who appears for the offender, said that her client expressed his remorse in circumstances where there is not the slightest bit of evidence - and I emphasise the word ""evidence"" - to justify a finding that the offender was remorseful. I do not propose to make that finding in the offender's favour.

37He pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and so the sentence that I will impose upon him is 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.

38Mr Puru faces other charges that his co-offenders do not. He pleaded guilty to an offence of break, enter and steal committed on 16 June 2011. On that occasion the offender broke into premises and stole some of the very firearms used in the later more serious offence.

39A short time before hand, on 1 June 2011, the offender had also committed another break, enter and steal offence. That is on a Form 1 attached to the break, enter and steal offence committed a couple of weeks later. On this occasion the offenders broke into a hairdressing salon. Once inside, Mr Puru and his co-offender ransacked the business, stole a large amount of money from the till and a computer. They then escaped by kicking their way through a gyprock wall.

40Mr Puru is significantly younger than Mr Zechel and Mr Tuimauluga. Despite that, he has managed to accumulate a substantial criminal history, including for acts of violence, break, enter and steal and robbery matters. 

41He has been supervised by Probation and Parole in the past with mixed results.

42He is now twenty-five. He lived early in his life with his mother and father in Cardiff. His parents separated when he was about ten, or in his early teens perhaps and at some stage in his early childhood he ran away from home and lived on the streets. His parents tried to get him back on the straight and narrow. They sent him to New Zealand to live with his father's family but that was not terribly successful. Whilst in New Zealand he got himself into trouble with the law for stealing cars and using drugs and when he came back to Australia he lived with his mother for only a short time before he left again to live on the streets.

43Although Mr Puru has some qualifications as far as work is concerned, he has had no significant employment since leaving school. This is what he told Probation and Parole:

""I was too lazy and did not want to work or be told what to do.""


44At the time of the offence he had been unemployed for about four months. He had been working at a chicken factory but got the sack because he did not turn up for work. 

45Of course, some explanation needs to be found as to why Mr Puru would commit this offence and it is not surprisingly related to drug and alcohol use. He began consuming alcohol about the age of ten and began to use drugs a little while later. He was a heavy user of drugs by his mid teens. He had accumulated debts to drug suppliers at the time of this offending and he needed to pay them off but he also wanted to get more drugs. 

46I have to say that using drugs is a very selfish activity. It also must be remembered that it is an illegal activity. It does not at all reflect well on Mr Puru that what motivated him to get involved in this most terrifying offence was simply so that he could pay off drug debts and get more drugs.

47I note that the probation officer suggests that the offender has acknowledged that his offending behaviour is related to his illicit substance abuse and anti-social associates and that if he is to have any chance of leading a lawful life he will need to address his addictions. I think that almost goes without saying.

48What I have learnt about Mr Puru, when dealing with this matter, is that he will, unless he changes his ways, continue to use drugs and that will result in a continuation of offending unless he is prepared to do something about the way he has lived his life until now. It may well be the case that Mr Puru will benefit from long term residential rehabilitation.

49The period of eligibility for parole, which must necessarily be long when a long sentence is imposed, will allow the parole authorities to decide whether it should be a condition of Mr Puru's release to parole that he complete a residential rehabilitation program. That, of course, will be a matter for them and not for me. 

50In case I have not mentioned it, I should emphasise that Mr Puru's decision to plead guilty to his offending came at an early stage and so the sentences I impose upon him will be 25 per cent less than they would otherwise have been.

51I come now to Mr Dejong, also a comparatively young man who pleaded guilty at an early stage. He was on two section 9 bonds at the time he committed the offence for which he must be sentenced. He too has a criminal history which commences in the Children's Court. There are some relatively serious matters, offences such as break, enter and steal and aggravated robbery. He too has accumulated a criminal history of rather impressive length in his relatively small number of years.

52Mr Dejong is the second of four siblings who lived with his mother and step-father in the Newcastle area before his arrest. He described a supportive relationship with all his family members. His mother, who was interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service confirmed that this was the case. Mr Dejong blamed irregular contact with his biological father for his dysfunctional upbringing.

53Mr Dejong completed Year 7 at high school and was expelled during Year 8. He has problems, of course, therefore, with literacy. He has never held employment and was receipt of a disability pension following an injury to his foot at the age of fifteen.

54He too commenced using drugs at a relatively early age. He was binging on alcohol at times. 

55He shows a bit of an insight too because he admitted to the Probation and Parole Service that his lack of pro-social activities and his choice of anti-social peers have contributed to his offending behaviour. He agreed with the police facts and expressed a need for some help in the future.

56Along with many people who appear for sentence in these courts, it was substance abuse which is likely to have been the major factor in Mr Dejong's criminal behaviour. He was a drug addict and he committed these offences to satisfy that addiction.

57Various courts have looked at the issue of whether drug use and drug addiction can be a mitigating factor. True it is that Mr Dejong's use of drugs began at an early age but many people would be concerned at any suggestion that a person who decides to continue to use drugs and to continue to commit offences to satisfy that drug addiction should receive a lower penalty simply because of that circumstance.

58Mr Dejong's drug addiction may explain what he did but a motivation consisting of a desire to continue to commit other offences (buying and using drugs) by committing this serious offence can not have a significant effect by way of reducing the sentence that I must impose upon him.

59Mr Dejong also expressed his remorse in a pre-sentence report and I make a finding in his favour in that regard.

60One other matter I should mention is that no offender should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offenders. They are all individual offenders and although no one has suggested that objectively their behaviour was any different to the objective behaviour of their co-offenders, subjectively and procedurally there are differences which have led to different sentences being imposed.

61The commencement dates of these sentences that I am about to announce have all been agreed based on the offender's pre-sentence custodies. 

62For the offender Tuimauluga, he is sentenced to a non-parole period of eight and a half years and a period of eligibility for parole of four years to date from 21 November 2011.

63Mr Zechel will be sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eight years with an eligibility period of parole of four years to date from 10 November 2012.

64Mr Puru is sentenced to imprisonment for the break, enter and steal offence to a fixed term of imprisonment of three years to date from 7 November 2011. For the aggravated break, enter and steal offence he is sentenced to imprisonment to a non-parole period of eight years with a period of eligibility for parole of four and a half years to date from 8 July 2012, making a total sentence in Mr Puru's case consisting of a nine year non-parole period and a thirteen and a half year head sentence.

65In Mr Dejong's case, I set a non-parole period of eight and a half years to date from 4 October 2011 and a period of eligibility for parole of four years.

66It will be obvious I have made a finding of special circumstances in each case.

		04 April 2013",2013-01-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760835,Larkins v R [2013] NSWDC 159,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Steven Andrew Larkins was the Chief Executive Officer of the Hunter Aboriginal Children's Services. That organisation provided high quality cultural care and support for aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, young people and their families. It appears that the appellant was effective and hard working and that many people benefited from his work. He is entitled to be proud of the things he achieved for people less fortunate than himself.

2But there is another side to Mr Larkins' activities. They concern two distinct areas: Dishonesty and child pornography. 

3The offender was charged with a number of offences and dealt with in the Local Court. Some of those are the subject of appeal to this court. Prison sentences were imposed and he appeals to this court against what he asserts is the severity of those sentences.

4Let me start with the dishonesty offences. In order to get his job, the offender forged and then used a document. There was something on his criminal history that he was concerned about and so he produced a clearance document which falsely stated that he had been screened and found suitable for a position involving unsupervised child care.

5Traditionally, the offence of forgery involving the creation of false documents and then using them is regarded as a most serious offence. The offender continued in a similar vein later on in order to keep the job he had obtained. He made a false statement in a statutory declaration, that is a Commonwealth offence for which he received a partially suspended sentence and then forged another document, purporting to be a letter from a Mr Mark Zeniol.

6These acts of dishonesty were performed by the appellant so that he could obtain and maintain his employment.

7As I began this judgment, there is no suggestion that he did not do his job well but that does not alter the fact that he obtained his position through fraud and kept it in the same way. That is a serious offence and serious misconduct, particularly in the case of a person who should have provided a good example to others.

8The other issue, as I mentioned, concerns the offender's possession of child pornographic material and that, in turn, can be divided into two areas. The first concerns three offences involving disgusting cartoons based on some characters from 'The Simpsons' cartoon show. At one stage there was some doubt as to whether such material even qualified as child pornography but a judgment of the Supreme Court held that, given the ages of Bart and Lisa Simpson, the cartoon showing them involved in sexual activity would be child pornography.

9But what distinguishes those offences from the much more serious offence I am about to get to is that in the production of the cartoons no child was harmed. That is not the case concerning the remaining offence the subject of these proceedings. It is the most serious of the offences presently before the court.

10In March 2011 the offender lost a thumb drive or USB stick. He asked someone to keep an eye out for it. It was found in April. An employee of the Hunter Aboriginal Children's Services was driving a work vehicle and took possession of the thumb drive which was sitting on the front passenger's seat.

11Inspection of the thumb drive in an effort to identify who owned it, and so who it should be returned to, revealed documents personal to the offender and a large number of videos showing child pornography. The very titles of the files indicate the nature of the videos, including references to the ages or purported ages of the children involved.

12Police were contacted and they went to the offender's premises. The thumb drive was then further examined and 40 child pornographic videos were discovered. Some of them involved penetrative sex between boys of between the ages of ten to fourteen and most of the videos involved more than one child. Thus, there are a large number of children involved in the production of these videos. That means that there are a large number of children who have been harmed in the production of material which the appellant possessed.

13It is such harm that makes offences of possessing child pornography, at least those not involving The Simpsons characters, of such seriousness. There is a demand, it appears, for videos of this kind and there are people in this world who are prepared to satisfy that demand by getting children to engage in sexual acts. By participating as he has the appellant has encouraged the production of material of this kind and thus encouraged further harm to other children in the future.

14The seriousness of child pornography offences extends to other areas as well. Normalising the idea that children should be involved in sexual activity is harmful in itself. It is for these reasons that possession of child pornography is treated as seriously as it is.

15The offender is entitled, as I mentioned, to rely on the good work that he has done and his otherwise good character. He will do his time in custody harder than others and he has suffered significantly already through the loss of his employment and the shame that he is now experiencing. But it is a fundamental rule of sentencing that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of what an offender did.

16The offender possessed a significant number of videos showing children performing sexual activity in circumstances where he must have known that each of those children was harmed in the production of that material. For that reason, a custodial sentence is required.

17Mr Booth submitted that if there was a sentence of imprisonment necessary it should be suspended. I do not agree. It cannot be ignored that the effect of a suspended sentence is often no punishment by the justice system at all. A person who receives a suspended sentence of imprisonment and who does not breach the bond receives little punishment.

18Of course, suspended sentences are appropriate in some cases but it must be remembered that that lack of punishment means that suspended sentences have little deterrent effect and general deterrence must be a prime component of any sentence imposed for offences of this kind.

19The magistrate imposed identical sentences for all offences of possessing child pornography. To put matters bluntly, the appellant received the same sentence for possessing on his IPhone cartoons showing Bart and Lisa having sex as he did for possessing on that thumb drive videos showing a number of real children having sex. In my view, the sentences for the first three offences of possessing child pornography, those relating to The Simpsons characters, were excessive. I will return to the appropriate order in a little while.

20As far as the fraud offences are concerned, I am satisfied that the sentences for those matters were appropriate. The effective punishment for all of those put together is imprisonment for ten months with the child pornography sentences commencing ten months after the commencement of the fraud offences.

21It is, as I said earlier, a serious matter, to forge a document and then use it to gain a financial advantage, even where the job which is obtained through the fraudulent conduct is done well. I am satisfied that the sentences imposed by the magistrate for the dishonesty offences were appropriate.

22I am satisfied also that the head sentence for the offence involving a thumb drive was appropriate, if not a bit lenient but what may well have been overlooked as these sentences were accumulated is the effect of the ratio for non-parole period to head sentence. As matters stand, the overall sentence of twenty-two months with a non-parole period of nineteen months results in a ratio of non-parole period to head sentence of 86 per cent.

23I can see no good reason why the ratio should not be more in the appellant's favour and indeed I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances in his favour. This will be the offender's first time imprisonment and he has commenced treatment in an effort to rehabilitate his attitude towards child pornography. Allowing an extended period of supervision on parole will promote his rehabilitation, which will make it less likely that he will commit offences in the future and which, in turn, makes it less likely that other people will be harmed.

24So, the finding of special circumstances is not made as a favour to the offender but as a means of best promoting the protection of the community.

25For those reasons, I make the following orders:

26For the offences of possessing child pornography relating to The Simpsons material, the sentences of imprisonment are quashed and instead the offender is placed on a bond to be of good behaviour under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of two years. The conditions of that bond are that he is to be of good behaviour and is to appear before this court if called upon to do so at any time and he is to advise the registrar of this court of any change of residential address.

27For the two offences of making a false document to obtain a financial advantage, the offence of using a false document to obtain a financial advantage and the offence of intentionally making a false statement, a statutory declaration, the sentences of imprisonment are confirmed.

28Those sentences will commence on today, 31 January 2013.

29For the offence of possessing child pornography relating to the thumb drive, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five months with a head sentence of twelve months to commence on 30 November 2013.

		28 August 2013",2013-01-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760836,R v Orrock [2013] NSWDC 160,"SENTENCE Judgment

1HER HONOUR: This is the judgment on sentence in the matter of Scott Allen Orrock. The offender is before me for sentence following his plea of guilty on 29 January 2013 to count 1 in an indictment dated that date, that on 20 April 2013 at Newtown he intentionally destroyed property by fire, that property being a police truck marked Newtown 16. That is an offence contrary to s195 (1)(b) of the Crimes Act and as such carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 

2I note, and in due course, will take into account the fact that this is a Table 1 offence under the Criminal Procedure Act capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum penalty available would have been 2 years imprisonment. There was presumably an election made by the prosecution to have the matter dealt with on indictment. The fact that it might have been dealt with however in the Local Court is a matter I am obliged to take into account, although I do note that neither party has actually referred to that in their submissions.

3Following that election he was committed for trial to this court on this count, together with a charge of intimidating a named police officer in the execution of her duty. The trial of those matters started before me with a jury on Wednesday 16 January 2013. At the end of the Crown case I directed the jury to acquit the accused in relation to the intimidation charge. The reasons for that are to be found in a separate judgment. In summary that course was taken because, whilst there was clear evidence of the accused behaving in a manner which the jury would have been entitled to accept as intimidation, there was no evidence from the named officer nor anyone else in the Crown case that the officer in fact was intimidated by his actions. That is, no evidence that she felt personally frightened, scared, or under personal threat of violence. That is an essential part of the charge and in the absence of that evidence; I was obliged to direct an acquittal of the accused.

4Following that, the trial proceeded on the matter now before me for sentence, with the accused giving evidence in chief on Tuesday 22 January and being about halfway through cross-examination overnight. On Wednesday morning, 23 January, the Crown advised that they had come into possession of images from the closed-circuit television hard drive seized by police from the accused's tattoo parlour premises on 21 April, the day after the offence. For reasons that were explored in a further judgment of 23 April 2013, the investigating authorities had neither completed an analysis of that hard drive nor sought to adjourn or postpone the trial until that was completed and it would appear that the analysis was only completed after the trial had started and after the accused had finished his evidence in chief and was halfway through cross-examination.

5In the circumstances, I granted the accused's application to vacate the trial and discharged the jury on the basis of fairness. The Crown not only agreed with that course but submitted that a costs order would be appropriate. I ultimately made an order under the Suitors Fund Act for the accused to have his costs of the aborted trial in the circumstances. The trial was then re-listed to commence before me on Tuesday this week, 29 January. The accused was re-arraigned and pleaded guilty to count 1 as I have already stated. At the earlier trial the accused foreshadowed and then gave evidence admitting having set fire to the police truck but claimed that he did so out of necessity. Thus he was attempting to rely on a defence of necessity as a complete defence to both substantive charges. 

6It was never necessary to explore the logic of that position in relation to the intimidation charge because he was acquitted by direction before the evidence was complete. There had been no final determination by the time the trial was vacated about whether or not that defence would be left to the jury on the damage by fire charge. The Crown had foreshadowed an argument that it should not, but the final decision awaited the end of the accused's evidence. Again that final determination was never necessary because the trial was vacated and the accused has now pleaded guilty.

7I have before me on sentence all of the evidence called at trial, together with the fact of the plea and some additional statements tendered by the Crown on sentence, including the fingerprint record. I accept from the combination of evidence that the accused now admits the elements of the offence but relies for an assessment of the objective circumstances of the offence on what is, in essence, non-exculpatory necessity. He relies on that, as I understand it, to mitigate the factual or objective seriousness of his offending behaviour. It seems to me that this is in a similar vein to circumstances in which an offender might rely on non-exculpatory duress to mitigate his offending behaviour in the way envisaged by s 21A (3)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which is applied, followed and referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal favourably in R v Tiknius [2011] NSWCCA at 215 in relation to Commonwealth offences. 

8Whilst there is no reference in the State statute to necessity as a mitigating factor on sentence, it seems to me that it is comparable to the concept of duress and by logical extension, that if evidence amounting to non-exculpatory necessity is accepted, then that is a factor to be taken into account as a mitigating factor by a sentencing judge because, if accepted, it impacts on an assessment of objective criminality and the moral culpability of the offender. This latter issue is in essence the only real issue for determination on this sentence and is a matter on which I must make a finding. 

9As to the other facts, I accept without any dispute, from the evidence before me on trial that on 20 April 2012 at about 3.11am, the offender took a baseball bat from under the counter of his tattoo parlour in King Street, Newtown and smashed the passenger window of an unattended marked police truck parked outside the premises immediately next door to that business. He poured some isopropyl into the window, which is an alcohol-based substance that he used in his tattoo business, and then set fire to the truck, which caught alight almost immediately. He then went back inside the tattoo parlour and shortly afterwards left in a taxi from the rear of the premises. The fire was extinguished by the Fire Brigade, which arrived very shortly afterwards, but the truck was extensively damaged by fire. The front of the outside awning of the adjoining café was also damaged by the fire in the vehicle and suffered damage. 

10The police truck had already had much of its usual contents removed but the damage to the body and interior of the truck was nonetheless extensive. It was effectively destroyed by the fire. I accept from the evidence before me on sentence, that the total cost occasioned by the damage to the truck was $58,138.71. From other evidence on sentence I accept that the damage to the front awning section of the adjoining café was $2,530, of which an amount was paid by the insurer and the balance by the owner. There are claims for compensation in these amounts which I will address at the end of this sentence. 

11None of these facts is in dispute. Also not in dispute is the fact that police then kept the vehicle under guard and established a crime scene in the area until they searched the premises the following morning. 

12Notwithstanding that, the offender came back to the premises about 8am on 21 April and disabled the closed-circuit television system which had been monitoring his tattoo parlour premises. However he did not remove the hard drive. When police searched the premises on the morning of 21 April, they recovered various items including the hard drive of the closed-circuit television system. For reasons that it seems to me cannot be understood, however, they did not conduct an analysis of that hard drive until some time in early 2013 after this trial had started, without advising the Crown Prosecutor that such analysis was imminent and in fact underway and without therefore advising the court. It would appear on its face to have been potentially of great value in prosecuting the case against the accused, especially as until 16 January there had been no admission by the accused of having in fact caused the damage to the vehicle. It is unfortunate that such a basic investigatory step was not undertaken much earlier so that a great deal of public money and court time might have been saved.

13On Saturday 21 April by arrangement, the offender attended the police station and was arrested and charged with this offence. He exercised his right to silence. None of that is in dispute. What is in dispute, however, is the accused's motive for committing the offence. Much of the background of the accused's evidence in relation to that motive, however, is also not in dispute. I accept from the evidence at trial, that the accused had been a member of the Nomads Motorcycle Club since he was twenty-one, rising to the rank of National President in Australia for the five years leading up to December 2009. It is a Club which I accept on the evidence is properly referred to as an outlaw motorcycle club, in that it has an acknowledged component of it which engages in criminal activity. The accused himself acknowledged that in his evidence. He left that Club in December 2009. That is also confirmed by evidence called in the Crown case at trial from an expert in these matters, Detective Sergeant Groenewegen. 

14I accept the evidence of the accused at trial that he did so at the time for family reasons. He had earlier been awarded custody of his twin daughters together with a former partner, not the mother of those children. He had subsequently married another woman and they were together caring for those daughters who continued to have contact with their former stepmother. I accept that he left the Nomads in December 2009 because he wanted to lead a more family oriented life following his marriage. At the time he was targeted, and I accept more probably than not, because he had left the Club. This took the form of someone setting fire to his personal vehicle at the rear of the tattoo parlour in December 2009. On the evidence I accept that not long after he left the Nomads in December 2009, he had some involvement with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, a Club also properly described as an outlaw motorcycle club. He became what is known as a prospect of that Club, something like a probationary member. I accept this did not last for long and he relinquished that position in early 2010. Between then and late 2011, on the evidence, he was not either a full member or prospect member of any motorcycle club but he did not ever sever ties with members of such clubs. He continued to have association with them and I accept he had not completely given up the codes and general mindset of such organisations. 

15In early 2012 he again contemplated becoming a member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club to the extent that by March 2012 he had again become a prospect member of that club. I accept from other evidence that by the time he committed this offence, albeit perhaps only shortly beforehand, he had decided not to proceed to full membership. Thus, at the time of this offence on the evidence before me, he was neither a full member nor a prospect member of any outlaw motorcycle club. Again, however, he still associated with such people, including it would appear, only about thirty minutes before committing this offence. There is no evidence, however, on which I could make any finding that this meeting played a role in his committing the offence. 

16The Crown called evidence from two officers involving specific knowledge both of outlaw motorcycle gangs or clubs and also of the events which were occurring in Sydney, involving those gangs, at the time of this offence. I accept from that evidence that in early 2012 there were a number of drive-by shootings at houses and tattoo parlours in Sydney connected with outlaw motorcycle gangs. I accept that by the time this offence was committed, police had formed the view that there existed what was referred to as a turf war between the Nomads and the Hells Angels motorcycle gangs. That belief of the police was in fact broadcast to the media by a senior police officer at around the time this offence was committed. I also accept from this evidence called in the Crown case, that leaving such groups is regarded poorly by those who remain members but even worse is to leave one group to join another which is what this offender was contemplating at the time of this offence. I accept the offender's evidence that this is regarded within such circles as the behaviour of a turncoat and viewed extremely unfavourably. 

17Shortly before this offence there were media reports that two houses and some tattoo parlours in western Sydney had been the subject of drive-by shootings. The offender, I accept, knew the people who either lived in those premises or owned them and believed that the events were connected with the activities of what he describes as bikies. This occurred at the same time as police were broadcasting their beliefs that there was a turf war in Sydney between the two outlaw motorcycle gangs with which the offender was connected. These events received extensive media publicity at the time in Sydney. I accept from all of the evidence before me at trial that these sorts of events, that is drive-by shootings and the like, were not unusual for these sorts of bikie gangs. In fact the offender had himself been the victim of that or similar events, at least three times. He was shot himself in 2006 and subsequently charged with concealing a crime because he refused to name his attacker. His tattoo parlour was the subject of a drive-by shooting in April 2007 and as I have already said, his car was burnt at the rear of those premises in December 2009. All of those, I accept, were connected with his involvement in or association with, outlaw motorcycle gangs. I accept that by early 2012 this sort of violence, which was not unusual, had changed a little in that it was now involving wider targets including the families of group members and that this was known to both police and to this offender. 

18Around 17 April 2012 police obtained some intelligence that the offender's tattoo shop was going to be targeted as part of this spate of escalating violence. The police have subsequently concluded that that intelligence was not accurate but believed it to be the case at the time.

19A decision was made to place a marked police truck in the vicinity of, or outside those premises, in an effort to deter any such attack, to protect the offender and also to protect adjacent business owners and residents, and any members of the public who might have been caught in any such attack. That decision was not initially conveyed to the offender but Newtown 16 was parked in the vicinity overnight on 17 April 2012. Police by that stage had taken steps to remove from that vehicle any items that might have been the subject of particular dangers such as firearms, ammunition and also the police radio.

20The adjoining café owner noticed the truck, as did the offender, but it was not a matter of great moment at the time. The truck was there again the following night in the general vicinity and the offender and others, I accept, started to notice it a little more. I accept that the police moved it from place to place, always however either outside, opposite or adjacent to the offender's tattoo parlour. I accept that by the second night, given the publicity surrounding other attacks on tattoo parlours in Sydney at the time, it would have been clear to most people that the truck was there connected in some way with the offender's tattoo parlour. 

21The offender, I accept, saw one of the officers moving the truck at one stage and spoke to him. That officer told him that it had been placed there to deter an attack on his tattoo parlour. He said he did not feel the need for that personal protection. The truck was placed there again on the evening of 19 April. The accused gave evidence that by that stage he was beginning to have some concern about it and the impact it might have on him. His evidence was that his staff had been receiving comments by passers-by asking about the presence of the truck. Some of those comments queried whether he was either working with the police or getting police protection and that he was getting similar queries from local business people and that he had started to receive some telephone calls along the same lines. 

22He said that in his mind these events came to a head overnight on 19 and 20 April. He claimed that by that stage he had received a few threats by phone, although he said he was not sure that they were serious or just pranks or people who did not genuinely mean the threats. His evidence was that on the evening of 19 April, however, sometime around about seven, which I infer was around about the time that the truck was parked in the vicinity, he saw four or five people sitting in the café opposite his tattoo parlour who he believed were watching him and his premises. He said he did not know them and thought they looked suspicious. He said he believed that two of them followed him down King Street about 8 o'clock that night because he saw them sitting in a café where he was having dinner, again watching him. He said he thought that they had followed him back to the tattoo parlour because he saw them again in the café opposite.

23In his evidence he said he shut the business early that night and sent the staff home because he had started to become concerned that the tattoo parlour might in fact be the target of a drive-by shooting and increasingly became concerned that he was to become the target of a shooting. He said that by that stage he formed the view that the presence of the marked police truck outside his tattoo parlour had increased his risk of attack because he thought it sent a message that he was somehow connected with the police and was obtaining protection from them.

24He claimed, and I accept this to be the case, that cooperation with police is not regarded highly within outdoor motorcycle gangs or those who associate with them. That it is not a desirable feature, but it is a reality. Even more so, I accept that if members of such an organisation were to form the view that their members or associates were cooperating with police, or even had become police informants into the activities of the gangs, that that would put that individual at great risk. Again I say that this is not behaviour or views which ought be condoned, but I accept that it is a reality, and a matter which was well known to the offender at the time.

25So by the evening of the 19 April I accept he had formed the view that the truck was putting him at risk to the extent that later in the evening he went to the hotel and asked some tow truck drivers who he knew if they would move the truck away from the café next to his tattoo parlour. Not surprisingly they declined, given that it was a marked police truck parked lawfully in King Street, Newtown. I accept he went back to the tattoo parlour and then started to think about his situation. He went home at one stage and took his daughters somewhere else. He started to become more anxious I accept and more focused on the police truck.

26He gave evidence that the unknown people came back to the café opposite and were watching him. He said that by 3am or shortly beforehand he had formed the view that he was at imminent risk of being shot at and in his own mind the focus of that risk was the presence of the police truck. He claimed to have considered other options. He also gave evidence, which I accept was logical, that the option of approaching the police was to his mind a last resort. Again it is not a view, which ought to be condoned, but I accept it was a view that he held. 

27So at about 3am, and this much is not in dispute, he walked the short distance of about 200 metres between his tattoo parlour and Newtown Police Station and spoke to the officer on the desk. I accept that by that stage he was a little agitated and more so than his normal self, but not significantly so. He asked to see the supervising officer, and that occurred. He made demands for police to move the police truck. Whether or not he used a swear word immediately when speaking to that officer or did so later in conversation with her is in dispute, but it seems to me it does not make any real difference. I accept from the evidence given by the first officer to whom he spoke that he did not initially swear when he saw her, but that he became increasingly agitated as he spoke to the supervising officer. That officer and all of the officers at Newtown Police knew him and agreed that his behaviour was different than his normal demeanour and that he became increasingly agitated and demanding. What he said to the officer on more than one occasion was,

""Move that fucking car right now"". 

28She declined and made it clear from the outset that this was not going to happen. She also made it clear that it was a decision from those higher up that the truck was placed there and that whilst it might be moved around slightly it would be staying in the area. The police had every right to take that course at the time.

29She told him he could take it up with the duty officer in the morning if he wished. His voice became louder, he became more agitated and pointed a finger at her and continued to demand that the truck be moved. Ultimately he said, 

""You fucking move it right away or I will burn it down"". 

30The officer told him that he should not make such a threat. He became more agitated as the officer continued to inform him that the truck would not be moved and that he could take it up with the duty manager later. At one stage the accused said to her, and this is not in dispute,

""You don't know what you're fucking doing. Everybody is going to think I'm working for the police."" 

31She replied, 

""Anyone who reads the newspapers will know why the car is parked there."" 

32He then said, 

""I don't fucking care. Do you know what you're doing, you are making me a target, you are making my family a target."" 

33All of this interaction was captured by a closed-circuit television, that is, the visual images. 

34The conversation did not last for a very long time. At one stage he moved towards the door and then came back and continued to speak to the supervising officer. I accept that at this stage he said, after having made another demand for the truck to be moved, 

""I will give you ten minutes to move the car or I'm going to burn it to the ground."" 

35I accept that the officer replied, 

""If you do that there will be hell to pay."" His reply to that was, ""I don't give a fuck. You've got ten minutes to move it or it's going to burn."" 

36He also said words to the effect that they could come around in fifteen minutes to arrest him. He left the police station shortly after 3am following these conversations and returned to the tattoo parlour, went in, took the baseball bat from under the counter, got the Isopropyl and then behaved in the way that I have already outlined, committing the offence as charged.

37The Crown submits that I would not accept from this evidence the accused's asserted motive for committing the offence. The Crown argues that the offender is a person who should not be accepted as a witness of truth and that his commission of the offence should be viewed simply as his performing a deliberate intentional and planned act without reason otherwise on the evidence. It seems to me that this submission ignores the surrounding circumstances, much of which in fact comes from the Crown's own case at trial. 

38There can be no doubt that the accused said the words he did at the police station and behaved in the way he did. There can be no dispute that he became increasingly agitated as he was left with the police, perfectly appropriately, refusing to agree to his demand to move the car. There can be no dispute about the general circumstances surrounding the offence, namely, the increasing violence on the streets involving outlaw motorcycle gangs, his close connection with such groups in the past and his ongoing association with members of that group. There can be no dispute about the fact that even the police at the time thought his premises were a likely target. There can be no dispute on the facts that the police truck was there attracting some attention. All of that comes from the Crown's own case at trial. If his reason for committing this offence was simply because he wanted to rid himself of some nuisance or obstacle to his business, or simply because he wanted to have a go at the police, it is unlikely in the extreme, it seems to me, that he would have gone to the local police station where he was known, said what he did, made the threats he did and then immediately go back and within minutes actually carry out the threat.

39The reason he gave for holding the belief he did, namely, that the presence of the truck was making him and his family a target, needs to be viewed from his own background and in the circumstances that were then occurring in Sydney. I accept on the balance of probabilities from his evidence that he at the very least believed he was being watched and believed that there was a high level of threat to him personally and also to his family at the time. He went to the police as a last resort. The demand he made of them was completely inappropriate and unreasonable and the police at the time had good reason to do what they did with the truck. There is no suggestion, and can be none, that they themselves expected that the presence of the truck would increase his risk of attack. But viewed through the offender's eyes I accept on balance that this was his belief. I accept that there were other avenues available to him and that his demands to move the truck were unreasonable. No doubt these sorts of considerations form part of the reason why he ultimately pleaded guilty and did not press these facts as constituting a defence of necessity. 

40As to the Crown's proposition, I accept the offence was deliberate and intentional. The accused himself has agreed to that by pleading guilty. I do not accept, however that it is open to characterise the offending as being planned. The accused gave evidence, which I accept, that when he went to the police station it was not then his intention to burn the police truck. He just wanted it moved. The decision to do so I accept was formed as he was talking to the officer and he acted on that decision within minutes after returning to the tattoo parlour. What he used to do so were items immediately on hand in the tattoo parlour and did not involve great planning. 

41What is more, he did not even think about the fact that his actions were being recorded by his own closed circuit television equipment. Thus, there was vision of him taking the baseball bat and the Isopropyl out to the truck. Even though he thought about coming back the next day to disable the closed circuit television, he did not think about removing the hard-drive which would have extinguished the evidence altogether. All of this taken together gives this offending the hallmarks of almost spontaneous behaviour, brought about in a state of heightened anxiety, not planned offending in the way that is understood to amount to an aggravating feature. It is also consistent with the offender's assertion about his reason for committing this offence.

42It would not be open, it seems to me, to reject the offender's evidence as to his motive given all of the other surrounding evidence which was in fact called in the Crown's case which supports that proposition. On balance therefore I accept his evidence about motive. I accept that by the time he went to the police station around 3am he had in his own mind formed a view that the police truck was making him and his family a greater target for drive-by shooting or direct shooting of him because it sent a message that in some way he was cooperating with the police. He behaved quite unreasonably in demanding that it be removed and then, of course, criminally in taking the action he did to burn it.

43On these facts it is a serious offence because it involved the burning of a police vehicle. The damage caused to it and the surrounding shop was extensive. The value is significant, albeit not huge. The fact that it was a police truck that he burnt it seems to me increases the objective seriousness and calls for real general and specific deterrence. There is an element of the offender's taking the law into his own hands, something which of course the authorities were trying to deter amongst outlaw motorcycle gangs. There is no room for any view within any section of the community that any individual is entitled to take the law into his or her own hands, and where people do so and commit a criminal offence, then the appropriate sentence should be one which deters this behaviour both at large and for the individual.

44That having been said, however, there are aspects of this offence which mitigate the objective seriousness and reduce the offender's moral culpability. It was not planned. Whilst the whole event is caught up in the disputes or activities then occurring involving outlaw motorcycle gangs in Sydney, this particular offence on the evidence was not committed as part of an organised criminal activity. More significantly, however, it was committed in circumstances where the offender, wrong and unreasonably, but nonetheless I accept in fact, believed that he needed to remove the truck to reduce what he thought was an imminent risk to him and some risk to his family at the time. He chose an extreme course by burning the truck and it was a course which paid no regard for public safety at the time but, I accept on balance, he did so because of this belief he had. That finding necessarily reduces the objective seriousness of this particular offending behaviour.

45As I have said the offender pleaded guilty to this offence when the re-trial was about to commence on Tuesday this week. That is thus not an early plea of guilty. There is, however, utilitarian value in that plea. I reject the Crown's specific submission that there is no utilitarian value represented by that plea. The fact is that the need for a re-trial was avoided by this plea. Much if not most of the evidence in the earlier trial went to the first count in the indictment on which he was acquitted by direction because of a gap in the Crown's evidence. The only reason there needed to be a re-trial at all was because the police had not analysed the hard-drive quickly enough, although apparently they had managed to analyse other electronic equipment seized from the offender. 

46This plea, it seems to me, would have been entered even earlier had that evidence been made available earlier. In fact, the earlier trial should not have commenced in the absence of that evidence but, as I have already said, unfortunately neither the Crown nor the Court was informed that the analysis was imminent. The trial should have been delayed until it had been undertaken and possibly Court time could have been saved. There is a utilitarian value, at the very least, in the avoiding of a second trial by this plea of guilty. Because of its timing, however, it is not at the top of the range. What is more, the accused's position of relying on a defence of necessity and making it unnecessary, in large part, for the Crown to call much of its circumstantial case to prove that he committed the offence, was only made known on the first day of the first trial. 

47It is also the case that the Court was only advised of the plea when the matter came on for re-trial on Tuesday this week. But I do not in the circumstances accept that this reduces to nil the actual utilitarian value of the plea in actually avoiding the trial. I accept that the accused's legal representatives advised the Crown twice last week of the possibility that the accused would plead guilty but would not able to confirm it until Tuesday, the first day of the trial, for practical reasons in large part because the accused is in custody, bail refused, and there was a long weekend intervening. Almost any plea of guilty reflects in some utilitarian value. This one is no different. The re-trial would have lasted about five days. That has been avoided and it has been unnecessary for all of the officers and others to come back to court to give their evidence again.

48In accordance with the dicta of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson and Houlton there should be a discount, albeit towards the bottom of the range around about ten per cent or a little more. 

49The plea of guilty is some evidence of contrition and remorse, but there is little other evidence in that category. The Crown has argued on sentence that there is no evidence of contrition and remorse. I do not accept that argument. When giving evidence at trial the accused did express some degree of remorse for having committed the offence. 

50In answer to cross-examination by the Crown he was exploring his thought processes at the time he set fire to the truck and, in particular, whether he had given any thought to the risk that his actions posed to surrounding businesses and people, he said this at p 296:

""Not at the time. At the time I was saving my own life and that's how I felt, that is where my mind was.""

51He went on to say this in answer to a further question in cross-examination:

""I wasn't thinking. The last thing I wanted to do was torch that car. I wanted to get it moved and I lit it and I am sorry I lit it.""

52So there is some, albeit scant, evidence of remorse in addition to his plea of guilty.

53He also gave evidence, which, I accept, that not long after having committed the offence he went home and later before attending the police station told his children that he was probably going to prison, thereby a recognition of his own offending behaviour. Of course this happened around the same time as he disconnected the closed-circuit television in an attempt to distance himself from the event which, itself, would have always been a futile effort given he did not remove the hard-drive but, also significantly, that he had been at the police station making threats to do the very thing he did just minutes before it happened. Nonetheless there is some evidence of contrition and remorse in the way that I have just outlined. 

54I now turn to the subjective circumstances. Some of that background I have addressed in the factual findings. The offender is now forty-eight. He is married. He has several children, but significantly and perhaps relevantly they include twin girls who are now teenagers. As I have said he has the custody of those children as a result of the court orders and was providing care for them with his wife at the time he committed this offence. I accept that his wife and children and former partner and others remain available to support him and in due course he will return to the community to live with his wife and his children. He has had a number of people present in court supporting, who, so far as I can tell, appear to be members of his family.

55As I have said, he is now nearly forty-eight. He has a criminal record, a matter he acknowledged to the jury in his evidence at the first trial. It is a relatively limited criminal history in the circumstances. It commences with an entry in the Children's Court, but for the first two pages, apart from this one juvenile matter, is comprised almost entirely of motor vehicle or licence offences dealt with by way of a fine. He also has a minor drug offence in 1993. There are no offences of violence on his adult record, although there are three convictions for possessing or using an unlicensed or prohibited firearm. There is no record of offending between 1991 and 1996. There then follows some more minor drug offences and traffic offences, all dealt with in the Local Court by way of fines or bonds up to 2004.

56In 2006 he committed three offences, including the most serious one of concealing a serious indictable offence and also possessing or using a prohibited weapon and possessing a prescribed restricted substance. The most serious of those occurred in about August 2006 and I accept in circumstances where he had himself been shot, more probably than not as a result of his involvement at that stage as national president of the Nomads motorcycle club, and refused to disclose the identity of his attacker. For that he was sentenced in the Local Court to eighteen months imprisonment, but on appeal to this Court in November 2008 that was converted to two years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention as to twelve months non-parole.

57He has not come to the attention of authorities for any offending behaviour since then and there is no record of his having been charged with any criminal offence since these offences which occurred in August 2006 until he committed this offence in April 2012. That is in circumstances where he was for some of that period still a member of the Nomads, known to the police as such, and for all of that period operating a tattoo parlour close to Newtown Police Station with all the notoriety and notice that operating such a business attracts. 

58In the circumstances it seems to me that this is not a significant criminal record. Further, the term of imprisonment he has been serving bail refused for this matter is, in fact, the first full time term of imprisonment he has ever been required to serve. Of course, he is not a stranger to prison, having spent some time in prison from time to time bail refused before ultimate sentencing for other matters. He has been in custody bail refused for this matter in two separate blocks. He was refused bail on his arrest on 21 April 2012 and granted bail by the Local Court on 27 April, thus spending seven days in custody for this offence. The DPP appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, which on 8 May revoked his bail and he has remained in custody bail refused ever since, that is eight months and twenty-four days to today. Therefore, he has been in custody bail refused in two blocks for a total of nine months before sentence. That time I accept has been on remand awaiting trial as an unclassified prisoner. I will backdate his sentence to 30 April 2012 to reflect those nine months in custody bail refused.

59I now turn to assess his prospects of rehabilitation, that is, how likely it is that he will commit criminal offences again of this type or any other type. The Crown has argued that there is no evidence from which I could make any finding that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I reject that submission. There is evidence that he has a relatively limited criminal record. Evidence that he has never committed anything that ultimately gave rise to full-time imprisonment. No evidence that the periodic detention sentence that he was ordered to serve was served in any way that brought him to the notice of authorities. Nothing that, except for one appeal, was ever serious enough to be dealt with in the District Court before and nothing in the past as serious as this offence. This offence was a one-off set of circumstances and he is unlikely, on my finding, to behave in that way ever again. On the record he has not committed any criminal offence since 2006 and even that was an offence of concealing an offence where he himself was the one who had been shot. He has not committed any offences since going into custody on this occasion, according to his custodial record. He is now almost forty-eight and has ultimately pleaded guilty and expressed some remorse. All of that is evidence from which his prospects of rehabilitation can be assessed. 

60It is also the case, I accept on the evidence, that he will probably always have an ongoing association, at the very least, with people in motorcycle clubs, even though it is referred to as outlaw motorcycle gangs. I infer he will continue to operate a tattoo parlour with all of the activities that often surround such businesses. That evidence too can be taken into account in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation. 

61On balance, however, I accept that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. That he will serve his prison term, get released on parole, serve his parole without incident and probably will not be charged with any further offences in the foreseeable future. That, of course, can only ever be a prediction based on the evidence which I have outlined.

62He will also have his family available to him, which assists his prospects of rehabilitation. It does not seem to me that he will require any ongoing supervision from Probation and Parole when he is released to parole to assist with those prospects of rehabilitation. But in any event, as I understand it, he will go back into the Newtown community and continue to operate his tattoo parlour there, very close to the Newtown Police Station, which of itself provides a significant degree of ongoing scrutiny.

63So I take all of that into account to determine the appropriate sentence, together with paying regard to the maximum penalty of ten years, and as I have said, bearing in mind the fact it is a table 1 offence, this is an offence that was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum penalty would have been only two years.

64I have also had access to the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission for offences dealt with in the District Court under this section. The highest sentence on those statistics ever imposed was six years overall, but that was in circumstances where the matter had gone to trial with a plea of not guilty. On those statistics only sixty-nine per cent of those sentenced in this Court for this offence received terms of full-time imprisonment after entering pleas of guilty, but I accept that given the objective circumstances surrounding this offence full-time imprisonment is the only available sentence.

65In the circumstances of the offence that I have found and taking into account the circumstances of the offender himself and the fact of the plea of guilty, I have concluded that an overall term of imprisonment of three years is appropriate. 

66I accept, again, contrary to the Crown's submissions, that there are some special circumstances, which would reduce the appropriate non-parole below the statutory ratio. The first is that this is his first full-time period of imprisonment. The second is that a significant portion of his non-parole period has been served in custody on remand as an unclassified prisoner, and for that a matter in two blocks after a release to the community for ten days.

67I further take into account his age and the fact that he has custody of his two daughters and needs to return to them as soon as possible, and has generally good prospects of rehabilitation. For that reason I am setting a non-parole period of eighteen months, backdated to 30 April 2012. In doing so I thus reject the submission made on his behalf that time served would be sufficient. But, further, I do not accept the Crown's submission that there are no grounds on which I would find special circumstances to reduce the non-parole period below the statutory ratio.

68In the circumstances of this matter, as I have found them, taking into account also the circumstances of the offender, it seems to me that a period of imprisonment of eighteen months non-parole with eighteen months thereafter on parole is appropriate. 

69As I said earlier, there is a claim for compensation both made by the Police Service and by either the café owner or his insurer for the damage suffered to the premises and to the police truck. It has been argued on the offender's behalf that I would not make the order for compensation to the Police Service. As I understand the argument that is in large part because of the costs that he has incurred in the trial which was vacated because of the late analysis of the CCTV hard drive. In those proceedings I made an order under the Suitors Fund Act for a certificate of payment of the offender's costs of that vacated trial. Hopefully, those responsible for making such orders in the Attorney General's Department will act on that order sooner rather than later. I have already signed the certificate and it is available for action immediately. I am conscious of the maximum available under such a certificate is $10,000. and also accept the submission that the accused has outlaid significantly more than that for the conduct of the trial that was vacated last week.

70The grounds are made out under the relevant legislation for a compensation order, both to the Police Service and in relation to the damage to the café. There is not argument with the latter. There is discretion, however, whether or not to order it. The grounds on which I am sought to exercise my discretion is that the offender will always be significantly out-of-pocket even after any Suitors Fund order is made for the trial that was vacated. It seems to me that that is not an appropriate basis on which to exercise a discretion not to order the compensation. The Police Service is out-of-pocket for the cost of the damage to the police truck purely and simply because the offender burnt it down. The quantum is probably proved. I will be making the order as sought. There is no objection on the offender's behalf to the orders for compensation made by or on behalf of the café owner. I will also make that order.

71In those circumstances then I make the following formal orders. The offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a non-parole period of eighteen months imprisonment commencing on 30 April 2012 expiring on 29 October 2013 with parole thereafter of eighteen months, commencing on 30 October 2013 and expiring on 29 April 2015, giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of three years commencing 30 April 2012, expiring 29 April 2015. I direct that he be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

72I make orders for compensation as follows. The sum of $58,138.71 to the New South Wales Police Force. The sum of $2,300 to GIO Insurance AND the sum of $230 to RY Trading Pty Limited.

2760839,R v Skuthorpe [2013] NSWDC 50,"SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR: Mr Skuthorpe's behaviour leading up to the commission of a most serious sexual offence does him no credit at all. He was given a suspended sentence for an office of stalking or intimidating. He breached that bond by the commission of an offence of driving whilst disqualified. He was called up and full-time imprisonment was imposed. He appealed that decision to this court and an intensive corrections order was substituted, which he again breached once more by an offence of driving whilst disqualified. He went to gaol for various offences and was released to parole on 18 December 2011. Only two weeks later he took advantage of a vulnerable 14 year old girl, having sex with her whilst another man did the same.
2He pleaded guilty, on the day his trial was due to commence, to an offence of having sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, those circumstances relating to her age, (she was only 14 years of age) and the fact that the offender was in company at the time. That is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
3I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in determining the appropriate sentence to impose on Mr Skuthorpe. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.
4The complainant in this matter was, when she first encountered the offender, heavily intoxicated. She was having difficulty standing and difficulty moving, when she was approached by the offender and two others, in the vicinity of the Newcastle Railway station. The offender engaged her in conversation. She did not know him and had never seen him or his companion previously. The offender tried to talk to her and tried to kiss her. He took her into the park at the rear of the Customs House Hotel, where there was a park bench. He continued to try and kiss the complainant and fondle her. He then led her further into the park. He put the complainant on the ground, took her pants and underpants off her and threw them away. At this time he was joined by another man. He, the offender, had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant, ignoring her resistance. At the same time as this happened, the other male put his penis into the complainant's mouth. He also put a finger into her vagina. As this happened, the complainant was being told, ""You love this"" or ""You're loving this"". The offender then ejaculated inside her, got off and he and his companion walked away, leaving the complainant lying on the ground.
5She recovered her clothing and eventually revealed what had happened to her. She was taken to hospital, where a forensics examination revealed the presence of semen in her vagina, which upon testing, proved to produce DNA which matched that of the offender.
6He was arrested in March 2012. He was interviewed by police and told them a pack of lies. He, at first, denied that he had intercourse with the complainant. Then, when he was told that his DNA had been recovered, he said that he had put his finger in the complainant's vagina. When confronted with the circumstance that the DNA that was recovered was recovered from semen, he not surprisingly, had no explanation. But he did continue to deny that he had intercourse with the complainant.
7Those denials continued until the very day this matter was listed for trial, when he, belatedly, pleaded guilty to the offence for which he must now be sentenced.
8Of course that plea still has a utilitarian benefit and so the offender is entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed to reflect that circumstance. But the lateness of the plea does call into question whether the offender is truly remorseful for what he did at the very beginning of 2012.
9Whilst I am talking about discounts, I should at this stage mention this circumstance. The offender knows who the other man was. He knows who the man was who put his penis into the complainant's mouth. He has not yet been arrested. There is a warrant out for his arrest but that has not been executed. The offender gave evidence in court before me, that should his offender be arrested, he is willing to give evidence against him. The offender is also therefore entitled, to a reduction on his sentence to reflect his willingness to assist the authorities. Combining both the discounts for pleading discounts and the discounts for assistance, meaning that I will impose upon the offender a sentence which is approximately 20 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.
10The offender is now 26 years of age. He was born in Bourke and grew up in western New South Wales. He lived with his mother and father, but was in custody when his father got sick and later died. He went to school until year 11 and after high school, worked as a jackeroo in western New South Wales. In order to perform that job he had to get certificates, which he had obtained whilst he was studying in high school. He also obtained certificates later on, as far as his work in conservation and land management is concerned, which he commenced doing in 2010. At one stage he went to Darwin to study and had no trouble with the police up there. But he came back to Dubbo and worked as a jackeroo again, before moving to Newcastle in 2010, to get a fresh start.
11He has a child who is now six, going on seven, who lives with his mother in Orange. The offender sees him as much as he can and has a good relationship with him.
12The offender has a problem with alcohol. He started drinking at 14. He started using cannabis about the same age and often drinks to the point where he passes out. He has used other drugs on occasions, but not very often. He has used speed, for example, only once and that was on the night that he committed this offence.
13This is a very serious offence. It is an offence, as I have already noted, of penile/vaginal intercourse, where the offender ejaculated whilst his penis was inside the complainant's vagina. That form of intercourse is traditionally regarded as one of the most serious forms of intercourse covered by that term. What the offender did carried with it the risk of communicating a disease. It carried the risk that the complainant could become pregnant and it was, it has to be noted, an intensely personal activity. He was a complete stranger to the complainant, who was vulnerable because of her substantial level of intoxication. 
14It is to be noted that, not only was the offender in company with his co-offender, but they both had sex with her at the same time. An offence committed in company can be committed where the co-offender simply stands by and watches. The fact that the co-offender actually participated in sexually assaulting the complainant at the same time the offender was, is one of the many factors that make this a particularly serious example of the offence.
15There are factors which point the other way. For example, the complainant was 14 and it would have been a more serious offence had she been younger. Similarly, there were only two people in company that night and it would have been more serious if there were more of them.
16Some other factors relied on by Mr Khan as suggesting that this offence was less serious than it would otherwise have been are, upon analysis, not properly to be taken into account in mitigation. For example Mr Khan relied on the circumstance that the injuries were not worse. He relied on the circumstance that the complainant's liberty was not taken from her. Both of those matters would have led to a more serious offence being committed, one under s 61J(a) of the Crimes Act, rather than one under 61J of the Crimes Act. It is not a matter of mitigation of an offence under s 61J, than a more serious offence under 61J(a) was not committed.
17Of course paramount in this sentencing exercise has to be the idea of general deterrence. Young girls should be entitled to go out, drink to the point of vulnerability but then get home safely, without being raped by people who would take advantage of their vulnerability to satisfy their sexual urges.
18Of course, we would prefer that 14 year old girls not get heavily intoxicated, but they will. And it is part of the function of the courts to do what they can to protect vulnerable, intoxicated young girls from the predatory actions of people such as the offender.
19This was an opportunistic offence and it would have been much worse, had the offender planned what he later did. I note that the offender was on parole at the time of this offence, that is a seriously aggravating factor. However, I will not double count by both regarding it as a circumstance of aggravation and commencing this sentence from a date after the offender's arrest. I will commence the sentence on 21 March 2012.
20The accused has a lengthy criminal history, but there is no other matter involving a sexual offence on it. That suggests the possibility that this will be an isolated offence of this type. Certainly, the sentence I am about to announce on the offender will act as a significant personal deterrent to him doing something, anything like this in the future.
21He is, if I can say so without appearing to be condescending, a clever man. He has obtained certificates and spoke very well in the witness box. The trouble is that he continues to offend. There are prospects that he will be rehabilitated. There are good prospects that he will commit no further sexual offence. But much depends on him dealing with the problems that he has with the consumption of alcohol and other drugs. That is one reason that I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. Not as a favour to him, necessarily, but in order to assist his rehabilitation so that the community is protected. If he can be rehabilitated from further offending then the community is, to that extent, advantaged.
22I am not entirely sure that the offender is truly remorseful for what he has done. There are factors pointing both ways. His late plea, I have already mentioned, but working the in other way is, the offender's assistance. The offender understands what he has done, looking at it in terms of the vulnerability that his younger sister has displayed. Not without some hesitation, I will make a finding that the offender is sorry for what he has done, even if he at times was hoping that he would not have to face punishment for it.
23Mr Khan helpfully provided some written submissions and even more helpfully provided a range of sentences which he submitted would be appropriate. The sentence I will announce is slightly above the range suggested by Mr Khan, primarily, because as my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offender's conduct.
24The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 21 March 2012 with a head sentence of seven and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 20 March 2017, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		29 April 2013",2013-01-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760841,Dansar Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2013] NSWSC 17,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  This is a claim in negligence brought against a local council by a property developer.  The claim is for pure economic loss, being the developer's disappointed profit expectations in respect of the proposed construction of a residential complex with 18 dwellings at Byron Bay, on a site separated from beach frontage only by a railway line.
2Amongst the many planning issues raised by the development application was a question as to the extent of Byron Shire's spare sewage treatment capacity.  The present claim rests critically on the Council's consideration of that issue.  In broad terms the developer, Dansar Pty Ltd, asserts that the Council negligently underestimated the degree of spare sewage treatment capacity in Byron Shire and overestimated the extent to which such capacity was already at least notionally allocated to existing properties or other approved developments, resulting in its denying the existence of spare capacity sufficient to meet the requirements of Dansar's proposal.
3The Council denies that it owed Dansar a duty of care, defending the claim with the modest contention that the exercise of public power in the management of such a basic community facility as the treatment of sewage does not give rise to a private right of action to protect the economic interests of private property developers.
4For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the Council does not owe the duty of care asserted against it and, accordingly, that Dansar's claim must be dismissed.
Order for a separate hearing
5On 6 October 2012 an order was made that the trial of questions on the issue of liability be determined separately and prior to the trial on damages.  This judgment determines the issue of liability.  It was common ground at the hearing that the Court would not proceed to a further hearing on damages unless the plaintiff established on the balance of probabilities in the present hearing that at least some damage was caused by any negligence found.  Circumstances in which the claim is brought
6Byron Bay, on the east coast of Australia, is stunningly beautiful and enjoys magnificent weather.  It is a popular tourist destination and a valuable area for property development.  
7The popularity of the region has at times imposed an excessive load on Byron Shire's sewage treatment system.  It is necessary to record some detail of the difficulties facing the Shire on that account.  During the 1990's the burden of an increasing permanent population together with a steady influx of tourists during holiday periods overwhelmed the system, sometimes placing the Council in breach of the standards imposed by the Environment Protection Authority.  In August 1997 concerns as to the public health and legal implications of that circumstance prompted the Council to impose a moratorium on new development pending improvement works to address the problem.    
8Byron Shire had two sewage treatment plants.  These proceedings are principally concerned with the workings of the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant.  The capacity of a sewage treatment plant to treat raw sewage can be measured in a unit known as EP, described in the proceedings as standing variously for ""equivalent population"" or ""equivalent person"".  As a unit of measurement, EP is an estimate or assumption that, for each member of the population, the volume of discharge that will flow into the sewerage system each day will be 240 litres (including all household effluent and stormwater drainage).  
9As at 1997 West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant had a rated capacity of 4,000 EP.  However, the increased load on the system during the peak holiday period was well in excess of that.  After imposing the moratorium on new development, the Council engaged engineering consultants Gutteridge Haskings & Davies Pty Ltd to design and implement urgent interim upgrade works on the plant.  The engineers recorded that, based on the peak holiday population for January 1997 considered together with upcoming developments approved by the Council, the predicted total requirement for West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant was 10,395 EP against its rated design capacity of 4,000 EP: exhibit A, tab 22, page 278.  Urgent interim works were recommended which, in short, were aimed at increasing the functionality of the existing plant until a new plant could be commissioned.
10After completion of the interim works in about April 1999, the Council revisited the need for a moratorium on new development.  On 19 September 2000 the Council passed the following resolutions (exhibit A, tab 37, pages 394 and 280 - the pages were out of order in the exhibit as originally compiled):
1. That Council acknowledges the existence of spare capacity at the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant.
2. That Council in its capacity as the sewerage authority resolved not to enter into any arrangement or agreement for the provision of sewerage services (including reticulation and treatment of sewage) for any proposed development, that is additional to the current and committed load in the catchment of the West Byron STP which would increase the load of the plant beyond its present capacity for non peak loads of 833 EP.  Any additional load would seriously jeopardise the plant's ability to meet EPA licence criteria and to comply with Council's statutory obligations for pollution control.  This resolution does not prevent Council from agreeing, when satisfied, to a scheme or arrangement that substitutes an existing sewage load on the plant with an identical equivalent sewage load, or lesser load, generated from a new development on the same land.

11The prefatory words of the second resolution (""in its capacity as the sewerage authority"") are explained by the fact that Byron Shire Council acts as the water and sewerage authority for its local government area.  It will be necessary to return to the significance of that circumstance.  
12The resolution acknowledging that spare capacity existed at the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant brought an end to the moratorium and opened an opportunity for developers to lodge applications for new development.  It became necessary in that context for the Council to identify its quantification of the spare capacity and to monitor the extent to which it might be taken up by new development applications as they were lodged.  Dansar's claim focuses acutely on that aspect of the process, being based on the assertion that the Council owed a duty of care to developers, in effect, to get those calculations right.  Implicitly, the claim assumes the existence of a private right to have any (correctly calculated) spare capacity allocated for new development.  So much is comprehended within Dansar's complaint that the Council's consideration of the application ""involved the failure to allocate the plaintiff with capacity in accordance with the allocation regime the Council imposed upon itself and which it communicated to the plaintiff"": see Dansar's written submissions at [5].   
13The Council's engineering department had calculated that there was ""spare capacity"" in the order of 92.4 ET (standing for equivalent tenement, a unit of measure estimating sewage effluent per tenement or standard household rather than per equivalent person).  Perhaps due to a transcription error, the figure of 92.4 ET first calculated by the Council was always later expressed as 92.7 ET.
14The Council maintained a series of tables referred to as the ""ET Allocation Tables"".  Mr Adrian Warner, an engineer employed by the Council, gave evidence that the primary purpose of those tables was to enable the Council to calculate the contribution to be levied from a developer for the construction of sewerage works in accordance with s 64 of the Local Government Act 1993: T91.47; T98.19.  However, the tables were also used by the Council's planning department to track the likely requirements of new development proposals against the so-called spare capacity of 92.7 ET.  
15It is important to understand what those calculations denoted.  As explained in evidence by Mr Warner, ET and EP measurements provide an assumed volume of discharge, which has a use in identifying the design capacity of a sewage treatment plant and in providing an estimate of the potential sewage that will be contributed to the system by proposed developments.  However, those units of measurement do not measure the actual capacity of a sewerage system or ensure against the risk of pollution of waterways and associated breaches of the licence conditions imposed by the Environment Protection Authority.  Those risks are best guarded against by the actual measurement of sewage flows, the measurement of process units and the measurement of performance outcomes of the sewerage plant.  Mr Warner considered that Dansar's reliance in these proceedings upon the existence of so-called ""spare capacity"" identified by the Council's engineers confuses a prediction of capacity with the actual measured or assessed capacity of the plant to process greater loads of sewage: see Mr Warner's affidavit affirmed 30 October 2013 at paragraphs 12-15, 55; and cross-examination at T97.20.   
16Dansar's original development application was lodged on 6 February 2001 by its planning consultant, GeoLink.  It is the Council's treatment of that application which gives rise to Dansar's claims in these proceedings.  The application sought consent for the construction of 18 two-bedroom, two-storey dwellings with associated car parking spaces, landscaping and a swimming pool: exhibit A, tab 40, page 728.  The proposed development was assessed as requiring 11.6 ET of sewage capacity.
17Dansar's application could not receive consent unless the Council was satisfied in terms of clause 45(1) of the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988, which provided as follows:
Provision of services:
45(1)  The Council shall not consent to the carrying out of development on any land to which this plan applies unless it is satisfied that prior adequate arrangements have been made for the provision of sewerage, draining and water services to the land.
 18According to the ET Allocation Tables, after the receipt of Dansar's application and depending on the treatment of a number of other applications, it appeared that the spare capacity of 92.7 ET (evidently adopted by the Council as the working assumption for those tables) might be absorbed or almost absorbed by applications lodged up to that point.  An announcement to that effect was made by the Mayor in a press release dated 1 March 2001: exhibit A, tab 45, page 1088.  The press release warned that anyone lodging a development application after that date did so in the knowledge that there may be no spare capacity at the time the application was determined.  Dansar contends that the Mayor's announcement was premised on a mistaken analysis as to the spare sewage treatment capacity available at that time.        
19On 24 April 2001 the Council resolved, ""for reasons of equity"", to allocate any spare capacity that should emerge in either sewage treatment plant after 6 March 2001 to applications received after that date in chronological order, that is, according to the date of receipt of the application.  It is common ground that Dansar's application was received before that date, within the moratorium-free window.   
20The Council did not determine Dansar's development application before it was deemed to have been refused under s 82(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and clause 113 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation.  Accordingly, from about 28 May 2001, Dansar had a right of appeal to the Land and Environment Court under s 97 of the Act.
21Dansar's application came before the Council on 14 August 2001.  A report to the Council of that date prepared by its development engineer discloses that, at that stage, the application was being treated as being within the spare sewage treatment capacity acknowledged by the Council in the 19 September 2000 resolution: exhibit A, tab 66, page 1307.  However, the development engineer had a series of other concerns about the application, which were unrelated to sewage treatment.  He recommended that the Council defer a decision on the determination of the application for two months to allow for the submission by Dansar of a revised proposal addressing the concerns set out in the report: exhibit A, tab 66, page 281.  
22Dansar's statement of claim relied upon an alleged failure by the Council to give ""any proper consideration"" to the development application at that meeting as one of the particulars of breach of duty of care (paragraph 52(b)(i)).  However, that allegation was expressly abandoned at the hearing.  
23On about 15 August 2001, following the Council's determination to defer a decision on the development application, Dansar instructed its planning consultant to prepare an appeal to the Land and Environment Court based on the deemed refusal.  The appeal was lodged on 31 August 2001.  Dansar's principal, Mr John Vaughan, gave evidence that one of the reasons for bringing the appeal was that the Council had a policy of reserving sewerage capacity for applications under appeal or review, although his main concern was to get a decision: T76.19-T76.31. 
24Dansar pursued its application to the Council in tandem with the appeal, as contemplated by s 82 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act.  On 16 October 2001 Dansar lodged amended plans in response to the Council's resolution of 14 August 2001: exhibit A, tab 70, page 1348.  Further changes to the design of the proposed development were submitted on 29 October 2001: exhibit A, tab 70, page 1358.  The amended plans reduced the number of dwellings and altered the layout of the project.
25On 2 November 2001 the Council filed a draft statement of issues in the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. The first two issues articulated in that document related to the absence of adequate arrangements for the provision of sewerage services for the development application.  The issues were expressed in the following terms (exhibit A, tab 71B, page 1327):
1.1 Whether adequate arrangements can be made for the provision of services to the proposed development in accordance with clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988.
1.2 Whether the proposal can be approved having regard to the inability to make prior adequate arrangements to the satisfaction of council for the disposal of sewage.
26As already noted, the Council's satisfaction as to the existence of such prior adequate arrangements was critical to the success of Dansar's development application, since clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan prohibited the granting of consent otherwise.  
27Dansar's principal, Mr John Vaughan, believed at that stage that he had an agreement to the effect that prior adequate arrangements had been reached.  His understanding was based on a conversation he had with the Mayor on 1 March 2001, the day on which the press release concerning the Shire's sewage treatment capacity was issued.  The conversation was in the following terms (affidavit of John Bernard Vaughan sworn 18 November 2011 at paragraph 21): 
Mr Vaughan: Have the existing development applications been allotted capacity?
The Mayor: If you are in, you're in.
28When Mr Vaughan saw the draft statement of issues filed by the Council in the Land and Environment Court, he confronted the Mayor as to why clause 45 had been listed as a reason for refusing his development.  According to Mr Vaughan, the Mayor's only response was, ""the Council's lawyers put it in"".  It should be recorded in the context of that evidence, however, that Dansar did not bring a claim based upon reliance on any representation by the Council on the issue of sewage treatment capacity: T78.18; T228.43.29On 13 December 2001 Mr Vaughan received a draft report from the Council evaluating Dansar's revised application following the amendments made in October 2001.  The draft report stated that the amendments created an extra 0.8 ET requirement of sewage treatment capacity.  Mr Vaughan stated that, had he or his planners been notified that the revised development application exceeded the ET allocation for the original application, the plans would have been further revised.  He requested that a supplementary report be prepared for presentation to the Council reflecting the deletion of one of the houses proposed as part of the complex, with the effect that the ET allocation would be reduced to a figure slightly less than that for the original development application: exhibit A, tab 78 at page 1399.  That request does not appear to have been complied with.
30The Council considered Dansar's application at its meeting on 18 December 2001.  An evaluation of the application prepared for the purpose of that meeting recommended that the application be refused for a number of reasons.  Apart from the first item, the detail is not important except to demonstrate the number and variety of reasons (beyond the sewage issue) put forward by the author of the report for rejecting the application.  They were as follows:
1. The proposed development exceeds the available additional loading on sewerage services, and therefore prior adequate arrangements have not been made in accordance with Clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988.
2. The proposed development is inconsistent with the guiding principles, in particular, clause 2(3)(b) and (c) of the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988, with regard to intergenerational equity, conserving biodiversity and ecological integrity.
3. The proposed development has not demonstrated that residential density has been maximised without adversely affecting the environmental features of the land, in accordance with clause 43(1)(a) of the North Coast Regional Environmental Plan 1988.
4. The proposed development does not comply with the requirements of Part J.
5. The application fails to provide detailed landscaping plans as required by Part H, Section H1.10, and thereby provides a lack of adequate detail to enable thorough assessment of the impact of the development on the streetscape, visual amenity and privacy of surrounding lands.
6. The application has provided a lack of adequate detail in relation to road construction requirements and the impact of such works on the design of the proposed development.
7. The application provides lack of adequate detail to demonstrate the adequacy of the 'potential pedestrian reserve' to physically cater for the function of the reserve for public pedestrian access, and to preserve the privacy and amenity of the adjacent residential property.
8. The application has provided insufficient detail to determine if the grades of the proposed access driveways are satisfactory.
9. The application has not provided any detail to show what impact the development may have on the existing stormwater regime.
10. The revised proposal is not accompanied by an objection pursuant to State Environmental Planning Policy No. 1 relating to the variation of the maximum height limit set by Clause 40 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988, relevant to proposed House 4.
31The Council did not accede to the recommendation that the application be refused, resolving instead to defer its consideration with an invitation to Dansar to make further amendments addressing points 2, 3 and 5 to 10 inclusive: exhibit A, tab 77.
32In reaching that position, the Council addressed the proposition put forward in the report (that the proposed development exceeded the available additional loading on sewerage services) by passing a resolution in the following terms (point 6 of the Council's resolutions):
That Council recognises that [the development application] was included in the pre 6 March 2001 ET allocation.
33Dansar's statement of claim relies upon an alleged failure by the Council to give ""any proper consideration"" to the development application at the December meeting as a further particular of breach of duty of care (paragraph 52(b)(i)).  That allegation was maintained at the hearing.  However, the considerations which prompted the abandonment of a like allegation in respect of the August meeting would appear to apply with equal force to the December meeting.  On the strength of the evidence before me, it appears that it would have been open to the Council to reject the development application at that meeting, even leaving aside the sewage issue.  Its consideration was expressly deferred against a recognition that the application fell within the spare capacity previously recognised, in order to allow Dansar to address other concerns. 
34The resolution on 18 December 2001 recognising that Dansar's application was included within the pre-March 2001 ET allocation (recorded at point 6) was the subject of a successful rescission motion at the next meeting of Council on 29 January 2002: exhibit A, tab 84.
35Separately, at the meeting of 18 December 2001, the Council resolved that three councillors be invited to negotiate the determination of the development application and accept a negotiated solution on behalf of Council.  However, Dansar alleges that the mediation of the remaining disputed items was not addressed because, from the time of the successful rescission motion on 29 January 2002, the Council negligently and erroneously maintained that the remaining ET available from the spare 92.7 previously quantified was less than the 11.6 ET required for Dansar's proposal.  
36On 13 February 2002 the Council filed its final statement of issues in the Land and Environment Court appeal proceedings.  In that document, the two issues raised by clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan continued to be listed as issues contested by the Council: exhibit A, tab 87, page 1519.
37At around the same time, the complications of a fluctuating itinerant population again began to surface.  On 15 February 2002, Mr Warner reported to the Council's general manager that a recent assessment of Byron Bay sewage flows for the peak period, January 2002, and the off-peak period, August 2001, showed significant growth.  The cause of the increase had not been able to be identified but its implications included a concern that, even following completion of a substantial upgrade to the two sewage treatment plants, ultimate capacity would be reached within a very short time: exhibit A, tab 87A, page 1747.  At that stage, Mr Warner considered that, irrespective of any theoretical calculation of spare capacity or available ET, by January 2002 the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant was in fact overloaded.  He noted that the Plant had in fact failed to comply with its licence conditions in the past (the significance of the breaches was questioned in cross-examination: T114-115).  Mr Warner regarded the risk of future non-compliance to be even greater, given the spike in January 2002.
38On 15 March 2002 the Land and Environment Court dismissed Dansar's appeal against the Council's deemed refusal of the development application: exhibit A, tab 94, page 1597, cited as Vaughan v Byron Shire Council, unreported, NSW Land and Environment Court, Commissioner Hoffman, 15 March 2002.  An appeal against that decision was dismissed: Vaughan v Byron Shire Council (No 2) [2002] NSWLEC 158.  It will be necessary to return to the detail of those two decisions.
39In October 2002, following the dismissal of the appeal, Dansar lodged a new development application seeking consent for the construction of 15 units and a separate application for development approval for a house on the western end of the land.  Those applications were ultimately approved.  In December 2005 Dansar sold the property subject to its compliance with the terms of the development approval.
40Dansar claims to have incurred ""significant financial loss and wasted expenditure as a result of holding the property, including lost profits"" (plaintiff's written submissions, paragraph 32) due to the Council's allegedly negligent approach to the sewage treatment capacity issue.   
Duty of care asserted by Dansar
41The circumstances surrounding the Council's assessment in 2000 that the existing spare capacity at the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant was 92.7 ET and the manner of allocation of that capacity are relied upon by Dansar to support the existence of a duty of care pleaded in the following terms (at paragraph 33 of the statement of claim):
(a)to give proper consideration to the development application;
(b)to give proper consideration, at the time it came to determine the development application, as to whether sufficient sewerage capacity existed at the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant to accommodate the development proposals constituted by the application.
42The particulars of that allegation identify (non-exhaustively) proximity, vulnerability, foreseeability and the Council's knowledge or constructive knowledge of the alleged actual spare sewage treatment capacity as relevant features pointing to the existence of a duty of care.
43Separately, Dansar relies on the Council's consideration of the development application to support the existence of a duty of care pleaded in the following terms (at paragraph 51 of the statement of claim):
(a) to give proper consideration to the development application after lodgement, and in particular after 14 August 2001;
(b) to give proper consideration to the development application on or about 14 August 2001, on or about 18 December 2001, on or about 29 January 2002 and on or about 22 February 2002 when the defendant came to consider whether or not the development application would be approved;
(c)in respect of the matters to be considered as part of (a) and (b), to act upon information which was properly and soundly based, accurate and reasonable in its conclusions as to the existing spare capacity of the West Byron Sewage Treatment Plant at the relevant times.  
44As already noted, during the hearing Dansar abandoned the allegation that there was any breach of duty of care in respect of the Council's consideration of the development application at its meeting of 14 August 2001.
45As noted in the submissions of Mr Taylor SC, who appeared for the Council, Dansar does not allege that the Council owed it a duty of care to enter into, or even to consider entering into, ""arrangements"" for the provision of sewerage services to the land (such prior arrangements being the pre-condition to the development consent imposed by clause 45 of the Bryon Local Environmental Plan).  The essence of the claim is that, having adopted a system for the allocation of the spare capacity identified, the Council failed to implement that system (or made errors in doing so).  Implicitly, the premise of the claim is that, regardless of any assumption of responsibility or specific reliance, the adoption of a system informs the existence and content of a duty of care.  
Principles to be applied in determining whether a duty is owed
46The correct approach to determining whether a duty of care is owed was analysed by Allsop P in Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; (2009) 75 NSWLR 649.  The President explained that, whilst the High Court has rejected the existence of any general determinant or formulaic equation to answer the question as to whether a duty of care exists in any given circumstance, an approach has been identified which requires the court to make an evaluative judgment based on the consideration of many factors.  His Honour said (at [102]-[103]):
102 ...If the circumstances fall within an accepted category of duty, little or no difficulty arises.  If, however, the posited duty is a novel one, the proper approach is to undertake a close analysis of the facts bearing on the relationship between the plaintiff and the putative tortfeasor by references (sic) to the ""salient features"" or factors affecting the appropriateness of imputing a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid harm or injury. 
103 These salient features include: 
(a) the foreseeability of harm; 
 (b) the nature of the harm alleged;
(c)  the degree and nature of control able to be exercised by the defendant to avoid harm; 
(d) the degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff to harm from the defendant's conduct, including the capacity and reasonable expectation of a plaintiff to take steps to protect itself;
(e) the degree of reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant;
(f)  any assumption of responsibility by the defendant; 
(g) the proximity or nearness in a physical, temporal or relational sense of the plaintiff to the defendant; 
(h) the existence or otherwise of a category of relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff or a person closely connected with the plaintiff;
(i) the nature of the activity undertaken by the defendant;
(j) the nature or the degree of the hazard or danger liable to be caused by the defendant's conduct or the activity or substance controlled by the defendant;
(k) knowledge (either actual or constructive) by the defendant that the conduct will cause harm to the plaintiff; 
(l) any potential indeterminacy of liability;  
(m) the nature and consequences of any action that can be taken to avoid the harm to the plaintiff;
(n) the extent of imposition on the autonomy or freedom of individuals, including the right to pursue one's own interests;
(o) the existence of conflicting duties arising from other principles of law or statute; 
(p) consistency with the terms, scope and purpose of any statute relevant to the existence of a duty; and 
(q) the desirability of, and in some circumstances, need for conformance and coherence in the structure and fabric of the common law.  

47The saliency of the relevant features is necessarily informed in the present case by the statutory framework within which the Council was required to consider the development application, importantly including its dual function as both the consent authority and the sewerage management authority.    
48Mr Cotman SC, who appeared with Ms Harris for Dansar, submitted that the present case does fall within an accepted category of duty of care, being ""the processing of development applications"": see plaintiff's legal contentions on duty of care at [4].  That submission invites careful attention.  Authority to support it was said to be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Makawe Pty Ltd v Randwick City Council [2009] NSWCA 412; (2009) 171 LGERA 165 at [43], where Hodgson JA provided a series of general propositions drawn from ""a number of cases suggesting that local authorities may have a duty of care owed to developers and/or purchasers in relation to their approval of development and/or building applications"": at [30].
49Of the five propositions drawn from those cases by Hodgson JA, the one relied upon by the plaintiff (proposition (2) at [43]) is:
However, if the approving authority is subject to a statutory requirement not to give consent unless it is satisfied of something, the courts may well find a duty, owed to developers and to purchasers, to exercise reasonable care in considering whether it is so satisfied: Taitapanui, Western Districts.  
50None of the cases reviewed by Hodgson JA at [30]-[43] was a claim for economic loss of the kind claimed here, being loss of the profits expected of a development project.  In each case, the nature of the harm alleged was the emergence of some physical feature of the relevant site or construction which ought to have been detected or prevented by the Council and which, at a later time, gave rise to damage to property or economic loss: a house which began to collapse due to slippage after being built where required by the Council on land known by the Council to be prone to slippage (Wollongong City Council v Fregnan [1982] 1 NSWLR 244); a house built in accordance with Council approval where the approval entailed consideration as to whether the land was fit to be used for residential purposes and the house later became uninhabitable due to movement of earth and rock (Bamford v Albert Shire Council [1998] 2 Qd R 125); a house built on land which the Council well knew was contaminated (Armidale City Council v Alec Finlayson Pty Limited [1999] FCA 330; (1999) 104 LGERA 9); a holiday cabin built within a predicted aircraft noise contour higher than was considered acceptable for houses and home units where the Council had received the relevant noise exposure forecast before giving development consent (Port Stephens Shire Council v Booth [2005] NSWCA 323; (2005) 148 LGERA 351); a house for which a building permit was granted negligently by a building surveyor employed by the Council which was later found to be structurally deficient (Moorabool Shire Council v Taitapunui [2006] VSCA 30; (2006) 14 VR 55); and a subdivision in which the purchaser of a lot incurred a substantial levy under the Sydney Water Act 1994 after the Council, as the principal certifying authority, issued a subdivision certificate without being satisfied that the subdivider had obtained a compliance certificate under the Act, which was a condition of the development consent (Western Districts Developments Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Shire Council [2009] NSWCA 283; (2009) 75 NSWLR 706). 
51More particularly, a consideration of the two decisions from which his Honour drew the particular proposition at [43](2) set out above reveals that it provides slender support for the plaintiff's claim as to the existence of a duty of care in the present case, let alone determining that the claim falls within an existing class of duty of care (unless that phrase is understood in the broadest sense).  Each was a case involving damage to property where the consenting authority had to be satisfied of matters pertaining to the protection of the person seeking consent.  That is not the way in which the case is put here.  Further, as noted above, in Western Districts the Council was acting as the certifying authority rather than as the development consent authority.  
52In Taitapanui, the relevant constraint was that the building surveyor was not to issue a building permit unless he was satisfied that the construction would comply with legislated standards.  The claim against the Council was not in respect of the exercise of its statutory functions at all, but based on its vicarious liability for the very different statutory functions of the building surveyor as the Council's employee.
53In Western Districts, the relevant constraint was that the Council was not to issue a subdivision certificate unless satisfied that the applicant had obtained a certificate of compliance from the water supply authority.
54The differences from the circumstances of the present case are manifest.  Dansar relied upon the fact that, under clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan, the Council must not consent to a development unless satisfied that prior adequate arrangements have been made for the provision of sewerage, drainage and water services to the land.  That was said to bring the case within the class of case referred to by Hodgson JA in Makawe at [43] in proposition no (2).  However, as already explained, those were cases in which the precondition for the issue of the relevant certificate was for the protection of the applicant.  The functions exercised by the Council in respect of Dansar's development application and more broadly regarding the management of sewage treatment in Byron Shire are scarcely captured in the proposition that the Council was subject to a statutory requirement not to give consent unless it was satisfied of something. 
55What that illustrates is the indeterminate content of the question whether a case falls into ""an existing category of duty of care"", an issue which was approached differently even within the several judgments in Makawe: Hodgson at [48] thought that the case did not, after a careful analysis of some of the matters that have earned the label ""salient features""; Campbell JA was silent as to existing versus novel, considering the relevant features without the label and without reference to the President's judgment in Stavar (at [59]-[73]); Simpson J noted the elusive distinction between ""pure economic loss"" and that which is not ""pure economic loss"" and considered (at [95]) that even a case falling within the description of pure economic loss should be approached in the manner identified by Allsop P in Stavar.  In so holding, her Honour noted that the authorities do not prescribe the relative importance of any of the salient features, that being ""precisely the point of the 'salient features' test"" (at [137]).
56Interestingly in that context, since the hearing of this case the Court of Appeal has determined an appeal in a claim similar to Dansar's (in that it was a claim for pure economic loss brought by a developer against a Council arising from the processing and assessment of a development application).  The appeal was determined without explicit reference to Stavar, evidently on the premise that pure economic loss is an existing category of duty of care: see MM Constructions (Aust) Pty Ltd v Port Stephens Council [2012] NSWCA 417. 
57The President wrote the main judgment in that case, holding that the duty asserted by the plaintiff did not arise.  After rejecting the broad proposition said to follow from earlier authorities that any foreseeable loss of any kind from the exercise of any [statutory] power exercised without reasonable care is recoverable (at [88]-[90]), his Honour considered the salient features identified by the High Court as being relevant to the determination of the existence of a duty of care in a claim for relational interest loss in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16; (2004) 216 CLR 515.  His Honour's assessment of those considerations was closely informed by a careful analysis of the statutory powers exercised by the Council and the broader statutory context in which the claim was brought. 
58One thing that is clear from the authorities is that, even where a case can be described as being of the kind in which the existence of a duty of care is already recognised, that is not necessarily determinative.  Save in the kind of case where the existence and content of a duty of care is beyond dispute, such as in the relationship between lawyers and their clients or employers and employees, an existing class of duty does not obviate the need to determine whether a duty is to be imputed in any particular case.  The task for the court is to form an evaluative judgment as to the appropriateness of imposing a duty of care of the kind asserted having regard to all of the salient features of the case which inform that question.  The list of such features provided by Allsop P in Stavar was described by his Honour as ""a non-exhaustive universe"" (echoing the widely-accepted scientific theory that the physical universe is expanding in a way that is unknown and unpredictable).  It stands as a helpful guide to the evaluative judgment that must be undertaken in any case in which the asserted duty of care is in contest, whether or not it is a duty of a kind that falls within a recognised class.
59The considerations listed by the President call attention to the need for conformance of the content of the duty of care alleged with the statutory responsibilities of the Council, a proposition forcefully reiterated in MM Constructions.  That is an important consideration in the present case and necessarily informs the assessment of many of the salient features relevant to the question whether a duty of care is to be imputed.  It is appropriate for that reason to begin with an analysis of the relevant statutory regime.  
 Functions exercised by the Council
60As recognised in the Local Government Act, all functions of a council come from statute, either from that Act or other Acts: see the note to chapter 5 of the Act.  The functions of a council include service or non-regulatory functions as well as regulatory functions.  The service or non-regulatory functions of a council are set out in chapter 6 of the Act, while the major regulatory functions are set out in chapter 7 of the Act.  
61An important aspect of the context in which the present claim is brought is that Byron Shire Council has the regulatory functions of being both the development consent authority and the water and sewerage authority for its local government area: see affidavit of Mr Warner affirmed 30 October 2009 at paragraph 4.  Byron Shire's position in that respect is to be contrasted with the position of Sydney metropolitan local councils or councils in the Hunter region, where water supply and sewerage are regulated by other authorities: see s 68(2) of the Local Government Act.  
62The general functions of the Council and its dual functions relating to the regulation of development and sewerage are governed by a complex statutory regime.  A helpful and comprehensive analysis of the relevant provisions was provided in the written submissions of the Council.  The following discussions draws heavily from that document.
63The service or non-regulatory functions of a council contained in chapter 6 of the Local Government Act include, in part 1 of chapter 6, the general function of a local council of providing services to meet the needs of the community.  That general function is conferred by s 24 of the Act, as follows:
A council may provide goods, services and facilities, and carry out activities, appropriate to the current and future needs within its local community and of the wider public, subject to this Act, the regulations and any other law. 
64The performance of that general function is circumscribed by the provisions of part 3 of chapter 6.  Division 2 of part 3 includes a series of specific provisions regulating the Council's provision of services in the construction of sewerage works and the management of sewage treatment.  Pursuant to those provisions, the Council has conditional power to construct sewerage works and in respect of the treatment of sewage, subject to Ministerial control and possible direction: see ss 56-66 of the Act.
65Section 64 in division 2 confers on the Council the function of a water authority under the Water Management Act 2000 of certifying compliance for development works carried out within its area.  The conferral of that function enables the Council to require the construction of sewerage works and to levy contributions towards the cost of such works. 66Chapter 7 of the Act confers on the Council a regulatory function in respect of sewerage works.  Section 68 in that chapter prohibits the carrying out of sewerage work, including the connection of a private sewer with the public sewer, without the prior approval of the Council.  Section 89 in chapter 7 sets out matters to be considered by the Council in determining whether to grant such approval, which include the principles of ecologically sustainable development.  As noted by the Council in its written submissions, the section imposes an obligation on the Council ""to subordinate the interests of individual applicants to the public interest (specifically in relation to protecting the environment and public health)"".  That said, the section also requires the Council to seek to give effect to the applicant's objectives to the extent of their compatibility with the public interest.  The section provides:
(1)  In determining an application, the council:
(a)  must not approve the application if the activity or the carrying out of the activity for which approval is sought would not comply with the requirements of any relevant regulation, and(b)  must take into consideration any criteria in a local policy adopted under Part 3 by the council which are relevant to the subject-matter of the application, and(c)  must take into consideration the principles of ecologically sustainable development.
(2)  If no requirements are prescribed for the purposes of subsection (1) (a), and no criteria are adopted for the purposes of subsection (1) (b), the council in determining an application:
(a)  is to take into consideration, in addition to the principles of ecologically sustainable development, all matters relevant to the application, and(b)  is to seek to give effect to the applicant's objectives to the extent to which they are compatible with the public interest.
(3)  Without limiting subsection (2), in considering the public interest the matters the council is to consider include:
(a)  protection of the environment, and(b)  protection of public health, safety and convenience, and(c)  any items of cultural and heritage significance which might be affected.
67As noted by Mr Taylor, although the Council has a service function of providing sewerage services and sewage treatment facilities, it has no specific obligation to provide them to any particular person.  Manifestly, that is the position in respect of the Council's regulatory function under chapter 7.  Connection to the public sewer required specific, additional approval which, under s 89, could only be granted to the extent to which it was compatible with the public interest.
68Section 176 of the Act allows an appeal to the Land and Environment Court by a person dissatisfied with the determination of an approval application.  Section 179 confers a limited discretion on that Court to award compensation for any expense incurred as a consequence of a council's refusal to grant, or delay in granting, the approval sought.    
69The regulatory function is also addressed in the Local Government (Approvals) Regulation 1999, clause 15 of which imposes a mandatory obligation on the Council, in determining any approval application, to have regard to the protection and promotion of public health, the protection of the environment, the safeguarding of its assets and any other relevant matter. 
70In its separate capacity as the development consent authority, there fell to the Council the function of considering Dansar's development application under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act.  
71In exercising that function, the Council was required to consider many matters.  Section 79C of the Act provides a list of considerations that are mandatory (where relevant) including any local environmental planning instrument, the likely impacts of the development including environmental, social and economic impacts and the public interest.  
72The relevant planning instrument in the case of Byron Shire was the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988, which is considered further below.  
73Section 80(2) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act mandates the rejection of an application for the subdivision of land that would, if carried out, not comply with an applicable environmental planning instrument.  Section 96A of the Act confers power to revoke or modify any consent in force if, ""having regard to"" the provisions of any draft local environmental plan it appears to the Council that the development should not be carried out or completed.  Section 111 of the Act requires the Council to ""examine and take into account to the fullest extent possible all matters affecting or likely to affect the environment"" in the carrying out of the works.
74As already noted, Dansar had a right of appeal to the Land and Environment Court against the Council's deemed refusal of the application, and exercised that right.  It was still open to the Council to determine the application after the appeal was lodged but any such determination would not have obviated the continuation or determination of the appeal, and a grant of consent would not have disposed of the proceedings without Dansar's consent: see s 82(3) and 82(4) of the Act.
75Dansar also had a right of internal review under s 82A of the Act.
Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988
76As noted above, the relevant local environmental planning instrument required to be taken into account by the Council was the Byron Local Environmental Plan 1988.  The aim of the Plan stated in clause 2(1) is to promote sustainable development in Byron by furthering the objects of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, particularly in regard to matters listed in that clause.  The objectives of the Plan stated in clause 2(2) include enhancing individual and community well-being by following a path of economic development that safeguards the welfare of future generations; inter-generational equity; and the protection of biodiversity.
77It is not necessary for present purposes to go to other parts of the Plan in any detail except in respect of sewage treatment.  As already noted, clause 45 of the Plan mandated the refusal of development consent unless the Council was satisfied that prior adequate arrangements had been made for the provision of sewerage services to the land.  
78The nature of the function, power or duty to be exercised by the Council under clause 45 was considered by the Court of Appeal in Codlea Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [1999]  NSWCA 399.  Central to the Court's analysis was the recognition that clause 45 has two elements - the objective existence of prior adequate arrangements, which is in the nature of a condition precedent to the granting of consent, and the Council's (subjective) satisfaction of that fact. 
79The Court held that the function of being satisfied (or not satisfied) as to the existence of prior adequate arrangements could be seen as a function basic to the Council's function to grant (or refuse) development approval and, for that reason one able to be exercised, on appeal, by the Land and Environment Court in accordance with s 39(2) of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979:  at [26] to [28] per Stein JA; Handley and Sheller JJA agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively.  Thus if a council refused to be satisfied although prior adequate arrangements had in fact been reached, it would be open to the Court to reach that state of satisfaction.  
80However, the Court held at [42] that the underlying objective requirement that there be prior adequate arrangements derives from a function that cannot be exercised by the Land and Environment Court.  In reaching that conclusion, Stein JA considered the separate functions exercised by the Council as a water, sewerage and drainage authority with the powers recruited by force of s 64 of the Local Government Act to levy contributions from developers so as to allow for the development of land without cost to the Council.  His Honour concluded from the operation of those provisions (which have since been amended but not so as to derogate from the force of the analysis) that the function of reaching prior arrangements, although not strictly a function of the Council in its capacity as the sewerage authority, brings forward consideration of some of the issues arising in the performance of that function:  at [32] to [33].
81The Court of Appeal's conclusion that the function of entering into prior adequate arrangements is exclusively the province of the Council and not one arrogated to the Land and Environment Court under s 39(2) of the Land and Environment Court Act proved fatal to Dansar's appeals.  Commissioner Hoffman felt bound to dismiss the appeal, applying Codlea in the absence of there being arrangements already reached between Dansar and the Council at the time the appeal was determined:  Vaughan v Byron Shire Council at [82] to [83].   Lloyd J held in Vaughan v Byron Shire Council (No 2) at [17] to [18] that the Commissioner was bound to reach that conclusion.  Salient features
82The disconformity between the duty of care asserted by Dansar and the Council's statutory functions is manifest.  Many of the functions exercised by the Council within the complex statutory regime considered above focus critically on considerations of public health and environmental impact.  The existence of a private right to recover relational interest damages in respect of a failure to allocate sewage treatment capacity to an individual property developer is plainly inimical to the unimpeded exercise of such functions.  That consideration alone militates powerfully against imputing a duty of care of the content asserted by Dansar.
83A consideration of the salient features of the relationship between the Council and Dansar produces the same conclusion.  I have already noted my view that the relevant features are necessarily informed by the statutory context.  
84It may readily be accepted (and was accepted by the Council at the hearing) that harm of the kind claimed by Dansar was foreseeable.  However, as submitted by Mr Taylor on behalf of the Council, harm of that nature is inherent in the process of due consideration which the Council must undertake when assessing proposals for new development in Byron Shire, keeping one eye on the interests of regional development and the other on the important public power exercised in the management of water and sewage.  As noted by Mr Taylor in that context, the fact that the public interest is a relevant and potentially determinative consideration in any development application is inconsistent with the imposition of a duty on the Council to take care in the allocation of putative units of sewage treatment capacity, less still to do so in a timely fashion.
85The nature of the harm alleged is the delayed receipt of development profits and the expenses and holding costs incurred during the alleged delay.  It is appropriate in that context to consider the salient features required to establish a relationship of sufficient proximity discussed by the High Court in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16; (2004) 216 CLR 515.  A helpful analysis of those considerations is to be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal in MM Constructions, to which I have already referred.  Here, as was the case there, there is no relevant reliance, no assumption of responsibility and no vulnerability in the relevant sense (see especially at [93]-[98]).    
86Dansar submitted that the Council had a high degree of control (able to be exercised to avoid harm to Dansar) in considering whether there was spare sewage treatment capacity within the 92.7 ET calculated by the Council's engineering department.  In particular, it was submitted that the Council had total and exclusive control over the calculation of spare capacity, the information sustaining the calculation and the application of that information to the allocation of ET to development applications.  Comprehended within that submission was the proposition that the Council had to apply its allocation system ""correctly"" and to form ""a correct view"" as to the possibility of reaching adequate arrangements within the meaning of clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan: see plaintiff's written submissions, paragraph 49.  
87In my view, that submission entails two misconceptions.  First, it looks with telescopic focus to the financial interests of developers as if that were the only interest required to be served by the exercise of the Council's several functions.  Secondly, it treats sewage treatment capacity as if it were a fixed, measurable resource which the Council had an obligation to quantify correctly and to allocate exhaustively.  That overlooks the complexity of the sewage issue, for the reasons explained by Mr Warner considered above, and the importance of the Council's separate function as the sewage management authority.  The present case is quite different from the position of a certifying authority where the matter required to be certified is known to the Council and not known to the person for whose protection the certificate is issued.  The control exercised by the Council, and the degree of vulnerability of the person seeking the certificate or approval, in cases of the kind discussed by Hodgson JA in Makawe derives from a more focussed task.  
88I accept that the Council had a degree of control in respect of the ET allocation process, in the sense that the Council's employees formulated and applied that process, and that Dansar was vulnerable to the outcome of that process, in the sense that it could not control it.  However, the control able to be exercised by the Council at any time was not unconstrained.  It was circumscribed by the many competing considerations required to be weighed in the exercise of a number of different statutory functions.  
89Further, as to the degree of vulnerability, it is important to understand what is comprehended within that term in the present context.  The kind of vulnerability that will point to the existence of a duty of care was explained in the joint reasons of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Woolcock at 530 [23]:
""Vulnerability"", in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, ""vulnerability"" is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff's inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant. 
90The want of reasonable care asserted in the present case is the Council's alleged failure, due to mistakes of calculation or wrong information, to identify enough spare sewage treatment capacity to satisfy itself as to the existence of ""prior adequate arrangements"" for the purpose of clause 45 of the Byron Local Environmental Plan.  In short, it is a complaint that the Council negligently failed to allow a greater burden on the sewerage system.  To say that Dansar was unable to protect itself from the consequences of such negligence in a way that should cast the consequences of the loss on the Council assumes not only that there existed an objective, ""correct"" quantity of spare sewage treatment capacity but that all such capacity was required to be allocated for development: see plaintiff's written submissions, paragraphs 29, 53.  Each of those premises highlights the disconformity between the duty of care asserted by Dansar and the unimpeded performance of the Council's statutory functions.  For the reasons given in the evidence of Mr Warner, the Council's calculation of spare capacity or available ET, whilst helpful for planning purposes, was ultimately no more than theoretical.  Further, the Council was under no legal duty to allocate all spare capacity calculated.  To adopt such an approach would plainly be in conflict with the proper exercise of its other functions.  
91The vulnerability asserted by Dansar is a want of protection of an economic interest which, as the foregoing analysis of the statutory context reveals, stands in competition with many other interests of varied vulnerability and importance.  Dansar ought reasonably to have expected and planned its business on that basis.  Mr Vaughan emphasised in his evidence that, until he saw the draft statement of issues in the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court, there were ""no concerns...at all about sewerage"": T78.49.  However, in the absence of any specific reliance by Dansar on any positive representation by the Council, I do not think it can be concluded that Dansar was vulnerable in the sense explained by the High Court in Woolcock.  The recognition of a duty of care to protect an individual against such vulnerability would skew the careful balance of competing interests sought to be achieved by the statutory regime of regulation and management.
92As to reliance and assumption of responsibility, Dansar asserts only that it was reasonably foreseeable that it (or a person in its position) would rely on the Council to process the development application with reasonable care and ""apply its ET allocation regimen with due care"": plaintiff's written submissions, paragraph 65.  Beyond that general proposition, Dansar does not assert any actual assumption of responsibility on the part of the Council or that it relied on the Council in any specific way.  I do not think that a consideration of any substantial weight in the present context.
93The consideration of proximity requires more careful attention.  As submitted on behalf of Dansar, it was a member of a fixed class of applicants who lodged applications within the moratorium-free period, expressly referred to in the Mayor's announcement of 1 March 2002 as ""a window of opportunity"" for the lodgement of development applications.  Dansar relied upon that consideration both as demonstrating a degree of proximity and as rebutting any suggestion that the recognition of a duty of care would result in an indeterminate liability.  The deliberations of the Council at various meetings, particularly including the December meeting at which it was resolved to recognise that Dansar's development application was included in the pre 6 March 2001 ET allocation and the subsequent rescission of that motion, reveal that those developers who had lodged applications within the moratorium-free period were regarded as a discrete group for the purpose of considering the availability of adequate sewage arrangements. That is a factor weighing in favour of the recognition of a duty of care, but I do not think it is of sufficient strength to outweigh the other salient features of the case.
94The strongest consideration, in my view, is the tension between the private right asserted in these proceedings and the public powers and functions exercised by the Council.  An important consideration in that context is the undesirability of producing an incoherent body of law.  I would perceive a measure of incoherence between the Court of Appeal's conclusion in Codlea (that the function of reaching arrangements for the provision of sewerage services to the land is exclusively the province of the Council) and the imposition on the Council of a duty of care of the content asserted by Dansar, which would open the exercise of that function to the scrutiny of this Court.


Conclusion
95For those reasons, I have concluded that the Council did not owe the duty of care asserted by Dansar.   
96In light of that conclusion, and after careful deliberation, I have concluded (in some fear of appellate censure) that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to determine the questions of breach of duty and causation.  I am mindful of admonitions by superior courts of the importance that, where possible, all issues of fact be determined at first instance, lest the failure to determine any particular issue be premised on legal error.  For example, the Court of Appeal has expressed the view that, in personal injury cases, where the issue of damages has been fully litigated and there is a reasonable possibility that the judge's conclusion on liability may be wrong, it is ""both just and convenient"" that the judge should proceed to assess damages even where not satisfied as to liability: see Nevin v B & R Enclosures Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 339 at [75] per Tobias JA, Sheller and Beazley JJA agreeing.  Those remarks were strongly reiterated in Wolfenden v International Theme Park Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 78 per Giles JA at [3]-[6]; Hodgson JA agreeing with additional remarks at [53]; Windeyer J agreeing at [55].
97It may also be observed that a complaint as to a similar circumstance was made by the appellant in MM Constructions (where it was alleged that the trial judge did not deal satisfactorily with breach of duty on the hypothesis that his Honour was wrong as to the existence of a duty of care), but that complaint was not ultimately required to be considered by the Court of Appeal (at [6]).   
98In my respectful opinion, it is not inconsistent with those authorities to recognise that, in some instances, the determination of issues of fact rendered hypothetical by the judge's conclusion as to another issue will prove to be a barren undertaking, the pursuit of which will be inimical to the overriding purpose of the Civil Procedure Act 2005.  In Kelman v Mutton; Howard Haulage Pty Ltd v Mutton  [2007] NSWSC 13 at [66], Sully J saw ""no sense"" in a trial judge's proceeding to quantify the apportionment of liability between cross-claimant and cross-defendant after rejecting the premise of the cross-claim.  To do so would require the judge to nominate hypothetical circumstances that justified the apportionment reached, contrary to the earlier finding.
99In the present context, the existence of the asserted duty of care is the legal construct within which the question of breach falls to be determined.  The question of breach is complicated in the present case by the indeterminate content of the duty asserted (to give ""proper"" consideration to the development application and to the sufficiency of existing sewerage capacity).  That duty is said to arise not only in respect of the four individual occasions identified in paragraph 52 of the statement of claim but also in respect of the underlying assessment of the so-called spare capacity.  To determine whether the plaintiff has established breach would require me to import hypothetical content into a duty the existence of which I reject on the grounds of disconformity with the content of the Council's statutory functions.  I do not think it is just or convenient to embark on such an exercise.  It would be artificial to proceed to determine the issue of causation in that circumstance.
100The order is that there be a verdict for the defendant.

2760845,R v McCook [2013] NSWDC 36,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: It is easy to feel sorry for Mr Ashley McCook. He had, as was revealed in remarks on sentence when Mr McCook was sentenced earlier, quite a difficult upbringing. His natural parents were involved in only a very brief relationship and he had little contact with his father. His stepfathers did not really play much of a part in Mr McCook's upbringing and it was suggested on an earlier occasion that Mr McCook's mother had put her own personal advantages before those of her children. 

2Mr McCook started to use drugs at an early age; cannabis when he was thirteen and then, as is often the case, progressing towards harder drugs until he ultimately developed a heroin habit. Heroin is expensive and Mr McCook resorted to crime in order to obtain the funds to buy that drug. 

3He has, since he turned eighteen, been in custody for an enormous proportion of his adult life. Since he turned eighteen he has spent eleven years, one month and nineteen days in custody and his time in the community has been less than eleven months. Some periods of freedom were very short indeed and the longest was five months and twenty days. Mr McCook has not even spent a birthday whilst he is not in custody since he turned eighteen. 

4As I said, it is easy to feel sorry for Mr McCook, but it is equally easy to feel sorry for those who are the victims of Mr McCook's many crimes. 

5He was last released on 25 May 2012 but committed this offence a very short time afterwards on 6 June 2012. He was arrested the following day and has been in custody since then. When he was released he was on methadone. He was living at Port Stephens with his grandmother and getting his methadone from Newcastle. He had a friend who wanted him to visit in Port Macquarie. His friend put pressure on him to make that visit because they had not seen much of each other over the years, presumably because of Mr McCook's regular incarcerations. So he went to Port Macquarie without making any arrangements as to how he would get his doses of methadone. In order to cope with the absence of methadone he says he bought a bottle of Rivotril off the street whilst in Port Macquarie. There are 100 pills in a bottle and I gather that Mr McCook did not moderate his intake of that drug. What happened after that is something of a blur to him. He eventually ended up committing the offence for which he must now be sentenced. 

6He went into a supermarket where he bought a knife. He went to a pharmacist in the same shopping centre and spoke to a pharmacy assistant. He told the assistant that he was looking for a script and that he had been in a fight. This confused the assistant. The pharmacist noticed and approached the counter. She asked Mr McCook if she could help him. He slid over a note with the words ""Xanax"", ""Diazepam"" and ""Serepax"" written on it. He then told the pharmacist, ""I have a knife. Just quietly go and get these so nobody gets hurt."" She went and got some of the drugs. Whilst this was happening the assistant looked over and saw the offender lift his jacket to reveal the knife handle between his jeans and his skin. Apparently the knife remained in its plastic packaging, the packaging it was in when he bought it from Woolworth's nearby. The pharmacist asked another employee to call the police. She did so. The drugs were put into a brown paper bag by the pharmacist and they were given to Mr McCook. He then asked for money but when the pharmacist told him that the till could not be opened without a sale Mr McCook simply replied, ""Oh, okay,"" and walked out of the shop. 

7Passers-by, aware of what had been going on, chased the offender and overpowered him, punching him in the face in the process. He was arrested and then interviewed by police. He told police he had bought the knife in order to defend himself against any stronger males he encountered after robbing the chemist shop but said he never intended to use the knife. He made admissions to his part in the offence.

8The offender has somewhat of a fatalistic attitude towards what is going to happen to him in the short term. He accepts, of course, as he must, that he must serve a significant time in gaol and he realises that his life until now has been largely wasted. He says, for example, that he does not have any children and that unless he changes his ways soon he will become one of those sad people who looks back on his life in his forties or fifties and realises that he has not enjoyed those aspects of life as a free man which are available to those of us who do not commit offences. Not to put too fine a point on it, Mr McCook is growing up and beginning to feel quite keenly that he is missing out on what life should be providing for him. After all, he only has one life and it is terribly sad to see it wasted in the way it has been.

9The offence is, of course, one of armed robbery and that requires that attention be paid to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 ACrimR. There a sentence of four to five years was postulated for an offence which met some common characteristics. The offender is not a young man with a limited criminal history but, on the other hand, his plea of guilty was early rather than the late plea referred to in the Henry guideline. 

10This was not really an offence that was planned to any great extent at all and the knife was not pointed to anyone or waved around, as is often the case in offences of this kind. Of course, that does not mean that people were not harmed by the commission of the offence. I am sure that the victims of the offence were very frightened. The offender may well have appeared confused at times but that might have only added to the apprehension felt by the victims of the offence, knowing that Mr McCook was not acting terribly rationally. 

11These offences are very serious. They do cause harm to the victims of the offences and they need to be dealt with in an appropriate way by the courts when people come before them for sentence. On the other hand, as Mr McCook's custodial history shows, if there is to be a change in his behaviour it is not going to be one which is easy. He is the type of person who must not only be punished but who also must be assisted in putting his life of crime behind him.

12The offender explained the difficulties in getting access to drug and alcohol counselling in Goulburn gaol. No doubt his misbehaviour whilst in custody has had a lot to do with both where he serves his sentence and also him gaining access to rehabilitation programmes whilst in custody. To that extent, he only really has himself to blame for the predicament he now finds himself in. But there are glimmers of hope and suggestions that Mr McCook might be, at the age of thirty-one, able to comply with the rules inside gaol and gain access to programmes and courses and the like which are desperately needed in his case. 

13Unless efforts are made by the prison authorities and, upon release, the Probation and Parole authorities, to rehabilitate Mr McCook then other people will suffer in the future. If Mr McCook is not rehabilitated then he will commit further crimes and there will be more victims of robberies, more victims of break and enters. More than most, Mr McCook should have close attention paid to his rehabilitation whilst in custody and upon his release.

14Although in the past Mr McCook's behaviour after release from custody suggests that a finding of special circumstances in his favour would simply allow him to commit offences earlier than would otherwise be the case, I am going to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour for this reason: He needs to be very closely supervised upon his release from gaol and that needs to take place for a significant period of time. It is possible that what Mr McCook really needs is a period in a residential rehabilitation facility and so whilst in custody efforts must be made by the prison authorities to have the offender in a position where at the expiry of his non-parole period he will be acceptable to a residential drug rehabilitation programme. The parole authorities might consider it appropriate that it be a condition of his release to parole that he enter into that form of quasi custody. It is my recommendation to the parole authorities that consideration be given to Mr McCook's release to parole only on condition that he enter into a residential rehabilitation facility and it is my recommendation to the prison authorities that the offender be considered for entry into the intensive drug and alcohol treatment programme at Windsor gaol. As I keep saying, substantial efforts must be made to assist Mr McCook to do what he now wants to do, that is, live a life outside gaol.

15But I repeat, this was a serious offence and one which needs to be dealt with in a way which punishes Mr McCook for what he has done. 

16Taking account of the Henry guideline judgment, as I must, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 6 June 2012 and a head sentence of six years. The non-parole period will expire on 5 June 2015, on which day he is eligible to be released to parole. Whether he is or not will depend not on me but on the parole board.

		12 April 2013",2013-01-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760851,Renshaw v Reed Business Information Pty Ltd trading as Lawyers Weekly [2013] NSWDC 5,"Judgment

1These are reasons for my ruling today striking out two of four imputations pleaded by the plaintiff in the statement of claim filed on 22 November 2012. 

2The imputations pleaded in the statement of claim are:

(a)The Plaintiff was in prison over drug charges (paragraph 7).

(b)The Plaintiff is a criminal (whole article including 7 and 8).

(c)The Plaintiff fled to Queensland in March to avoid justice (8).

(d)The Plaintiff is embroiled in a seedy Court case (3).

(e)Richard Vereker put up $50,000 bail to have the Plaintiff released from prison (8).

(f)The Plaintiff is unfit to be a Barrister (whole article).

3The imputations the subject of challenge in this application are imputations (b), (d), (e) and (f).

4Although the general practice, in imputation arguments, is for the matter complained of to be set out in full either as part of, or as a schedule to, any judgment, I have not done so in this application. This is because counsel for the defendants has told me that the matter complained of contains errors, is withdrawn from publication, has been the subject of an apology and will be defended by the defence of offer of amends. In those circumstances, and given the narrow bases upon which the argument has proceeded before me today, it is not appropriate to include the text of the publication in this judgment.

5I shall set out each of the imputations challenged, the basis for challenge and the rulings I have made.

Imputation (b): the plaintiff is a criminal

6The matter complained of is an article in the ""Lawyers Weekly"" dated 21 November 2012, captioned ""Barrister's Double trouble [sic]"". The article describes the plaintiff, a barrister, as having two problems. The first is that he has been the victim of theft by a ""former Penthouse Pet"" with whom he shared his apartment, and the second is that he was ""released from prison over unrelated drugs charges"", following which he fled to Queensland in March 2012; as a result, the surety of $50,000 put up on his behalf was called upon.

7Counsel for the defendants submits that an imputation of being a criminal is not capable of being conveyed: Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison (1982) 149 CLR 293. He submits that the matter complained of refers only to charges being laid which, without more, cannot convey an imputation of guilt. He also relies upon the asserted confusion of names between the plaintiff and the woman charged with stealing the money, which a diligent ordinary reasonable reader ought to be able to discover. 

8Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the matter complained of goes well beyond stating that charges have been laid, and relies upon Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186 at [11], where Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ cited with approval the observations of Lord Devlin in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234 at 277:

""[11] Lord Devlin pointed out, in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd, that whereas, for a lawyer, an implication in a text must be necessary as well as reasonable, ordinary readers draw implications much more freely, especially when they are derogatory. That is an important reminder for judges. In words apposite to the present case, his Lordship said: 

It is not ... correct to say as a matter of law that a statement of suspicion imputes guilt. It can be said as a matter of practice that it very often does so, because although suspicion of guilt is something different from proof of guilt, it is the broad impression conveyed by the libel that has to be considered and not the meaning of each word under analysis. A man who wants to talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also a fire; but it can be done. One always gets back to the fundamental question: what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary man: you cannot make a rule about that. They can convey a meaning of suspicion short of guilt; but loose talk about suspicion can very easily convey the impression that it is a suspicion that is well founded.

[12] A mere statement that a person is under investigation, or that a person has been charged, may not be enough to impute guilt6. If, however, it is accompanied by an account of the suspicious circumstances that have aroused the interest of the authorities, and that point towards a likelihood of guilt, then the position may be otherwise. There is an overlap between providing information and entertainment, and the publishing of information coupled with a derogatory implication may fall into both categories. It may be that a bare, factual, report that a house has burned down is less entertaining than a report spiced with an account of a suspicious circumstance. At this preliminary stage of the proceedings, the respondents have not yet had an opportunity to indicate why it was considered relevant to the story about the fire to link it with the development application. For that matter, the occasion has not yet arisen for a jury to decide what meanings the article would convey. We are concerned only with the anterior question of what the article is capable of conveying.""

9The matter complained of states that the plaintiff was released on bail from prison over the ""unrelated drugs charges"" after a Mr Vereker posted a $50,000 surety. I agree that this imputes only the laying of charges. I also agree that this sentence is followed by a reference to Mr Vereker pledging ""the $50,000 surety for her"", namely the woman charged with stealing from the plaintiff, and that this is inconsistent with the statement that Mr Vereker provided a $50,000 surety for the plaintiff. 

10I agree with the submission of Mr Rasmussen that the matter complained of goes much further than merely referring to the drugs charges for which the plaintiff was in prison. The reader is told that the plaintiff ""fled to Queensland in March"" (this being a November publication) and that Mr Vereker was ""forced to ask a Supreme Court judge"" to get the money back after the plaintiff had fled. This goes well beyond an assertion that criminal charges have been laid. 

11There are references to the surety being given for ""her"" (i.e. a person other than the plaintiff) and there are references to the criminal charges laid against the woman who stole money from the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendants submits that the combination of these inconsistencies, and the principles set out in Mirror Newspapers, mean that this imputation is not capable of being conveyed.

12It is not uncommon for inconsistent or wrong identification material to appear in the matter complained. The presence of such material does not mean that the imputation cannot be conveyed: Australian Defamation Law and Practice (LexisNexis, Australia) point out at [6,035]; Hough v London Express Newspaper Ltd [1940] 2 KB 507; Abbott v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (1987) Aust Torts Reports 80-138; Hall v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2002] 1 Qd R 376; Gardener v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 10 (but cf Maxwell-Smith v Warren [2007] NSWCA 270). 

13I am satisfied that the matter complained of does not merely state that charges have been laid; the inference that the plaintiff has fled the jurisdiction and is in breach of his obligations to appear, together with the tone and presentation of the article in its entirety, go well beyond such a statement. While there are references capable of suggesting that the woman in question could have been the person for whom the surety was posted, the assertions that the plaintiff fled the jurisdiction resulting in the surety being called upon are clear.

14This imputation will go to the jury. 

Imputation (d): the plaintiff is embroiled in a seedy Court case

15The defendants' objections are:

(a)The imputation does not capture the sting but merely repeats the words of the matter complained of;

(b)""Seedy"" is a slang term, and the use of slang in imputations is impermissible;

(c)The imputation is not capable of being defamatory.

16Prior to the uniform legislation, objections of this kind were common in New South Wales. This was in part because the imputations (and not the matter complained of) formed the cause of action, which was seen as a good reason for careful drafting, and partly because to obtain tactical advantages in s 7A jury trials, where the jury had to determine issues of defamatory meaning and might more readily do so if the imputation quoted the publication. Challenges to use of the actual words are particularly likely to be brought where the words used are asserted to be slang, which is asserted to be ambiguous or of indeterminate meaning.

17In Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 Hutley JA stated (at 688) that it was ""strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words that it has used."" Gleeson CJ reiterated the correctness of Hepburn in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 148, using the imputation ""X is disgusting"" as a litmus for the degree of specificity (or lack thereof) in pleading. Hodgson JA similarly affirmed this principle in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52] - [54]. Use of the words of the matter complained of was noted to be permissible, where those words were appropriate, by McColl JA in Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213.

18Counsel for the defendants referred to Bass v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 343, where an imputation that the plaintiff was ""a shonky operator"" had been pleaded. Hunt A-JA traced the history of this word (at [5] - [6]), concluded that ""shonky operator"" meant a dishonest person, and went on to dismiss the appeal. 

19Although the Court of Appeal did not strike out this imputation on the basis that ""shonky"" was impermissible, this decision has come to be seen as a case supporting the striking out of similarly pleaded imputations where the words in the matter complained of are repeated and are asserted to be slang, on the basis that the issue of whether such an imputation could be pleaded ""only arose on appeal"" (Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 20 at [24]). 

20In Ahmed, the second case relied upon by the defendants on this point, the matter complained of described the plaintiff as ""married to a lowlife grub who...was convicted of indecent assault"" and went on to refer to the plaintiff (in the first broadcast) as ""his grub of a wife"". There were two hearings in the Defamation List in the Supreme Court in relation to the challenge to the word ""grub"". After the first challenge, Nicholas J struck out an imputation that the plaintiff ""is a grub because she is a vile person"", stating that the defendant's objections to the imputation had been ""resolved during the course of submissions and exchange between Bench and Bar"" and striking out the imputation with leave to replead. 

21The repleaded imputations which were the subject of a second ruling in Ahmed were that the plaintiff was a grub because she was married to a convicted sexual offender and because she obtained an AVO against a talkback radio caller. Simpson J struck out both imputations. While her Honour considered the use of ""grub"" in the matter complained of conveyed a defamatory meaning (at [23]), that did not mean that its meaning was clear or ambiguous. Her Honour went on to state:

""[25] It is sometimes the case that, by reason of lack of specificity in what is published by a defendant, a plaintiff is hampered in attributing a more precise meaning to the language used by the defendant than that language itself conveys. It is, after all, the language of the defendant: see, for example, Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682. However, the obligation remains upon a plaintiff to identify the defamatory meaning. It is quite possible that the language used by a publisher is so vague or unspecific as to leave open a range of meanings. In such a case, it is insufficient for a plaintiff to adopt, in the imputation, the language used by the defendant, and leave the question of its meaning to the jury, see Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425. It is, of course, possible for a plaintiff to provide alternative translations of the defendant's language; but provide at least one translation a plaintiff must.""

22In Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425, the term ""breach of trust"" was genuinely ambiguous. ""Seedy"", however, is in a different category. It connotes distasteful, unsavoury or perhaps even disgusting conduct or events and there is no secondary meaning suggested. The ""seedy"" nature of the court proceedings is illustrated in the matter complained of by a photograph of a legs in pink high heels beside a briefcase full of cash. 

23There is no need for the plaintiff to obtain a ""translation"" of ""seedy"", or to seek alternative words to encapsulate its meaning. It is, like ""shonky"", or ""disgusting"", a word for which the meaning is clear. I am unconvinced that the word is even a slang expression.

24For the same reasons that Gleeson CJ considered that the meaning of ""X is disgusting"" to be clear and not to need refinement, I consider that the meaning of ""seedy"" is not only clear but successfully encapsulates the sting of the matter complained of, including not only the words, but the heading and the photograph.

25This imputation will go to the jury. 

Imputation (e): Richard Vereker put up $50,000 bail to have the plaintiff released from prison

26I shall deal with the objection to this imputation only briefly, as counsel for the plaintiff has indicated that he proposes to amend this imputation in order to encapsulate the sting with more precision.

27Counsel for the defendants submits that the circumstances in which a person is the subject of a $50,000 surety pending a criminal hearing, cannot, without more, be capable of being defamatory.

28While the defamatory meaning of imputations should be determined against the context of the matter complained of (Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos (2001) 54 NSWLR 165), there is force in the defendants' submissions: Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison, supra. The sting the plaintiff appears to be aiming at, namely that the plaintiff fled the jurisdiction resulting in the calling up of the surety, is simply not identified.

29I have struck out this imputation but granted the plaintiff liberty to replead.

Imputation (f): the plaintiff is unfit to be a Barrister

30The defendants submit that the use of ""unfit"" is a ""rhetorical flourish"" which does not add to the sting of the imputation (Mayfield-Smith v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 419 at 420; Waterhouse v David Syme & Co Ltd [2000] NSWSC 817 at [22], with the result that this imputation does not differ in substance from (or rolls up) the other imputations pleaded: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Hodgkinson [2005] NSWCA 190.

31In Viney v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1273 Simpson J (at [24]) deplored the practice of objecting to imputations on this basis, adding that ""the time has come for defendants' counsel to bury the practice of attacking imputations pleaded by plaintiffs on the basis that they are ""rhetorical"""". Mr Dawson has also referred me to Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Hodgkinson, a decision to which Viney does not refer.

32There will clearly be cases where it is appropriate for there to be an imputation of unfitness; for example, in Ainsworth v Burden [2000] NSWSC 105, the matter complained of dealt with the issue of whether the plaintiff was a fit and proper person to hold a licence. 

33In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Hodgkinson, Hodgson JA noted at [39]:

""[39] I agree with Ms Adamson that Morris does not decide that the words ""fit"" and ""proper"" are rhetorical, and that it does not decide that anything that is rhetorical should be struck out. Rather, the circumstance that an imputation or words in it are rhetorical may suggest that the imputation is expressed with insufficient precision or does not differ in substance from other imputations. I also accept, as suggested by Ainsworth, that the expression ""not ... fit and proper"" may in some contexts be sufficiently specific and precise. However, in my opinion Hansen can no longer be regarded as supporting a general proposition that less precision and specificity is required for contextual imputations than for plaintiff's imputations, particularly having regard to the subsequent introduction of the s 7A procedure and its implications. The considerations of practical justice referred to in Drummoyne are applicable in each type of case. I think that this case can be distinguished from Ainsworth because in that case, the question of fitness and propriety of the plaintiff in relation to licences for poker machines was the very subject of the defendant's publication, and involved qualities of character that were quite readily identifiable; and because the factors pointing to unfairness in this case were not present in Ainsworth.""

34Conformably with this reasoning, I have struck out this imputation. I have granted leave to replead, as it would appear that the imputation the plaintiff was seeking to convey relates to whether his conduct contravenes his responsibilities as a member of the legal profession. If so, that imputation should be pleaded with some degree of specificity.

Concluding remarks

35This matter was sent to me from the General List, after another judge of this court disqualified himself from hearing the argument. As the plaintiff is anxious to obtain a hearing date, and the defence is limited to offer of amends, I have made orders for the proposed amendments to be listed before me next Friday so that any further objections can be dealt with on that day, and the matter then returned to the Defamation List.

36I have made an order for costs in favour of the defendants. The defendants were successful in relation to two of the four issues for argument. In addition, the defendants had to argue the case before me today without the benefit of knowing what the plaintiff's submissions would be, as the plaintiff totally failed to comply with a timetable for his submissions to be provided by 25 January. Failure to comply with timetables for submissions in defamation arguments inconveniences not only the other parties, but also the court, and costs penalties should follow in such circumstances.

Orders

(1)Grant leave to the plaintiff to strike in as paragraph 12 of the matter complained of the photograph appearing opposite paragraphs 3 to 5 of the matter complained of.

(2)Imputations (b) and (d) will go to the jury.

(3)Imputations (e) and (f) struck out with leave to replead.

(4)Direct the plaintiff to provide a draft Amended Statement of Claim by 5:00pm Tuesday 5 February 2013.

(5)Matter listed for directions or argument before Gibson DCJ on Friday 8 February 2013 at 9:00am in order to enable a hearing date to be allocated as soon as the pleadings timetable is completed.

(6)Defendants to notify the plaintiff of any objections by 4:00pm Thursday 7 February 2013.

(7)Plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of today.

2760864,Waters v Commonwealth of Australia [2013] NSWCA 5,"Judgment
1McCOLL JA:  I agree with Basten JA.
2BASTEN JA:  In 2010 the applicant commenced proceedings against the Commonwealth seeking damages for psychological or psychiatric conditions which arose in the course of her employment.  The Commonwealth contended that she was bringing an action for damages for an injury sustained by her in the course of her employment for the purposes of s 44 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (""the Compensation Act"").  That section extinguishes any such cause of action contingently upon the operation of s 45: Austral Pacific Group Ltd (In liq) v Air Services Australia [2000] HCA 39; 203 CLR 136 at [21]-[22] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ) and [67] (McHugh J) and [80] (Callinan J).
3Section 45 permits the bar to be lifted where the claimant elects to bring an action for damages, rather than receive statutory compensation.  However, a precondition to the application of s 45 is that compensation ""is payable"" in respect of the injury under one of ss 24, 25 or 27.  Each of those sections is contingent upon the employee suffering a ""permanent impairment as a result of"" the injury.  Unless that condition is satisfied no election can be made and the extinguishment of the cause of action continues to operate: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Flynn [2002] NSWCA 315; 55 NSWLR 303 at [42]-[44] (Beazley JA) and [48] (Hodgson JA).  Where the preconditions to the operation of s 45 are satisfied, the employee is required, before any amount of compensation is paid to her pursuant to any of those sections, to ""elect in writing"" to institute an action against the Commonwealth for non-economic loss.  She has not taken that step.  Accordingly, the Commonwealth contended, the cause of action remains barred.
4These arguments were accepted by Barr AJ in the Common Law Division and the applicant's second further amended statement of claim was struck out with no opportunity to replead: Waters v Commonwealth of Australia [2012] NSWSC 790.  The applicant sought leave to appeal from that judgment.  For the reasons given below, the application must be dismissed with costs.
Case presented below5The applicant, Natalie Elizabeth Waters, commenced employment with the Commonwealth in the Australian Taxation Office in February 2000.  Her employment terminated on 22 November 2004.  By the time her employment terminated, she claimed she was suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder.  The medical evidence available to this Court indicated that, at least in part, her health problems, which included an immunodeficiency, existed prior to the conduct of her employer relied upon as the basis of the claim, which conduct occurred between 15 July 2004 and 22 November 2004.
6On 24 October 2011 the Commonwealth filed a notice of motion seeking to have the claims dismissed pursuant to r 13.4 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).  In the alternative, it sought that the further amended statement of claim (which had been filed on 31 August 2011) be struck out, pursuant to r 14.28.  The primary ground on which the Commonwealth relied for seeking dismissal of the claim was that any cause of action had been extinguished by s 44 of the Compensation Act and that there had been no election under s 45.  In the alternative, the Commonwealth relied upon the continued inadequacies of the pleading, the difficulties faced by the applicant in obtaining and retaining legal representation and the unlikelihood that any further indulgence would result in the formulation of a proper pleading.
7The trial judge concluded that the cause of action had been extinguished: at [36].  He also accepted the alternative argument that the pleading should be struck out, without leave to file a further amended document.
Issues raised on application8The applicant obtained legal representation in or about October 2012 and briefed counsel to appear on the application for leave to appeal.  On the evening before the hearing of the application, a document entitled ""revised proposed third further amended statement of claim"" was provided to the respondent and to the Court.  Submissions made on her behalf identified a number of errors in the judgment of the primary judge.  Only one of these, however, is even potentially material.
9First, the applicant noted that the primary judge had identified the period of employment as extending from 8 February 2000 until 24 November 2006, at [2].  The latter date was wrong, but the correct date (22 November 2004) was noted in the following paragraph.  Nothing turned on the misstatement at [2].  Secondly, there was said to be a factual error at [36] which, being a focus of challenge to the judgment below, may be set out in full:
""It seems to me that as they apply to the present case ss 44 and 45 are clear in their meaning.  The plaintiff had a choice whether to seek benefits under the Act scheme or to proceed outside the Act.  Before taking the latter course she had to elect.  She has not elected.  On the contrary, she has claimed and has already received benefits under the Act.  I conclude that in so far as her claim is for non-economic loss, therefore, her cause of action has been extinguished by s 44.""
10The applicant challenged the statement that she had claimed and received benefits under the Compensation Act: she asserted there was no evidence before the primary judge upon which to base such a statement.  However, assuming the statement to be erroneous, the error is immaterial, for reasons which will shortly appear.
11The third, and potentially significant error, which appears to have resulted from the applicant's submissions when appearing for herself at the hearing of the motion, involved reference to the definition of ""injury"" in s 5A of the Compensation Act, being a provision which was not introduced until 2007, well after the applicant's employment had terminated.  In order to assess this challenge it is necessary to set out the critical statutory provisions.
12The operative provisions in the Compensation Act, as in force on 1 November 2004, relevantly provided:
""44 Action for damages not to lie against Commonwealth etc in certain cases
(1) Subject to section 45, an action or other proceeding for damages does not lie against the Commonwealth ... in respect of: 
(a) an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment, being an injury in respect of which the Commonwealth ... would, but for this subsection, be liable (whether vicariously or otherwise) for damages ....
45 Actions for damages - election by employees
(1) Where: 
(a) compensation is payable under section 24, 25 or 27 in respect of an injury to an employee; and 
(b) the Commonwealth ... would, but for subsection 44(1), be liable for damages for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee as a result of the injury; 
the employee may, at any time before an amount of compensation is paid to the employee under section 24, 25 or 27 in respect of that injury, elect in writing to institute an action or proceeding against the Commonwealth ... for damages for that non-economic loss.
(2) Where an employee makes an election: 
(a) subsection 44(1) does not apply in relation to an action or other proceeding subsequently instituted by the employee against the Commonwealth ... for damages for the non-economic loss to which the election relates ....""
13If s 44(1) applied to the claims made by the applicant, the relevant causes of action were extinguished.  That was not only because she had not made an election pursuant to s 45 before commencing the proceedings, but because no such election was available to her.  An election is only available where compensation is payable under at least one of ss 24, 25 or 27.  Each of those sections has operation in respect of injuries resulting in ""permanent impairment"".  The applicant disclaimed any entitlement to compensation based on permanent impairment.  Accordingly, the right of election under s 45(1) was not available to her.  That is why the question of whether she had been paid compensation was immaterial.
14Recognising this difficulty, the applicant sought to avoid the conclusion that she had no cause of action by submitting that s 44(1) did not apply to her claims.  The submission commenced with the correct proposition that s 44 only applied with respect to proceedings for damages ""in respect of ... an injury"".  That invited attention to the definition of injury in s 4 of the Compensation Act which, in November 2004, stated:
""4 Interpretation
(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:...
injury means:
(a) a disease suffered by an employee; or
(b) an injury (other than a disease) suffered by an employee, being a physical or mental injury arising out of, or in the course of, the employee's employment; or
(c) an aggravation of a physical or mental injury (other than a disease) suffered by an employee (whether or not that injury arose out of, or in the course of, the employee's employment, being an aggravation that arose out of, or in the course of, that employment;
but does not include any such disease, injury or aggravation suffered by an employee as a result of reasonable disciplinary action taken against the employee or failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with his or her employment.""
15The applicant asserted that the injury or aggravation suffered by her was as a result of ""reasonable disciplinary action"" and thus fell outside the concept of ""injury"" in the Compensation Act and thus outside the bar on proceedings imposed by s 44(1).  It will be necessary to assess whether that argument has any reasonable prospect of success.  However, it is necessary first to note the further assertion that the critical qualification to the definition of injury, as found in s 4, differed in material respects from the definition in s 5A on which the primary judge had erroneously relied.  Thus, the words of exclusion found at the end of the definition in s 5A(1), following the amendment in 2007, read:
""but does not include a disease, injury or aggravation suffered as a result of reasonable administrative action taken in a reasonable manner in respect of the employee's employment.""
16The concept of ""reasonable administrative action"" was then the subject of a further explanatory provision in s 5A(2) which stated:
""(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) and without limiting that subsection, reasonable administrative action is taken to include the following: 
(a) a reasonable appraisal of the employee's performance; 
(b) a reasonable counselling action (whether formal or informal) taken in respect of the employee's employment; 
(c) a reasonable suspension action in respect of the employee's employment; 
(d) a reasonable disciplinary action (whether formal or informal) taken in respect of the employee's employment; 
(e) anything reasonable done in connection with an action mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d); 
(f) anything reasonable done in connection with the employee's failure to obtain a promotion, reclassification, transfer or benefit, or to retain a benefit, in connection with his or her employment.""
17The applicant submitted that the change was significant for her case.  As appeared from the proposed revised pleading provided to the Court, she accepted that on or about 1 October 2003, ""there occurred or apparently occurred the occasion for reasonable disciplinary action"": paragraph 8.  She then pleaded that thereafter action was taken by the respondent, ""but the said action was not taken in a reasonable manner"": paragraph 9.  The thrust of the submission was that, until 2007, the exclusion covered all reasonable disciplinary action, whether taken in a reasonable manner or not.  Her claim was therefore within the exception to the definition of ""injury"".  Further, she alleged that her injury resulted from the failure to obtain a transfer or benefit, being a matter also excluded from the definition of ""injury"" in s 4.  The different structure resulting from the amendments in 2007 may well, the applicant submitted, have explained why the primary judge failed to accept her submissions that, in 2004, her claim fell outside the scope of an ""injury"".
18It would be unproductive to consider how this issue was dealt with below.  It is clear from the judgment that it was the applicant (appearing in person) who sought to rely upon the language of s 5A.  It was the primary judge who noted that it had been inserted later by an amending Act: at [32].  His Honour also referred to a contemporaneous regulatory impact statement which adopted the same language as the definition in s 4.  He then expressed difficulty in understanding how the applicant framed her claim, commenting that he did not ""understand it to include compensation for the consequences of legitimate management action"": at [33].  As the applicant no longer seeks to rely upon the pleading before the primary judge, it is not fruitful to examine its detail here.
19The applicant's submissions in respect of this issue have the flavour of casuistry.  First, what is excluded is ""reasonable disciplinary action"", not a precondition for taking reasonable disciplinary action.  If the action is undertaken in an unreasonable manner it would not constitute ""reasonable disciplinary action"" under s 4.  Even if the first steps taken were reasonable, it will have ceased to be reasonable whenever it involved conduct of the kind alleged by the applicant, namely abuse, harassment and bullying.  This conclusion does not rely upon any change in the wording following the insertion of s 5A.
20Further, and more fundamentally, the submission ignores the structure of the Compensation Act.  In common with workers' compensation legislation in comparable jurisdictions, statutory compensation is payable under the Compensation Act in respect of any injury arising out of or in the course of employment, without the need to prove fault on the part of the employer.  The effect of s 44(1) is to impose a bar on civil damages claims in respect of such injuries as are compensable under the statutory scheme.  The bar does not, consistently with that policy, operate in respect of any loss or damage suffered at the hands of the employer, which is not compensable under the statutory scheme.  However, it is highly implausible that either negligence or deliberate tortious conduct suffered in the course of employment will not give rise to compensation.  Reasonable disciplinary action may fall outside the statutory scheme, but it is quite implausible that it would give rise to a claim in tort, if for no other reason than that it is, ex hypothesi, ""reasonable"".  The sort of conduct complained of in the pleading, which may plausibly aggravate a mental condition, was described as harassment, bullying, taunting, abusive conduct and so on.  However, the applicant has no reasonable prospect of establishing that such conduct is not covered by the statutory scheme for compensation.  Such a proposition would be inconsistent with well understood principles as to the availability of workers compensation.
21The applicant sought to escape the logic of this conclusion in two ways.  First, she submitted that her complaint was not that she had been bullied by her superior, but that the Commonwealth had failed to transfer her away from the person responsible for the bullying and her failure to obtain a transfer fell within the terms of the exclusion.
22That submission cannot be accepted: if it were correct, it would mean that the Commonwealth, as employer, would not be liable to pay compensation in respect of either deliberate bullying or an unsafe work environment in circumstances where the employee had sought a transfer or that other steps be taken to avoid the harassment or the safety risk.  Even if the refusal to take such steps had been entirely reasonable, if the risk or injury materialised, compensation would be payable.  The Commonwealth could not be heard to say, 'your injury resulted not from the bullying but from our failure to transfer you away from the bully, which is conduct covered by the exemption'.
23The second and final manner in which the applicant sought to avoid the operation of s 44(1) was to assert that her claim was for breach of the contract of employment and not for damages for personal injury.  This argument, too, must be rejected.
24Section 44(1) in its terms is not limited to causes of action in tort or for breach of statutory duty, as distinguished from breach of contract.  It precludes actions or other proceedings for damages ""in respect of ... an injury"".  The applicant's contention in this respect not only lacks support in the statutory language, but would undermine the apparent purpose noted above, namely to exclude actions or proceedings for damages for injury coextensively with the scope of the statutory scheme for payment of compensation.  The argument based on the existence of a cause of action for breach of contract (in contrast to the earlier argument) does not rely upon an absence of entitlement to compensation but rather ignores the consequence of its existence, namely that a claim for damages is to be available in circumstances where statutory compensation is also available.  Acceptance of the submission would fundamentally undermine the clear legislative purpose of s 44(1).
Conclusions25The critical question was whether any possible claim for damages the applicant had in respect of the conduct of officers in the employ of the Commonwealth, which caused a physical or mental injury or an aggravation of a physical or mental injury, had been extinguished by s 44(1) of the Compensation Act.
26Whether the primary judge in fact mistook the relevant definition of ""injury"" is unclear: as his reasons reveal, he addressed the submissions made by the applicant which relied upon s 5A whilst noting that it was introduced by a later amendment.  Further, as that reasoning also revealed, the submissions put to this Court based on the definition of ""injury"" in s 4, as in force in 2004, were not raised in the Court below.  Because they were not raised, it has been necessary to consider them in greater detail than would usually be called for on a leave application.  However, that analysis reveals that, as issues of law, they enjoy no prospects of success.
27The conclusion reached by the primary judge at [36], as set out at [9] above, erred in favour of the applicant by assuming that an election under s 45 may have been available to her, when it was not.  However, none of that casts any doubt upon the conclusion of the primary judge that any cause of action she may have had in respect of the injuries complained of was extinguished by s 44(1).
28In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to comment further on the state of the pleadings as they arose in the Court below, nor on the proposed revised pleading proffered in this Court.
29The primary judge ordered that the second further amended statement of claim be struck out and that the applicant pay the respondent's costs.  Because there was no leave to replead, that constituted a dismissal of the proceedings.  Those orders were appropriate: no question of repleading could arise once it was accepted that the applicant's potential causes of action had been extinguished.
30The appropriate orders in this Court are:
(1) Dismiss the application for leave to appeal from the judgment and orders in the Common Law Division.

		06 February 2013",2013-02-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2760868,R v Falk-Meyn [2013] NSWDC 35,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Many offences of attempted murder result in no actual physical harm, guns do not go off or bullets miss, but this is not such a case. The offender shot Maxwell Barrett with the intention of killing him. He did not succeed in killing Mr Barrett but Mr Barrett's physical injuries are such that he has been significantly harmed by what Mr Falk did to him. All offences of attempted murder involve an offender wanting to kill another person but this is more serious than those where no injury is caused simply because a high level of injury has resulted.

2Let me explain how the offences that I am dealing with came about. The offender is twenty-four. He has a sister who is two years younger than him. A man by the name of Maxwell Barrett was for some years in a relationship with Mr Falk's grandmother. When Mr Falk was about twelve he told members of his family that his sister had complained to him that Mr Barrett had spoken to her in a sexually explicit manner and dealt with her sexually. Not surprisingly, there was a bit of a discussion involving the various members of the family. As a result the relationship between Mr Barrett and the offender's grandmother ceased, Mr Barrett being told of the allegations that had been made against him.

3It is not for me to make a finding about Mr Barrett's conduct. It is not for me to decide whether he did deal sexually with the offender's sister and speak to her in a sexually explicit manner. All I need to find, and I do, is that it appears that the offender did believe that Mr Barrett had done those things.

4After the relationship ceased, Mr Barrett was subject to various forms of abuse by members of Mr Falk's family, and clearly over the years Mr Falk has harboured animosity towards Mr Barrett. He has been a bit of a focus of the offender's anger from time to time over the years.

5The offender was released from custody having served a sentence for armed robbery on 25 July 2011. I will note now that he was released without supervision because he was released at the expiry of his total term. Not too long after his release from custody he said something on Facebook to which his sister took exception. She and Mr Falk exchanged disharmonious messages resulting in the offender's sister comparing the way he was treating her with the way that Mr Barrett had treated her some years before. She said, amongst other things, ""You're no better than Max because he treated me the way you speak about women, that's why I'm so upset by what you wrote"".

6It appears that this led to the offender's resentment heating up. There were threats made to him on Facebook perhaps related to what I just referred to and the offender obtained a shotgun and ammunition, he says in order to defend himself because of the threats that were being made against him, but he also determined that he would use that shotgun to kill Mr Barrett.

7In the period leading up to his attempt to do so, he made some enquiries about where Mr Barrett was living. At 10.30pm on 23 November 2011, the offender sent a text message to his friend, Matthew Mason, saying he was going to kill Mr Barrett. He sent a message to his sister about an hour later expressing his love for her. She asked him not to do anything silly and the offender said that he would not. He then went to Mr Barrett's home. He had the shotgun and three rounds of ammunition. The ammunition took different forms, one was a solid slug and the other contained smaller pieces of shot. The offender deliberately chose ammunition of the latter type to put in the chamber of the shotgun because he thought it was more likely to kill Mr Barrett.

8He waited outside and made efforts to draw Mr Barrett out of his home. He did this by throwing a Besser block through the window of Mr Barrett's motor vehicle. He was hoping that Mr Barrett would open the door to his home so he could be shot. Mr Barrett didn't hear what happened but his neighbour did. She came out, asked what was going on, became concerned of course and went in to ring triple-0. Because the offender had not succeeded in getting Mr Barrett to come outside by breaking the window of his car, he took more direct action. He started throwing bricks at the windows of the house. He had to throw four bricks before Mr Barrett, alerted by the noise of breaking glass, came to his front door. He opened his wooden door and pushed the screen door open, stepping onto his front verandah. As he stepped from the doorway the offender raised the shotgun and discharged it. Photographs were tendered showing that the shot had passed through the screen door. Mr Barrett was struck.

9The offender jettisoned the fired cartridge and reloaded the gun and then made his way to Mr Mason's home. He then hid under the house. He rang his sister and said, ""I just shot Max, I just shot and killed him"". When asked, ""Why?"" He said, ""Because I hate him"". The offender contacted others indicating that he had shot and killed Mr Barrett. Eventually the offender was discovered hiding under the house and after some time, during which the offender threatened self harm, he was persuaded to come out where he was arrested.

10The offender eventually spoke to police in an electronically recorded interview and told police what he had done. He admitted he had gone to Mr Barrett's home with the intention of killing him and told police he was quite surprised that Mr Barrett had not died. He explained that his motivation was his hatred of Mr Barrett.

11As might be imagined when you get shot with a shotgun at close range significant damage is caused. Mr Barrett was taken to hospital and operated on. Unfortunately what affects him most these days is an unhappy consequence of being shot and the surgical procedures which followed. He suffered a stroke which has severely impaired his ability to move, communicate, and think, such that he has gone from living independently to living in a high level, residential aged care facility requiring maximal assistance. The impact upon Mr Barrett has been enormous.

12The offender was charged with two offences, one of shooting with intent to murder and another one of possessing a prohibited weapon, namely the shortened shotgun. When I sentence him for the second of those two matters he ask that I take into account two matters on a Form 1, one offence of possessing ammunition without a permit and the other one of not keeping the firearm safely. Whilst there is a considerable degree of overlap between the two offences on the indictment, possessing a prohibited weapon and using it to shoot someone with intent to kill them, there is still a need for a level of accumulation given the separate aspects of criminality to which the offences relate.

13Mr Falk's background is troubling. His mother gave evidence on the last occasion setting out the difficulties that the offender's behaviour had caused from a very young age. She explained the history of his schooling and what she and her family had had to put up with over the years. She appears to have made superhuman efforts to assist the offender as he was growing up but these have all, as these offence demonstrate, been largely in vain.

14The offender's behaviour has been disturbing for many years. There is nothing really in his background which would explain why that would be so. Although his parents separated when he was relatively young, there is no suggestion that that had any significant impact on Mr Falk's behaviour. Instead it appears to be something within Mr Falk that has caused him to act in inappropriate, violent and aggressive ways for almost all of his life.

15Two reports have been tendered today to assist me in understanding what it is which has troubled the offender over the years and to assist me in deciding the offender's moral culpability amongst other matters. Dr Adams who has seen Mr Falk on a number of occasions has reviewed him extensively and looked at a number of other documents which set out investigations into the offender's psychiatric state by other experts. He says that the offender's 

""clinical presentation can best be understood in terms of his underlying borderline (emotionally unstable and impulsive) and antisocial personality structure in keeping with a personality disorder that developed in the context of his disrupted early childhood.""

16Some things have not helped. The offender has been using drugs in the past which not surprisingly has deleteriously impacted upon his mental state over the years. The offender has had significant mood changes and associated features of depression. He speaks about symptoms consistent with psychosis although there is no evidence to suggest, according to Dr Adams, that he suffers from an underlying psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. What is clear is that Mr Falk's unhappy mental state is very long standing and there is no guarantee that it will improve any time soon. That is not to say of course that there has not been some improvement. I mentioned that Dr Adams has seen Mr Falk on a number of occasions. When one contrasts how he appeared to Dr Adams as he described in a report dated 4 April 2012, to his description in Dr Adams' later report dated 31 January 2013, there is a glimmer of hope. Mr Falk is, in custody, complying with his medication regime and appears to have been assisted by conversations with older and perhaps wiser inmates as to what life inside is really like. Dr Adams says, and the Crown does not challenge, that these offences were committed at a time when the offender was not complying with his psychiatric medication and was using increasing levels of illicit substances. On top of that, the threats that he was getting over Facebook, added to his increasing levels of distress and fear for his own safety. Dr Adams says:

""In my opinion it is reasonable to conclude that his decision making capacity and consequential thinking would have been impaired as a result.""

17This is an important matter in assessing the moral culpability of the offender when, after some planning, he went that night to kill Mr Barrett. Had the offender's mental state not been as Dr Adams describes it, his moral culpability would have been even higher.

18Of course, as Mr Weightman who appears for the offender accepts, it does not automatically flow that mere presence of a mental illness should necessarily result in a shorter sentence. There are considerations which work both ways. Although for example, the offender's moral culpability might be lower than what otherwise be the case and the offender's time in custody might be harder than were he not suffering from a mental illness, the very nature of his mental illness suggests that there is an increased risk of future offending. I spoke before about some changes that had come about in the offender in more recent times as he has complied with medication, abstained from illicit substance use and been reviewed by mental health clinicians whilst in custody, but it has to be said that the offender's prognosis is still very much guarded.

19The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to these matters and so the sentence I impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. The attempted murder charge, is of course a very serious one. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years with a standard non-parole period of ten years. The firearm's offence carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years with a standard non-parole period of three years. I have taken the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods into account in determining the sentences to impose upon Mr Falk. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in either case are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

20I noted before that the offender was released from custody shortly before he committed these offences without being supervised by the parole authorities. I, of course, mean no criticism of them, Mr Falk's behaviour was such that the authorities had no other choice but that does not mean though that I should not make a finding of special circumstances in Mr Falk's favour. His failure to take advantage of opportunities offered to him whilst in custody on the last occasion does not necessarily mean that he will not take advantage of them on the next occasion. It is clearly the case that substantial efforts need to be made in Mr Falk's case if he is to be assisted to avoid future criminal behaviour. As events have shown he is capable of causing great harm and if upon his release from custody (and released from custody he must be at some stage), he commits a further offence involving more harm, then those individuals and the community in general, will suffer greatly.

21Depending on how the offender goes over the years that he must necessarily serve in custody, it may be that the parole authorities consider it appropriate to release him at the end of his non-parole period, if they do then an extended period of supervision on parole will assist Mr Falk to avoid further offending and that will in turn have beneficial effects for the community. However, given the length of the sentence which I must necessarily impose and given the length of the non-parole period which results from an application of the statutory ratio, there will necessarily be a fairly modest reduction in the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence. And on top of everything I have said it must be remembered that one of the fundamental rules in sentencing is that a non-parole period imposed upon an offender must bear a reasonable relationship with the objective gravity of what the offender did. As I have tried to make clear, in the offender's case, the objective gravity of his conduct was significant indeed.

22Taking into account the Form 1 matters, for count 2 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of four years to date from 24 November 2011. On count 1 on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eight years and a head sentence of twelve years to date from 24 November 2012. There will thus be an overall sentence consisting of a non-parole period of nine years, the period of eligibility for parole of four years, making a total sentence of thirteen years.

23The earliest date on which the offender can be released is 23 November 2020.

		10 April 2013",2013-02-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760886,Fairfield City Council v Quality Handling Systems Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLC 7,"Judgment

1 The defendant Quality Handling Systems Pty Ltd pleaded guilty to one charge of permit and/or cause pollution of waters pursuant to section 120 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. The date of the offence was 26 April 2012. The prosecution was brought by Fairfield City Council.

2An offence under section 120 carries a maximum monetary penalty of $1,000,000 pursuant to section 123 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act. The maximum monetary penalty that can be imposed in the Local Court is $110,000 pursuant to section 215. The principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 apply in that the jurisdictional maximum is not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction.

3Section 215 was most recently amended by the Protection of the Environment Legislation Amendment Act 2011, which was assented to on 16 November 2011. The relevant schedule (Sch 2 [14]) commenced on 6 February 2012. Prior to this amendment the maximum fine under section 215 was 200 penalty units ($22,000).

4The defendant pleaded guilty on 19 December 2012, which was the second time the matter was before the Local Court. I am satisfied that the plea was entered into at the earliest opportunity and there was utilitarian benefit in the plea. I allow a 25% discount for the entry of the plea of guilty: R v Thompson: R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.

Facts

5The Facts were tendered. In summary, they state that employees of Fairfield City Council carried out an inspection of an address in Wetherill Park after receiving a complaint from a member of the community that washing activities had been conducted in the external area of the business premises.

6The Council officers observed a large quantity of pooled water on the unsealed ground of the adjoining premises at Wetherill Park, a high pressure gurney close to an open factory doorway with a hose from the gurney connected to a tap just outside the factory building. There were numerous stainless steel items raised off the ground on pallets and wet ground around them. There was a stormwater drain located underneath one of the stainless steel items and water in the drain even though it had not rained for 2 days. The officers spoke with the Workshop Manager and the Operations Manager of Quality Handling Systems Pty Ltd at the address and they said that cleaning of stainless steel products had been undertaken in the external area of the premises for the last 18 months or so.

7The stainless steel products have a gel applied to remove welding marks before being washed off with a gurney. The gel was a product called ""Wurex PP 14 Stainless Steel Pickling Paste"". Information about this product states that it is hazardous and dangerous. It contains nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid and should not be discharged into sewers or waterways, and that action by any means should be taken to prevent spillage of the products entering drains or watercourses.

8The Court had tendered to it as Exhibit 'G', the Material Safety Data Sheet for Wurex PP14 Stainless Steel Pickling Paste, which was 18 pages in length and contained a great deal of detailed information about hazards identification, first aid measures, accidental release measures for minor and major spills handling and storage and toxicological information. More specifically, section 2 says it is very toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. It causes severe burns and there is risk of serious damage to eyes. Section 3 says the Pickling Paste's composition is; nitric acid 25-30% and hydrofluoric acid 5-10%. Section 13 on disposal considerations includes the following information, ""DO NOT allow wash water from cleaning or process equipment to enter drains...in all cases disposal to sewer may be subject to local laws and regulations and these should be considered first."" 

9Fairfield City Council issued Prevention Notices which provided for extensions of time for compliance with preventative actions.

10Subsequently, Mr Derek Meachan a director of the Company, was interviewed on 28 June 2012. Mr Meachan confirmed that washing pickling paste off the stainless steel equipment had been occurring for approximately 18 months and that management knew this activity was being conducted in external areas of the premises and no instructions had been given to staff in relation to how the activity should be undertaken. He said that some of the washing waters would have washed onto the neighbouring soil at the adjoining premises and some down the stormwater drain. Mr Meachan also said that neutralising spray should have been applied before washing the pickling paste off the stainless steel.

11In addition to the Statement of Facts, the Court had a number of other documents tendered, which gave further details of the circumstances surrounding the offence. A Statement from Judith Stones, a senior environmental officer with Fairfield City Council, said that whilst carrying out the initial inspection she had a conversation with Mr Roger Pierce, the Operations Manager. During the conversation and after conceding they had been cleaning the stainless steel with the passivating gel (or acid), the following was said:
Judith Stones: ""Where have you been doing the cleaning?"" 
Roger Pierce: ""Out there in the corner on the concrete outside the building [referring to the eastern boundary of the subject premises]. We have a bath where we do all the small stuff; it's just the big stuff we have a problem with.""
Judith Stones: ""How long have you been doing this washing process?"" 
Roger Pierce: ""Two years. Before we could handle it but now we have such demand. We've got a tank to do a wash bay but we've been falling behind so we haven't done it....""
Later on this conversation occurs:
Trevor Wintle [another Senior Environmental Health Officer with Fairfield City Council]: ""Have you ever done anything to neutralise it [the washing off the pickling paste or acid from the stainless steel - my insertion] after you've done it?""
Roger Pierce: ""Well that's what the water's for.""

12Shortly after the abovementioned exchange between Mr Wintle and Mr Pierce, Mr Wintle realised that he had come into contact with the pickling paste and was experiencing an acid burn. Ms Stones and Mr Wintle then immediately attended the Emergency Department at Fairfield Hospital, following advice from Poisons Information.

13Ms Stones also saw the label on the product called ""Wurex PP14 Stainless Steel Pickling Paste"" and on this label it had, ""Dangerous Goods Classification 6 (toxic) and Class 8 (corrosives)"".

14Ms Stones' statement goes on to state that the pickling paste washed off the stainless steel items using water enters a nearby stormwater drain, which drains to Council's stormwater drainage system, which drains into Prospect Creek. My own further investigation shows that Prospect Creek drains into Chipping Norton Lake and then into the Georges River. 

15Her statement also says that it is believed that discharging matter into the stormwater system with such a low pH level (even though diluted by water) has the potential to alter the pH of the aquatic ecosystem into which it will drain, namely Prospect Creek. In regard to the nitric acid, it is associated with oxides of nitrogen and can contribute to acid rain and also the formation of photochemical smog. As to the hydrofluoric acid, there are two chronic toxic effects associated with fluoride - dental and skeletal fluorosis. It is understood that fluoride can be toxic to aquatic life and also have harmful effects on plant life.

16At the time of investigation, there was an inadequate quantity of water remaining in the stormwater drain which could be analysed. It was not possible to clearly demonstrate the specific impacts of the washing activity upon Prospect Creek. However in considering that the washing activity had occurred during a period of 18 months it is considered likely that the discharge of potentially acid waters into Prospect Creek could have impacted upon the environmental values for the ecosystem in terms of pH levels, levels of oxides of nitrogen and levels of fluoride.

Defendant's Explanation for the Offence and Subjective Circumstances 

17Quality Handling Systems Pty Ltd specialises in the design and manufacture of Mechanical Sampling Systems. These systems are supplied for collecting representative samples from streams of bulk materials and slurries. Materials sampled include coal, mineral ores, processed minerals, aggregates, concentrates, fertiliser, mineral sands, process by-products, limestone, cement, grains and woodchips. The company has been operating for 20 years and at the time of the incident had 55 employees and operated at 4 sites. It has a gross turnover of $11.6 million, and a net turnover of $6.7 million. It has never been previously prosecuted for an offence of this type.

18Mr Salama, on behalf of the company, submitted that they offered no excuse. They co-operated with the investigation of the incident. He further asked the court to take into account the positive steps the company has taken to rectify the situation. The company has had the wash bay repaired, and applied to Sydney Water for a licence/permission to have a waste storage facility present which captures the water. They have spent: 
- $25,000 rectifying the wash bay 
- $10,000 on reports
- $10,000 for retaining a business analyst
- $4,000 (so far) paid to Sydney Water in relation to a waste/storage facility.

19Whilst the Court acknowledges the amount spent in rectifying the wash bay and on the other matters, it also notes that this work was only carried out after the Council discovered the offending behaviour, and the repair of the wash bay should have been carried out much earlier.

Matters of General Principle 

20Section 241 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, contains a number of matters to be considered on the question of imposing penalty. These matters include: the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment; practical measures that may be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm; the extent to which the person committing the offence could reasonably foresee harm caused or likely to be caused by the offence; the control that person has over the causes; whether the person was complying with orders from their employer; and any other matter considered relevant.

21The Prosecutor tendered 4 cases which it submitted were of relevance in determining the appropriate sentence in this case. The first case in date order is Wollondilly Shire Council v Brogan Box Pty Ltd, an unreported judgment of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales dated 28 March 2002. Bignold J imposed a fine of $12,500 for paint from the Defendant's premises getting into the stormwater grate. At paragraph [15] Bignold J quotes Sheahan J in Environment Protection Authority v Transfield Pty Ltd [2001] NSWLEC 45 stating, ""While this is indeed a relatively minor breach of the law it should attract a monetary penalty as industry must be vigilant to meet the community's expectations and aspirations for the environment."" Bignold J went on to evaluate the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective culpability as at the very low end of the spectrum of overall gravity.

22In Environment Protection Authority v Straits (Hillgrove) Gold Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 114, a fine of $50,000 was imposed for a gold antimony miner carelessly allowing slime containing high levels of antimony, arsenic and lead amongst other minerals to escape to a distance of 300 metres. The defendant cleaned up the slime and the offence was considered to be of low to medium gravity. In Environment Protection Authority v Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 65, discharge of sediment laden water into Bora Creek, was assessed as medium to mid range objective gravity and the Court imposed a fine of $105,000. In Environment Protection Authority v Moolarben Coal Operation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2012] NSWLEC 80, for discharge of sediment laden waters, a fine of $112,500 was imposed.

Remarks and Conclusion 

23In the Court's view, general deterrence is extremely important in a case of this type. The Court was advised by the solicitor for the Council, that there are 3000 businesses in the area, and the Council regularly receives complaints of substances/smells/odours in Prospect Creek. These complaints are difficult to trace back to source. Therefore, when a large company is found to have committed what the Court considers a very serious breach of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act, the community would expect heavy penalties to be considered. The Court also notes that the maximum penalty which could be imposed in the Local Court for an offence such as this, was recently increased by a factor of 5. 

24The Court is unable to precisely determine the extent of harm to the environment, but notes that there were admissions by persons from the company that the washing of the pickling paste into the stormwater drain had been occurring for either 18 months or 2 years. So there was considerable potential for harm to the environment.

25The Court finds that the defendant had taken no practical measures to prevent, control, abate or mitigate the potential harm to the environment from the washing of the pickling paste into the stormwater system. Although it accepts that after discovery of the offence by Fairfield City Council, Quality Handling Systems took action to prevent any further harm occurring. The Court gives credit to the defendant for the money spent to rectify the wash bay and obtain reports.

26The Court further finds that the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that harm was likely to be caused by the discharge of pickling paste into the stormwater drain. There was ample information available to the defendant as to the toxic and corrosive properties of the pickling paste and the clear directions not to discharge the pickling paste into drains. Notwithstanding this clear advice, the company simply washed the pickling paste into the stormwater drain for a period of either 18 months or 2 years. It was a flagrant breach of the environmental laws.

27After taking into account all the material submitted by Fairfield City Council, the submissions of the prosecution and the defendant, the early plea of guilty and all the other matters referred to earlier, the Court comes to the conclusion that a fine of $75,000 is the appropriate penalty in this case.

28The Court notes that there has already been agreement between the parties for the defendant to pay the costs of the prosecution in the sum of $5,000 payable within 7 days. The defendant is to pay court costs of $83.00.

2760889,"Application of Con Bodiotis, Khaleb Taleb and Ghassan Amoun [2013] NSWCCA 40","JUDgment

1Judgment was given by the Court on 31 May 2012 in relation to an application for leave to appeal by OS1: OS1 v R [2012] NSWCCA 102. At the time judgment was delivered publication of the judgment was, under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010, restricted to the Crown and the Applicant. 

2Applications have been received on the part of three persons who are co-offenders of OS1, those persons being Con Bodiotis, Khaled Taleb and Ghassan Amoun. These parties seek review of the orders under s 13 of the Act. A fourth co-offender, a Mr Abbas, has not made any application. 

3The basis for the review is that each of the parties has appealed, relying either on a parity argument amongst the co-offenders or specifically in relation to the discount that has been given for assistance. In that regard, part of the judgment of the Court in relation to OS1 dealt with a discount for assistance provided.

4Written submissions have been received from and on behalf of OS1 and also from the Crown. Neither of those parties opposes the whole of the judgment being made available to the legal advisers of the present applicants.

5Is to be noted that when the sentence of the District Court was imposed, no order was made for suppression of OS1's identity. Nevertheless, this Court took the view that that was an important consideration arising out of the matters that were raised on the appeal and at the sentencing proceedings. 

6It seems to me that the interests of justice require that, for the Applicants to be able fairly to argue their case based on a discount for assistance or parity of sentencing, the legal advisers of those Applicants be able to read and digest what this Court has said in relation to the sentencing of OS1.

7For those reasons the order restricting the publication of the OS1 judgment is varied under s 13(3) in this way. Publication of the judgment is restricted to the Crown and lawyers for OS1. Publication of the judgment is further restricted to lawyers appearing for Con Bodiotis, Khaled Taleb and Ghassan Amoun and only to them for use in their applications to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against sentence.

2760892,D v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) - Sydney [2013] NSWSC 60,"Judgment


	
	In July 2012, Bradd LCM refused an application brought under s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) for the separate hearing of two charges brought against the plaintiff under ss 61M(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The charges concerned events which allegedly occurred in January 2007 and July 2009. His Honour also concluded that the evidence of the two complainants could be admitted as tendency and coincidence evidence under s 97 and s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995. By a further amended summons, filed in November 2012, the plaintiff seeks leave to appeal under s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). In the alternative, orders are sought under s 65 and s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), as well as declarations under s 75 of that Act.
	
	
	A non-publication order was made in relation to the name and identity of the complainants, given that they were juveniles and the charges have not been heard.
	
	
	Count 1 relates to [A], the plaintiff’s niece. It is alleged that while the plaintiff and [A] were both attending a new year’s eve party with other family members, the plaintiff touched her with one hand on the outside of her clothing in the area of her vagina, after they went together to the laundry area of the house.
	
	
	Count 2 relates to [B], who was working as a casual employee at a delicatessen owned by the plaintiff. It is alleged that [B] was working in the kitchen area when the plaintiff wrapped an apron around both of them and rubbed his groin against her bottom and lower back area.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application for separate hearings of the two charges was listed for hearing in July 2012. Without objection the Director of Public Prosecutions served tendency and coincidence notices at the hearing and the parties accepted that his Honour’s ruling on the notices would determine the separate trial issue. Statements made by the two complainants, the plaintiff and another witness were tendered and submissions advanced. His Honour gave his decision later that day.
	
	
	The tendency notice stated that the tendency sought to be proved was the plaintiff’s ‘tendency to act in a particular way, namely to show sexual interest in girls aged 15 to 16 years’. The coincidence notice specified that the two events to which the notice related were the allegations made by the two complainants in their statements.
	


The matters pressed on appeal


	
	The plaintiff complained that his Honour failed to properly consider and provide adequate reasons for the refusal of the application for a separate hearing of the two charges; as well as failing to consider whether the offences arose out of the same set of circumstances; and/or were part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character; or ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice, within the meaning of s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	The plaintiff also complained that his Honour failed to properly consider and provide adequate reasons in relation to whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have on the plaintiff, in accordance with s 101(2) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The Director raised the question of whether refusing an application for separate trials was an interlocutory order within the meaning of s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, observing that similar rulings have been held to constitute such an order, for the purpose of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). It also submitted that a decision on the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence was not an interlocutory order for the purpose of s 53(3)(b), but accepted that the decision underpinned the conclusion reached as to the refusal of the application for separate trials and that it was accordingly appropriate to examine the correctness of the admissibility question (see R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125).
	


Jurisdiction


	
	The plaintiff’s application was made under s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which provides:
	


""(2)    If of the opinion:

(a)    that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b)    that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

   the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.""


	
	Section 29 was also relevant to the application, providing relevantly:
	


""29    When more than one offence may be heard at the same time

(1)    A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances:

(a)    the accused person and the prosecutor consent,

(b)    the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,

(c)    the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

…

(3)    Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.""


	
	The appeal is brought under s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act,  which provides:
	


""(3)    Any person against whom:

…

(b)    an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings,

   may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.""

 


	
	While his Honour gave a decision, he made no formal order in relation to the plaintiff’s separate trial application, concluding simply that it was ‘not granted’. The Director accepted that it was open to the Court to find that this was, ‘in a negative sense’, an interlocutory order. The Director also submitted however, that the refusal of the plaintiff’s application may properly have been characterised as a judgment rather than an order and that under s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, as opposed to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act , the lack of a formal order in a negative direction case might preclude a finding that there had been an order made, for the purpose of the section, with the result that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.
	
	
	The term ‘interlocutory order’ is not defined in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act but it was considered in Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCA 357; (2009) 75 NSWLR 392. There it was observed at [10] - [15]:
	


""[10]    It is noteworthy that the word “order” appears in s 53(3)(b) alone and not, as is often the case, as part of a broader formulation extending to “judgment or order”: cf Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F. See R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636–639.

[11]    As Samuels JA pointed out in Barton v Walker [1979] 2 NSWLR 740 at 747D: “The word ‘order’ … is … a word familiar enough to lawyers commonly found in the collocation ‘judgment or order’. The distinction between these two notions is reasonably clear, but the cases discriminating between them do not cast light on the precise meaning of ‘order’ itself.”

[12]    Furthermore, as King CJ said in Legal Practitioners Complaints Committee v A Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 at 127: “There is no completely satisfying definition of either ‘judgment’ or ‘order’ and no exhaustively definitive way of distinguishing between judicial acts which should be characterised as judgments and judicial acts which should be characterised as orders.”

[13]    The word “order” is narrower in scope than the word “judgment”, although they may substantially overlap in a particular statutory framework. It may well be that a decision on a separate question of law will constitute a “judgment” in a particular statutory context. For present purposes it is not strictly necessary to distinguish between the two concepts.

[14]    Whether a decision or ruling constitutes a “judgment or order” turns on whether there is an operative judicial act: see Johnston v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2005) 62 NSWLR 309 at 314 [29]. There is no operative judicial act here.

[15]    Furthermore where, as in this case, a magistrate has done no more than answer a preliminary question of law, there has been, in my opinion, no order. As the joint judgment put it in Steffan (at 639), the determination does not “command that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court. It remains as no more than a ruling, one which can be tested on appeal to this Court after a conviction”.""

 


	
	The Director also submitted that there should be a consistency of approach in appeals brought under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act and those brought under s 53(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, notwithstanding the different statutory language, s 5F giving a defendant a similar right of appeal, with leave, in relation to both an interlocutory order and a judgement. In s 5F appeals, the view taken has been that refusal of a separate trial application concerns a procedural matter which requires appellate restraint (see R v Dao [2011] NSWCA 63 at [69]).
	
	
	In the circumstances which have arisen in this case, in my view it must be concluded that an interlocutory order has been made, albeit not formalised. The circumstances are not dissimilar to those considered in R v F, albeit in this case the evidentiary ruling was made prior to trial.
	
	
	As Spigelman CJ discussed in R v Dao at [6], there is a need to determine questions such as this as a matter of substance, not form. In this case, the missing formality is the entry of an order dismissing the plaintiff’s separate trial application. The parties would even now be entitled to ask that such an order be entered. There is no question that the nature of such an order is interlocutory. It does not finally dispose of the parties' rights and could be revisited in the trial, in the event that circumstances changed (see Hall v Nominal defendant [1966] HCA 36; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 439 - 40; R v Wright (1990) 90 Cr App R 312 at 338 - 40 and R v Dao at [207]).
	
	
	In the result it must be concluded that the Court does have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.
	
	
	The Director did not, however, concede that any views reached on this appeal in relation to the joinder application, could affect his Honour’s decision in relation to the tendency and coincidence evidence ruling, given that was an evidentiary ruling in respect of which no appeal lies under s 53(3)(b). It was accepted, nevertheless, that it was virtually inevitable that given the way in which the matter had been dealt with below, any expression of opinion on that ruling would be adhered to and a course consistent with that opinion taken at the trial.
	
	
	The Director’s view of s 53 must, in my view, be accepted. Such an evidentiary ruling is not the subject of an appeal under the section. Nevertheless, in the circumstances which have arisen the ruling must be considered, in order that the appeal in relation to the refusal of the separate trial application, may be determined.
	


Leave under s 53(3)(b)


	
	Leave under the section will not readily be given (see Dao v R at [208] -[209]). It is well settled that it is undesirable to fragment criminal proceedings by interlocutory appeals. Not only does the plaintiff have the right to appeal any conviction to both the District and Supreme Courts, but the Local Court itself can revisit the question of the separate hearing of the charges, if circumstances change. Ordinarily, in order to be granted leave under the section a plaintiff must establish that the circumstances warrant a trial being interrupted, there being substantial doubt about an interlocutory order made, which it is convenient to resolve before the trial proceeds (see Kocer v R [2006] NSWCCA 328 at [22] - [23]).
	
	
	Like the circumstances considered in Dao v R, this is a case where the question of a separate trial hinged on an evidentiary ruling as to tendency and coincidence evidence. Like in that case, I have concluded that the leave sought should be granted. Here no trial date has been set. The ruling is critical to the decision made in relation to the joint trial and if in error and there is a conviction, will almost inevitably led to an appeal and retrial. The plaintiff has established that his Honour failed to give adequate reasons for his decision, particularly in relation to the balancing exercise which had to be undertaken under s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In the result I am satisfied that this is a case where the leave sought must be granted, as a matter of justice.
	


The decision appealed


	
	His Honour began by noting the two counts to which the application under s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act related, quoting the section and referring to s 29. He observed that the circumstances relevant to the application were that the offences arose out of the same sort of circumstances, or more likely, formed part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. His Honour then noted the tendency and coincidence notices served, observing that:
	


""So the prosecution have served a notice of tendency evidence and coincidence evidence and the grounds of the tendency and coincidence evidence are that in both cases the alleged victim was in the age of under sixteen, being fifteen years of age, and in each case [D] had quasi-authority at the time.

So to amplify that aspect, [A] is the niece of [D] and [D] exercises the right to discipline [A], and in the case of [B], she was an employee of [D], as was Ms Goldhill, who is not an alleged victim in a charge but has given evidence as well.""

 


	
	His Honour then turned to consider whether the evidence was admissible as tendency evidence, by reference in s 97 of the Evidence Act. His Honour observed that the prosecution proposed to lead tendency evidence on the basis that the complainants were in the same age group and under the plaintiff’s quasi-authority at the time of the alleged offences.
	
	
	His Honour referred to factors discussed in Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (9th ed, 2010) at p 427, noting that the two occasions in question were separated by a time gap of more than 2 years. He found that there was a specificity as to the alleged conduct; a degree of similarity between the conduct and the circumstances in which it took place, observing that it was the degree of similarity in the circumstances which was the main fact relied on, the circumstances being the complainants’ ages and the plaintiff’s quasi-authority over them. His Honour also noted the evidence of the plaintiff leading one complainant to the isolation of a laundry and coming to the back room of the workplace, in the other.
	
	
	His Honour found similarities in the plaintiff’s conduct of interacting with the complainants at a time when they were in an isolated place. He found that this tied in with the use of his quasi-authority over them, given their respective relationships.
	
	
	His Honour took the view that it was not necessary that there be similarities in the location of the events, such as both events occurring in a social setting, or place of employment. He concluded that there were sufficient circumstances of similarity, despite the different settings in which the events occurred.
	
	
	He concluded that the plaintiff had a tendency to act in a particular way, observing:
	


""As I have explained, the manner in which he used isolated circumstances to allegedly interfere with the two alleged victims and also have a particular state of mind which is exemplified by the alleged evidence and also in relation to the ages of both [A] and [B], so it would be open to a tribunal of fact to infer behaviour from that evidence and decide whether that is evidence of a tendency to act on a particular occasion.""

 


	
	His Honour then turned to consider ‘the other issue’, whether or not the evidence had significant probative value. He observed that probative value was defined, ‘as the extent to which evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’ and ‘significant’ as something regarded as been more than relevant, but less than substantial. Again, by reference to Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (9th ed, 2010), he observed that ‘the point is the degree of impact on the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’.
	
	
	His Honour also observed that the similarity of surrounding circumstances may be such as to lead to significant probative value, even if the conduct is not identical, referring to R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209, where the tendency rested on only one significant circumstance, vulnerability. He observed that ‘there is no requirement that tendency evidence be based on similarities’. His Honour concluded that the evidence was admissible as tendency evidence, having significant probative value.
	
	
	As to coincidence, his Honour observed that:
	


""In relation to the coincidence rule, evidence that two or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that having regard to any similarities in the events of the circumstances in which they occurred or any similarities in both the events in circumstances in which they occurred it is improbable the events occurred coincidentally unless the Court thinks that the evidence will either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the parties seeking to adduce the evidence having significant probative value.""

 


	
	He took the view that while the events were not similar, in terms of the alleged acts, the circumstances were, given the ages of the complainants, the plaintiff’s quasi-authority over them and the manner in which they were allegedly taken advantage of. He concluded that the evidence would have significant probative value.
	
	
	His Honour then referred to Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 472, where McHugh J observed:
	


""... the proposition that the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect is one that can be easily misunderstood. The use of the term ``outweigh'’ suggests an almost arithmetical computation. But prejudicial effect and probative value are incommensurables. They have no standard of comparison. The probative value of the evidence goes to proof of an issue, the prejudicial effect to the fairness of the trial. In criminal trials, the prejudicial effect of evidence is not concerned with the cogency of its proof but with the risk that the jury will use the evidence or be affected by it in a way that the law does not permit. In no sense does the probative value of evidence disclosing propensity, when admitted, outweigh its prejudicial effect. On the contrary, in many cases the probative value either creates or reinforces the prejudicial effect of the evidence. In my view, evidence that discloses the criminal or discreditable propensity of the accused is admitted not because its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect but because the interests of justice (cf. Lord Morris in Boardman, [1975] A.C., at p.439) require its admission despite the risk, or in some cases the inevitability, that the fair trial of the charge will be prejudiced.

If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.""

 


	
	In the result his Honour concluded that:
	


""It is my view that that test is made out in this case, so the application for the counts to be separated is not granted and I find that the circumstances set out in s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act for the joinder is satisfied.""

The evidence


	
	In a statement made in March 2008, [A] gave an account of the events which occurred at the new year’s eve party which she attended with her parents, the plaintiff and his wife, son and girlfriend, at the home of another family member in January 2007. After midnight she went with her uncle to look for her cousin and his girlfriend. He took her to a laundry, where he touched her on the vagina over her underwear and dress, saying ‘I know you’ve been fingered’. She left and returned to her parents. She reported the assault to a friend on 7 January, but did not take it further, because she thought no one would believe her. She reported the assault to another cousin in the following October and then told her parents. She reported the assault to police in March 2008.
	
	
	In a statement made by the plaintiff on 18 April 2011, he gave an account of his relationship with [A] and her family and of having in the past assumed full parental responsibility over her, including discipline, when she misbehaved. He said that prior to the new year’s eve party, he had heard that she had been behaving badly at parties and social functions, engaging in binge drinking and sexual encounters with older boys. He described [A] joining him at the party to look for his son and his girlfriend and his conversation with her, after they found them, when they were together on a 2nd floor landing, about her binge drinking and sexual encounters. He said that he threatened to tell her parents if she did not behave; that she defiantly reached out and grabbed his scotch and drank the glass, whereupon her smacked her on the backside in discipline, telling her in an angry voice that she was ‘a little shit’. He described the rest of the evening and his shock when he heard of [A]’s allegations in October, which he denied. He described discussions with other family members, including his brother, about her allegations and misbehaviour. He also described his involvement with other children in cricket coaching and the gourmet food store which he owned and operated between 2003 and 2010, where he managed school age children who he employed. He said that ‘Never once in the performance of any of these roles have I 'acted indecently or inappropriately'. He did not refer to [B]’s complaint.
	
	
	In her statement of 22 July 2011, the former girlfriend of the plaintiff's son, gives an account of being employed by the plaintiff at his store in 2004, after school and during school holidays. She gives an account of the plaintiff making inappropriate sexually suggestive remarks to her when she was aged 16. She started dating the plaintiff's son in mid-2006. She attended the new year’s eve party and described the party and [A] leaving them with the plaintiff at the party. She did not see her again that evening. The plaintiff's son told her of [A]’s allegation against his father in early 2008. They broke up in mid-2008
	
	
	In [B]’s September 2011 statement, she gives an account of being employed by the plaintiff to work at his store after school, in July 2009. She described the plaintiff coming into the back room where she was working, approaching her from behind and wrapping a work apron around both of them and rubbing his groin area up against her bottom and lower back region, in an action which she described as ‘dry humping’ for about 10 seconds. Afterwards he reduced her shifts and she stopped working there in August 2009. She was shocked and scared that people would not believe her. About two months later, she discussed it with a friend, who encouraged her to tell her parents. She told a teacher at school about four months later and then spoke to a counsellor, who spoke to her parents. She also explained the impact which the assault has had on her.
	


The cases advanced below


	
	The parties’ cases were shortly put below. Identification was not in issue. Nor was there any suggestion of collusion by the complainants. Neither of the alleged assaults were witnessed. There is some evidence as to subsequent complaint in each case. The prosecution case was that the plaintiff manufactured circumstances in which he became alone with both complainants, when he assaulted them.
	
	
	Without objection, the four statements relied on by the Director were tendered.
	
	
	The factors on which the Director relied for both tendency and coincidence were the girls' ages of 15 or 16 and that they were under the plaintiff’s quasi-authority at the relevant time. The statement made by the plaintiff was relied on to establish that there was a quasi-authority position between him and his niece. It was argued that taking the proposed evidence at its highest, it was apparent that it had significant probative value and was of importance in establishing the facts in issue, its weight being a separate consideration.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the Court’s power to order separate trials flowed from s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act and that s 29 of that Act embodied the provisions made in s 97 and s 98 of the Evidence Act. He referred to the Crown’s concession that if the tendency/coincidence application failed, there was no basis upon which the separation of the hearings could be opposed.
	
	
	It was submitted that the indictment and the statements showed that there were separate individuals, locations and places involved in the two alleged offences; that there were no issues of coincidence and that the material sought to be relied upon by the Director had no significant probative value. The evidence, it was submitted, would be argued at trial to be inadmissible under s 55 of the Evidence Act, as not rationally affecting the existence of the probability of a fact in issue in the proceedings.
	
	
	It was argued that the significant hurdles posed by s 97 and s 101 could not be overcome. The evidence did not have significant probative value, nor could it establish tendency, it was submitted, given the differing times circumstances, relationships and acts involved. It could not establish a tendency to commit conduct in particular circumstances. Nor could it establish coincidence, having in mind the requirements of s 98 given the events and the circumstances in which they occurred.
	
	
	To advance these arguments particular emphasis was placed on the dissimilarity of the alleged acts. Reference was made to Phillips v R [2006] HCA 4; (2006) 225 CLR 303, it being submitted that while a number of similar complaints may have increased the probability that one or more complainants was assaulted, that did not increase the possibility that the plaintiff had assaulted any particular complainant. In the absence of striking similarities, it could not be concluded that both complainants were telling the truth, one or more of them could be making false allegations.
	
	
	It was not submitted that there would be any particular prejudicial effect flowing from the receipt of the evidence, but it was submitted that the circumstances warranted a severing of the hearing of the two charges.
	


The reasons given were not adequate


	
	The requirement to give reasons for decisions is well settled and does not require great elaboration here. As discussed by McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 280:
	


""If an obligation to give reasons for a decision exists its discharge does not require lengthy or elaborate reasons: Ex parte Powter; Re Powter (1945) 46 SR (NSW) 1 at 5; 63 WN 34 at 36. But it is necessary that the essential ground or grounds upon which the decision rests should be articulated. In many cases the reasons for preferring one conclusion to another also need to be given: Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission (at 701, 713). In Iveagh (Earl) v Minister of Housing and Local Government [1964] 1 QB 395, Lord Denning MR, speaking of a Minister's duty under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958 (UK) to furnish “the reasons for the decision”, declared (at 410) that:

“… The whole purpose of the enactment is to enable the parties and the courts to see what matters he has taken into consideration and what view he has reached on the points of fact and law which arise.”

 


	
	In the case of evidentiary rulings which effectively dispose of an application such as this, the obligation is of the kind discussed in R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427, where it was observed as to a ruling in relation to s 137 of the Evidence Act, at [47]:
	


""... adequate reasons for the rejection of evidence will hardly be found in a simple statement that s137 applies or in a bare finding that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial effect of the evidence. The reasons for judgment must make clear what the unfair prejudice is and why it is of such a kind that the evidence must be rejected despite its probative value.""

 


	
	Here the Director’s case was that his Honour’s reasons disclosed that he understood the statutory tests he was applying, albeit giving very, very succinct reasons for the views he reached, particularly in relation to the requirements of s 101 of the Evidence Act. His Honour’s approach reflected that the parties had not submitted that any particular prejudice would flow from refusal of the application or receipt of the tendency and coincidence evidence, as well as the short compass of the evidence over which the matters put in issue turned.
	
	
	The cases put below certainly did not emphasise the requirements of the applicable statutory provisions, particularly in the way in which the plaintiff’s case was argued on appeal. The approach adopted below no doubt reflected that the charges concerned two events of short compass, matters which were to be dealt with summarily, rather than before a jury. That also explains why concerns about appropriate directions being given about the receipt of tendency and coincidence evidence and the use to which it could be put in the reasoning process, did not arise and were not addressed. Nor were the circumstances such that one complainant was making more serious allegations than the other. It was the dispute over the alleged similarities between the two alleged offences over which the parties joined issue and directed their submissions, it being common ground that his Honour’s conclusion as to tendency and coincidence evidence would resolve the question of whether or not there should be separate trials.
	
	
	His Honour clearly responded to the cases which the parties had so argued, concluding that tendency and coincidence had been established and that accordingly, the trials should not be separated.
	
	
	The arguments advanced turned entirely on whether or not the necessary tendency and coincidence could be established and whether or not the evidence sought to be relied on had the necessary probative value. No separate submissions were advanced as to what the interests of justice required in the event that the plaintiff did not succeed on the tendency/coincidence questions.
	
	
	Given his Honour’s conclusions about the matters over which the parties had joined issue, it can be inferred that he did not consider that justice demanded that the cases be heard separately, even though he did not separately address that question, which arose under s 29(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	In the circumstances it seems to me that little complaint can be made about his Honour’s approach to the requirements of the Criminal Procedure Act. What was not, however, addressed by his Honour, was the question which arose under s 101 of the Evidence Act, namely the balancing exercise which that section requires and the necessity for giving reasons as to why that exercise led to the conclusion reached. In O’Keefe v R [2009] NSWCA 121, it was observed at [49] - [50] that:
	


""49    Simpson J pointed out in the passage quoted above that, as the trial judge is to undertake an evaluative assessment of the probative value of the evidence, minds might reasonably differ as to the outcome of that assessment. The same has been said of the application of s 137 of the Act. Both in respect of a determination made under s 101(2) and a determination made under s 137 a review of that determination by this Court can only be performed in accordance with the principles laid down in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.

50    The applicant contends under Ground 3 above that the Judge failed to give sufficient reasons for determining to admit the evidence. Even if that assertion were made out, it would not have the effect of rendering the decision to admit the evidence nugatory. However, the reasons given by the trial judge may disclose error in the exercise of the discretionary judgment to admit the evidence under the House principles or the failure to give adequate reasons may mean that this Court could not rely upon the judge’s determination and would have to reach its own conclusion as to whether the evidence ought to have been admitted.""

 


	
	Even if the Director's submission that his Honour’s reference to R v Pfennig showed that his Honour did turn his mind to the requirements of s 101 of the Evidence Act be accepted, it was necessary for his Honour to give some explanation of why the balancing exercise which the section required be undertaken, favoured the conclusion which he reached. In this case, the failure to give any explanation of the conclusions reached in that regard, establishes the error about which the plaintiff complains on appeal as to the inadequacy of the reasons given.
	


Tendency


	
	The starting point is s 55(1) of the Evidence Act, which provides that evidence that is relevant in a proceeding ‘is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding’. Such evidence is admissible, unless otherwise provided (s 56). The admissibility of tendency evidence is governed by s 97 of the Evidence Act, which provides:
	


""97   The tendency rule

(1)    Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a)    the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)    the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.""

 


	
	‘Significant’ has been held to mean ‘important’ or ‘of consequence’ (see R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459 per Hunt CJ at CL).
	
	
	The tendency here in question was ‘a tendency to act in a particular way, namely to show sexual interest in girls aged 15 to 16 years’.
	
	
	In R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; (2008) 189 A Crim R 492, Simpson J explained at [22] - [23]:
	


""[22]    “Proof of a tendency to act in a particular way of itself goes nowhere. Evidence that a person had a particular tendency is adduced in order to render more probable the proposition that, on a particular occasion relevant to the proceedings, that person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind); that is, to provide the foundation for an inference to that effect.

[23] Put another way, tendency evidence is tendered to prove (by inference), that, because, on a particular occasion, a person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind), that person, on an occasion relevant to the proceeding, acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind).”

 


	
	As discussed in the authorities, the questions raised for determination by the section involve value judgments. Tendency evidence is led as evidence tending to prove the guilt of an accused. Typically a jury is asked to reason that because the accused acted in a particular way on some other occasion or occasions, he or she is more likely to have acted in the same way on another occasion.
	
	
	The exercise required under the section is an evaluative and predictive one which must be undertaken in a context where ‘probative value’ is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as meaning ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’. The facts in issue in each case appear to be firstly whether the plaintiff conducted himself as alleged and secondly, whether he acted with sexual interest.
	
	
	In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228, Spigelman CJ observed in relation to the definition at [61] - [62]:
	


“[61]    In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment …’. The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ‘probative value’, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.

[62]    This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ‘rationally affect’ the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in [Adam v R [2001] HCA 57; 207 CLR 96], a ‘test’ of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight.”

 


	
	In R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim A 308 (followed in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9, see at [66] - [77]), Simpson J observed:
	


""[33]    It is also useful to articulate the exercises involved in a decision to admit or reject evidence tendered as tendency evidence under s 97(1). Some precision in that analysis, also, is required. It is necessary to bear in mind: —

(i)    the actual probative value to be ascribed to a particular piece of evidence is committed to the tribunal of fact (in this case, the jury);

(ii)    even where the judge is the tribunal of fact, it is not ordinarily possible finally to determine the actual probative value of any piece of evidence until the evidence in the case is complete. This is explicitly recognised in s 97(1)(b), which envisages that the evaluation of the probative value of the evidence in question is to be made having regard to other evidence “to be adduced”, and implicitly by the use of the subjunctive “would not” in s 97(1)(b).

(iii)    whether a particular piece of evidence is capable of being ascribed probative value is to be determined by the trial judge; this is to be done by reference to the test prescribed in the definition of “probative value” contained in the Dictionary and involves an assessment of the extent to which that evidence could rationally affect (ie is capable of rationally affecting) the probability of the existence of a fact in issue;

(iv)   the task that a trial judge undertakes under s 97(1) involves a two-step process: firstly, the assessment of the extent to which the evidence in question has the capacity rationally to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; and, secondly, (where the judge concludes that the evidence has that capacity) an assessment and prediction of the probative value that the jury might ascribe to the evidence. The evidence is not to be admitted if the judge concludes that the evidence, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced, would not have significant probative value, ie if the judge concludes that the jury would not regard the evidence as having probative value, and to a significant degree (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457). If the determination is that, notwithstanding that the evidence would have probative value, its probative value would not be significant, then the evidence is not admissible.""

 


	
	In R v PWD it was observed at [64] - [65], however:
	


""64    In Ford Campbell JA (Howie and Rothman JJ agreeing) at [38], identified as an error in the trial judge’s reasoning the judge’s apparent view that tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those constituting the particular crime with which the accused is charged. In that case, the accused was charged with sexual intercourse without consent against an 18 year old woman who was a guest in the accused’s home. The evidence of two other women he had indecently assaulted while they were guests in his home was held to have significant probative value. The respondent in that case argued that there was nothing unusual about the allegations by the women of sexual interference after a social event involving the consumption of a considerable amount of alcohol. That argument was rejected (Ford at [126]). The lack of striking pattern or similarity between the charged incident and the other two incidents was held not to be determinative. Campbell JA observed, at [38]:

“The second flaw is the judge’s apparent view that the tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those that constitute the crime with which a particular accused is charged. That is not so. All that a tendency need be, to fall within the chapeau to section 97(1), is ‘a tendency to act in a particular way’.” (emphasis added).

65    Later, at [125], his Honour stated:

“In my view there is no need for there to be a ‘striking pattern of similarity between the incidents’. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged. In my view, it meets that test.”

 


	
	As Simpson J discussed in R v Dao at [182] - [187], assessment of the probative value of any of the evidence relied on to establish this tendency did not depend on any assessment of the credibility or reliability of the evidence. That is a matter to be determined, in the usual way, at the trial.
	
	
	His Honour’s conclusion that the evidence here in issue had significant probative value seems to me to have been well open. The conduct relied on to establish the alleged tendency was different and did occur some years apart. There was, however, no glaring difference in its seriousness: in one case touching his young niece’s vagina area on the outside of her clothing and in the other, wrapping an apron around both he and his young employee and pressing his groin against her back and bottom. That conduct did suggest that he had a sexual interest in both complainants and that he acted on that interest opportunistically, when alone with them.
	
	
	In both cases the alleged conduct occurred while the plaintiff was alone with the young complainant, with whom he had an ongoing relationship. The plaintiff complained on appeal that there was no basis for the view which his Honour reached as to some link between the two alleged assaults flowing from the plaintiff’s relationship with the two complainants, particularly given that his niece did not consider that he had any authority over her. That was submitted to be a point of distinction to the authority he had over the other complainant, as her employer.
	
	
	Contrary to the plaintiff's case, the evidence did establish the nature of the authority he considered that he had over his niece and the circumstances in which he exercised that authority, by hitting her. The plaintiff said in his statement that he had in the past exercised the authority of a parent over her and that he had hit her on the backside, in exercising discipline over her misbehaviour on the night of the alleged offence. In their statements both the plaintiff and his niece refer to contact between them during a discussion about her sexual behaviour, albeit in quite different contexts and using quite different words. Whose evidence will be preferred, need not be determined at this stage.
	
	
	In his statement, the plaintiff makes no reference to the allegations made against him by [B], but says that he had never acted indecently or inappropriately to any of his employees. That account of his behaviour is inconsistent with that given by [B] and his son’s former girlfriend. Again, which evidence will be preferred, cannot be determined at this point. It is the question of whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, which had to be assessed. His Honour’s view that it could was clearly open.
	
	
	The plaintiff also complained that it was his Honour who considered the locations in which the two alleged assaults occurred, as being a relevant similarity and the parties did not address this. It was submitted that in O’Keefe v R [2009] NSWCCA 121, the view was taken that a tendency to assault females in secluded locations did not have significant probative value (see at [65]) and so that this was a factor which his Honour ought not to have considered, at least without giving the parties an opportunity to address him.
	
	
	These criticisms do not seem warranted to me. The evidence which had to be considered fell within very short compass. This was not a circumstantial case like O’Keefe v R, where identity of the assailant was in issue. On the cases which the parties advanced, his Honour clearly had to consider the circumstances in which the alleged assaults occurred. In both cases the allegation was that the plaintiff assaulted a young complainant with whom he had an ongoing relationship, when alone with them. The parties addressed him on those circumstances. The view that there were relevant similarities in the circumstances was open. There was no denial of procedural fairness in his Honour’s approach to that matter.
	
	
	The nature of the opportunity to be heard which the rules of natural justice require is that discussed in Adamson v Ede [2009] NSWCA 379, where it was observed at [57] - [59]:
	


""57    That it is a court, rather than some other sort of decision-maker, that is required to grant natural justice can affect what, in the circumstances of a particular case, natural justice requires. Established rules of procedure of courts can affect the content of natural justice as applied in the courts. In J v Lieschke (1987) 162 CLR 447 at 456 Brennan J (with whom other members of the court agreed) recognised that the audi alteram partem principle applied to courts, but continued:

“That is not to say that the content of the principles of natural justice to be applied by a court take no account of the nature of the jurisdiction to be exercised. The nature of the proceedings, the powers to be exercised and the prescribed rules of procedure may affect the extent to which a plenary right to be heard may be qualified, even in curial proceedings.”

58    This has led the requirement of natural justice in court proceedings to sometimes be put as an entitlement to a fair trial. In Stead v State Government Insurance Commission (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145, the joint judgment of Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ approved of the statement of the English Court of Appeal in Jones v National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB 55 at 67 that:

“There is one thing to which everyone … is entitled, and that is a fair trial at which he can put his case properly before the judge. ... No cause is lost until the judge has found it so; and he cannot find it without a fair trial, nor can we affirm it.”

59    Both in a court and in a tribunal, natural justice requires that a person be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case. However, as Gaudron J (with whom Dawson J agreed) pointed out in Re Association of Architects of Australia; Ex parte Municipal Officers Association of Australia (1989) 63 ALJR 298 at 305 (sub nom Re Coldham; Ex parte Municipal Officers Association of Australia (1989) 84 ALR 208 at 220):

“… the fact that a hearing has taken place may have particular significance in determining whether or not the opportunity was given. As was pointed out by Deane J in Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 343, procedural fairness requires only that a party be given ‘a reasonable opportunity to present his case’ and not that the tribunal ensure ‘that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is entitled’. And it is always relevant to inquire whether the party or his legal representative should reasonably have apprehended that the issue was or might become a live issue: see Re Building Workers’ Industrial Union; Ex parte Gallagher (1988) 62 ALJR 81 at 84; 76 ALR 353 at 358.” (original emphasis)""

 


	
	The plaintiff was given a fair opportunity to meet the case put against him.
	
	
	His Honour did not err in weighing up the competing considerations and reaching the view that the evidence could have significant probative value. The relevant considerations were taken into account. His Honour did not mistake the facts, misapply principle or take into account irrelevant or extraneous matters. The conclusion reached was open. The evidence was clearly capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the plaintiff having had a sexual interest in engaging in the conduct alleged. If accepted beyond reasonable doubt, the evidence rendered it more probable that the plaintiff had acted in the way alleged.
	
	
	Section 101 raises an additional barrier or hurdle to admissibility, namely that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the plaintiff. It provides:
	


""101   Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1)    This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2)    Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3)    This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4)    This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant. ""

 


	
	It seems to me that the probative value of the evidence in each case clearly outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the plaintiff. While it may be accepted that there will be some prejudicial effect in receipt of the evidence, that it is unfair or substantial prejudice is not apparent.
	
	
	The unfair prejudice suggested for the plaintiff on appeal was the risk that the evidence would provide artificial corroboration and would be given undue weight or used in some unfair way, by the magistrate hearing the case, so as to provoke an irrational, emotional or illogical response of the kind discussed in R v SK [2011] NSWCCA 292 at [33] - [35], for example. There it was observed:
	


""33   Further, in the written submissions, the applicant's counsel referred to R v Watkins (2005) 153 A Crim R 434, a case in which criminal convictions for fraud, following pleas of guilty, ten years before a trial for similar offences, were held inadmissible by this Court, on the basis that the jury would be diverted from a proper consideration of the accused's defence and simply assume his guilt.

34   Notwithstanding these submissions, the applicant did not identify how the risk of misuse of the evidence by the jury could arise. It is no answer to make general statements about the arousal of prejudice. A jury's antipathy towards an accused, assuming that the accused is guilty and failing to properly consider a defence are all potential by-products of tendency evidence. In that sense, the nature of tendency evidence is inherently prejudicial, hence the need for strong directions, including the requirement that the tendency evidence be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is not however, prejudicial simply because it tends to prove the commission of the offences. That constitutes, subject to proper directions, appropriate use of the evidence, not its misuse.

35   The pre Evidence Act cases cited by the applicant (Sutton, De Jesus and Hoch) are of no assistance to the applicant on this issue. The law in this State is as discussed in DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272. The facts in Watkins amply demonstrate why the proposed tendency evidence in that case was overwhelmingly prejudicial.

36   I agree with the Judge that the applicant failed to identify any specific prejudice for the purposes of determining the test under s101. As I have already noted, on the hearing of the application, the parties acknowledged that the admissibility of the tendency evidence dictated the fate of the separate trial application.""

 


	
	In this case, I cannot see that there is a real risk that the evidence of the alleged tendency will be given more weight than it deserves at any trial. It is relevant in this regard to take account of the fact that the evidence will be assessed by a magistrate, not by a jury. That clearly significantly reduces the risk of any misuse of the evidence, illogical or emotional reasoning, or other unfair prejudice, in my view to the point where it cannot sensibly be concluded that the prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighs its probative value. A magistrate assessing evidence such as this is in quite a different position to that of a jury, being unlikely to engage in impermissible reasoning of the kind referred to in the authorities relied on for the plaintiff. A magistrate is well able to approach the task of objectively analysing the evidence, and which evidence ought to be accepted or which rejected, without engaging in illogically or impermissibly emotional reasoning.
	
	
	In the result this aspect of the appeal may not be upheld.
	


Coincidence


	
	As discussed in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 at [55], ‘s98, in its terms, poses this simple question: whether the evidence being considered is capable, to a significant degree, of rationally affecting the assessment (ultimately by a jury) of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.’ The section provides:
	


""98 The coincidence rule

(1)    Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a)    the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)    the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.""

 


	
	Coincidence evidence is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act to mean ‘evidence of a kind referred to in s 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.’ As discussed in R v Nassif [2004] NSWCCA 433 at [51], tendency and coincidence evidence are not necessarily interlinked, and there will be cases where evidence of tendency will be admissible, when evidence of coincidence is not; and at [52], in the case of coincidence evidence, the more numerous the items of similarity, and the more precise, the stronger the inference of improbability and the more likely the admission of the evidence.
	
	
	In R v PWD it was observed:
	


""79    The authorities are clear that for evidence to be admissible under s 97 there does not have to be striking similarities, or even closely similar behaviour. By contrast, coincidence evidence is based upon similarities. Section 98 provides in terms that two or more events occurring is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act, on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless, the evidence has significant probative value.""

 


	
	Section 101 also applies.
	
	
	The 'events' here in question are those which [A] and [B] outlined in their statements. Like the circumstances which arose for consideration in DSJ v R; NS v R, those events were sought to be relied on by the Director not only to prove the two charges, but also in order to defeat the application for separate trials. This was not a case, however, where the plaintiff urged another possible explanation for the events relied on, inconsistent with guilt. It was rather the question of whether there were sufficient similarities between the two events and the circumstances in which they occurred to establish coincidence which was in issue. Such similarity must be such as to lead to the conclusion that they have the significant capacity to establish the fact or facts in issue.
	
	
	His Honour’s conclusions rested on the similarities which he found in the alleged conduct and the circumstances in which it occurred. They are those earlier referred to: the ages of the complainants; the plaintiff's relationship with them; his sexual interest in them; and how he acted on that interest when alone with them. His Honour came to the view that the similarities were such that it was improbable that the events occurred coincidentally and that the evidence had significant probative value.
	
	
	Again, while no doubt there are other cases where coincidence evidence is stronger than that relied on in this case, I consider that there is a sound basis in the evidence for these conclusions, given these similarities. The evidence did provide a basis upon which his Honour could come to the conclusion that it had significant probative value, that is, the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts in issue.
	
	
	In terms of s 101, while receipt of the evidence is unquestionably prejudicial, its prejudicial effect cannot be considered to substantially outweigh its probative value, for the reasons I have already explained, in relation to the tendency evidence.
	


Separate trial


	
	A decision as to whether or not to grant a separate trial is a discretionary one, not lightly to be interfered with on appeal, particularly where the appeal rests on a complaint about an evidentiary ruling. As I have discussed, this appeal is in effect an appeal from such an evidentiary ruling, a ruling which does not appear to have been in error, notwithstanding the failures identified, particularly in relation to the requirements of s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In my view the circumstances which came to be considered were such that his Honour was entitled to take the view that the offences formed a part of a series of offences of the same or similar character, as s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act contemplates. The plaintiff did not put this possibility in issue below, consistently with that section itself making clear that such a series of offences may be comprised by ‘two or more offences’. It was the character of the alleged offences and their similarities which was in issue.
	
	
	The alleged offences involved two young female complainants of similar age; conduct of similar seriousness, touching the complainants inappropriately on their clothing; and occurred in similar circumstances, namely where the plaintiff took the opportunity to pursue his sexual interest in the complainants, over whom he had certain authority, by taking advantage of finding himself alone with them. Contrary to the case pressed for the plaintiff, that the age of the complainants is an element of the offences with which he has been charged, is not a reason for not considering the complainants’ ages, in determining the questions which his Honour here had to resolve as to the application for separate trials.
	
	
	The plaintiff had a particular relationship with each complainant, which enabled him to exercise certain authority over them. In the case of his niece, it was in his own statement that he said he had exercised the role of a parent in relation to her discipline in the past and that was why he touched her on the occasion in question. That evidence was admitted without objection and was thus something on which the Director was entitled to rely in the case advanced and a matter which his Honour had to consider, taking the evidence at its highest. The conclusion which his Honour reached was open on the evidence and was relevant to the view that he plainly came to, that the necessary similarity in the character of the two alleged offences was present.
	
	
	It has not been established that the interests of justice required that these two summary charges be heard separately. In the result it follows that while leave to appeal must be granted, the appeal must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons given, I order that:
	


1.   Leave to appeal be granted.

2.   The appeal be dismissed.

		20 February 2015",2013-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760898,Burns v R [2013] NSWCCA 17,"Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with the reasons of Button J and the orders proposed. 

2BUTTON J: This is an application pursuant to s 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is not necessary to quote from the statute. It suffices to say that the parties agree that the subsection gives this Court a discretion to intervene in the following circumstances. If an offender is convicted of more than one count on an indictment, and one or more of the convictions are subsequently quashed on appeal, this Court may re-sentence on the remaining count or counts: see generally Sheehan [No 2] v R [2006] NSWCCA 332.

3This case is a very good example of the need for such a provision in order to ensure that justice is achieved for successful appellants. 

Chronology

4On 23 October 2009, the applicant was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales for five offences: one count of manslaughter (an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years), and four counts of supplying methadone (an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years). For the purposes of this judgment, it is not necessary to review the facts underpinning those convictions, except to say that the manslaughter was intimately connected with one of the supplies. 

5The learned sentencing judge structured the sentence as follows. On three counts of supplying methadone, three fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years 6 months were imposed, all to date from 14 July 2009, and to expire on 13 January 2012. On the fourth count of supplying methadone (which in fact was count two on the indictment), a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years 4 months to date from 14 July 2010 and expire on 13 November 2013 was imposed. On the count of manslaughter, his Honour imposed a non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years 6 months to date from 14 July 2010, with a balance of term of 1 year 2 months to date from 14 January 2014 and expire on 13 March 2015. In other words, the head sentence for manslaughter of 4 years 8 months would expire on 13 March 2015, and the non-parole period of 3 years 6 months would expire on 13 January 2014.

6Annexed to this judgement is a diagram that seeks to show the structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant in a readily comprehensible form.

7A number of aspects of that structure may be noted. First, his Honour decided to make the sentence for the manslaughter and for the related methadone supply cumulative upon the other three methadone supplies, to the extent of 12 months. Secondly, the sentences for the supply in count two and for the manslaughter are wholly concurrent with each other. Thirdly, it is clear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour equated the fixed term for count two to what would have been a notional head sentence for that offence, and not a notional non-parole period. Fourthly, and importantly to this application, no non-parole period was imposed with regard to count two. That was for the very sound reason that to do so would have had no utility, because any such non-parole period would have been subsumed by the non-parole period of the sentence for manslaughter.

8On 20 June 2012, the High Court of Australia quashed the conviction of the applicant for manslaughter. Of course, she remained in custody pursuant to the fixed term imposed for count two. Her legal advisers quickly approached the sentencing Judge for a variation in that sentence, pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour refused the application, but granted the applicant bail on 29 July 2012. She has been on bail since that date.

Analysis

9It is quite apparent that, if the sentence for count two is not adjusted by this Court, the applicant will suffer a serious injustice. That is because, as the Crown accepts, one can safely infer that, if there had been no sentence at first instance for the manslaughter, the applicant would have received a non-parole period with regard to count two. If that non-parole period had been 75 per cent of the fixed term of 3 years 4 months imposed for count two, the applicant would have been eligible for consideration for release on parole on 13 January 2013. 

10It is agreed between the parties that it is incumbent on this Court to intervene; the only question is how best to do it.

Solution 

11I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to alter the commencement date of the sentence for count two. Nor is there any need to go through the logistical procedure adopted in Lavender v R [2006] NSWCCA 24. The simplest course is to impose a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years or less on count two, thereby ensuring that the State Parole Authority is not required to determine that the applicant is suitable for release at the end of the non-parole period. As well as that, there should be a non-parole period that expires on the day of the release of the applicant to bail some months ago. I firmly reject any proposition that the applicant should be returned to custody at this stage of the proceedings, and of course the Crown has not made such a submission. 

12The effect of the new sentence I propose for count two will be a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 2 years 16 days. The resultant total head sentence imposed upon the applicant for all extant counts will be one of 4 years, with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years 16 days.

13The result will be that the applicant will remain on conditional liberty, but she will be on parole, and not bail. And she will be subject to her head sentence until its complete expiry on 13 July 2013. Both of those aspects of the sentence structure are appropriate, and may be of assistance to the applicant as well as the community. 

14Nor will the sentence I propose suffer from the anomaly of an unusually low ratio between the new non-parole period and the new head sentence of count two. The ratio between them will be 68 per cent, and a finding of special circumstances in order to achieve that result is entirely apposite to doing justice in this case. And the relationship between the total non-parole period served by the applicant and the total head sentence to which she will be subject will be 76 per cent. 

15Finally, I should indicate that I have not overlooked the obligation contained in s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to order the release of the applicant at the end of the non-parole period. However, in light of the fact that the non-parole period I propose expired months ago and the applicant was indeed released on that date, it would be otiose for me to do so. 
Orders

16The orders I propose are:

(1)Leave to appeal granted with regard to the sentence for the offence in count two of supplying methadone.

(2)Appeal allowed.

(3)Sentence for count two quashed.

(4)In substitution, the applicant is sentenced on count two to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 2 years 13 days to date from 14 July 2010 and expire on 27 July 2012, with an additional term of 11 months 17 days to commence on 28 July 2012 and expire on 13 July 2013.

2760902,Braedon WILLIAMS v R [2013] NSWCCA 15,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hidden J.
2HIDDEN J:  The applicant, Braedon Kane Williams, pleaded guilty in the District Court to aggravated break, enter and steal, an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  He asked that a further offence of the same kind be taken into account on a Form 1.  Blackmore DCJ, taking the Form 1 matter into account, sentenced him to imprisonment for 4 years, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 12 February 2011, and a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months.  He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.  
3The grounds of the application are such that it is not necessary to examine the facts of the offences or the applicant's subjective case in detail.  The two offences were committed in the early hours of 12 February 2011 in the Albury area.  Each offence was committed in the company of two co-offenders, Nathan Sullivan and Eric Dwayne Williams.  Eric Williams is not related to the applicant.  In the principal offence a Caltex Service Station was broken into and cigarettes of a value in excess of $2,600 were stolen.  Roller doors to the premises were damaged in the process.  The Form 1 offence was a break-in at an IGA Supermarket, where alcohol of a value of a little over $770 was stolen.  
4The applicant was 22 years old at the time of the offences, and 23 at the time he was sentenced.  He is now 24.  He has a substantial criminal record.  A pre-sentence report before Judge Blackmore disclosed a disturbed upbringing.  He had limited education and a minimal employment history.  He developed a major problem of substance abuse, particularly alcohol.  Nevertheless, his Honour characterised the report as ""reasonably positive"", but noted that it was clear from the report that the applicant needed ""firm direction in order to change.""  
5The author of the pre-sentence report recommended that the sentencing court should order that the applicant ""enter a residential rehabilitation program for drug and alcohol addiction directly from custody so that there is no opportunity for him to relapse or to further delay that entry and direct that he is not to discharge himself from the program without the prior permission of his supervising officer.""  His Honour adopted that recommendation.  After setting the non-parole period, he said:
""I recommend your release to parole.  That recommendation is subject to the condition that the offender be placed in a full-time drug rehabilitation course directly from custody.  Parole should not be granted to this offender to be at large.  Once in that course, it will amount to a breach of parole if the offender leaves the course for any reason.""  
Co-offenders
6At the time he sentenced the applicant, Judge Blackmore also dealt with Nathan Sullivan.  Sullivan pleaded guilty to both offences.  He was sentenced to partly cumulative terms of imprisonment aggregating 4 years with an effective non-parole period of 3 years.  Sullivan is about 2 ½ years younger than the applicant.  He also had a substantial criminal history.  His pre-sentence report was unfavourable, and his Honour described his prospects of rehabilitation as ""negligible.""  He was subject to what his Honour described as ""a number of forms of conditional liberty"", which included a parole order, at the time of the offences.  
7Eric Williams was dealt with later by Frearson DCJ.  Like the applicant, he pleaded guilty to the offence at the service station and had the offence at the supermarket taken into account on a Form 1.  He received a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 2 years.  He is about 16 months older than the applicant.  He also had a significant criminal history, and he was subject to a 15 month suspended sentence for affray at the time of these offences.  
8However, having been in custody for about 3 months upon his arrest on 12 February 2011, he had been released on bail and had undergone a residential rehabilitation program for 12 months at a facility in Victoria called Granya House.  He had aquitted himself well at that program, and Judge Frearson treated that period as a form of quasi-custody which entitled him to an additional measure of leniency.  I shall refer to that principle when dealing with the first ground of this application.  His Honour found that he was remorseful, that he had made ""excellent progress towards rehabilitation,"" and that he was ""unlikely to re-offend in this way.""  Whilst mindful of the sentences passed on the applicant and Sullivan, he saw the case of Eric Williams as ""one of the rare cases"" where an offender appeared to have changed his life and where rehabilitation ""should receive more emphasis than in other cases.""
9Judge Frearson also dealt with the suspended sentence, revoking the bond and directing that Eric Williams serve the 15 month prison term.  However, he fixed a non-parole period of 3 months dating from 12 February 2011, which had effectively been served by the period the offender had been in custody before his release on bail.  
The application
10Counsel for the applicant, Mr Brady, argued the application on two grounds:
(1)  The sentence failed to take into account the quasi-custody of  the residential rehabilitation directed by his Honour.
(2)  A comparison of the applicant's sentence to those imposed upon his co-offenders gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
Quasi-custody
11I have referred to what was effectively a direction by Judge Blackmore that, if the applicant were granted parole, he should be placed immediately into a full-time drug rehabilitation program and should not be permitted to be at large.  There was evidence, to which his Honour did not expressly refer, that a position might be available to the applicant in the well known rehabilitation program conducted by Odyssey House.  A letter from that organisation disclosed that it was willing to ""induct"" the applicant into the program ""as soon as practicable"", and that the program would be ""of some 12 months duration.""  There was also a letter from Granya House offering him a position on a specified date while he was awaiting sentence if he were released on bail.  The letter did not disclose the length of the program.  He remained in custody and that opportunity was not available to him.  Mr Brady submitted that a rehabilitation program of that kind would amount to a form of quasi-custody which should have been taken into account, but his Honour failed to do so.  
12That it is appropriate for an offender to be given credit on sentence for having undergone a full-time residential rehabilitation program is not in doubt.  Mr Brady referred us to the recent decision of this court in Renshaw v R [2012] CCA 91, in which the principle was re-stated, with reference to relevant authority, by Hoeben JA at [28] - [32].  Among the cases referred to by Hoeben JA was R v Campbell [1999] NSWCCA 76, in which Kirby J noted that in earlier cases credit had been allowed for 50% or even 75% of the time spent in rehabilitation.  
13Two difficulties confront this submission.  The first is that, while it was open to his Honour to recommend conditions of a parole, he had no power to direct them.  Plainly enough, this is what he purported to do.  It is entirely understandable that his Honour took that course, given that it had been recommended by the Probation and Parole officer who prepared the pre-sentence report and the representatives of the Crown and the applicant before his Honour (who did not appear in this court) did not address the question whether he had the power to do so.  
14By s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a court imposing a sentence of 3 years or less must, if a non-parole period is specified, order that the offender be released on the expiration of that non-parole period.  In that event, s 51 empowers the court to impose conditions on that parole order.  That regime, however, is confined to sentences of 3 years or less.  Where the sentence is in excess of 3 years, the court cannot direct the release of an offender at the expiration of a non-parole period and cannot impose conditions upon any parole order which might be made.  In that situation, whether a parole order is made and, if so, what conditions are imposed upon it are matters for the Parole Authority, not the sentencing court: see ss 134 - 135 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, 244 CLR 120, at [4].  
15The second difficulty is that in Renshaw, and the earlier cases referred to by Hoeben JA, the offender had completed a rehabilitation program before sentence was passed.  Not only was the sentencing court able to assess the benefit of the program, it was able to be informed of the conditions of it and, in particular, the discipline which it imposed upon the offender.  We were not referred to any authority in which consideration was given to the extension of leniency on this basis in anticipation of an offender undertaking rehabilitation.
16All this Mr Brady acknowledged.  Nevertheless, he submitted that an allowance for prospective quasi-custody should have been made.  In the light of the evidence of the 12 month program at Odyssey House, he contended for a reduction of sentence of the order of 6 months.  (He noted that the program undertaken by Eric Williams at Granya House was also for 12 months.)  He argued that, in the light of what Judge Blackmore had to say, coupled with the recommendation of the author of the pre-sentence report, it was most likely that the applicant would not be released to parole except to undertake a course of residential rehabilitation and would not be allowed to be at large until he had completed it.  
17That may be so, but it cannot be predicted with any certainty.  Whether a place at Odyssey House, Granya House or any other program would be available when the applicant becomes eligible for parole is unknown.  Equally, whether it would be necessary or desirable for him to undertake such a program would fall to be determined at that time.  These are matters exclusively within the province of the Parole Authority, to be determined by it when the applicant becomes eligible for release.  Recommendations to the authority by a sentencing court are no more than that, and they may or may not be acted upon.  
18In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that an allowance for quasi-custody was called for.  In this context there is another matter raised by the Crown prosecutor in this court which is worthy of note.  Judge Blackmore said of both the applicant and Sullivan that, in the absence of pleas of guilty, he would have imposed a total sentence on each of them of 6 years and 6 months.  This he reduced by 25% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the pleas.  That reduction would produce a sentence, in round figures, of 4 years and 10 months.  His Honour reduced that term further so as to impose a 4 year sentence on both men.  He said that he did so ""in the hope that some initial consideration might lead to a change in these young men, particularly in the case of Mr Sullivan.""  He noted that Sullivan was ""still a young man and a lengthy sentence would be particularly difficult for him.""
19It is clear that that further reduction of 10 months was not in recognition of quasi-custody in the applicant's case because his Honour extended the same benefit to Sullivan, for whom a residential rehabilitation program was not in prospect.  It means no more than that his Honour extended additional leniency to both men in the light of their youth and in the hope of fostering their rehabilitation.  However, it is a relevant matter in determining whether the lack of an allowance to the applicant for quasi-custody has caused the sentencing process to miscarry.  I prefer to express no concluded view about whether a reduction of sentence for quasi-custody would ever be appropriate where an offender had the prospect of a rehabilitative program but has not yet undergone it.  In the present case, however, I do not consider that such an allowance was required and I would reject this ground of the application.
Parity/proportionality
20Mr Brady submitted that the relativity between the sentence passed upon the applicant and those passed upon Sullivan and Eric Williams was such as to engender in him a justifiable sense of grievance.  He acknowledged that there was no relevant distinction between the involvement of the three men in the offences, and founded his argument on a comparison of their subjective cases.  
21He pointed out that the applicant and Sullivan received the same head sentence despite the fact that Sullivan was subject to more than one form of conditional liberty at the time of the offences and could not make out a subjective case as favourable as the applicant.  While accepting that Sullivan was the younger of the two men, he noted Judge Blackmore's finding that the applicant showed some positive signs of rehabilitation whereas Sullivan's prospects of reform were bleak.  Indeed, his Honour said in his remarks that Sullivan's case was ""actually more serious"" than the applicant's and that the offences were ""committed whilst he was on conditional liberty.""  While the applicant's non-parole period was 3 months less than Sullivan's, Mr Brady argued that this was inadequate to mark the applicant's lesser criminality.  In that regard he also relied upon his argument that the applicant, unlike Sullivan, would be likely to spend a significant proportion of his parole period in residential rehabilitation.  
22As to Eric Williams, Mr Brady acknowledged that at the time he was sentenced he made out a much more favourable subjective case than the applicant.  This, he argued, was sufficiently reflected by Judge Frearson's order that the 2 year sentence be suspended.  He focused upon the nominal term of 2 years, arguing that such a marked disparity between that sentence and the applicant's sentence could not be justified.  He noted that Eric Williams was older than the applicant and that he had been on a bond associated with a suspended sentence at the time of the offences.  Moreover, Judge Frearson dealt with the breach of that bond in such a way as to impose no further punishment upon him.
23Mr Brady also pointed out that Judge Frearson, when considering the sentences passed upon the applicant and Sullivan, wrongly ascribed to the applicant the unfavourable subjective features which Judge Blackmore had found in Sullivan's case.  That is so, but it is not material for present purposes.  This court's task is to examine the evidence as it was and determine whether, viewed objectively, the applicant has been unfairly treated when regard is had to the sentence passed upon Eric Williams.  
24More than enough has been written by appellate courts on the subject of parity of sentence.  A helpful review of the relevant principles is to be found in the recent decision of this court in Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227, 214 A Crim R 191 at [77] - [83].  It is appropriate to set out some passages from that judgment which are germane to the present case.
25Relevantly to the complaint of a lack of proportionality between the applicant's sentence and the sentence imposed upon Sullivan, the court said at [77] - [78] (omitting references to authority):
""[77]  There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same judge, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them ... .
[78]  Where the same judge sentences two offenders at the same time and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences, having regard to the differing criminality of each, the differing subjective circumstances and relevant sentencing principles, this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance because of different sentencing outcomes ... .""

26Relevantly to the applicant's complaint about his sentence in comparison with the sentences passed upon both co-offenders, the court said at [83]:
""A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of a reasonable and impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated, having regard to the sentence passed upon the other offender.""
27What the court there said bears upon the issue of proportionality between the applicant's sentence and Sullivan's.  Of course, their sentences are not ""markedly"" different.  The complaint is not one of marked disparity, but rather the lack of it.  The applicant contends that he was entitled to be treated significantly more leniently than Sullivan.  As to Eric Williams, the complaint is one of marked disparity.  Both complaints raise the same question, that is, whether a comparison of the offender's sentence with those imposed upon the co-offenders, viewed objectively, conveys that justice has not been done to him.
28Dealing first with Sullivan's sentence, Judge Blackmore had the advantage of considering the cases of both men in the same proceeding.  It is clear that he was mindful of Sullivan's less favourable subjective case, particularly his commission of the present offences while subject to conditional liberty.  On the other hand, it is equally clear that he was particularly conscious of Sullivan's youth and was concerned to foster his rehabilitation, even though his prospects of reform were not encouraging.  It would have been open to his Honour to reflect the different subjective cases of the two men by extending greater leniency to the applicant, but it does not appear to me that a marked difference of sentence was called for such as to warrant the intervention of this court.
29The difference between the applicant's sentence and that imposed upon Eric Williams, of course, is marked.  However, Judge Frearson was well aware of the sentences passed upon Sullivan and the applicant when he took the course he did, and he decided that a very different approach should be taken in Eric Williams' case.  There was good reason for the measure of leniency which he extended.  Despite his unfavourable criminal history and his breach of conditional liberty, that offender had undergone a course of residential rehabilitation and had turned his life around.  It was clearly open to Judge Frearson to place particular emphasis upon rehabilitation and to treat the case as exceptional.  In these circumstances, the difference in sentence between the two men does not establish that the applicant has been unfairly treated.  
30This ground also is not made out.  I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

		14 February 2013",2013-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760904,Ronald EATTS v R [2013] NSWCCA 14,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hidden J.
2HIDDEN J:  The applicant, Ronald Edward Eatts, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges:
two charges of sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years;
a charge of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s 61J of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
The applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1, when sentencing him for the aggravated offence, two further offences of sexual intercourse without consent and one of indecent assault.  
3On 4 February 2009, the following sentences were imposed:
On each of the charges of sexual intercourse without consent, imprisonment for 9 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 7 years, dating from 29 October 2008;
On the charge of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years, also to date from 29 October 2008.
The overall sentence, then, was imprisonment for 12 years with an effective non-parole period of 9 years.  The significance of the commencement date of 29 October 2008 will become apparent.
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.  The application is some 3 years out of time, and his application for extension of time is founded upon the material in an affidavit of his solicitor.  In written submissions, the Crown prosecutor challenged the adequacy of the explanation proffered by that affidavit and argued that an extension should not be permitted.  However, the issue was not addressed in oral submissions, counsel for the applicant and the Crown both dealing with the merit of the matter.  Given the seriousness of the offences, and the length and practical effect of the sentences imposed, I would grant an extension of time.  
Facts
5The offences were committed in the course of a single episode at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre at Silverwater, where both the applicant and the victim were in custody.  The applicant was 26 years old at the time and the victim was 19.  They shared a cell.  The offences occurred in the late afternoon of 4 April 2004, while they were both in the cell after the evening lockdown.  No purpose would be served by recounting the facts, which were dreadful.  It is sufficient to say that during the episode the unfortunate victim was anally raped twice and forced to fellate the applicant on three occasions.  There were accompanying indignities which need not be described.  It was a sustained sexual attack of the most brutal and degrading kind.  
6It will be noted that the applicant was not sentenced until almost 5 years later.  However, for reasons which are not apparent, he was not charged until September 2007, some 3 ½ years after the offences.  
Subjective case 
7As I have said, the applicant was 26 years old at the time of the offences.  He is now 34.  He is of Aboriginal extraction.  He had a disturbed upbringing, marked by the violence of his father, who served a number of gaol sentences.  He had virtually no education, his schooling having ended after year 4.  Not surprisingly, perhaps, he has a history of psychiatric illness and drug abuse.  A forensic psychiatrist who examined him was of the opinion that he was suffering from a psychotic episode at the time of the offences, although he did not find a direct connection between the psychotic symptoms and the offending behaviour.  The sentencing judge did not see in this material any reason to diminish the significance of specific and general deterrence.  No issue was taken with that approach in this application.  Nor was it argued that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive.  
8Of primary significance for present purposes is the applicant's criminal and custodial history.  He has a formidable criminal record, commencing in the Children's Court in the early 1990s, although it contains no entry of the nature of the present offences.  At the time of those offences he was waiting to be dealt with for serious robbery offences and receiving stolen property.  
9On 8 April 2004, 4 days after the present offences, he was sentenced to terms aggregating 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months, dating from 27 July 2003, for two counts of armed robbery and one of receiving.  That total sentence was to expire on 28 October 2011, and the non-parole period on 28 October 2008.  On 10 June 2005, for an offence of aggravated robbery, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, dating from 29 October 2005.  That sentence was to expire and the non-parole period also expired on 28 October 2008.  The sentencing judge in the present case directed the sentences he imposed to commence upon the expiration of that existing non-parole period, that is, on 29 October 2008.
10It is necessary also to have regard to the applicant's earlier history of incarceration.  It need not be examined in detail.  What it discloses is that, as a result of earlier sentences and the revocation of parole, he had been in virtually continuous custody in adult institutions since 1 July 1997.  This period was punctuated by brief periods on parole: 56 days between 9 March and 14 May 1999, 27 days between 1 June and 28 June 1999, and 47 days between 12 June and 29 July 2003: a total of 130 days, roughly 4 months.  The effective non-parole period for the present offences will expire on 28 October 2017.  By then, putting aside his brief periods of liberty, he will have been in custody for almost 20 years and 4 months.  
The application
11Hence the present application.  The overall sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years preserves the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.  The complaint is that his Honour should have found special circumstances, so as to vary that proportion in the applicant's favour, because of the accumulation of that sentence upon the non-parole period associated with the sentences he was then serving, and having regard to his lengthy custodial history.  
12In written submissions filed in support of the application it was pointed out that, if one had regard to the non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months upon which the present sentences were accumulated, the aggregate term would be 17 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months.  The proportion between non-parole period and sentence in that event is about 82.5%.  If one were to have regard to the total period of virtually continuous custody from 1 July 1997, the 12 year sentence, expiring on 28 October 2020, would terminate roughly 23 years and 4 months after the commencement of that period.  The period of 20 odd years which the applicant would have served by the time he became eligible for parole would represent about 87% of that total term.  
13It was contended that on either approach the 9 year non-parole period should have been reduced so as to achieve a ratio of 75% of the overall sentence.  The second approach, having to regard to the whole period of custody from 1997, was put as the preferable course.  In that way, it was argued, the proportion between effective non-parole period and total term would be such as to achieve a beneficial period of parole eligibility, and guard against the risk of the applicant becoming institutionalised.
14The application was argued before us by Ms Loukas of counsel (now senior counsel.)  She referred to a passage of my judgment in Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213 at [29], in which I did no more than summarise the effect of existing authority: 
""It is well established that accumulation of sentence, whether by reference to sentences passed on one occasion or to a sentence which the offender is already serving, is a basis for a finding of special circumstances. Equally, it is well established that whether special circumstances are found for that reason is a matter for judgment in each case. Certainly, there is not a general requirement that the proportion between effective non-parole period and aggregate sentence should not exceed 75%. Nevertheless, where it does, one would expect the sentencing judge to articulate his or her reasons for doing so and, in the absence of such reasons, the inference might be drawn that the practical effect of the accumulation was overlooked: R v Nightingale [2005] NSWCCA 147, per Tobias JA (with whom Buddin and Hall JJ agreed) at [39] - [46].""
15The risk of institutionalisation as a basis for a finding of special circumstances also arose for consideration in that case, and authorities on that matter were referred to at [30] - [31].  
16Ms Loukas referred to a passage early in the remarks on sentence in which his Honour noted that the sentences which the applicant was then serving provided for parole eligibility in October 2008 and would expire in their entirety in October 2012.  He said that he proposed to commence the sentences he was to pass at the expiration of the non-parole period, noting that it would be ""unfair"" to delay the commencement of those sentences until the ""conclusion of the parole period in 2012.""  Ms Loukas noted that, because of s 55 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that latter course would not have been available.  She cited R v Killick [2002] NSWCCA 1, 127 A Crim R 273.  That his Honour thought the sentences could be post-dated in that way, she submitted, conveyed that he was not attentive to ""the relevant principles in relation to accumulation"" and underlined her central argument that he overlooked the practical effect of the measure of accumulation which he did impose.  
17I do not find this argument persuasive.  The fact remains that his Honour accumulated the sentences he imposed upon the previous non-parole period, in conformity with s 55.  Moreover, other observations in the remarks on sentence demonstrate that his Honour was well aware of the practical effect of the course he was to take.  He observed that the applicant had ""spent an extraordinary part of his life in custody.""  Later, he said:
""The courts have employed all sentencing options in the management of this offender but he has persisted.  ...
His custodial history presents a dismal picture.  ...  Upon my calculations this thirty-year-old man has been at large for less than 6 months of his adult life.""  
18Finally, having indicated that he proposed to make the sentences he was to pass concurrent, his Honour said:
""I am concerned that this offender is reaching a point in his life where some care has to be taken to avoid the risk that he will become entirely institutionalised.  He is thirty years of age.  There may yet be some hope that within the next ten years of his life he may be assisted to reach a point where he can make an adjustment so that he can transition from where he is into the community.  A sentence beyond what I believe is appropriate in this case is likely to have such a crushing impact that he will be, for all intents and purposes, suitable only for life within the prison system or the Justice Health facilities that will be available to him there.  It is for those reasons that I believe I should order that these sentences be served concurrently.""  
19While expressed as a reason for concurrence of sentence, that last passage demonstrates that his Honour was well aware of the implications of his sentencing order upon a man who had already spent so much of his adult life in custody.  The issue of institutionalisation was expressly addressed.  Although he did not refer in terms to accumulation as a possible basis for a finding of special circumstances, I would not infer that his Honour overlooked the practical effect of his accumulation of sentences upon the applicant's previous non-parole period.  The applicant, with a substantial criminal history behind him, stood for sentence for appalling crimes.  His Honour gave him the benefit of concurrent sentences for those crimes, and structured the sentences in such a way as to provide for a substantial period of parole eligibility, 3 years.  I have given anxious consideration to this serious and unusual case, but I am not satisfied that in this approach his Honour fell into error.
20I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
21ADAMSON J:  I agree with Hidden J.

		14 February 2013",2013-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760906,R v Kaewklom (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 59,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1JOHNSON J: The Offender, Kukiat Kaewklom, is before the Court for sentence for two serious crimes of violence committed in February 2011. On 10 February 2011, the Offender (then aged 18 years) beat and seriously injured a 15-year old girl with whom he had been in a relationship. On 15 February 2011, whilst in custody for this offence, the Offender fatally attacked, by way of kicking and stomping, an elderly prisoner (who was a stranger to him) who was in a cell with the Offender at the Liverpool Local Court.

2On 5 September 2012, the trial of the Offender for the murder of his fellow prisoner, Frederick McGregor, commenced before a jury. The Offender pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter, a plea not accepted by the Crown. The trial proceeded with the jury being informed that the issue for determination was whether the Offender ought be convicted of murder, or of manslaughter upon the grounds of substantial impairment. 

3On 10 September 2012, the Offender sought to be arraigned again in the presence of the jury and he pleaded guilty to murder. The circumstances in which the change of plea occurred are considered in earlier judgments of the Court: R v Kaewklom (No. 1) [2012] NSWSC 1103; R v Kaewklom (No. 2) [2012] NSWSC 1117. Put shortly, the Offender's change of plea followed the communication to the Offender's trial counsel that the forensic psychiatrist retained for the Offender, Dr Bruce Westmore, had altered his view, in light of the report of the Crown's forensic psychiatrist, Professor David Greenberg, and that his opinion no longer supported the partial defence of substantial impairment. 

4A sentencing hearing proceeded before me on 8 November 2012. 

5By that time, the Crown and Ms Manuell SC, counsel for the Offender, agreed that the charge of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to the 15-year old girl on 10 February 2011, for which the Offender had been committed for sentence to the District Court, should be transferred to this Court so that the Offender could be sentenced for both offences at the same time. 

6A direction was given by the Chief Justice for the purpose of s.128(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to permit this approach to be taken. The sentencing hearing on 8 November 2012 extended to both offences. 

7The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life: s.19A(1) Crimes Act 1900. A standard non-parole period of 20 years applies to this offence. 

8The maximum penalty for an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm is imprisonment for 10 years: s.35(2) Crimes Act 1900. A standard non-parole period of four years applies to this offence. 
 
Facts of Offences

9The Crown tendered a separate Statement of Facts with respect to each offence. What follows is drawn from those statements, and from associated photographs and video and audio recordings tendered by the Crown. 

The Offence on 10 February 2011

10The Offender was born in July 1992 and was 18 years and six months' old in February 2011. The Offender and his 15-year old former girlfriend, X, had been in a relationship for two years. I will refer to this young victim as X to guard against publication of her identity: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

11During their relationship, the Offender was invited to live with X and her parents at an address in Fairfield. Towards the end of December 2010, X's parents requested the Offender to move out and live elsewhere. The Offender left the premises and resided at a friend's house in Berala.

12The relationship continued until the end of January 2011, when the Offender disclosed to X that he had cheated on her. The relationship ceased, but they maintained contact with each other until the beginning of February 2011. 

13At about 2.30 am on Thursday, 10 February 2011, the Offender called X by mobile phone and argued with her, with X eventually agreeing to see the Offender. The Offender drove to a location near X's residence and collected her. They then drove to Cabramatta and purchased some cigarettes. They drove to a car park area in Lansvale. 

14The Offender and X had a conversation, which included the Offender making sexual advances towards her, with X refusing these advances and requesting that he take her home.

15As a result of X's rejection, the Offender became enraged. He said ""Do you wanna see me angry, do you wanna see me angry, I'll show you what angry is"". The Offender then hit X three to four times to the face whilst they were both inside the vehicle.

16The Offender then exited the vehicle by the driver's door and forcibly dragged X from the vehicle. The Offender continued to punch X numerous times whilst she was on the ground. The Offender also kicked and stomped on X whilst she was on the ground. 

17X called ""000"" and the call was recorded. The recording was played at the sentencing hearing. The call reveals a vivid contemporaneous record of the anger and violence of the Offender and the understandable fear of X:

""OPERATOR: Please go ahead Telstra.

TELSTRA OPERATOR: xxx no request, no location.

OPERATOR: Police emergency go ahead.

X: No, no, I'm sorry.

OPERATOR: Hello. 

X [to the Offender]: I'm sorry please leave me alone.

OFFENDER [to X]: ....(INAUDIBLE) ... Fucking ... bring fucking
people here, you fucking dog bitch.

X [to the Offender]: I'm sorry please stop hitting me.

OFFENDER [to X]: Bitch.

OPERATOR: Hello can you hear me? Can you tell me the address? Where are you?

OFFENDER [to X]: I love you so much, you're fucking lucky bitch ... Fucking slut.

OPERATOR: Hello can you please tell me where you are? 

OFFENDER [to X]: Get up now.
 
X: (MOANING)

OPERATOR: Tell me the suburb that you're in?""

18X then lost consciousness. Her next memory was regaining consciousness in the Offender's vehicle.

19About 11.00 am on 10 February 2011, X recalls being driven by the Offender towards her home. On the trip home, the Offender asked her if she was going to tell anyone what happened. She said that she would not. The Offender asked what she would tell her mother. X said that she would tell her mother that she had been bashed in Cabramatta. The Offender said ""Good, because if you tell anyone about it and I find out, I'll make sure your fucked up eye is hanging out"". I note (as the photographs of her confirm) that X had a serious and visible injury to her right eye as a result of the Offender's attack upon her.

20The Offender refused to drive X all the way home, and he dropped her off about 200 metres away. 

21X went home and called her mother. Her mother returned home and saw X's injuries. X's mother immediately drove her to Fairfield Police Station and an ambulance was called. X originally told police that she had been assaulted by some girls in Cabramatta. She did this because she was afraid of the Offender.

22X was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital, and was treated for her injuries which included the following:

(a) fractured right eye socket;

(b) a laceration to the top of the head, two centimetres long and one centimetre deep;

(c) deep bruising to her facial area;

(d) tenderness to the left abdomen;

(e) red marks to the neck area;

(f) abrasions/swelling to her knees and foot.

23Photographs depicting the injuries to X were tendered on sentence. They confirm the gravity of the attack by the Offender upon her.

24At about 10.16 pm on 14 February 2011, the Offender, who had become aware that police were looking for him for the assault upon X, voluntarily attended the Cabramatta Police Station and asked to speak with the detectives. After a short conversation, the Offender was arrested for causing grievous bodily harm.

25The Offender was then escorted to the charge room at the police station at about 11.00 pm. He was read his rights and then signed the appropriate documentation to state he had received and understood his rights. The Offender then participated in an electronic recorded interview between 11.58 pm on 14 February 2011 and 1.44 am on 15 February 2011. In the course of this interview, the Offender denied his involvement in the assault and concocted a false account of how X came to receive her injuries. 

26The Offender told police in the interview that on the night of 9 February 2011, he drank a significant amount of beer and spirits. He said that he received a telephone call from X asking him to pick her up from Cabramatta. He then drove to the bus stop near the train station and collected her. He said that, when she got into the car, X was bleeding and bruised. He drove her to a car park at Lansvale and they talked. He alleged that X told him she had been assaulted by some Asian girls and refused to go to the hospital. 

27When told by police that X alleged that he had assaulted her, the Offender suggested that X may have made up this allegation because he had slept with two of her friends, and also because X was seeing a psychologist.

28CCTV footage from Cabramatta, and available telephone records, demonstrated that the account given by the Offender in the interview was false. 

The Offence of Murder on 15 February 2011

29Following the record of interview which concluded in the early hours of 15 February 2011, the Offender was charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to X and was refused bail. At about 4.00 am, he was placed in a cell at the Cabramatta Police Station next to the murder victim, Frederick McGregor.

30The Offender was a fit and powerfully built, 18-year old young man.

31Mr McGregor was 69 years of age. He was slightly built and weighed 55 kilograms. At about 7.40 pm on 14 February 2011, Mr McGregor, who was on the Child Protection Register, had been transferred from Green Valley Police Station to the Cabramatta Police Station after being arrested for a breach of a residential condition of his bail, and was refused bail by police to appear before the Liverpool Local Court on 15 February 2011.

32Following his arrest, Mr McGregor was abusive towards police and was observed to be intoxicated.

33At around 2.00 am on 15 February 2011, Mr McGregor woke up and pressed the emergency buzzer in his cell. He then yelled abuse at the police and was quite belligerent. His behaviour continued for some time until he was observed to be asleep at 3.55 am.

34At about 5.45 am, Mr McGregor was awake and yelled out and annoyed the police. A police officer responded, telling Mr McGregor to ""shut up"" and calling him several derogatory names, including ""rock spider"" and ""cockroach"". 

35At this time, the Offender was observed to be lying down on his bed. 

36Mr McGregor continued yelling, banging and pressing the buzzer in his cell at regular intervals until some time after 7.00 am, before finally falling asleep.

37At some time after 8.15 am, police arrived at Cabramatta Police Station to transport the Offender and Mr McGregor to the Liverpool Local Court complex. During the preparation stage of transfer, both the Offender and Mr McGregor were woken up separately, strip searched and removed from their cells and placed into the holding dock separately without incident.

38The Offender and Mr McGregor did not have any interaction during the period of time they were held at Cabramatta Police Station.

39Just before 9.00 am, both men were handcuffed and again separately conveyed and placed in the rear of a police caged vehicle without incident, and without any communication occurring between them. 

40The Offender and Mr McGregor were then transferred to Liverpool Local Court, a journey occupying some 10-15 minutes. Police did not observe any verbal interaction or any eye contact between the two men, who sat at opposite corners of the caged section of the police van. 

41On arrival at Liverpool Local Court, at around 9.15 am, the police handed over custody of the Offender and Mr McGregor to Corrective Services officers, who placed the Offender in Cell 1 at about 9.24 am, where he was again strip searched. Mr McGregor was then placed in the same cell at about 9.29 am. 

42Between 9.25 am and 9.54 am, the Offender and Mr McGregor remained in the cell together. Mr McGregor continued to bang on the door of the cell and yell abuse at the Corrective Services officers.

43At 9.54 am, the Offender was escorted from the cell to the legal room to speak to a Legal Aid lawyer for about half-an-hour. The question of bail was discussed and the Offender was told that he would need a place to reside and a surety.

44At around 10.25 am, the Offender returned to Cell 1 and Mr McGregor was then escorted to the legal room. 

45From 10.25 am until 10.32 am, the Offender kicked the wall and stretched his arms. He then began to pace the length of the cell and, as time went on, the speed of his pacing increased.

46I observe at this point that events inside Cell 1 described so far and to follow were captured on CCTV, with the recording being shown during the sentencing hearing. 

47At about 10.32 am, Mr McGregor returned from the legal room to the cell and stood near the door of the cell with his back to the Offender. The Offender continued to pace up and down the cell.

48Mr McGregor moved away from the door of the cell and stood about one metre from the cell door and hugged the alcove wall around the toilet block. The Offender continued to quickly walk the length of the cell, but was required to alter his direction due to the movements of Mr McGregor.

49At 10.34 am, Mr McGregor moved back to the door and at 10.34.49 am, Mr McGregor, after banging on the door one last time, turned away from the door and walked diagonally across the cell, walking just in front of the path of the Offender.

50A second later, the Offender grabbed Mr McGregor from behind, grasped the top of the victim's clothing around the shoulder area and threw him to the ground. Mr McGregor landed on the ground parallel to the front wall of the cell. He appeared to hit the wall and he faced the wall when the Offender kicked him to the back.

51The Offender (who was wearing shoes) then repeatedly stomped and jumped with his two feet on the head and upper chest area of Mr McGregor approximately 20 times. The Offender placed his hands on the wall in front of Mr McGregor as he continued to stomp and jump on him. The Offender used both feet to stomp on Mr McGregor. The Offender's last action was to step back and forcefully kick the victim to the head.

52The attack by the Offender upon Mr McGregor had occupied some 22 seconds. 

53After the forceful kick to the head of the victim, the Offender walked away and paced the length of the cell twice more before a Corrective Services officer entered the cell. Officers had heard noises and went to investigate and saw the victim lying on the floor of the cell.

54The Offender was removed from Cell 1 and was placed in Cell 2. The Offender then paced in this cell before what appeared to be an attempt to wash the blood off his shoes from the toilet basin at about 10.30 am. This was observed by a Corrective Services officer, and the Offender was handcuffed and taken to Cell 4 at 10.31 am, before being made to take off his shoes. Blood was visible on the sole and side of the Offender's shoes.

55On the way to Cell 4, a Corrective Services officer had the following conversation with the Offender:

""OFFICER: What did you do that for?

OFFENDER: He is a paedophile.

OFFICER: How do you know this?

OFFENDER: The boys in the cells last night said so.

OFFICER: He's just some old guy who has breached his bail.""

56Corrective Services staff had rendered first aid to Mr McGregor, who was unconscious and bleeding profusely from an ear and was making gargling noises. Ambulance officers attended a short time later and conveyed the victim to Liverpool Hospital.

57Crime scene officers attended and conducted an examination of the cells and seized the Offender's shoes, which were observed to have blood and hair on them. Later forensic examination revealed that the blood and hair was that of the victim.

58Mr McGregor was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital and the following injuries were noted:

(a) complex bilateral cranial vault fractures;

(b) depressed left parietal fracture;

(c) skull fracture;

(d) complex petrous temporal bone and facial bone fractures;

(e) left temporoparietal extradural haematoma;

(f) subdural haematoma in middle and left posterior cranial fossae;

(g) minor intraventricular haemorrhage;

(h) left side rib fractures.

59A craniotomy was performed on Mr McGregor. He was placed on a life-support system. However, he did not recover. On 25 February 2011, his life-support system was turned off and Mr McGregor died.

60A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr McGregor had died as a result of head injuries. The forensic pathologist, Dr Wills, noted that the left side rib fractures were indicative of blunt injury to the left side of the chest and were consistent with stomping and/or kicking. The complex skull fractures indicated the application of a severe degree of blunt force to the head.

61On 15 February 2011, the Offender was arrested and taken to Liverpool Police Station. He was interviewed concerning the attack upon Mr McGregor. The Agreed Statement of Facts records that, in brief, the Offender told the police during the interview:

""* He barely spoke with the victim because a police officer told him that the victim was a paedophile so he did not want to speak to him.

* He did not communicate with the victim when in the cell together.

* He left the cell to speak with the Legal Aid solicitor and the victim was banging on the walls.

* He returned to the cell and the victim was still banging on the walls and was being loud.

* He grabbed the victim and 'blanked out'.

* He was angry 'cause the banging interrupted me talking to the Legal Aid lady.'

* He grabbed the victim by the shirt and wanted to tell the victim to shut up.

* He 'lost his head', got 'aggro' and didn't control himself and threw the victim to the ground.

* When asked if he had kicked the victim he replied 'I'd say so, there was blood on my shoes.'

* He did not try to do anything with the blood on his shoes, specifically did not try to remove it.

* When he approached the victim he wanted to 'shut him up.'

* He 'loses it' when he is 'having a really bad day' and today he was having a 'bad day.'

* The offender agreed that the only reason he grabbed the victim was because the victim annoyed him and banged on the wall.

* He does not remember doing anything and cannot remember how he was feeling when he grabbed the victim.

* He felt really weird in the head and feels like this when he is 'about to fight, when I drink too much.'

* He has not been drinking but his interview and court case affected him.

* He did not hit the victim because he was worried that the victim was a paedophile but rather because he was banging on the walls.

* He had no issues with the victim in the truck, no fights, no arguments."" 

62The Offender was then charged with attempted murder. Upon the death of the victim on 25 February 2011, the Offender was charged with the murder of Mr McGregor.

63The Offender has remained in custody since 15 February 2011. 

The Offender's Subjective Circumstances

64Evidence concerning the Offender's subjective circumstances is to be found in the reports of Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg. The Offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.

65The Offender was born in Thailand in July 1992. He came to Australia at the age of six years with his mother, who raised him in Australia.

66Professor Greenberg noted that the Offender had a turbulent family background, with a troubled youth and a pattern of aggression and a poor relationship with his mother and her partners. The Offender moved out of home and lived initially with various friends as a teenager, leaving school at about 14 years of age and working in several unskilled capacities on a part-time basis and living briefly in refuges and drawing Centrelink payments. 

67The Offender stated that he had abused alcohol since the age of 14 or 15 years. He also reported substance abuse including use of cannabis, LSD and crystal methamphetamines.

68The Offender stated that his mother lived with her partner at Merrylands and that he did not get on with this partner. He stated that he had a seven-year old half-brother from his mother's second relationship.

69The Offender's history contained entries in the Children's Court for two relatively minor matters which occurred when the Offender was aged 14 and 15 years. Counsel accepted that these matters were not significant for the purpose of sentence in this Court.

70Provided to Professor Greenberg were a range of documents relevant to the Offender's background which were summarised in his report of 1 September 2012 (Exhibit G, pages 13-14). The Offender attended the Penrith Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service in November 2006 presenting with problems of anger outbursts and polysubstance abuse. 

71Professor Greenberg observed that the Offender had a history and a pattern of difficulties with anger management dating back to when he was seven years of age. 

72Professor Greenberg observed that, at the time of the offences, the Offender was ""an 18 year old immature, somewhat naïve youth"" (Exhibit G, page 28). 

73It should be observed that Professor Greenberg regarded the Offender to be ""an unreliable historian"" (Exhibit G, page 28), a view not disputed by Dr Westmore in his last report of 11 September 2012 (part Exhibit 1). The Offender had changed his account, in a number of important respects, when Professor Greenberg examined him on 25 and 31 August 2012. Put shortly, Professor Greenberg considered that there was ""a strong probability that [the Offender] may be retrospectively malingering psychotic symptoms to explain his behaviour"" at the time of the offence and/or ""embellishing past history to support his current version"" (Exhibit G, page 26).

74Dr Westmore agreed with Professor Greenberg that the Offender suffers from significant personality problems and, if not an antisocial personality disorder, certainly strong antisocial personality traits (Exhibit 1, report of 11 September 2012, page 3). 

75Both Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg referred to the fact that the Offender has been treated with antipsychotic medication whilst in custody. This was done upon the basis of ""self-reports of psychotic and depressive symptoms"" (Exhibit G, page 26). A complicating factor, however, in determining issues concerning the Offender is that he has proved to be an unreliable historian. 

76Justice Health records confirmed that the Offender was being treated within the prison system with antipsychotic medication in September 2012 (Exhibit 2).

77I will return to issues concerning the Offender's risk of reoffending and his prospects of rehabilitation later in these remarks.

The Offender's Pleas of Guilty

78The Offender pleaded guilty to the s.35(2) offence in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. It is common ground between counsel that this plea was entered at the earliest opportunity so that the Offender should receive a discount of 25% on sentence for this offence. I accept this submission and will take this approach on sentence for this offence.

79The position is more complicated with respect to the murder charge. The Offender went to trial, and then pleaded guilty during the trial. Thereafter, on 17 September 2012, the Offender indicated that he wished to withdraw his plea of guilty to murder and proceed to trial, an application which I held was not open in law to the Offender: R v Kaewklom (No. 2). 

80Ms Manuell SC acknowledged that, against this background, it is difficult to assess the quantum of any discount to be given to the Offender for his guilty plea. It was submitted that a ""modest discount"" was warranted to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea as there were some identifiable cost savings to the community, albeit not as substantial as if the plea had been entered before trial.

81The Crown submitted that the Offender would be entitled to a ""very minor discount"" given the circumstances of the case. 

82Applying the principles in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at 10-11 [32] and R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [73]-[77], I propose to allow a modest discount (which I will not quantify) for the Offender's very late plea of guilty to murder.
 
The Offender's Youth

83Both the Crown and Ms Manuell SC submit that the Offender should be sentenced for the s.35(2) offence upon the basis of anger and frustration on his part at the response of X to his advances, and that the murder offence occurred in a context of anger, tiredness and frustration that he found himself in custody for the charge arising from the attack on X.

84The Crown pointed to the objective gravity of both offences, but acknowledged that there being very little, if any, evidence of premeditation, some weight should be afforded to the Offender as a result of his youth.

85Ms Manuell SC accepted that the crimes were serious, but submitted that the offences (and, in particular, the murder offence) constituted a very immature response by the Offender to the frustrations he had experienced in the previous 24 hours. Senior counsel conceded that the sentences should reflect a need for deterrence and retribution, but that the youth of the Offender remained a significant factor on sentence.

86In approaching the Offender's youth as a factor on sentence, I keep in mind Professor Greenberg's assessment of the Offender's relative immaturity referred to earlier (at [72]). It may be said that the Offender's immaturity played a part in the commission of an act of sudden violence: R v Dannevig [2012] NSWSC 1013 at [68]. There was no rational motive or advantage for the Offender to attack Mr McGregor in the cell, in circumstances where it was obvious that only the Offender was the assailant, leaving aside the fact that the whole episode was recorded on CCTV. This was a pointless and gratuitous attack upon Mr McGregor. 

87That said, the gravity and ferocity of his crimes of violence, committed on separate occasions over a five-day period, with both involving cowardly attacks upon the heads of vulnerable victims by way of kicking and stomping, emphasise the continuing need for specific and general deterrence and retribution to be reflected significantly in the sentences to be imposed, applying the principles in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 at [22]-[26]. 

The Offender's Mental Condition

88Ms Manuell SC advanced a submission that the Offender's mental health issues should be taken into account in his favour on sentence in accordance with the principles in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]-[178]. 

89A difficulty with this submission is that the Offender bears the onus of proof, on the civil standard, to satisfy the Court that any of these considerations may operate in the Offender's favour on sentence. Both of the forensic psychiatrists accept that the Offender is an unreliable historian. 

90There is agreement that certain diagnoses may be made concerning the Offender, but these diagnoses do not, in my view, assist the offender in consideration of any of the factors identified in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa in this case.

91Ms Manuell SC did not contend that the Offender's mental health issues contributed to the commission of either of the offences in a material way so that his moral culpability may be reduced (T35.44, 8 November 2012). Nor did senior counsel submit that this was a case where the Offender's mental health issues rendered him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (T36.1). 

92I am not satisfied that any of the principles identified in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa are engaged in the Offender's favour on sentence.

93As both Professor Greenberg and Dr Westmore observed, an opportunity to undertake a longitudinal assessment of the Offender over the long term in custody will assist the process of diagnosis and (if necessary) treatment.

Remorse or Contrition

94The Crown submitted that the Offender had not evidenced remorse or contrition for his crimes, in a way which satisfied the requirements of s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms Manuell SC did not contend that contrition or remorse had been demonstrated by the Offender. 

95The Offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offence arising from his attack on X. However, there is no positive evidence of remorse on his part for that offence.

96The Offender went to trial on the charge of murder, changing his plea during the trial, although thereafter indicating a desire once again to plead not guilty to the charge. The varying accounts given by the Offender to Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg do not provide any evidentiary foundation for a finding of contrition or remorse on his part for the murder. 

97In these circumstances, I do not find that the Offender has demonstrated remorse or contrition for either of these crimes. 

Objective Gravity of the Offences

98Each offence carries a standard non-parole period so that the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 should be kept in mind on sentence. The standard non-parole period is a guidepost to be taken into account, together with the maximum penalty as part of the instinctive synthesis process. The standard non-parole period refers to the statutory concept of objective seriousness.

99Both the Crown and Ms Manuell SC submitted that the murder offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

100With respect to the s.35(2) offence, the Crown submitted that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness and no contrary submission was advanced for the Offender. 

101I accept the submissions of counsel concerning the statutory concept of objective seriousness.

102Counsel addressed matters bearing upon the broader common law concept of the objective gravity of the Offender's crimes.

103With respect to the offence of murder, the Crown submitted that the Offender acted with an intention to kill as evidenced by the ferocity of the repeated stomping, at times with two feet, upon the head of Mr McGregor and the callousness and placement of the final vicious kick to the head. Ms Manuell SC submitted that the nature of the attack does not necessarily establish that the Offender had an intention to kill rather than an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, as either result could have ensued from the Offender's action. 

104I am satisfied that the Offender's actions established that he acted with an intention to inflict very severe grievous bodily harm upon the victim. There is some question as to whether an intention to kill ought be inferred, to the criminal standard, from his actions. No admission of an intention to kill was made. That said, I consider that this is a case where there is little difference in the moral culpability of the Offender flowing from his intention: Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 11 at [1], [44]-[45]. 

105No act of Mr McGregor could amount to a form of provocation. The Offender's attack was upon a stranger who had the misfortune to be in the same cell as the Offender arising from the Offender's anger, tiredness and frustration at his predicament. The Offender had come to the police station on the evening of 14 February 2011 believing that he could talk his way out of any charge of attacking X, but instead found himself charged and in custody.

106Although the offence was ferocious, it was spontaneous and relatively brief so that Mr McGregor was not subjected to a protracted period of terror. That said, the very ferocity of the sustained and cowardly attack upon Mr McGregor involving a solidly built, fit, 18-year old man assailing a 69-year old slightly built and frail man for no good reason, constituted an explosive and chilling act of violence.

107It is the case, as submitted for the Offender, that no weapon was used during the attack. However, in a practical sense, the Offender's feet were used as a type of weapon to attack the head of Mr McGregor by way of kicking and stomping as he lay prone and helpless on the ground: AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 at [79]. 

108The earlier attack upon X involved an entirely unprovoked and unwarranted attack upon a teenage girl, who had done nothing more than reject the Offender's advances. The ""000"" call and photographs provide vivid support for X's account of a sustained and brutal attack upon her, involving kicking and stomping to the head. The Offender threatened to harm X if she told the truth, and showed little concern for her by not taking her home and leaving her in the street. 

Relevance of the Murder Being Committed in Custody

109It is the case that the Offender attacked Mr McGregor at a time when both men were in custody in a cell attached to a courthouse. 

110Courts in this State have emphasised that considerations of deterrence are of particular importance in sentencing for offences of violence which occur within the prison system. It is the obligation of the courts to do their best to maintain proper order and discipline in prisons by punishing, with appropriate severity, violent crimes committed within the prison system: R v Kamotu (NSWCCA, 24 August 1995, BC9501870 at pages 7-8, per Gleeson CJ, Allen and Simpson JJ agreeing). Officers who administer prison communities are entitled to expect that inmates will be deterred from offending, and inmates serving their sentences are entitled to as much protection as the courts can afford them: R v Fyffe [2002] NSWSC 751 at [33]; R v Hore; R v Fyffe [2005] NSWCCA 3 at [351]ff; R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [56].

111The Offender and Mr McGregor were not being detained in a prison. Each man had been in custody for a comparatively short time, in facilities adjacent to the Local Court in which each was to appear that morning. Some of the considerations which apply to sentence for crimes of violence committed by one prisoner against another in a prison setting have limited application in this context. 

112However, there are some factors relevant to a prison murder case which are pertinent to the sentencing of the Offender. Using some of the concepts applied by Barr J in sentencing a prison murderer in R v Knight [2004] NSWSC 498 at [17]-[18], it may be said that persons in police or courthouse custody are ""particularly vulnerable people"" because they ""have no choice about where"" they are placed, and ""cannot choose the company they keep"". In imposing sentences for offences committed upon persons in custody, the Court must impose sentences calculated to discourage such offences in recognition of the vulnerability of persons in custody.

113I bear in mind that no process of classification or protection assessment had been undertaken with respect to the Offender and Mr McGregor for the purpose of what was going to be, on any view, a temporary placement of the two men in a cell. 

114Further, it was common ground between counsel on sentence that I should approach the Offender's case upon the basis that this was a spontaneous attack by the Offender upon the victim, arising from anger, frustration and tiredness, with some element of irritation because the victim had been noisy whilst in custody, but not because the Offender in some way targeted the victim because he believed he was, in some way, a child sex offender. It is noteworthy that the Offender had no prior custodial experience, and thus had not been exposed to the thought processes well known in prisons, where child sex offenders are frequently regarded as appropriate subjects for punishment by other prisoners.

115However, it might be thought that the angry, tired, frustrated and powerfully built 18-year old Offender may not have launched an attack upon another person in the cell, if that person was also young and powerfully built. I acknowledge that there is an element of speculation in this. However, what is clear from the evidence, including the vivid CCTV footage of the crime, is that the Offender quickly overpowered the elderly and lightly built victim who was rendered prone on the ground, and then attacked in circumstances where there was no prospect of the victim defending himself.

116Allowing for the differences between serious crimes of violence committed in prisons and the present offence, I nevertheless consider that specific and general deterrence should be taken into account on sentence, for reasons analogous to those applying to violent crimes committed in prison.

Assessing the Offender's Risk of Reoffending and Prospects of Rehabilitation

117Courts have recognised the imprecise nature of the process which involves an assessment of an Offender's risk of reoffending, in particular where a lengthy sentence is to be imposed so that there is no prospect of the Offender being released into the community at an early time. It has been emphasised that it is the risk (and not certainty) of reoffending which is under consideration: Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [53].

118The Court is entitled to take the circumstances of the present offences into account in determining the question of future dangerousness: Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 at 207-208 [64]-[69]. The Offender's crimes involved explosive violence committed in the context of anger and frustration. A capacity to act in this way on more than one occasion, including the infliction of lethal force, does not assist the Offender in consideration of possible future acts of violence.

119Nor does the absence of remorse assist the Offender in considering his prospects of rehabilitation: Ng v R at 208-209 [69].

120However, the offences must be considered against the background of anger management issues which had been identified in the Offender, although he had no significant criminal history. Further, the Offender has been in custody since February 2011, and there has been no disciplinary problem or violent conduct on his part in the no doubt tense custodial setting in which he has been housed. The Offender's conduct in custody is relevant to an assessment of the risk of reoffending and future dangerousness: Ng v R at 208 [66].

121The Crown submitted that the Offender's uneventful custodial history may be related to the fact that he has been receiving medication whilst in custody. Ms Manuell SC submitted in response that this aspect may tend to confirm that there is a foundation for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

122Professor Greenberg considered the question of the Offender's future dangerousness, observing that ""prediction of future violence or re-offending is fraught with difficulties"" (Exhibit H, page 2). After considering risk factors which may apply to the Offender, Professor Greenberg concluded that the Offender would probably fall within the ""moderate range of risk for future acts of violence"", with this prediction based on him having numerous historical factors such as his previous history of violence, his first act of violence from a young age, past relationship instability, past employment problems, substance abuse problems, early maladjustment and having a personality disorder. 

123Professor Greenberg observed, however, that clinical items and future risk management items may be amenable to change over time, and that change in the Offender's current risk for future violence would largely depend upon his motivation and response to rehabilitation programs and his developing future appropriate acceptable responses to a past history or pattern of maladaptive behaviour.

124Professor Greenberg concluded (Exhibit H, page 4):

""Clinically, Mr Kaewklom falls within the moderate range for future risk of acts of violence at this time. Mr Kaewklom is a 20 year old man who is intelligent and capable of benefitting from education and rehabilitation programs. I note in the Justice Health records that he has requested education services to complete his HSC exams. His custodial record has no misconduct over the past 18 months. His response to rehabilitation interventions, and his personal pro-social maturation and growth as an individual may or may not change over time. However should he benefit from such programs and interventions, his future risk for violence would be reduced accordingly.""

125It is necessary to keep in mind, however, that the Offender appeared to be engaging in a form of deceptive conduct in August 2012 in his dealings with Professor Greenberg, leading to the conclusion that he was an ""unreliable historian""; a view not disputed by Dr Westmore. This aspect may also bear upon the Offender's process of maturity and his reliability for the future, these being relevant to an assessment of his risk of reoffending and his prospects of rehabilitation. 

126The Court must be guarded in assessing the long-term future of the Offender, arising from the commission of very serious crimes when he was 18 years' old, and with that assessment being made when he is 20 years' old. 

127That guarded approach does not permit a positive finding that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. However, a finding should not be made that there are poor prospects of rehabilitation.

128At the same time, an adverse finding should not be made that the protection of the community bears upon the determination of sentence in his case, including the fixing of non-parole periods. 

129There will be ample time for the relevant custodial authorities to make an assessment of the Offender, based upon his custodial history and efforts made to further his education and rehabilitation in custody, before a decision must be made concerning his release by way of conditional liberty.

Accumulation and Totality 

130The Crown submitted that a measure of accumulation is necessary in this case given separate offences committed five days apart against different victims. Senior counsel for the Offender accepted that a measure of accumulation was appropriate, but submitted that the Offender's age and the totality principle ought see a lesser degree of accumulation than might otherwise be warranted.

131Although there is a similarity in the two crimes, involving in each case a frenzied attack using kicking and stomping to the heads of the victims, there is clearly a need for a significant level of accumulation of the sentences to be imposed for these offences. 

132I shall keep in mind the totality principle, whilst at the same time recognising the need for the sentences to be imposed to reflect the objective gravity of the offences as well as all other factors bearing upon the assessment of penalty.

Effects of the Offender's Crimes

133The Court was informed that X did not wish to make a victim impact statement for the purpose of the sentencing hearing. The Crown also indicated that the relatives of Mr McGregor did not wish to make victim impact statements.

134It is apparent from the evidence before the Court that the attack upon X was a terrifying experience which left her suffering from significant injuries which clearly constituted grievous bodily harm. After the attack, she was threatened by the Offender. That experiences of this type occurred for this 15-year old girl, and will have consequences upon her for some period at least, is an appropriate inference to be drawn, even without a victim impact statement. 

135The law recognises, without specific evidence, the value which the community places upon human life. That is why unlawful homicide is recognised by the law as a most serious crime, one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The criminal law does not seek to value one life as greater than another: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 86-87. The absence of a victim impact statement from any member of Mr McGregor's family does not affect the question of sentence to be passed upon the Offender for his murder.

Determining the Appropriate Sentences

136I have referred to a range of factors to be considered on sentence. It is necessary now to undertake the process of instinctive synthesis for the purpose of passing sentence.

137The offences committed by the Offender are of substantial objective gravity. He committed a brutal and cowardly attack upon his 15-year old former girlfriend because of anger and frustration at her refusal to do what he wanted. He then threatened to harm her if she told the truth.

138Four days later, the Offender attended the police station for the purpose of providing a false account to police concerning the attack on X. Things did not progress as he expected. Police did not believe his false account and he was arrested and charged and was placed in custody. The next morning, he found himself in a cell with the elderly victim. The Offender was clearly tense and frustrated, with his frustration intensifying after a conference with the legal aid lawyer who, no doubt, identified the difficulties he would have in being released on bail. Although the noisy earlier conduct of the victim in the cells may have been somewhat irritating to the Offender, what followed constituted a sudden, brutal and explosive attack upon an elderly, frail and defenceless victim who had said and done nothing to the Offender. Although the attack occupied some 22 seconds only, it was intense and directed at the victim's head.

139The Offender was 18 years of age at the time of these offences and had a turbulent family background. Despite anger management issues and abuse of alcohol and illegal substances, he had not come into conflict in any significant way with the criminal justice system.

140The Offender's youth is relevant to sentence, although the factors of general and specific deterrence and the need for retribution are significant factors on sentence. An assessment of the Offender's prospects of rehabilitation is guarded, although his custodial experience shows an ability to live without committing acts of violence.

141Having regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors and relevant sentencing principles, I am satisfied that an appropriate sentence for the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to X, before application of the 25% discount for his plea of guilty, is a term of imprisonment of five years. After application of the 25% discount, a head sentence of three years and nine months will be passed. In the absence of a finding of special circumstances, and with some rounding, a non-parole period of two years and nine months is appropriate.

142Having regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors and applicable sentencing principles, and taking into account the modest discount for the Offender's plea of guilty, a sentence of imprisonment of 20 years should be imposed for the crime of murder. Unless special circumstances are found, the non-parole period would be one of 15 years. 

143As I have said, it is appropriate to partially accumulate the sentences to reflect the fact that they are separate crimes committed against separate victims, albeit only five days apart and involving (in some respects) similar offending conduct. I am satisfied that a period of two years accumulation is appropriate, having considered relevant principles, including totality. 

144I am satisfied that a finding of special circumstances should be made with respect to the sentence for murder. The special circumstances arise from the process of accumulation, and the need to ensure a sufficiently lengthy period of supervision in the community is available when the Offender becomes eligible for parole. I am satisfied that the appropriate non-parole period to impose for the murder sentence is one of 13 years and six months.

145The total effective sentence to be passed will comprise a non-parole period of 15 years and six months with a balance of term of six years and six months.

146The sentence for the s.35(2) offence will commence on 15 February 2011. 

147Kukiat Kaewklom, will you please stand.

148For the crime of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to X, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on 15 February 2011 and expiring on 14 November 2013, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 15 November 2013 and expiring on 14 November 2014.

149For the murder of Frederick McGregor, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 13 years and six months commencing on 15 February 2013 and expiring on 14 August 2026, with a balance of term of six years and six months commencing on 15 August 2026 and expiring on 14 February 2033.

150The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 15 August 2026.

		08 February 2013",2013-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760909,R v Abdollahi (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 475,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: A disturbance that occurred in the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""VIDC"") on 20-21 April 2011 resulted in charges of riot and affray being brought against various detainees, including the 13 accused. It had its genesis in the morning of 20 April in the Fowler Compound and then at around midnight, after staff had been evacuated from that compound, extended into the Hughes Compound and other parts of the VIDC. 

2Earlier this week I determined that evidence of events which occurred subsequent to the evacuation of staff from Fowler was not admissible. This is because there were a large number of detainees involved in the disturbance at and beyond that time and the Crown was unable to identify that any of the accused (with one exception) participated in the events subsequent to the evacuation: R v Abdollahi (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 474. The disturbance that continued in the Hughes Compound and other areas represented a severe escalation of the severity of the incident and substantial damage to property, including the burning down of buildings, occurred. I did, however, indicate in that judgment (at [18]) that ""evidence derived at a subsequent time, which clearly bears upon events which must have been in existence, or initiated, at around or prior to that time ... is not excluded"". 

3The judgment in R v Abdollahi (No 1) includes a general description of the layout of the VIDC and of the nature of the disturbance and so I will not repeat it here.

Objection to video footage recorded after the point at which the Crown can prove the involvement of the accused

4The Crown wishes to tender in the trial video footage recorded from a police helicopter that flew over the VIDC. The filming commenced at 11.44pm and continued for about 45 minutes. The segment that the Crown wishes to tender is only the first 5 minutes or so and it is generally concentrated upon the Fowler Compound. Objection is taken on behalf of a number of accused upon the basis that the footage includes events that are subsequent to, and too remote from, the staff evacuation from Fowler.

5The footage in question commences at about 10 kilometres from the VIDC as the helicopter approached. It shows a general view of the entire complex and indicates that there were various fires. The distance of the helicopter from the VIDC means that it really only gives a general impression of there being fires within. As the helicopter neared, the footage commences to concentrate on the Fowler Compound. 

6Clearly depicted are four fires within the compound. Fires within the Murray office building and on the soccer field were lit at around, or prior to, the staff evacuation and no-one takes the objection in respect of that aspect. But there are also fires shown to be ablaze in buildings which have been referred to as the gymnasium and the library/recreation room. It is contended that these must have been lit after the staff evacuation and, for that reason, render the footage inadmissible in accordance with my earlier ruling.

7Another aspect of concern to counsel for the accused who made the objection was that the footage also shows a fairly large number of detainees (perhaps about 30 on the ground and about 15 on the roof of one of the buildings) within the compound. While providing a commentary for me as to what the footage depicted as it was played in court, the Crown Prosecutor, perhaps tongue in cheek but I am not sure, referred to these men ""celebrating"". Upon having reviewed the footage a number of times it appears to me that it simply shows some of the men waving towards the helicopter.

Timing of relevant events

8The times at which various events occurred in the course of the disturbance cannot be determined with any precision. Witness statements provide what can only be described as rough estimates. That is understandable as the nature of the events that were occurring were such that it would be unrealistic to expect any of the VIDC staff to have been taking any notice of the time. 

9The best guide to the timing of specific events is what has been referred to as the Command Room Log. Staff on the ground were relaying what was occurring to a command room where senior officers were stationed. The substance of those communications was in turn relayed to a scribe who entered them in a log. The log records a summary of events together with a time. The accuracy of the times in relation to the events to which they relate depend upon a number of variables. They include how soon after an event occurred a staff member became aware of it; how soon after that the staff member communicated with the command room; how soon after that it was relayed to the scribe; and how soon after that it was entered in the log.

10Another variable, or requirement to interpret the log with caution, is that because of the stress of the situation, entries in the log can hardly be construed literally. By way of example, there is an entry timed at 11.15pm which includes ""Staff are being pulled into the Murray Unit [the office within the Fowler Compound] for their safety"". Then there is an entry timed at 11.19pm which includes ""Staff have pulled back into the Murray Unit. Clients are attacking the Murray Unit. They are throwing things at it and setting fire to the staff office. All staff withdrawn."" 

11An entry timed at 11.32pm includes, ""The staff office is completely ablaze"". Then, at 11.39pm there is an entry, ""The internet room and the gym are on fire"". At 11.50pm an entry was made that included ""Another building is on fire. It is the top recreation room in Fowler. The staff office is now totalled to the ground."" For the reasons given above, it is apparent that the observations in these entries were made at some stage prior to the time they were recorded in the log.

12The best estimate of the time of the evacuation of staff from the Fowler Compound seems to be in the order of 11.15pm to 11.20pm.

13The fires in the Murray Unit, as well as those in the other two buildings, appear in the latter half of the video footage, so at about 11.48pm to about 11.49pm. They each appear to be well alight. No-one has suggested that they might only have been lit moments before the footage commenced. Precisely how long before is beyond determination; that would require some expertise informed by knowledge of the combustibility of the building materials and contents of the buildings as well as the source of the ignition, which are all unknown.

Relevance of the evidence

14For the count of riot (and, in the case of the accused Sayed Mosawi, aiding and abetting riot) it is necessary for the Crown to prove, amongst other things, that 12 or more persons were present together and they used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose. The Crown has particularised what it claims to have been the common purpose as:

(i) to demonstrate and/or protest their dissatisfaction with the circumstances of their detention within the Villawood Detention Centre; and
(ii) to use and/or threaten violence towards property and towards people.

15The question is whether the footage of what was occurring within the Fowler Compound at around 11.47 to 11.48pm can, if accepted, rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of that common purpose: see s 55 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The answer to that question, in my view, must be affirmative.

16It would be unrealistic to think that the atmosphere within the Fowler Compound changed significantly within the 15 or so minutes between when the staff evacuated and when it must be the case that the fires in the gymnasium and in the library/recreation buildings were started. Similarly, it would be unrealistic to think that the attitude and demeanour of detainees within the compound involved in the disturbance changed significantly within the intervening period.

17Fires well alight within the compound within half an hour of the staff evacuation, as well as what might be called buoyant boisterous behaviour of the detainees who remained there after there was an opportunity to be removed to another compound, must be capable of having a bearing upon whether the common purpose asserted by the Crown was in existence prior to and around the time of the staff evacuation. Accordingly, the evidence is relevant and admissible, subject to any discretion or requirement to exclude it on account of unfair prejudice: ss 135 and 137 Evidence Act. 

No danger of unfair prejudice outweighing probative value

18The evidence which will be before the jury includes that fires were set on the soccer field and the Murray Unit. Evidence of two other buildings being on fire does not create a degree of unfair prejudice that would justify exclusion of the evidence. Similarly, the evidence which will be before the jury will include some quite significant displays of defiance and threatened violence towards staff of the VIDC. Given that context, evidence of the behaviour of detainees, even if if could be described as boisterous, does not involve any degree of unfair prejudice that would warrant exclusion. Putting both aspects together, I do not think that the cumulative effect involves a degree of unfair prejudice that would warrant the exclusion of either.

Conclusion

19I conclude that what has been described as ""chapter one of the Polair footage"" is admissible.

		02 May 2013",2013-02-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760910,Pettersen v R [2013] NSWCCA 20,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  I agree with the reasons of Fullerton J and her Honour's proposed orders.  I also agree with the additional remarks of Beech-Jones J. 
2FULLERTON J:  This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 19 April 2012 in respect of an offence with which the applicant was charged in September 2011 and to which he had entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court on 28 February 2012.  That offence will be referred to as ""the conspiracy charge"". 
3The sentence imposed on a second offence, also the subject of charge in September 2011 and a plea of guilty, was not challenged on the application.  That offence will be referred to as ""the attempt charge"".
4The conspiracy charge attracted a sentence of imprisonment of 6 years, which, after a finding of special circumstances, comprised a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 3 years.  It was laid in the following terms:On 20 March 2011 at Rosehill in the State of New South Wales, [the applicant] did conspire to break and enter the warehouse of The Perfume Network situated at 2/142 James Ruse Drive Rosehill, and then in the said The Perfume Network warehouse did conspire to commit a serious indictable offence, to wit, steal in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he was in company with other persons, namely Yashar Gogani and other unknown persons.
5The attempt charge, committed two months after the conspiracy, related to an attempt to commit an aggravated break and enter with intent to steal from different commercial premises.  That offence was laid contrary to s 113(2) and s 344A of the Crimes Act 1900 and carried a maximum period of imprisonment of 14 years.  
6That offence was laid in the following terms:On the 14th day of May 2011 at Belrose, in the State of New South Wales, [the applicant] did attempt to break a certain building, to wit, the warehouse of Bright Point within the curtilage of the dwelling warehouse belonging to Bright Point situated at 2 Minna Close Belrose, with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, to wit, steal in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he was in the company of Shawn O'Mealey, Jack Dunn and other unknown persons.
7The attempt charge was treated by the sentencing judge as the principal offence.  After taking into account on a Form 1 three offences of take and drive a conveyance contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months was imposed.  The sentence on the conspiracy charge was partially accumulated on that sentence and an effective sentence of 7 years and 3 months imposed with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.  
8On the appeal the Crown conceded that the conspiracy charge was erroneously treated by the sentencing judge as if it were a breach of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, carrying a statutory maximum of 20 years imprisonment and attracting a standard non-parole period of 5 years, when a conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of an aggravated break, enter and steal (as with a conspiracy to commit any indictable offence) is a common law misdemeanour to which no statutory maximum penalty or standard non-parole period applies.  Properly understood, the penalty for the conspiracy charge was at large subject only to a requirement that the sentence imposed not be excessive (see Savvas (No 2) v R (1991) 58 A Crim R 174).  
9The Crown also conceded that the Crown's submissions on sentence were the source of his Honour's sentencing error.  The Crown's misdescription of the offence and the applicable penalty apparently originated in the fact that the conspiracy charge, laid by the issue of a Court Attendance Notice, wrongly cited s 112(2) of the Crimes Act as the section under which the offence was brought.  This error was not corrected when the applicant entered his plea of guilty in the Local Court and not detected or corrected by the Crown when the applicant adhered to his plea in the District Court, or during the course of submissions on sentence.  
10The Crown conceded that treating the conspiracy charge on the basis that it in fact attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, as distinct from the statutory maximum for the substantive offence being a reference point or ""yardstick"" to be utilised by the sentencing judge as an upper limit beyond which the sentence for a conspiracy to commit the offence would not ordinarily extend (Bell v R: Jelisavac v R [2009] NSWCCA 206 at [3] per Price J, with whom Allsop P and Harrison J agreed), was analogous to where a sentencing judge has misstated the maximum penalty for an offence under a criminal statute.  It was also accepted that his Honour wrongly referred to a standard non-parole period of 5 years as applying to the conspiracy charge and that this constituted a sentencing error.  
11The Crown accepted that where an error of either kind has been identified, but, importantly, where the error is demonstrated to have had a material impact upon the sentence imposed, the intervention of this Court will be justified, subject only to the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
12Although the Crown conceded that the applicant should be granted leave to appeal, it was submitted that the application of established sentencing principles, in particular an assessment of the objective seriousness of the conspiracy charge having regard to its duration and the degree of planning and organisation involved, coupled with the fact that the applicant was unable to rely upon any features in mitigation of sentence, necessitated a finding that the sentence was otherwise within an available discretionary range, and that the Court would decline to intervene.  In the event the error was shown to have infected the sentence, thereby triggering the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the Crown submitted that no other sentence was warranted in law.  
13The applicant submitted that a different sentence was warranted in law. 
The evidence on sentence
14An agreed statement of facts was tendered upon which the facts were found proved for sentencing purposes. 
15The Crown also tendered the applicant's criminal antecedents and his custodial history which revealed, relevantly for sentencing purposes, that he had been released to parole on 21 July 2010 (eight months before joining the conspiracy) having served the 2 year non-parole period of a sentence of 3 years and 9 months for an offence of aggravated break and enter with intent.  A pre-sentence report dated 17 April 2012 was also tendered.
16The applicant gave evidence on sentence and called evidence from his mother, supported by a letter from the father of his partner.  A report from a forensic psychologist was also tendered.
The facts relating to the conspiracy charge 
17Towards the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011 police suspected that the applicant, together with other persons, was planning to commit unspecified property offences.  From January 2011 the applicant's telephone was the subject of lawful interception from which police concluded that the applicant and others were planning to break into commercial premises located in the Rosehill Business Park at Rosehill.
18On 2 February 2011 police surveillance officers observed the applicant as he and a co-conspirator, Yashar Gogani, drove to a McDonalds restaurant at North Parramatta where they met with another man.  The three men then drove to the Rosehill Business Park where The Perfume Network was located.  They remained in the area for about 30 minutes undertaking reconnaissance. 
19On 8 March 2011 the applicant and Gogani went to a hardware store at Artarmon where the applicant purchased a large set of bolt cutters, an axe and a pair of gardening gloves, intended for use during the planned break and enter of The Perfume Network.  This was confirmed in a number of intercepted telephone conversations. 
20On the late evening of 20 March 2011, Gogani was observed by police to drive to Cammeray, where he met the applicant.  Both men then travelled in Gogani's vehicle to North Parramatta.  They stopped at a location close to an Isuzu Pantec truck.  Shortly after, police saw the applicant driving the Pantec truck in the general direction of Parramatta.  Gogani followed in his car.  
21The owner of the Pantec did not know the applicant and had not given permission to him or Gogani to take and use his truck.  (This offence was taken into account on sentence in relation to the attempt charge.)
22The applicant drove the Pantec to Parramatta, arriving shortly before midnight, parking the truck about 150 metres away from The Perfume Network.  The applicant left the truck and got into the vehicle driven by Gogani.  The men drove away from the scene.  
23Through intercepted telephone communications, police were able to determine that the applicant had been alerted to their presence and the conspiracy was terminated.  It was clear from the same telephone calls that the Pantec truck had been stolen in anticipation of the break-in at The Perfume Network.
The facts relating to the attempt charge 
24In the early morning of 1 April 2011 a Mercedes station wagon was stolen from a garage in Cammeray.  The car was a high performance vehicle.  (This offence was taken into account on sentence in relation to the attempt charge.)
25Late on the night of 5 May 2011, or in the early hours of the following morning, the rear registration plate was stolen from a Mercedes sedan which was parked in Neutral Bay.  
26On 6 May 2011 investigating police located the stolen Mercedes station wagon on 1 April parked in a private residential garage in Bondi that had been leased by the applicant.  The Mercedes had been fitted with the stolen registration plate.  Under the authority of a warrant, police covertly installed a listening device and a tracking device in the car.  The car was left in the garage.
27At about 3.30am on 14 May 2011 the applicant was observed by police driving the stolen Mercedes out of the Bondi garage with Shawn O'Mealey as his passenger.  The car was tracked travelling to various locations in Sydney.  It was apparent from the information received from the listening and tracking devices that the car stopped from time to time, allowing O'Mealey to leave the vehicle and return a short time later.  One of the stops was to allow O'Mealey to collect a portable police radio capable of monitoring police radio channels.
28Eventually the men travelled to Lilyfield where the applicant and O'Mealey met with another person who was driving a stolen Audi RS4 with two male passengers.  The two cars then travelled together to a petrol station in Chatswood, where the occupants were filmed by security cameras as they spoke together.  
29Having obtained fuel, the cars proceeded to Belrose.  There, the occupants assisted each other to steal a Toyota Hilux utility.  (The offence was also taken into account on sentence in relation to the attempt charge.)
30The three stolen vehicles then travelled in convoy to the site of a commercial warehouse occupied by Brightpoint Australia P/L in Belrose.  En route, the applicant was recorded talking about the value of iPhones, and discussing the number of phones in each box. 
31Brightpoint is a telecommunications distributor which stored large quantities of mobile telephones for various telecommunications companies at its warehouse.  The warehouse was well secured with 24-hour onsite security, closed circuit camera surveillance, and a perimeter steel fence of some six feet in height.
32At 4.06am security cameras on the site recorded the Toyota Hilux as it drove at the locked gates to the site, ramming them open.  It then drove onto the warehouse site, followed by the Mercedes and the Audi.  Once on the premises three of the men used a crowbar to attempt to force entry to the warehouse via a fire door.  They were unsuccessful, with the door remaining securely closed. 
33After some minutes spent unsuccessfully attempting to gain access to the building, they rejoined the applicant and left in the Mercedes and the Audi.  The Hilux was abandoned at the warehouse.
34The applicant drove the Mercedes to the residential garage of a unit complex in Cammeray leaving it parked and unattended.  The Audi was driven to another location.
35On 14 May 2011 the surveillance devices that had been installed in the Mercedes were retrieved by police. 
36The applicant was arrested by police on 6 September 2011 and subsequently charged with the attempt and conspiracy charges. 
The applicant's criminal antecedents  
37The applicant, who was aged 30 at the time of sentence, had served various custodial sentences for dishonesty offences.  In June 2002 he was convicted of a number of break and enter offences, each attracting full-time custody.  In February 2003 he was convicted of two offences of robbery whilst armed, and other offences including an aggravated break and enter offence.  Whilst on parole for those offences he committed an aggravated break and enter, for which he received a prison sentence of 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 22 July 2007.  He was on parole for that offence at the time of the commission of the conspiracy charge (and the attempt charge).  His parole was revoked following his arrest.  The applicant's balance of parole expired on 21 April 2012.  The pre-sentence report also confirmed that the applicant had been supervised by the Probation and Parole Service since 2002, and was subject to supervision at the time of committing both offences.
The applicant's subjective circumstances
38The applicant's personal and family history was detailed in the pre-sentence report and the report of the psychologist.  Although the applicant received relatively high scores on Depression and Anxiety Scales, this was regarded as likely to have been inspired by the uncertainty attending the outcome of the sentencing proceedings.  His childhood was described as fragmented as a consequence of the breakdown of his parents' marriage, however his family life was otherwise the source of loving support.  On completing Year 10, he left school to find employment.  He completed two years of a four-year apprenticeship as a spray painter and, at the time of his arrest, was working with a local council and attending a TAFE welding course part-time.  The applicant's family were supportive of him, as was his partner of some years.  He had the offer of work upon his release.
39He told the author of the report that he had committed the offences as a means of ""wiping"" a $5000 debt plus interest, after he was threatened with consequences for non-payment.
The significance of the misstatement of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period
40The sentencing judge first referred to the maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 5 years at the commencement of his sentencing remarks when reciting the particulars of the conspiracy charge.  He did not refer to the maximum penalty again other than noting, later in his sentencing remarks, that both the maximum penalty, together with the standard non-parole period, operated as a legislative guidepost, as mandated by the High Court's decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27].   Treatment of the maximum penalty as a factor which, when taken and balanced with all other relevant factors, operates as a yardstick against which an appropriate sentence might be measured, is consistent with what the High Court in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 identified as an uncontroversial statement of primary sentencing principle.
41As noted above at [10] it is similarly well recognised that the maximum penalty for a substantive offence can function as a useful guide (or yardstick) when sentencing for a conspiracy to commit that offence.  Approached in this way, I am not persuaded his Honour's treatment of the maximum penalty on the conspiracy charge as statutorily fixed at 20 years could be said to be productive of error in the imposition of sentence.  Although the applicant did not seek the intervention of this Court on this basis, I am confidently of the view that after applying the discount for the plea of guilty a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years for the conspiracy was within his Honour's sentencing discretion, having regard to the scope and object of the conspiracy, the length of time over which it operated and the degree of planning involved in breaking into commercial premises with the objective of stealing a considerable quantity of valuable property.  As Simpson J observed in Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247; 173 A Crim R 458 at [83] it is the organisational nature of a conspiracy and the interrelationship between the various participants, rather than an identification of the role of a particular conspirator by reference solely to the physical acts performed by that person, that is of primary importance when sentencing for a conspiracy.
42In considering the impact on sentence of what his Honour erroneously believed to be a standard non-parole period of 5 years on the conspiracy charge, it is instructive to set out in full the way his Honour approached the issue:  Of course I am sentencing the offender after a plea of guilty and I am sentencing the offender of course in the context of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R which reflected upon the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way (2004).  It noted, amongst other things (between [16] and [29]) the fact that the fixing of a non-parole period is but one part of the larger task in passing appropriate sentence upon the particular offender, fixing the appropriate non-parole period is not to be treated as if it were the necessary starting point or the only important end point in framing a sentence to which Div 1A applies.  I note of course amongst many other matters raised in Muldrock, and discussed in subsequent cases to which I will refer in a moment, that the High Court held that a consideration of s 21A in the context of Pt 4 Div 1A requires an approach that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v R.  The judge is required to identify all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then make a valued judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case...
43His Honour then proceeded to position the conspiracy within the mid range of objective seriousness referable to the features to which I have already referred.  His Honour also took into account the applicant's recruitment of others into the conspiracy and that special equipment had been purchased to achieve the objective of forcing entry to the premises and, as aggravating factors under s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that the conspiracy was committed whilst the applicant was subject to conditional liberty and that he was motivated by the prospect of considerable financial gain.
44There being no standard non-parole period applicable to the conspiracy charge, his Honour was not obliged to make an assessment of where within a range of objective gravity or seriousness the offence was located and, in that sense, he has taken into account an irrelevant consideration in his reasoning process.  The question remains, however, whether that triggered the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  In my view it did not.  
45Although, as Davies J recognised in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [23], there remains a doubt as to whether, after Muldrock, a court is required or permitted to classify, or is prohibited from classifying an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies by reference to low, middle or high range objective seriousness, there was nothing in Muldrock to suggest that a conventional assessment of the extent or degree of objective offending for sentencing purposes should be avoided or, as I see it, whether it can be avoided.  
46In Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183, the degree of specificity with which a sentencing court should determine the degree of objective seriousness in order to permit the appropriate treatment of the standard non-parole period remained unresolved, McClellan CJ at CL at [40] concluding that in order to resolve the issues on that appeal it was not necessary to reach any settled view.  His Honour did however expressly agree at [41] with the observations of Johnson J (in dissent) in R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38 at [86] where his Honour observed that an assessment of objective gravity was an important element of the process of the instinctive synthesis of the relevant factors in the exercise of a sentencing discretion in the process of imposing a proportionate sentence.  
47In this case, I have no doubt that the sentencing judge's reference to the degree or extent of objective seriousness referable to ""a range"" was directed to that legitimate sentencing objective (albeit framed in the context of a standard non-parole period).
48After rejecting the applicant's explanation for his involvement in the conspiracy as untrue, and concluding that little could be said in his favour in mitigation, in particular that he was unable to conclude that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation or that he was unlikely to reoffend given his criminal history, his Honour went on to say:  ...I approach the matter as the High Court has decreed in Muldrock.  The standard non-parole period is a guidepost but not the definitive determinate of what the appropriate non-parole period should be or what the total sentence should be but provides some assistance or guidance.  In any event, I have concluded in relation to that offence, bearing in mind I am required, as the authorities make clear, to fix a non-parole period in relation to it, that there are special circumstances which require an adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of the sentence.
49The applicant cited Diesing v R [2007] NSWCCA 326 as authority for the proposition that where a sentencing judge has imposed sentence referable to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in circumstances where no standard non-parole period applied, the sentence will invariably be infected by error necessitating resentence.  In support of that submission he placed particular reliance upon Latham J's observation at [59] that this Court had, by that time, recognised an upward trend in sentences imposed for offences carrying a standard non-parole period, even where there were factors justifying a departure from it.  Her Honour also observed that the notional range of sentences for a mid range offence where a standard non-parole period applies will generally be higher than those where there is no standard non-parole period, in each case (as the law applied at that time) because the sentencing judge was obliged to have regard to the standard non-parole period when fixing an appropriate sentence. 
50While her Honour's analysis of sentencing trends pre-Muldrock was well supported by the experience of this Court and sentencing statistics, it does not, in my view, necessarily lead, in this case, to the conclusion that his Honour's reference to a standard non-parole period of 5 years post Muldrock was productive of a sentence outside a discretionary range.  To the contrary.  Because of the way his Honour approached sentence, which was an exemplar of the approach mandated by Muldrock, his Honour did no more than take the standard non-parole period into account as providing some assistance or guidance as to what a non-parole period should be in the context of the total sentence.  It cannot be gainsaid that he gave it preponderant weight.  In my view, after a finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period of 3 years for the conspiracy charge was not only an available sentencing outcome but one that is reflective of a generous measure of leniency.
51The orders I propose are:1.  Leave to appeal granted.2.  Appeal dismissed.
52BEECH-JONES J:  I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Fullerton J.  Ordinarily a reference by a sentencing judge to a standard non-parole period where none is prescribed would represent a strong start for an applicant for leave to appeal in seeking to establish error.  This is still the case post the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, especially as the High Court noted that it may be that for some offences the effect of the introduction of standard non-parole periods will be a ""move upwards in the length of non-parole period[s]"" (at [31]).  However in this case the matters pointed to by Fullerton J have persuaded me that the references by the sentencing judge to the existence of a standard non-parole period of five years where there was none had no material impact on the sentence his Honour determined, namely a non-parole period of three years with an additional term of three years.  In any event the matters canvassed by Fullerton J concerning the circumstances of the offence, the subjective case of the applicant and the findings of the sentencing judge lead me to conclude that no lesser sentence was warranted even if error had been established (cf s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912).
53I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.

8Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour set the following conditions on the Applicant's release on parole:
1. That he reside at a fulltime rehabilitation centre for no less than six months; and

2. That he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for as long as the Service deems necessary but for a period not less than nine months.

The facts

9The charges against the Applicant all arose from the one incident with the co-offender Andrew Kirby. Although the Applicant and Kirby were sentenced together their counsel were not able to agree on a common statement of facts for the Sentencing Judge. There were two sets of facts, one for each offender, agreed with the Crown in each case. It was necessary for the Sentencing Judge to choose between competing accounts of what happened at the premises. What follows represents either what was agreed as between co-offenders or what the Sentencing Judge found.

10The Applicant and Kirby went to a unit in a complex at Pooley Street, Buranga on 12 May 2011. One of the victims, AB, lived at that unit. On the evening concerned he was present at the unit with a friend of his, ML, the second victim. They were watching movies.

11At about 9:00pm there was a knock on the door. When AB opened the door he saw Kirby's younger brother and a friend of his called Yarrin at the door. Yarrin said to AB ""Lock the door, my [sic] brother is coming around.""

12At about 9:30pm there was a much louder knock on the door. ML opened the door about half way and the Applicant and Kirby entered the premises. Neither of them was known to AB but ML recognised Kirby. The Applicant locked the door behind himself. Both of them were yelling loudly and abusively. Kirby yelled at them ""You have been giving my brother yarndi (marijuana) and alcohol"" but AB denied it.

13The Applicant then took a red hooded jumper from a BMX bicycle in the unit and wrapped it around his right hand. With that hand he then picked up a knife from the top of a small storage cabinet next to the couch where AB and ML were sitting. The Applicant stood in front of them with the knife saying ""I'm going to kill youse tonight. I will go to gaol for 20 years but I don't care"". 

14At one point either the Applicant or Kirby said to AB and ML ""Give us your money."" AB then took two $50 notes from his wallet and handed them over. One or both of them then said ""Give us the rest of your money"". AB then handed over notes totalling $350.

15Shortly afterwards the Applicant gave Kirby the knife and grabbed a pair of scissors. Thereafter they exchanged weapons on more than one occasion. 

16In relation to the use of the knife by each of the Applicant and Kirby the Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant was standing in front of AB and ML when they were in the lounge room. The Applicant was holding the knife in his hand and was thrusting the knife towards ML's chest within a foot of it. ML said the distance varied with each thrust, of which there were more than ten, but mainly within a foot of it. The Applicant was holding it at his waist height, poking it at ML and was yelling ""You luck (sic: lucky) we just stab you and leave you lying on the ground bleeding. You don't know how easy it is for us. We're not afraid to do it.""

17At the same time ML said that he could see Kirby out of the corner of his eye thrusting the point of the scissors towards AB. However, he was focussed on the knife that the Applicant was thrusting towards him. At one point the Applicant and Kirby changed positions so that Kirby was thrusting the scissors at ML and the Applicant was thrusting the knife at AB. 
18Kirby went into the bathroom and demanded that AB and ML go into the bathroom. The Applicant followed them. According to the victims the mood of the Applicant and Kirby kept changing from aggression to calm. At one point in the bathroom Kirby told ML to put his head over the sink but ML refused. At another point Kirby grabbed an electric lead and tried to tie AB's arms with it while the Applicant stood watching holding the scissors. 

19His Honour also found that when the parties were in the bathroom Kirby put the knife with the blunt side on the outside skin of ML's throat and that the Applicant was present, ready and willing to support Kirby as he did this in what the Judge described as ""cruel torment"". 

20Things eventually calmed although at about 10:10pm Kirby again became animated when the four of them were back in the lounge room and again demanded to know who had given his brother yarndi and alcohol. Before they left the Applicant said to Kirby ""Hand back some money, you can't leave them with no money"". Kirby then put a $50 note back on the couch but left with the rest of the money.

Subjective features

21The Applicant was the eldest of four children with the fifth dying at a very early age. His parents separated when he was about five because of domestic violence issues. He left home after his mother had entered into an abusive relationship when he was aged about 13. He resided with his father until he was 18. His father had a recurrent history of alcohol abuse. 

22He has had two daughters to separate women. He has made attempts to maintain contact with his daughters but there have been difficulties. 

23He told Professor Greenberg, who examined him prior to the sentencing hearing, that he had first been depressed when his brother passed away some ten years ago. He was sent to Mildura Hospital for a three week period and medicated. 

24About four years ago he had some paranoid beliefs. At the time he was abusing ecstasy, cannabis and Oxycontin. He appears to have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a four week period. He had attempted suicide on three occasions.

25Professor Greenberg diagnosed the Applicant with adjustment disorder with depressed mood, alcohol abuse and poly substance abuse. He said he had low intellectual functioning with some personality problems. 

26He was subsequently seen by a psychologist, Mark Howard, who performed psychometric testing. That testing demonstrated that he had a composite IQ ranging between 47 and 61. That was in the lower Extreme range. His scores on the Depression and Anxiety scales were in the Extremely Severe range falling above the 98% percentile of the normative sample. Testing of mood revealed that the Applicant then experienced severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. 

27Mr Howard said that the Applicant was very remorseful for his behaviour in the offending. He noted that he had been prescribed Seroquel, a mood stabiliser. 

Remarks on sentence

28His Honour dealt with the facts as detailed above and the Applicant's subjective circumstances. When dealing with the matter of the objective criminality of the offending he first considered the question of the form of aggravation charged which was that each was in company. His Honour said that there were other forms of aggravation such as being armed, depriving a person of his liberty and knowledge that there was a person present at the time of entering which were of greater criminality than being in company. His Honour went on to say that in each offender's case the co-offender's role was so aggressively violent towards the victim it went beyond a mere supportive presence to one of actual enforcement of violent conduct. His Honour said that in that sense that feature of aggravation assumed serious weight within the measure of criminality provided in the statute. 

29He found that the objective criminality in respect of the intended serious indictable offence (being intimidation) was towards the lower end of objective seriousness. He said that the aggravated feature of the entry was that the offenders remained on the premises for as long as they did and committed the second offence, the robbery. His Honour's only conclusion with regard to objective seriousness was that ""the criminality arising from the enter with intent offence is such as to call for fulltime incarceration"".

Sentence of the Co-offender Kirby

30At the time of the commission of the index offences Kirby was subject to a s 9 bond by reason of a sentence of 8 months imprisonment being suspended. The sentence had been imposed for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

31In respect of the breach of the bond his Honour set a non-parole period of four months to commence on 21 May 2011 and expiring on 20 September 2011 with a balance of term of four months. 

32His Honour then sentenced in respect of the index offences. He said that the starting point was four years for both offenders but he would allow a 40% discount for an early plea and for assistance for Kirby. He then imposed the following sentences:

Offence 1: A non-parole period of 18 months to commence 21 September 2011 and expire on 20 March 2013 with a balance of term of 11 months;

Offence 2: A fixed term of 12 months to commence 20 September 2011 and expiring on 20 September 2012;

Section 166 Certificate: A fixed term of 15months to commence 20 September 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2012.

33His Honour imposed the same conditions on Mr Kirby's release on parole as were imposed on the Applicant.

Grounds of appeal

34The Applicant sought leave to appeal on the following grounds:

1. The learned Sentencing Judge erred by failing to properly give weight to the limited record of the Applicant and to the fact that the Applicant had never served a custodial sentence.

2. The learned Sentencing Judge erred in imposing a condition upon the Applicant's release to parole without providing procedural fairness to the Applicant by giving his counsel any opportunity to make submissions about such a course and by failing to indicate to the Applicant that such a course was within the contemplation of the Sentencing Judge, before the condition was imposed.

3. The learned Sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the Applicant relative to his co-offender, in that he:

a. treated both as having indistinguishable records, and
b. treated both as having equal culpability notwithstanding the existence of a serious aggravating circumstance existed for Kirby.

4. The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed upon him and his co-offender.

Ground 1: The Applicant's criminal record

35His Honour said this in relation to the Applicant's criminal record:

Kennedy's first brush with the law appears to have been in 2002 in
respect of driving offences whilst he was a child. In 2005 he was before the court for a mid-range PCA (the second one for him) and a driving offence; in 2006 he was convicted for resisting an officer in the execution of duty, possessing a loaded firearm and the firearm being an unregistered firearm. In 2007 he is before the court for high-range PCA and another driving offence; 2008 carried in conveyance; 2010 domestic violence/common assault, 2010 another one. Again his record is not by any means the worst that I have seen. His first custodial sentence was in 2005.


36The recitation of the Applicant's record was wrong in a number of respects. First, and in the Applicant's favour, he first came before a court in 1998 on three occasions for three different offences. Secondly, there was only one conviction for driving with a mid-range PCA. The first reference to it was on an occasion when the Applicant did not appear at Court and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Thirdly, in 2010 there were not two charges of common assault involving domestic violence. Again, the first occasion that offence is mentioned the Applicant did not appear in Court and a warrant was issued. Finally, and most significantly, the Applicant had never been sentenced to imprisonment before the offences now under consideration.

37All of these mistakes except the first were against the Applicant's position. The Crown submitted, nevertheless, that the Sentencing Judge did not suggest that he was taking the Applicant's criminal history into account as an aggravating factor or on the basis of the principles in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1987) 164 CLR 465 at 473. On that basis it is suggested that the ground is not made out.

38The ground of appeal is poorly worded because according of weight to one factor or another is peculiarly within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge. Nevertheless, the fact that the Sentencing Judge made specific errors in relation to the Applicant's criminal history, particularly the misstatement about prior custody, demonstrates error on his part. The matter was regarded as of some significance by the Sentencing judge because of the use he made of the Applicant's criminal record when considering parity between the offenders. This will be dealt with in relation to Grounds 3 and 4.

39This ground is made out.

Ground 2: Imposing the rehabilitation condition

40The transcript of the sentencing proceedings show that at no time did his Honour alert the Applicant's counsel to the fact that he was considering imposing this condition. During his Remarks on Sentence his Honour noted that the co-offender Kirby was willing to attend full-time rehabilitation and his Honour said at that point:

So please remind me when I announce these sentences that there is a rehab condition. 

41It is clear, however, that his Honour was dealing with the co-offender Kirby at that point. The Crown does not contest that the rehabilitation order ought to be quashed. 

42It is unfortunate that, when his Honour asked counsel if there was anything else having imposed the sentences and the rehabilitation condition, the Applicant's counsel did not say anything concerning the rehabilitation condition.
Grounds 3 and 4: Parity

43In dealing with the parity issue his Honour said this:

[92] I find the culpability of both offenders as being about the same. Both had criminal histories but not sufficiently different to distinguish one from the other. Both had childhoods marred by domestic violence, alcohol issues, poor parenting issues and generally the social consequences of displacement shared with others including their parents through the history of Aboriginal displacement by the dominant white society and its values.

[93] The only distinctions between them are the greater discount to be given to Kirby for assistance given and the difference in commencement date of the sentences. A further distinction is that Kirby must answer for the s 12 breach on his suspended sentence. (emphasis added)

44The Applicant does not challenge the determination by the Sentencing Judge that the roles of each offender in the actual offences committed were similar. The Applicant was right not to do so.

45However, in relation to the criminal histories of the two offenders the position was far different from his Honour's assessment of the position. First, and as noted earlier in relation to Ground 1, the Applicant had never served time in custody. Secondly, the Applicant's prior criminal history consisted of the following:

(a) Driving offences including a mid-range and a high-range PCA;

(b) Resist officer, possess a loaded firearm, possess an unauthorised firearm, use an unregistered firearm - all of these offences were dealt with by a 12 month section 9 bond;

(c) Be carried in a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner. This was dealt with by a two year section 9 bond;

(d) Two offences of common assault, one involving domestic violence and four offences of behave in an offensive manner or use offensive language, two of which were committed when he was 14 years of age.

46On the other hand, Kirby had been sentenced to prison on five separate occasions for offences including common assault, contravene ADVO's, have custody of an offensive implement, failing to appear, larceny and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In relation to the last offence that imprisonment of eight months was suspended on entry into a section 12 bond. Kirby was subject to that suspended sentence at the time of commission of the index offences. The last matter was an aggravating factor.

47The Crown submitted that the Applicant did not have a justifiable sense of grievance because Mr Kirby's sentence was reduced by reason of his assistance and because the aggravating factor of being on conditional liberty when the offences were committed was dealt with by his Honour wholly accumulating the sentences imposed on Mr Kirby on the expiry of the non-parole period for the time he was ordered to serve for breach of that suspended sentence. In that regard the Crown submitted that increasing Mr Kirby's sentence by reason of being on conditional liberty would risk double counting. 

48In my opinion, by reason of the considerable difference in the criminal histories of the offenders and by reason of the fact that the index offences were committed whilst Mr Kirby was on conditional liberty, the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance for his Honour having chosen the same starting point for each of the offenders. In circumstances where his Honour only required the Applicant to serve half of the period of the suspended sentence for its breach any fear of double counting by selecting a different starting point before Mr Kirby are allayed. 

49As Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 303:

[I]t is convenient to observe, once again, that, as between co-offenders, different criminal histories and custodial patterns may be such as to justify a real difference in the time each will serve in prison. And, of course, it is necessary when applying the parity principle that like be compared with like. There may be some aspect of one offender's criminal history or custodial situation which has no counterpart in the case of his or her co-accused. If so, it may justify the imposition of a different sentence... .

See also the joint judgment of French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28].

50In my opinion this ground is made out.

Re-sentence

51Error has been shown in the three respects mentioned. It is necessary, therefore for this court to re-sentence the Applicant unless it is considered that no lesser sentence is warranted. The Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted due to the leniency of making the offenders' sentences for the offences entirely concurrent when a separate element of criminality was involved in the robbery offence.

52In my opinion the sentence imposed on Kirby was not so lenient or inadequate that it would be inappropriate to exercise the discretion in the Applicant's favour to reduce his sentence if there is proper reason to do so. I note what is said in that regard in Green at [33].

53The significant difference in the criminal histories of the co-offenders together with the fact that the offender Kirby was on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offences justifies a different starting point for the two offenders. In my opinion that starting point should have been three years and eight months compared to the four year starting point his Honour reached for Mr Kirby. 

54With a 25% discount for an early plea the total term is 33 months. Maintaining the ratio his Honour adopted of 55% between the non-parole period and the head sentence, the appropriate non-parole period in respect of Count 1 is 18 months with an additional term of 15 months. I would not disturb the sentences imposed in respect of Count 2 and the section 166 certificate offence. The condition to enter full-time rehabilitation should be quashed.

		13 February 2013",2013-02-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760916,Slotboom v R [2013] NSWCCA 18,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: The reasons given by Johnson J accurately reflect the reasons I joined in the order refusing the applicant leave to appeal.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Dirk Marten Slotboom, sought leave to appeal under s.5F(3)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from an interlocutory judgment or order of Bellew J on 30 January 2013 refusing to adjourn the Applicant's murder trial. 

3Following the refusal of the adjournment, the trial was fixed to commence on 4 February 2013. 

4At the conclusion of the hearing of this application on 1 February 2013, the Court made an order that leave to appeal was refused, with reasons to be published at a later time. These are my reasons for refusing the Applicant leave to appeal.

Application for Leave to Appeal Under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912

5This Court has made clear that the requirement for leave to appeal under s.5F(3) is a live question to be considered in the circumstances of the particular case: R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 722-723.

6In Agius v R [2011] NSWCCA 119; 80 NSWLR 486, the Court said at 489 [10]:

""This Court has said that leave will only be granted where the decision which is the subject of the s.5F application is attended with sufficient doubt so as to warrant the matter being argued on appeal (R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 644-645), or where the interests of justice otherwise require the intervention of the Court at this stage of the proceedings (R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723; R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536; (2000) 120 A Crim R 42 at 48 [34]). The Court should bear in mind the undesirability of interrupting criminal proceedings by the bringing of a s.5F application: R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; (2008) 71 NSWLR 31 at 37 [23]-[25].""

7The principles to be applied by this Court where an appeal is brought against the discretionary decision of a trial Judge refusing to adjourn a criminal trial were expressed in the following way in R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290 (footnotes omitted):

""Whether or not an adjournment should be granted is a matter which lies within the discretion of the trial judge. An appeal based upon the judge's refusal to grant an adjournment is thus one against the exercise of a discretion, and it will be allowed only where it has been established that the judge has erred in the proper exercise of that discretion. There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision, but that presumption will be overcome where it is shown that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts. Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise that discretion. An appellate court may not, however, substitute its own findings of fact for those of the primary judge unless there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence is all one way or the judge has misdirected himself in relation to those facts. If the appellate court is satisfied that there has been an injustice to one of the parties as a result of the judge's exercise of discretion, it is under a duty to review the order made.""

Proceedings Against the Applicant

8In February-March 2012, the Applicant stood trial, together with Fadi Shamoun (""Shamoun""), before Bellew J and a jury for the murder, on 24 June 2007, of Richard Carruthers. 

9At the conclusion of the trial, Shamoun was found guilty of the murder of Mr Carruthers and of a further count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the wife of Mr Carruthers. However, the jury could not agree upon a verdict in relation to the Applicant. The jury was discharged with respect to the Applicant and his matter was adjourned with a view to setting a date for his retrial.

10It is the retrial of the Applicant which was listed to commence before Bellew J and a jury on 29 January 2013, which is the subject matter of the unsuccessful adjournment application.

11On 29 June 2012, Shamoun was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 27 years, with a non-parole period of 20 years, in respect of the charges for which he was convicted. 

12On 10 July 2012, a Notice of Intention to Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was lodged by Shamoun. In his judgment refusing the adjournment application (at [50]-[57]), Bellew J noted that Shamoun was in the course of seeking a further extension of time to allow an appeal to be filed. No grounds of appeal had been filed, let alone written submissions in support of any appeal. 

The Application for Leave to Appeal

13The sole basis upon which adjournment of the trial was sought on 29 January 2013 was to defer the trial of the Applicant (who is on bail) until the Court of Criminal Appeal had heard and determined an appeal against conviction by Shamoun which, so the trial Judge and this Court were informed, would include a ground of appeal that the verdict of guilty of murder was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. If this ground was made out, the Court of Criminal Appeal would be asked to acquit Shamoun of murder. 

14A premise of the application was that, given the way in which the Crown has put its case, if Shamoun was acquitted of the murder of Mr Carruthers, then the Applicant, whom the Crown alleges directed the attack upon Mr Carruthers, could not be liable to conviction for the murder of Mr Carruthers. 

15As the Crown case had been conducted at the first trial upon the basis that the Applicant could not be convicted of murder if Shamoun was acquitted, it was argued that the Applicant's trial should not proceed until the Court of Criminal Appeal had determined whether Shamoun's murder conviction should stand.

16Mr Dhanji SC, counsel for the Applicant before this Court, developed submissions in support of three proposed grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - His Honour failed to have regard to a relevant consideration, that is the prejudice to the Applicant arising from refusal of the application.

(b) Ground 2 - His Honour placed too much weight on case management to the exclusion of other factors.

(c) Ground 3 - His Honour's decision was unreasonable or plainly unjust, in that real injustice would be occasioned to the Applicant if the adjournment was not granted.

17It was submitted by Mr Dhanji SC that the primary Judge had focused on the issue of delay in his judgment refusing the adjournment, but had failed to balance competing considerations which were relevant to the discretionary decision to be made. It was submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the prejudice to the Applicant which was said to arise in the following ways:

(a) the Applicant's trial was likely to conclude well before Shamoun's appeal is heard and, if the Applicant is convicted, he faced a lengthy period in custody in circumstances where, if Shamoun is subsequently acquitted by this Court, the impact of that judgment will be that the Applicant should have been acquitted at his first trial;

(b) the Applicant at this trial is not able to cross-examine the central Crown witness, David Saad, about his evidence that Shamoun was the killer and the Applicant is not able to put a positive case that Shamoun was not the killer;

(c) in the event that the Applicant is convicted and Shamoun is acquitted by this Court on appeal, there will be an inconsistency between that acquittal and the conviction of the Applicant - quite apart from questions of incontrovertibility and abuse of process, the inconsistency will tend to bring the system of criminal justice into disrepute.

18Whilst acknowledging that delay was a relevant consideration, Mr Dhanji SC submitted that the likely delay before this Court determined Shamoun's conviction appeal was not a decisive factor, given the delay by the Crown in taking four-and-a-half years to bring the Applicant to trial and the fact that the key Crown witnesses had all provided statements and given evidence on several occasions. 

19Mr Dhanji SC noted that the Crown had sought to change its position for the purpose of the retrial, by contending that it would be open to the jury to convict the Applicant even if it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Shamoun who was responsible for the killing. Referring to R v King (1985) 17 A Crim R 184 at 188-189 and King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 433, Bellew J ruled (at [30]-[48]) that the Crown ought not be permitted to present its case at the retrial upon a different basis, so that a direction would be given that it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied that Shamoun killed Mr Carruthers before the Applicant could be convicted of murder. Mr Dhanji SC submitted that the Crown's desire to change its case should lead the Court to conclude that there was a real question as to whether Shamoun had killed Mr Carruthers, and thus there was substance in Shamoun's conviction appeal.

20The Crown submitted that leave to appeal should be refused in circumstances where the application was based upon what were, at best, two possibilities - firstly, that Shamoun would proceed with an appeal to this Court and secondly that, if he did, that he would be acquitted by this Court following that appeal. 

21The Crown pointed to the consequence that a further delay in the trial may serve to erode recollections of witnesses to be called at the trial. 

22The Crown emphasised, as well, the need for exceptional circumstances before this Court would grant leave to appeal under s.5F from a discretionary determination declining to adjourn a trial.

Determination of Application

23It may be accepted for the purpose of this application that, if Shamoun had been acquitted at trial in March 2012, or if this Court on appeal acquitted him of murder, then such a verdict would render it inevitable that the Applicant could not be convicted of the murder of Mr Carruthers. This is the product of the manner in which the Crown has conducted its case against the Applicant and will be required to conduct its case at his retrial.

24If Shamoun's appeal was ready to proceed with formulated grounds of appeal and written submissions which permitted an assessment of the strength of the grounds of appeal and, in particular, any ground of appeal that the verdict of guilty of murder was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, then the trial Judge and this Court would have been in a position to make some assessment of Shamoun's prospects of success. Further, the hearing of the appeal could have been expedited. However, this was not the scenario presented by the Applicant.

25The Applicant was not in a position to advance submissions of this type at first instance or before this Court. This was so even where the same senior counsel (not Mr Dhanji SC) had appeared for the Applicant at trial before Bellew J and a jury in February-March 2012, and was to appear for the Applicant again at the pending retrial. 

26If, as appears to be the case, Shamoun's legal representatives did not take prompt action to lodge an appeal to this Court which was then prosecuted with due despatch, it was always open to the Applicant and his legal representatives to formulate by reference to materials in their possession (including the transcript of the trial of February-March 2012 and the summing up of Bellew J at the trial) the ways in which it could be said that the verdict of the jury on the murder count against Shamoun was unreasonable or could not be supported on the evidence. After all, it is said that the Applicant, in effect, had a vested interest in the outcome of Shamoun's appeal.

27Without an analysis of this type, this Court is left in the position that nothing more can be said than Shamoun proposes to press a ground of appeal contending that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported. The bare possibility that such a ground will be pressed, associated with the bare possibility that the Court of Criminal Appeal may find merit in that ground with the prospect of acquitting Shamoun, constituted a tenuous basis for the trial Judge, or this Court, to determine that the interests of justice require that the trial of the Applicant be adjourned.

28I do not consider that the Applicant's case is advanced materially by reference to the Crown's attempt to change its approach at the retrial (see [19] above). That does not serve to demonstrate that Shamoun has good prospects of success on an appeal against conviction.

29It was not submitted for the Applicant to Bellew J that, given his Honour's function as trial Judge in February-March 2012, his Honour ought form a view concerning the weakness of the case against Shamoun on the murder count, and the corresponding strength of any ground of appeal that the verdict on this count was unreasonable. The fact that his Honour (at [59]) did not express any view on these matters does not assist the Applicant.

30In the result, this Court has been left with a flimsy basis for concluding that the interests of justice required an adjournment of the trial of the Applicant. Associated with this lack of information concerning the nature of Shamoun's grounds of appeal and the arguments to be advanced in support of those grounds, was the length of the delay before this Court would hear and determine any such appeal. 

31On 1 February 2013, the Court stood the hearing of the application down to allow counsel to make enquiries of Shamoun's legal representatives concerning a likely timeframe for a more expeditious approach to preparation of the appeal. The Court was informed that junior counsel for Shamoun was preparing an advice on merits and draft grounds of appeal, which would form the basis for draft written submissions in support of the appeal. These documents were to be provided to the senior counsel to be briefed for the hearing of the appeal by 17 March 2013. On this basis, the Court was informed that grounds of appeal and written submissions for Shamoun were likely to be filed soon after 17 March 2013. 

32Bellew J formed the view that, if the adjournment application was allowed, the hearing of any appeal would be four to six months away (with the Court likely to reserve judgment) and any trial of the Applicant would be in the vicinity of 12 months away, if not more (at [56]-[57]). The information provided to this Court, associated with the prospect of an expedited hearing of Shamoun's appeal, may have seen a lesser delay, but still one likely to extend to mid-to-late 2013.

33A consequence of these matters is that the Applicant is in no real position to assert, with any vigour, that he is at the risk of prejudice of being convicted by a jury at his trial of the murder of Mr Carruthers, in circumstances where there is a real prospect that Shamoun will, in due course, be acquitted of that charge so that the Applicant himself should also be acquitted.

34The very conduct of the adjournment application brought belatedly by the Applicant on the first day of the scheduled retrial, against the background of inaction of the type which I have mentioned, is a further consideration to be taken into account by this Court in determining whether leave to appeal ought be granted in this case. 

35If the Applicant had taken the steps which I have mentioned, his position on the leave application, and possibly the appeal itself, may have been different. However, that is not the case.

36The trial Judge was entitled to take into account the strong public interest that, once fixed for hearing upon the basis that the parties were ready to proceed, a criminal trial should ordinarily proceed with expedition: R v Alexandroaia at 291. The significance of this consideration has been reinforced by the enactment of the case management provisions in ss.134-149F Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

37This Court has observed that it should be reluctant to interfere with the discretionary refusal of an adjournment application by a trial Judge. 

38I was not persuaded that the circumstances of the case were such that this Court should grant leave to appeal against the refusal of the adjournment.

39It was for these reasons that I joined in the order made on 1 February 2013 that leave to appeal be refused.
 
40GROVE AJ: On 1 February 2013 I joined in making the order that leave to appeal be refused. I have had the opportunity to read in draft the reasons of Johnson J for also joining in making that order. I agree with his statement of reasons and am content gratefully to adopt them in lieu of publishing a separate statement to the same effect.

2760926,R v Ryan [2013] NSWDC 281,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Trevor Ross Ryan appears today for sentence in relation to eight offences, in respect of which he entered pleas of guilty to having committed between 15 July 2011 and 17 July 2011, at various places in New South Wales, but particularly at Tumbarumba, Wagga Wagga and Lucknow, near Orange.

2The offences were committed when Mr Ryan was an escapee from a Corrective Services establishment near Tumbarumba. 

3The offences to which he pleaded guilty in summary were, in order of their occurrence: Firstly, an offence of breaking, entering and stealing at Tumbarumba, where he broke and entered the dwelling house of Anne Cameron and stole certain property particularised in the charge, which included a set of car keys. That offence, contrary to s 112(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment.

4Related to that offence is count 2, when the prisoner took and drove the car of Ms Cameron by the use of the car keys that he had stolen from inside her dwelling house, taking the car without her consent. This offence contrary to s 154A Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.

5Three offences were committed on 16 July in the early hours of the morning in Wagga Wagga as the prisoner was endeavouring to make his way from Tumbarumba, as I would understand it, to Dubbo possibly, to elude capture.

6These offences are in count 3 an offence of aggravated breaking and entering of a dwelling house and therein committing the indictable offence of stealing in circumstances of aggravation that he knew people were inside the dwelling. This offence, contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and has a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment.

7Count 4 on the indictment, to which he pleaded guilty, is an allegation that at the time of his presence inside the dwelling house he took a five year old girl, TB, without her consent, with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely ""psychological gratification"". I am informed that this offence, contrary to s 86(1) Crimes Act, carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment.

8He shortly after, whilst the young person was in his detention, committed the offence particularised in count 6 of sexual intercourse with TB, a child then under the age of ten years, namely five years of age. This offence contrary to s 66A(1) Crimes Act, carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of fifteen years.

9Shortly after that he committed the offence particularised in count 7, contrary to s 148 Crimes Act carrying a maximum penalty of seven years, of stealing property belonging to a woman named Amy Paul in a dwelling house that she shared with another person at Crampton Street Wagga Wagga. Amongst the property he stole was a set of keys which he used to commit the offence in count 8 of taking and driving a motor vehicle that belonged to Amy Paul, without her consent, another offence contrary to s 154A Crimes Act 1900. 

10Count 9 on the indictment is an offence of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, again contrary to s 154A, as with counts 2 and 8, on 17 July 2011 at Lucknow, the car being taken after it would appear he had dumped the car of Amy Paul.

11Again this offence, as with all the other offences, with the exception it must be pointed out of counts 4 and 6, was committed in furtherance of his intention to elude or avoid apprehension.

12The statement of facts is an agreed statement of facts. It is quite lengthy but a body of it includes a great deal of detail that does not have to be repeated in these remarks on sentence, particularly in relation to aspects of the investigation of the matter concerning the detention and sexual and assault of TB.

13The prisoner, who was born on 18 June 1991, as I said earlier, was an escapee. He had been sentenced in the Campbelltown District Court on 6 May 2010 to a term of imprisonment of three years three months, with a non-parole period of two years, by a Judge of this court, for offences including an offence of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, knowing people were in the premises.

14The prisoner was lawfully at the Mannus Correctional facility at Tumbarumba from October 2010. On 14 July 2011 he was found to be missing when a muster was conducted. 'Mannus', of course, is close by to Tumbarumba. 

15The victim, Ms Cameron, in relation to count 1, had travelled from Tumbarumba to Wagga with her partner, Mr Goldspink, and secured the premises. Mr Goldspink returned to the premises at 5.15pm on the evening of 15 July. He noticed the vehicle, the subject of count 2, a Kia Rio sedan missing from the carport. He also found the property that is particularised in the indictment in Count 1 of ninety-six dollars that was in a plastic money jar was missing, along with of course the set of keys for the vehicle. It goes without saying that subsequent investigations, when the vehicle was recovered in Wagga Wagga, found the fingerprints of the prisoner on the rear vision mirror and on another item within the vehicle. The prisoner obviously drove to Wagga Wagga and was here at least in the early hours of the morning of 15 July 2011. 

16The victim, TB, as I have pointed out, was five years of age. She lived in the premises with her parents and her older brother and sister. There was another person who was, as I understand it, an aunt of the victim of the sexual assault living in the premises and she shared a bedroom with TB.

17The facts set out the movements of the family up until the time that the victim was placed in her bed by her father, as I would understand it some time after 12.30am. The victim was placed in a low, or low level, bunk and her aunt slept in the top bunk.

18Some time later, it is estimated between 4am and 5am, the prisoner had broken into the premises to commit the offence in count 3. It is quite clear that in the middle of the night it would be expected that persons would be inside a dwelling house and inside the premises. Once in there, the prisoner stole a mobile phone charger, a Nokia mobile phone, USB cable, some gold rings belonging to CB and the mother JS, and then it would appear the prisoner entered the bedroom of the victim.

19The victim awoke to find the prisoner sitting beside the bed, that is where she first saw him, and he asked her ""Would you like to come outside with me?"" He helped her out of the bed and took her by the hand and left the house via the backdoor. Once outside the house he walked the victim down the side of the house and then onto what I understand to be a footpath on the street. He told her to be quiet by putting his fingers over his lips and saying ""Shhh"".

20He then pointed at a house and said to the victim ""That's my house right there"". The prisoner walked along the footpath to other premises then picked the victim up and carried her over his shoulder.

21In her interview on 1 November 2011 the victim said that the prisoner had licked her ""private parts"". He did this when he took her to an area between some houses, which are not described, and told her to lay down. He said to her that he would ""kill her"" if she did not listen to him. There was a tap nearby the grass area where she was laying. The prisoner pulled down her pants, that is her underpants and tights, spread her legs apart and began licking her vagina. This is described in the facts as occurring for a ""very short time"".

22The facts reveal that two citizens SJ, a nurse, and JG, a schoolteacher, were in their home in Cullen Road. At about 4.45am SJ heard a male voice and could hear a girl's voice. The voices were nearby. She went out to the toilet, looked around and could not see anything but could hear then a female ""whimpering"" and ""becoming distressed"". 

23She became concerned. She and her partner went out to see what was going on. She heard a male voice during the course of these inquiries saying ""Be quiet, lay down, be quiet"", and instructed her partner to call the police. She says that she could hear ""crying and wincing"".

24Ultimately she saw what was obviously the prisoner standing holding a small child. The child's head appeared to be above the male, as if she was raised above him. He was walking towards Edward Street and ultimately was seen to have the child on his back. The prisoner was called to by JG calling out ""Oi"", and the facts state the prisoner immediately dropped the victim and began running away in the direction of Edward Street. The child was gathered up by JG and the facts reveal the circumstances in which she was ultimately reunited with her family.

25The prisoner was chased by JG for a period of time down to Dobney Avenue and ultimately JG lost sight of him, although he endeavoured to keep in visual sight of him.

26The police attended. The facts state that the victim appeared frightened and in shock when seen by the police, and ultimately the police made inquiries to locate her parents. I have been provided with a number of details of her reunion with her parents and the fact that her father found the property missing that is particularised in count 3.

27Both fingerprint evidence and what is described as ""DNA evidence"" linked the offender to his presence in the property.

28Some time during the morning of 16 July the offender entered the premises of Amy Paul. Inside those premises he took car keys and a wallet containing money and cards, I would take that to be credit cards, and then used the keys to take the vehicle that belonged to Ms Paul. That vehicle was located at Lucknow near Orange some time during the evening of 16 July.

29The prisoner whilst in Lucknow took the motor vehicle of Ms Haydon and that is the offence constituted by count 9. That vehicle was taken by the offender and travelled in by him to Sydney. It was seen by a witness in Shalvey in Western Sydney and ultimately recovered by the police. 

30The prisoner was arrested on 22 July 2011 in an apartment in Pitt Street Redfern and taken to Redfern Police Station to be interviewed.

31That interview it is of some importance in the context of some of the history that the prisoner has given to medical professionals concerning matters relevant to the charges and the like. In the course of the interview the prisoner sought to distance himself from the events to which he has pleaded guilty, particularly the events in Wagga. He claimed that he had been in a car crash in 2009 that affected his memory. There is in fact, on examination of the evidence available to this Court from hospital notes and psychiatric and other examinations, no evidence of a lack of memory of the prisoner so far as relevant events are concerned by reason of a head injury.

32He told police that he had not been in Wagga since 2006, 2007, when he was in a Juvenile Detention Centre, although he admitted that he had escaped from lawful custody. That fact was self-evident. He said that when he escaped from Mannus he stole a car from Mannus, or near Tumbarumba, and used it to get to Dubbo, taking a route to Dubbo which took him through Albury, Leeton, Griffith and Condobolin. This was untrue.

33When asked about his fingerprints being located within the home of the victims in respect of counts 3, 4 and 6 he said that he was not talking, he had nothing to say. When it was put to him that he had committed the abduction of the child he said ""Look I wouldn't have a clue if I did it or not, I didn't do it"".

34He later in that interview denied again breaking into Cullen Road, the Cullen Road premises where count 3 was committed, as well as count 4. He made a claim of being affected by drugs at the time he escaped from Mannus, saying that he had smoked some cannabis and taken some pills ""like eckies"", which I take to be a reference to MDMA, or ecstasy, whilst he was in custody. At a later interview he said he had consumed some ""ice"" in Wagga. 

35In this matter I have the Victim Impact Statement of the mother of the victim of the sexual assault. This statement is received pursuant to s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have read that statement and it reflects upon the effect of the victim from the perspective of the mother since these events. There is objective evidence on the night in question that the victim was distressed and upset. The facts refer to her appearing in ""shock"".

36I have taken that statement into account as required to under s 28. One would not be surprised by the general import of the statement, having regard to the objective facts.

37With regard to the personal circumstances of the prisoner, and his criminal history, and his medical condition at the time of the commission of the offences and before and since, the Court has been provided with a body of material which provides some context for the circumstances in which the prisoner came to be in custody at Mannus, and perhaps some context for the commission of the offences with which the Court is concerned.

38I have been provided in the material that has been tendered with medical histories from Dubbo Base Hospital, and I have been provided with records of the Juvenile Justice Health Division and some ""Kessler 10"" Mental Health Self-assessments that have been taken from Justice Health records.

39As I would understand it, this material and a substantial body of material from Department of Community Service records have been considered by Dr Olav Nielssen, from whom I have received reports, firstly, of 11 October 2012, which was prepared before Dr Nielssen had the opportunity to read the DOCS' material, and a further report reflecting upon particularly the DOCS' material, prepared in early February of this year.

40I also have a medical report from Dr David Greenberg, who is consultant psychiatrist to the Department of Corrective Services Justice Health from time to time, whose report, as I understand it, was prepared for the matters that were dealt with by his Honour Judge Conlon SC, at the Campbelltown District Court.

41With regard to the Dubbo Health records, they are not comprehensive. They provide history of some head injury, causing a laceration, without fracture, or neurological deficit, after a head blow with a railway stone. There is also record in the Dubbo Hospital notes of an attempted self hanging by the prisoner.

42The Justice Health records are not exhaustive either. What is comprehensive, in this regard, however, are the Department of Community Service's records, which apparently amount up to six volumes, and detail the contact of the prisoner and members of his family with the Department of Community Services, between at least October 2001 and 2008.

43The records provide a comprehensive and contemporaneous account of the prisoner being the subject of, without any doubt, a great deal of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of family members over a period of time, and reflect upon a considerable degree of dysfunction, neglect and deprivation for the prisoner in a range of ways since he was at least ten years of age.

44The very first note in the material provided to me reflects notification of an incident relating to concerns about the welfare of the children of the prisoner's family in the context of being struck by an iron bar, wielded by their mother.

45I do not propose to go through that material in detail. As I say these contemporaneous records, which are very powerful evidence, present a very sorry picture of neglect and dysfunction in the life of the prisoner from the time he was a very small child.

46The material was subjected to scrutiny by Dr Nielssen as material that he may be able to comment upon in the context of the character of the allegations brought against the prisoner, particularly in respect of the sexual assault and the detention of the child, as well as other matters.

47In that regard, I note, amongst a myriad of family incidents that the Department of Community Service's report, the prisoner at one stage, admittedly when he was in his mid-teens, was the subject of protection by an apprehended domestic violence order, in which he was the person in need of protection and the person from whom he was in need of protection was his mother.

48I believe the material is summed up very fairly in Dr Nielssen's report of 6 February. He states:

""The additional material indicates that Mr Ryan had an extremely unstable and insecure childhood, even by the standards reported by people from the more dysfunctional Aboriginal communities in recent decades. The DOCS' records show that he is brought up in an environment in which he was subjected to physical and emotional abuse as well as severe deprivation and neglect of his basic physical and psychological needs.""

49He does express theories and possible occurrences reflecting the possibility if his mother abused alcohol when he was a child that this may have had an effect on the prisoner's neurological development.

50He goes on to say in relation to matters about which he can express opinions with some confidence:

""The experience of physical abuse by his mother is likely to have contributed to impairment in his capacity to experience basic security in relationships as an adult, that is a pre-requisite for a stable lifestyle of long-term partnership and employment and has probably left him with an increased propensity to resort to violence to solve interpersonal problems. The lack of socialisation and basic education and vocational training is also likely to have left Mr Ryan with a limited capacity to adapt to independent life in the community as an adult.""

51He says further:

""The main effect of the conditions of Mr Ryan's upbringing would appear to be the increased propensity to abuse substances and to alleviate distressing emotional states, both by following the example of his parents and also as a well recognised way of ameliorating the chronic dysphoria that is often described in people who have suffered severe neglect and abuse in childhood.""

52He notes there is no reference to sexual abuse in childhood, and in fact the prisoner does not claim such sexual abuse, for example, in the report prepared by Dr Greenberg, at any earlier time, when the 'courts' were concerned with less serious charges than those particularly set out in counts 4 and 6. The opinions expressed by the doctor, as was conceded by Mr King, are not of such a nature as to enable the Court to reach any firm findings in that regard.

53He concludes in supplementation of the opinions that he had expressed in October that:

""Mr Ryan would appear to require a long-term programme of socialisation, including basic education, vocational training, counselling, et cetera, to improve his interpersonal skills and capacity for self-control and counselling, specifically directed at his propensity to abuse drugs. His prospects of long-term stability would be assisted by graded release into a supported environment in which all those needs are addressed.""

54I have quoted that part of that report in full because as Judges are often told in discussions with representatives of the Department of Corrective Services and representatives of the Parole Authority, in seminars and the like, unbeknownst to the people that sit in court, even the legal representatives, a great deal of weight is placed upon consideration of the evidence that was available to the sentencing judge in regard to parole release and even for classification.

55The prisoner, as follows from what I have already pointed out, is an Aboriginal man born in Dubbo and one of a number of siblings. The history of his upbringing is largely to be found in the reports of Dr Nielssen and/or the report of Dr Greenberg.

56As I understand the matter, although there is no direct evidence on this, Mr Ryan believes that he is the third oldest of six children, although his eldest brother died at birth. He was, as I said earlier, generally raised by his parents, although there were many DOCS interventions for his welfare. His father apparently died in 2008. The accounts from the prisoner obtained by the two doctors that have prepared reports reflect upon the unwillingness of the prisoner to discuss matters relating to his history. He had education at primary school, and at high school, but was not a great achiever and he was ultimately expelled from school for fighting. He says that he did complete year 10 and is literate, but he, as his history reveals, had a connection with the court system from the age of fourteen years of age. I am not aware of any cautions that were administered to him of course before he first was brought to court.

57He has experience working as a mechanic, or a trainee mechanic at a motorcycle shop as part of the Ted Noffs' Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Programme. He had also worked at ""Hungry Jack's"", as I would understand it, in Dubbo and had some short employment in Canberra doing mechanical work, but this was unpaid work.

58He has not a great history of employment, reflective of his educational achievement, and of course there are very limited economic opportunities for a person in his situation.

59So far as it reflects upon his criminal history, in the context of this life of neglect and abuse, at least physical abuse, he began drinking alcohol at the age of thirteen and had alcoholic blackouts obviously from binge drinking. He also began smoking cannabis at thirteen and began using amphetamines, according to the history he gave Dr Greenberg, when he was about fifteen years of age, and has used prohibited drugs up until the time of his last incarceration in 2010.

60As I said he has undertaken some rehabilitation programmes. But as I would understand the history that has not assisted him in relation to his alcohol and substance abuse.

61The report of Dr Greenberg in its conclusions in 2010 states that the prisoner was not mentally ill, nor does he have a developmental disability. Dr Greenberg notes some history of being diagnosed with ADHD as a twelve year old and notes the lengthy history of drug and alcohol abuse and the deterioration of his behaviour. Clinically he says his primary diagnosis is that of a man with a significant antisocial personality disorder associated with alcohol and polysubstance dependence. At that time he had evidence of mild depression, which may have been due to an underlying dysthymic disorder, or drug induced mood disorder. He was of the view that the prisoner's needs had to include addressing his alcohol and drug dependence by counselling and review of his condition by an appropriate medical professional.

62Dr Nielssen in his assessment of the prisoner noted on mental state examination, some time before 11 October 2012, that the prisoner did not appear to be depressed. There was some clinical suggestion of impaired judgment, but there was no disorganisation of thinking suggesting the presence of underlying mental illness or brain damage affecting communication.

63His diagnosis was primarily that of a substance dependence and abuse disorder with a possible underlying psychotic illness. The first diagnosis was based upon the history he gave of drug and alcohol abuse. He said complications of substance abuse can include episodes of amnesia and the triggering of psychotic symptoms and possible impairment of cognitive function. He reflected upon some history of hallucinations relating to voices and some past treatment of antipsychotic medication.

64He noted, as it is relevant to the judgment of this matter in some respects, that the prisoner denied having any sexual attraction to children and could not offer an explanation for his reported behaviour. He said that the increased sexual interest and loss of inhibition from the combination of methylamphetamine and benzodyasapim medication were quite probably ""factors"" contributing to the offences.

65The difficulty with that analysis in the latter part is, of course, whilst the prisoner has raised this matter in interviews with the police and in the conference with Dr Nielssen, there is no direct evidence from the prisoner about this which could be challenged, or tested. The prisoner has not given evidence. There was not, in the investigation of the matter, as I understand it, any evidence found within the motor vehicles that he drove of recent ingestion of methylamphetamine, or other illicit or prescribed drugs.

66Certainly, I note the suggestion of the prisoner in this regard, but it is quite clear that the offences, with the exception of counts 4 and 6, as I earlier said, were offences committed by the prisoner in the course of him endeavouring to elude recapture, and of course the most serious offences with which I am concerned occurred in the course of one of the those offences, albeit in circumstances that speak of an absence of premeditation.

67Of course, as I will analyse in a moment, the fact that he committed the offence on a small child is a matter of deep concern and it could be categorised as ""predatory behaviour"". But to be fair, there is no evidence, as there is from time to time in sentencing offenders for offences of this type, of the prisoner having a paedophilic or other personality disorder, or condition, which might first of all explain his conduct in a rational way, or suggest that the prisoner is a danger to the community in a general and permanent sense.

68Dr Nielssen said that the prisoner would seem to have a guarded prognosis based upon the impulsive nature of his offences, and the pattern of his substance abuse despite previous drug rehabilitation programmes. He said the impression for him of the prisoner from a single interview was that the prisoner had a limited capacity for participation in counselling aimed at improving his self-awareness and that his best chance for a successful rehabilitation would be a carefully structured preimposed release plan that included stable accommodation, some form of occupation or training, and close supervision and support.

69He was quite ""still young"" according to Dr Nielssen and that is self-evidently true, being twenty at the time of the commission of the offences, and in the doctor's opinion should ""mature over time"".

70This brings me back to the details of his criminal history understood in the context of what I have just outlined. According to his criminal history he first appeared in the Children's Court in December 2005, and has a series of findings of guilt over the next three or so years for which he received various orders, including probation and community service, suspended control orders and the like. Those offences were generally offences of dishonesty, breaking and entering dwellings, larceny, having goods in custody. The are some offences of violence, but predominantly his offences were offences of dishonesty.

71He does not have a significant record as an adult, albeit of course by the time he was sentenced in 2010 in the District Court he would have been eighteen years of age. However, he was convicted in the Local Court of breaking, entering and stealing in June 2010 and sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment, commencing on 9 January 2010. This conviction followed upon his appearance at the Campbelltown District Court, when he was sentenced for the aggravated breaking, entering and stealing matter that I referred to and had two offences taken into account of taking a vehicle without consent and driving whilst unlicensed.

72For the aggravated breaking, entering and stealing matter, as I have earlier said, he was sentenced to three years three months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years, on 6 May 2010. The non-parole period would have expired or be required to expire, bearing in mind the sentence commenced on 9 February 2010, on 8 February 2012.

73I should point out, as was self-evident from what I said earlier, that amongst, the orders made in relation to him in the Children's Court, there were included 'control orders' and he had been in various Juvenile Justice institutions. I also note that he has other findings of guilt in the Local Court, apart from the ones that I have identified. The record obviously has no mention of sexual assaults, or offences relating to children. 

74In the submissions made by learned counsel for the accused, it was not submitted in the context of all the material available that the prisoner had any mental health issue that could be assessed as contributing to his offending, or being regarded as a matter that might be a mitigating consideration, for example, in the way in which mental health may influence or affect sentencing, as set out in summary cases such as Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 or R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228.

75In relation to the issue of his Aboriginality, I have gone to some length to outline the social context in which he grew up and made some observation of its relevance to the circumstances that at least brought him into custody at the time of his escape.

76Clearly, on the basis of the facts available to this court, there is no direct relationship to the offending with which I am concerned to his Aboriginality beyond the relationship of that to the circumstances of him coming to custody in 2010 and the social circumstances that led to a propensity to commit acts of dishonesty.

77It was submitted in this court that his deprived background could be taken into account as being a matter that was relevant to the assessment of his development and relevant to explaining aspects of his escape from custody.

78Of course, as the facts made clear, when he escaped from custody he acted purposefully, as any person, Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal, may have done if they had sought to elude capture. But I accept that his Aboriginality is still a relevant matter to be taken into account.

79The Crown itself acknowledges this, indirectly at least, based upon the material available to it at the time of preparing the written submissions, by reference to the decision of Wood J in The Queen v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. 

80Of course Wood J in that judgment was sentencing a man in relation to inter-communal violence in the Brewarrina area and many of the matters that were developed by his Honour as ""Fernando principles"" which have been the subject of much comment by subsequent judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal, have no direct relationship to this.

81However, out of that judgment one might fairly identify the fact that some of the propositions that his Honour put forward have salience in these proceedings:

""Firstly and fundamentally, the same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case, irrespective of the identity of a particular offender, or his membership of an ethnic or other group, but that does not mean that the sentencing court should ignore those facts which exist only by reason of the offender's membership of such a group.

Further, in sentencing an Aboriginal person, the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt. It must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting, and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender.

In sentencing an Aboriginal person who has come from a deprived background, or is otherwise disadvantaged by his social or economic factors, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly, or even unduly harsh when served in an environment which is foreign to him and in circumstances where it may be dominated by persons from different cultural backgrounds.

Furthermore, in every sentencing exercise, whilst it is important to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and not to lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence in the midst of what might otherwise be attractive subjective circumstances, full weight must be given to the competing public interest to rehabilitation of the prisoner and the avoidance of recidivism on his part"".

82I have somewhat paraphrased his Honour's words, but I do note that his Honour, nine years later in Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121, in a context of dealing with one of the early suspended sentences the subject of a Crown appeal, reflected upon the observations of King CJ in Yardley v Betts and by the South Australian Full Court again in Osenkowski, concerning the interests of sentencing being not just of punishment and retribution, noting the need for courts in sentencing to reflect upon the fact that ultimately when people are returned to the community the sentencing process should contribute to the rehabilitation of offenders. Because that was not just in the interests of the offender, but it was in the interests of the community. Clearly that is so of an offender with this prisoner's background, including his criminal background, because there can be no doubt, allowing for the course of conduct with which I am concerned, that the prisoner is to be regarded as a person who could be characterised as becoming a recidivist.

83In passing from this part of the sentencing exercise I also note the words of Hidden J in the sentencing of Mr Welch, in the Supreme Court, where his Honour said:

""Only the most myopic in this community would deny that much of the contact with Aboriginal people with the criminal law can be traced to their dispossession and the breakdown of their culture. The high incidence of Aboriginal people and the often deleterious and sometimes tragic effects it has upon them are of justifiable concern to the community to recognise that background in an appropriate case for the purpose of sentencing is neither discriminatory, nor paternalistic"".

84As I understand it, with the agreement of all parties in Parliament yesterday, a Bill was passed by the House of Representatives, short of constitutional recognition of Aboriginal people, noting and recognising in legislative form the place of Aboriginal people as the first occupants of this country. I noted the Prime Minister in her speech, supported by members of the Opposition, said that whilst there should be no guilt for the past, and past mistakes, there was much work to do in the future to make good the damage that has been done to Aboriginal communities. It could be fairly said that this prisoner's background reflects much of a very sad picture of damage that has been done to Aboriginal communities over a number of decades, through forces beyond the control of the Aboriginal people living in those communities, particularly in western New South Wales.

85In sentencing the prisoner of course, at this point I come back to submissions that were made particularly by the Crown, but also accepted in the submissions of the accused's counsel, relating to the essence of the sentencing exercise with which I am concerned.

86First of all I am to have regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown Prosecutor in this matter, as he has done in a number of matters in which I have presided in this Court, has at length, and very helpfully, outlined much of the discussion about the 'purposes of sentencing' which in part emanate from the judgment of the majority in Veen (No 2) v The Queen in 1988.

87He correctly points out, as the Court of Criminal Appeal has said, in the context of the consideration of s 3A being a codification and elaboration of the purposes of sentencing set out in Veen (No 2), that deterrence, retribution and protection of the community are not to take precedence to the exclusion of rehabilitation. But neither is rehabilitation to take precedence over deterrence, retribution and punishment. All must be balanced in the overall synthesising of the sentence.

88It was pointed out in the decision of MA, and as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in The Queen v Way, quoting from the Crown's submissions:

""The ultimate objective remains one of imposing a sentence that is just and appropriate having regard to all the circumstances of the offence. It is imperative that the offender's objective circumstances do not cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case.""

89Of course, each of the individual charges create their own individual consideration and it could not be fairly said that all of the purposes of sentencing, so far as they are relevant, are equally applicable to all of the offences to the same extent. But it must be fairly acknowledged, and I believe it has been in the submissions made, that in this matter the requirements of punishment, or adequate punishment, deterrence of the prisoner and others from committing similar offences, and protection of the community are important purposes of sentencing. The prisoner is required to be made accountable for his actions. He is to be denounced for his course of conduct, reflected in each of the matters with which I am concerned, and there must be due recognition of the harm done to the various victims and the community by his course of conduct over the three days, or two days, covered by the matters in the indictment. But also there is a need to reflect upon, as I said earlier, the long-term promotion of the rehabilitation of the prisoner. There is no need to dilate upon those matters any further.

90There is one matter concerning the protection of the community that needs to be considered, however, when weighing up the various purposes of sentencing. I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that so far as sexual predatory behaviour is concerned that the prisoner is proven to be a danger to the community.

91Of course, the facts speak for themselves in terms of their seriousness. The fact that the prisoner has acted in the particular way shown in counts 4 and 6 reflects of course the possibility that he may act that way in the future. But as I pointed out in the context of the medical evidence made available to the Court, and these matters are capable of assessment from a medical perspective, particularly in the hands of a very experienced psychiatrist like Drs Nielssen and Greenberg, there is at this point no evidence of an existing sexual predilection, or psychiatric, or psychological condition that would compel the prisoner to commit offences of this type.

92I note the Crown's submissions in relation to matters that are to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in each matter, by reference to both the maximum penalties that apply and where applicable as it is in two of the counts of the indictment, the standard non-parole period.

93I also accept the very detailed written submissions of the Crown about the seriousness of offences of sexual assault, particularly upon children. These matters are self-evident by the legislature's fixing of a maximum penalty of twenty-five years in relation to the s 66A offence, and the standard non-parole period of fifteen years. The courts have been consistent in that regard. 

94In relation to 'breaking and entering matters' I am also aware of what Lee J said in Hayes v The Queen, (1984) 1 NSWLR 740 but particularly I take into account Groves J observations in R v Ponfield and ors, (1999) 48 NSWLR 327, one of the early guideline judgments, in respect of break and enter matters.

95It is worthy of note that the various matters that are quoted by the Crown as being features of breaking, entering matters that might be circumstances of aggravation were in part picked up in somewhat different language by the subsequently enacted s 21A, which obviously still applies.

96However, for the purposes of this sentencing exercise, the matter that I wish to dwell on just for a moment is the consequences of Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120, as it relates to the offences which have standard non-parole periods. Amongst other reasons there are general statements by Muldrock v The Queen that might be said to be generally applicable in sentencing, and they pick up of course some of the matters that the Crown has identified in its written submissions.

97By reference to Pt 4, Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I first of all note that the Court concluded, particularly at [25], that it was an error to characterise the relevant provision in the Part as ""framed in mandatory terms"". It pointed out that a Court is not required when sentencing for a 'Div 1A' offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness.

98From that judgment the following matters may be seen as determined. Firstly, that it is essential to recognise that fixing the non-parole period in a case involving a standard non-parole period is only one part of the larger task of passing sentencing. Fixing the appropriate non-parole period is not to be treated as if it were the necessary starting point, or the only important end point in framing a sentence. Further, the Part requires, in conjunction with s 21A, an approach to sentencing that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Makarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357, particularly at [51], whereby the judge endeavours to identify all the relevant factors, including those at common law, to the sentencing exercise, discusses their significance and makes a value judgment as to what is an appropriate sentence.

99The Court went on to say (at [27]) that:

""The court must be mindful of two legislative guideposts, the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period, the latter requires the content be given to its specification, meaningful content cannot be given to the concept of taking into account characteristics of the offender, what is required is a consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence without reference to matters personal to a particular offender, or class of offenders. It is to be determined solely by reference to the nature of the offending, in the context of the consideration of the non-parole period that is a standard non-parole period for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness. The court is not required to commence with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle range of objective seriousness (by reference to a hypothesised offence) and then to ask whether there are matters which warrant a longer or shorter period [28] and of course, in making a record for its determination of the appropriate non-parole period, this does not require the court to 'attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant for the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period, or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending'."" (29).

100What the judge is required to do is fully identify the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached for the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

101I note in passing an article Hulme J in the November issue of the Judicial Officers' Bulletin, surveying many of the authorities of the Court of Criminal Appeal since Muldrock, discussing the appropriate approach to sentencing for matters that have a standard non-parole period. That article is quite a chilling reminder for Judges at first instance of the fact that even amongst the learned Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal there are various disagreements and conflicts as to the appropriate approach.

102With regard to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending and other matters though noting what I have said about both Ponfield as it relates to the breaking, entering and stealing matters, and the observations of Muldrock, first of all in relation to all the offences it is the case that the prisoner committed the offences whilst an escapee, as I have pointed out, and it was conceded in the submissions of the accused that offences committed by a person who otherwise should be in lawful custody aggravates the matter for the purposes of fixing an appropriate sentence and this is to be regarded as being a greater aggravation than if each of the offences was committed while subject to ""conditional liberty"", citing The Queen v King [2003] NSWCCA 352. 

103Intimately related to that proposition is, as I have earlier pointed out, the fact that all of the offences, save for counts 4 and 6, were offences committed by the prisoner in furtherance of his desire to continue his freedom and elude detention and/or recapture.

104The sexual assault and detain person with intent offences were not in furtherance of his attempts to elude detection, or were directly related to his status as an escapee, but they were committed in the course of, or immediately after the commission of count 3, which is one such offence.

105It goes without saying, having regard to their facts and other aspects of aggravation arising from the matter that the seriousness of the offences in count 4 and count 6 are self-evident, as a matter of commonsense, without necessarily having to dilate upon s 21A(2) of the Act.

106In relation to counts 1 and 2, the offences in Tumbarumba, noting the above, are to be seen in this light. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt having regard to the prisoner's background and the character of his criminal history, that notwithstanding having previously been dealt with in the District Court and other courts for like offences, that his criminal history ""aggravates the seriousness of (those) offence(s)"", pursuant to s 21A(2).

107I take this view on the basis of his relatively young age the time of the commission of the offence.

108I do accept that his criminal history clearly is relevant. It does not entitle him to any leniency in relation to any of the offences that I am concerned with and the fact that he was an escapee serving sentences of a similar type stands, even from a commonsense common law perspective, an independent aggravating feature. I do not believe, however in proper context, that the observations of the majority in Veen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 (at 477), have been reached at this point.

109I note in relation to count 1, count 3, and, so far as it may be relevant bearing in mind it is an ""enter dwelling"" offence; count 7, that there was no professional planning, no vandalism, there was a single entry, there was a modest amount of personal property stolen, certainly no items of sentimentality, save of course there were some gold rings taken from the residence of the victim of counts 4 and 6, the property of a victims father and no aggravations were pleaded under the legislation, save for count 3, which I will deal with separately. In relation to count 1 and in relation to count 7 of course the prisoner stole a pair of keys to give him the opportunity to commit counts 2 and 8, the taking of the motor vehicles.

110Although count 3 is in many respects intimately related to counts 4 and 6 in terms of the aggravations that are pleaded, it is the aggravation of knowing people to be inside. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that knowledge of the fact that people are inside was a matter that motivated the prisoner to commit the offence. His motivation, I am quite satisfied, was to obtain property that might assist him in his endeavour to elude recapture. It has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that he had a particular intention of abducting a child, or committing a sexual assault. He had no knowledge of the occupants of the premises, as far as I am aware it was just sad happenchance.

111Of course, this offence has to be seen in the context of what followed from it in counts 4 and 6, and I have already pointed to the absence of any predilection for sexual assault of children.

112Whilst Count 3 was an offence occurring at night, he clearly committed the offence with the intention of stealing property that he could carry away. He had no knowledge of vulnerable occupants, the choosing of the particular house would appear to be random and opportunistic. There was no vandalism, no professional planning, one entry to the premises.

113In the context of the matters arising in relation to the standard non-parole period, that provides a guidepost, or some indication, in relation to the matter, as discussed in Muldrock. 

114Count 4 was pleaded as an offence of detention for the purposes of psychological gratification. Although the prisoner sexually assaulted the complainant after she came into his detention I cannot not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had formed an intention to sexually assault her at the time that he took her into his detention. 

115It is quite clear that counts 4 and 6 were crimes committed without planning or premeditation, although he does not shed much light on the circumstances of the taking of the child. He came across her in the course of stealing property.

116Of course, what period he intended to detain her before the detention was interrupted by the courageous intervention of citizens, who are to be commended it is impossible to say. The prisoner was taking her away from the premises and thus the detention was not transient. 

117Aggravating factors that relate to this charge arising under s 21A(2) include the threatened use of violence during the course of the detention, admittedly also at the time of, or close to the sexual assault; the fact that the offence was committed in the home of the victim, or at least commenced in the home of the victim; the fact that the victim was clearly vulnerable by reason of her age alone, but also, effectively, not having anyone there to protect her.

118The Crown does not submit that this offence, as well as count 6, involved the infliction of substantial injury or harm. Whilst the Court cannot find that the prisoner did not have significant criminal history, given the character of his previous offending, the fact is that the matters in count 4 and count 6 are of an uncharacteristic nature, having regard to his criminal history.

119As I said earlier, in relation ultimately to all the matters, I could not conclude that his prior criminal history was a relevant aggravating factor, although I note what was said about this matter is reflected in the Crown's submissions, particularly by reference to the decision of McNaughton.

120The issue of the age of the child, in the context of the charge pleaded, was discussed in the decision of The Queen v King [2009] NSWCCA 117. Obviously the very young age of the child, noting what the learned Judges in that Court said, is a relevant factor for consideration of the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence reflected in count 6, as it must be in relation to count 4, where age is not pleaded.

121In this matter again, there was, as in the case of the detention offence, the threatened use of violence to the child of a serious kind.

122It was submitted that the threat was a ""qualified"" one, or some such thing. , But the words must have been frightening to the child and were clearly designed to compel her to bend to his will. 

123Of course, in light of subsequent events, even though he was interrupted in his detention, I could not conclude that he in fact had an intention to kill her. He clearly had an intention to frighten her.

124The Crown, in relation to count 6, as with count 4, does not submit there was relevant emotional harm, there is no evidence of that. The limits of the Victim Impact Statement which no doubt have been explained to the mother, are defined by the legislation and the case law.

125It is to be borne in mind of course that the sexual assault was committed whilst the child was unlawfully detained by the prisoner. Noting s 21A(2)(m), literally interpreted the fact that there were related offences committed is of itself not pursuant to s 21A(2) an aggravating factor in the sense. However, the fact the child was detained is a separate criminal act, albeit that it was for a short period of time, it is a matter that must be reflected in the consideration of the totality of the criminality. Furthermore, it sheds light on the circumstances of the sexual assault.

126Both the Crown and the defence, in their written submissions, endeavoured to rely upon various decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the District Court, to provide instances of comparative sentencing and principles that should be applied.

127It is quite obvious the most helpful judgment was the decision of King, to which I earlier made reference.

128I have had regard to the various authorities referred to by the Crown. I have had regard of course to the judgment of her Honour Judge English in this Court, and the sentence imposed on a person who abducted a child. That person of course had, as I understand it, no prior criminal convictions. But the character of that detention, the length of it, the manner of it, and the character of the penetration and the sexual assault of the victim were substantially different from the circumstances of this case, albeit absent the general aggravation of the prisoner in this matter being an escapee.

129With regard to the judgment of King, I appreciate that he was only to be sentenced for one count contrary to s 66A Crimes Act. But there were three offences on a Form 1, including committing a related act of indecency; stealing from the dwelling, as I understood it, in which he committed that offence; and an attempt to take a motor vehicle. However, the character of the offending, pursuant to s 66A in this matter is very similar. The consideration of Pt 4 Div 1A in a practical sense, that is in a factual sense, bears parallels with this case. Admittedly, of course, King is decided before Muldrock was decided. In King the child sexually assaulted was four; here the child was five. In King the child was assaulted in her grandmother's house. The Court said that the mere fact that it was committed in the home of a place where the child would expect to feel safe would deny the offence falling into the low range of criminality as the sentencing Judge had concluded.

130In this matter of course the victim had been taken from her house and then was sexually assaulted. This of itself reflects at the very least a greater criminality at least in the totality sense when the two offences are taken together in this matter.

131Here, as with King, the sexual assault was for a brief period of time. Here I am satisfied the prisoner knew that the conduct was wrong and in each case the victim found the conduct distressing. 

132Each crime, that is the crime of sexually assaulting the victim in this matter, and in the matter of King, was committed by a stranger.

133Of course, as with King there was no evidence of psychological injury, or emotional injury, apart from, as I have acknowledged, what was in the Victim Impact Statement. However, as with King I must conclude in this matter that it can properly be assumed that there would be a real risk of some harm, of more than a transitory nature occurring in such a case. In fact the Court of Criminal Appeal said in King, which it can be equally applied here:

""It is an inherent part of what makes the offence so serious"" [40].

134In King and in this matter, the sexual assault offences involve no real planning. There is no basis for concluding beyond reasonable doubt, as I said earlier, that the prisoner's intention in taking the child from the house was to sexually assault her. Like Mr King, the prisoner could not be found to be in character a ""sexual predator"" by way of criminal history or proven disposition.

135But as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in King:

""Planning or premeditation is not a factor that has any great significance in the evaluation of child sexual assault offences"".

136It was pointed out that in most instances even within the family they are ""usually opportunistic"".

137As with the matter of King and this offence, the offence of sexual assault was ""not an instantaneous reaction to seeing the child"".

138As with Mr King, this prisoner has no prior record of such offending, but here, as with Mr King, the prisoner's record is still relevant and obviously could not mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentence.

139As with King, the offences of detention with intent and sexual assault were committed during the course, or as a result of, an unlawful entry to a house in order to steal property. 

140Mr King, of course, was twenty-four years of age, and could ""no longer rely upon youth"". This prisoner is four years younger. Mr King was a person who had been given ""ample opportunity for reform"". I am not sure that this has occurred in this prisoner's case. Certainly the sentence I impose will delay that process of course.

141Mr King was intoxicated, which is not a mitigating factor in any event. I could not be satisfied by whatever test one applied that the prisoner was intoxicated.

142I have referred to the prisoner's claim of the use of amphetamines. Even if he had been affected by amphetamines, or other drugs, and even if this did disinhibit, him this could not be in any way seen as a mitigating factor for any of the offences, but particularly the offences involving the child.

143I note in this matter that the character of the penetration required by the law to prove sexual intercourse is conceded by the Crown in accordance with authorities such as PGM (2008) 187 A Crim R 152, and of course the High Court judgment in Ibbs v The Queen, as being not as serious as other forms of that penetration.

144The sexual assault occurred thankfully for a short period of time. Of course, there is a wide range of conduct contemplated as sexual intercourse. Given in this matter, as opposed to King, the intercourse did not cause any physical injury to the victim, this is a distinction that may be made.

145Of course, all acts of sexual intercourse are serious and I appreciate that what the prisoner did would fill ordinary people with revulsion. But the fact that the community would be filled with revulsion is not the final determinant, nor an appropriate scientific measure, of the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence in the context of the range of conduct contemplated by the section.

146I am mindful of the fact that the detention of the child was interrupted. As to what the prisoner would have done with the child had he not been interrupted would be a matter of speculation. Clearly he was taking her away, but I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was taking her away for a further sexual assault. Of course, the fact that he had done it once leaves that suspicion as a realistic one. Nevertheless, to conclude otherwise requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.

147I appreciate, as the Crown points out, the prisoner did not voluntarily cease the detention but it is to be fairly said that when first challenged at least verbally he did not continue with the detention, but abandoned the child in circumstances where he knew he was being followed.

148There was no actual violence or physical hurt inflicted on the victim. As with Mr King, the prisoner was not in a position of trust, but the absence of that aggravating factor is offset to a significant degree by the fact that the prisoner was a person who had broken into the home of the victim as a burglar, had no right to be in the house, and of course had no right to be at liberty, given he as an escapee (See King at [38]).

149Of course with regard to counts 7, 8 and 9, these offences have much the same characteristic as the offences disclosed in counts 1 and 2, and to some extent count 3, albeit that count 3 is pleated with the circumstance of aggravation.

150The various features of the matters arising from the observations of Grove J in Ponfield have been taken into account in respect of count 7, albeit that it is not a breaking, entering and stealing matter.

151With regard to relevant mitigating factors that arise under s 21A(3) of course the pleas of guilty are mitigating factors in each case. They were given on arraignment and I have concluded that the prisoner, in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton should receive a discount of fifteen per cent upon the other wise appropriate sentences. Of course the discount would have been less had the pleas been entered closer to, or at the time, that the trial was to commence. The submission was made by the defence that the discount should be fifteen per cent and I accept that that is so.

152Ultimately in relation to the various offences I could not conclude that the loss, injury, damage and the like was ""substantial"". I appreciate personal property was taken from the victims in money and small items of jewellery and the like. The most valuable items that were taken in two of the offences involving the entry to premises, the premises at Crampton Street in Wagga and the premises at Tumbarumba, were the motor vehicles that were driven away. But those vehicles were recovered and I was not told there was any damage in those vehicles. Thus, no finding could be made that there was substantial injury.

153None of the offences was part of a planned or organised criminal activity, as is self-evident. Obviously, with regard to other matters identified in the mitigating factors under s 21A(3) I could not conclude that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation. This is a matter for resolution and consideration by the Parole Authority at some future time. I could not conclude that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend without proper guidance within the correctional system.

154I have had regard of course to all the oral submissions, although they are relatively brief, and the written submissions. Most of the matters that have been raised in the written submissions have been directly addressed in these remarks. I could not do justice to everything that has been written.

155With regard to the commencement of the sentence, I have already foreshadowed that the sentence should commence at the expiry of the non-parole period fixed by His Honour Judge Conlon SC.

156The Crown submitted that I should impose sentences that commence at the expiry of the total sentence imposed by Judge Conlon. With respect, in the proper exercise of discretion and in accordance with general sentencing policy of Judges since the fixing of non-parole periods, particularly in the context of the decisions that have been brought to my attention, such as Callaghan and the like, the consideration of totality of criminality and the need to avoid ""double dipping"" in this matter, dictate the fixing of sentences that effectively commence at the expiry of the non-parole period.

157The prisoner, I note, was at large for a period of something in the order of ten days, or slightly less. I am not sentencing for the escape matter. I do not understand why that matter is not before the District Court. If I was sentencing him for the escape matter there are specific considerations I have to take into account in accordance with both legislation and common law principles developed over a long period of time.

158But that having been said, as I earlier indicated, I have had very close attention to the authorities that were drawn to my attention, particularly, although it is concerned with sentencing an offender upon a breach of parole, the decision of Callaghan and the analysis of Simpson J of the competing considerations that affect the Court's discretion, which is, as everybody concedes, relatively wide.

159With regard to the issue of special circumstances, ultimately the calculation of the appropriate sentence has turned in part upon the particular 'special circumstances' which mandates the adjustment of a relevant non-parole period, that the sentences I impose will in various respects be partially accumulative, not only upon the non-parole period fixed by Judge Conlon, but in respect of the sentences that I must impose.

160That is so because of the need to have proper regard to the totality of the criminality involved in accordance with the principles laid down by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1988) 194CLR 610, particularly at [45].

161There has been a recognition of those principles in the internal organisation of the sentences. For example, I have imposed the sentences that involve a slight partial accumulation of the much greater sentence for the sexual assault upon the detention. As I pointed out in my earlier remarks , they were offences committed at the same time. Taken in combination and just standing alone, they reflect a totality of criminality greater than their constituent parts. Of course, those offences are required to be partially accumulative upon the offences committed in Tumbarumba and in Wagga and Lucknow, other than counts 3, 5 and 6.

162The truth of the matter is ultimately when the prisoner is considered for release to parole, assuming that occurs at the expiry of the non-parole period, the balance of sentence that I have identified represents in the context of the sentencing exercise I am undertaking the appropriate period of time that the prisoner would require for parole supervision to have the opportunity, if it be presented to him by the Parole Authority, of undertaking the steps that would enable him to take his place in the community without fear of committing further offences, or presenting a danger to the community. He needs an extended period of supervision to adjust to community living (R v Moffit (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, (at 120-121) per Wood J).

163The facts of the matter are though in summary, that the prisoner on escape from Mannus, went upon a course of criminal conduct that was purely for the purposes of his own interests, without any regard to the interests of his victims. I have made the point that these offences were opportunistic, unplanned and unpremeditated. But it must also be said by, in effect, abducting the little girl and sexually assaulting her he added a completely new, and far more serious dimension, to the character of his offending, which must be reflected in the sentences imposed by this court.

164Mr Ryan, I have to now move to the sentencing of you. Would you kindly stand thanks and I will have to work my way through the counts. It will take a little bit of time, but it is the procedure of the court that prisoners stand when they are sentenced.

165In relation to count 1, and all these sentences have been calculated with a fifteen per cent discount, although in some instances without deleterious effect to you I have rounded some up and rounded some down by a matter of a few months.

166In relation to count 1 you are sentenced to three years imprisonment.

167Now Mr Crown, just one thing you need to assist me with. I said in my judgment that the relevant commencement date should be 9 February, but I also noted the custody record talked in terms of a non-parole period expiring on 17 February 2012. Is that right?

168QUEENAN: I think the reason for that your Honour is that it was adjusted to take into account that period upon which--

169HIS HONOUR: That he was at large?

170QUEENAN: That he was at large.

171HIS HONOUR: Yes of course, yes. Right so it does make sense.

172I am sorry Mr Ryan. In relation to count 1, you are sentenced to three years imprisonment. That will date from 17 February 2012 and expire on 16 February 2015. I decline to fix a non-parole period for that offence, because I am not required to by law, and secondly, it is subsumed into other sentences I imposed.

173In relation to count 2, you are sentenced to a term of twenty months imprisonment. That will date from 17 February 2012 and on my calculation expire on 16 October 2013. 

174In relation to count 7, that is the steal from the dwelling offence, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years six months. You are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years six months. That will date from 17 August 2013 and on my calculation will expire on 16 February 2016.

175In relation to count 8 you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of twenty months. That will date from 17 August 2013 and expire on 16 April 2015.

176In relation to count 9 you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty months and that will commence also from 17 August 2013 and on my calculation expire on 16 April 2015.

177In relation to count 3, because it has a standard non-parole period, I am required by law to fix a non-parole period. The non-parole period I fix for this matter of course is of no effect, because it is subsumed by other orders, but in relation to count 3 you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period for a period of three years three months. This will date from 17 February 2015 and on my calculation expire on 16 May 2018.

178I fix in respect to that sentence a balance of sentence of one year. That will expire on 16 May 2019.

179In respect of count 4, that is the detention, or abduction offence, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years nine months. That will date from 17 February 2015 and will expire, on my calculation, on 16 November 2021. I decline to fix a non-parole period for that matter. It is not required to by law, and it is covered by the sentence I will impose in relation to count 6.

180In relation to count 6 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period for seven years six months. That will date from 17 February 2016 and expire on 16 August 2023. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of five years three months which will expire on 16 November 2028.

181Now the total sentence I have imposed on my calculation is a sentence of sixteen years and nine months, with a non-parole period of eleven years six months.

182The special circumstances that I have been identified have been reflected in the adjustment of the non-parole period in relation to count 6.

183You can take a seat, thanks very much.

184Now Mr Crown, any matters--

185What about you Mr King?
 
186186KING: No your Honour, I haven't identified any matters.
 
187HIS HONOUR: You understand the effect of the sentence in terms of the structure of it and the totality of the sentence?

188KING: Yes your Honour.

189HIS HONOUR: Mr Ryan, it is a stressful time for you I know, but do you understand the effect of the sentence I have imposed?

190OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

191HIS HONOUR: It is an effective non-parole period, as I calculate it, of twelve years imprisonment, to date from the expiry of the non-parole period fixed by his Honour Judge Conlon, plus the time that you were at large, which has been adjusted in the Corrective Services' records.
 
192The balance of sentence I have calculated is four years nine months.
 
193Thank you very much Mr Crown for your assistance in this matter. Thank you Mr King. Thank you Mr Ryan, you can go with the officers. Mr King will speak to you in the cells I am sure about the sentences I have imposed.

		20 February 2014",2013-02-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760932,R v Bragg [2013] NSWDC 37,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: The sentence that I will announce at the end of these remarks is, I fully acknowledge, the sort of sentence which sometimes provokes outrage on the part of commentators such as talk-back radio hosts keen to whip up ill-informed sentiment by giving their listeners only part of the entire story and by failing to reveal some of the most important aspects which have led to a particular sentence being imposed. Indeed, if I were to review this matter and focus only on what the offender did and the sentence ultimately imposed, I, too, might be outraged. It is therefore to be remembered that the reasons I am going to do what I will ultimately do as regards the offender are designed not to do him any particular favour, but are designed to protect the community and its individual members. 

2Ultimately the purpose of sentencing offenders is to protect other people. Sometimes, indeed usually, the way in which judges seek to protect the community is by imposing harsh sentences which will act as both a personal deterrent to the individual offender and a general deterrent to others who might be tempted to act in the same way. But that is not to say that harsh sentences are the only way in which the community can be protected. Sometimes, and this is such a case, a sentence which promotes the rehabilitation of an individual offender best achieves the protection of the community.

3In this case I have chosen a sentence which at first blush appears lenient, but again I say, this is not because I want to do a favour for Mr Bragg; it is so that I do what I can to ensure that he does not harm anyone else in the future in the way in which he has harmed people in the past.

4I also recognise that rehabilitation can not only be achieved in the community. Often enough I hear submissions which suggest that there is no such thing as rehabilitation whilst in custody. That, of course, is a blanket statement which must be rejected. Rehabilitation can be achieved whilst in custody.

5It must be recognised that all sentences, apart from life sentences, must end eventually, and all offenders not serving life imprisonment will be released into the community at some stage. Given that Mr Bragg will be free sooner or later, it is in the community's interest that, when he is freed, all that can be done to ensure that he does not cause future harm has been done.

6The offender's crimes were very serious indeed. He is to be sentenced for two offences of aggravated break enter and commit a serious indictable offence, in both cases, indecent assault, knowing that there were people inside. One only needs to look at the maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of five years to realise how serious such crimes are. Indeed, I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods in formulating the appropriate sentences in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period for either offence are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

7On two occasions the offender did what I have earlier described as ""every parent's nightmare"". On two occasions he broke into a home and went into a bedroom where two young boys were sleeping, and he molested one of them. He molested the same boy on two separate occasions, which is a seriously aggravating feature of his behaviour, because it seriously added to the harm that that poor young boy felt. And if that was not bad enough, at the time he committed these offences he was on a bond, having been convicted earlier that year of an offence of being a convicted child sex offender, and loitering in or near a public place at which children were present. And on top of everything I have so far said, after these offences he was dealt with by a magistrate for another offence of that kind. On that occasion he was dealt with by the magistrate under section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act.

8So, to summarise, Mr Bragg is a person who has committed two very serious offences, and who has a history of misconduct which demonstrates that he is a person who is potentially going to commit more serious offences of that kind. Ordinarily, that would necessarily mean that the offender will be spending a significant time in custody. It is a fundamental rule of sentencing that the sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender's conduct.

9After the offender's arrest, he spent six months and fifteen days in custody. Anyone who looks at the ultimate sentence I am going to impose upon Mr Bragg must remember that he did spend more than half a year in gaol. Nor was his time in gaol a pleasant experience. Mr Bragg suffers from a significant intellectual disability. He functions at a lower level than 99.9 per cent of the population. That made him, amongst other matters, a very vulnerable person whilst in custody. Gaols are terrible places. They are populated by violent, aggressive, and, on occasions, sexually frustrated inmates who apparently think nothing of sexually assaulting vulnerable people. That happened to Mr Bragg. His cell mate raped him on two occasions.

10Ordinarily he would be entitled to think that he would himself receive counselling for having been the victim of a sexual assault. That has been difficult because of the offender's crimes.

11After that period in gaol he was released on bail. He does not want to go back, for obvious reasons, and has said on occasions that he would rather kill himself than return to gaol. I emphasise that that is not a reason that I have decided to do what I will ultimately do. Many times offenders make similar comments, and even where I acknowledge that there is a risk of that threat being carried out, I have sent offenders back to gaol because that is required by the law. I mention it only to demonstrate that in some way the offender has already been punished for his misconduct. He spent that period in custody and suffered significantly while he was there. It may be that he has not been punished enough, but to say that he has not been punished at all would not be correct.

12Why, then, am I not going to send Mr Bragg back to gaol, at least, not now? Why, then, am I going to put him on a suspended sentence? The reason for that is, as has been suggested by what I have said so far, to protect the community and individual members by promoting Mr Bragg's rehabilitation.

13There has been a significant change in Mr Bragg since he committed these offences. Indeed, in some ironic way, part of that is because he has now been the victim of sexual assault, which has enabled him to develop to a greater level some empathy with the victim of his offending. He now, having been the victim of a sexual assault himself, can understand why it would be that the victim would describe the impact of the offender's crimes upon him in the terms that he did. I have re-read the victim impact statement today, and I can quite understand everything that is contained in that statement.

14When the matter was first before me last November, Mr Booth tendered quite a lot of evidence to demonstrate the significant change that had come about in Mr Bragg of recent times. He was living in a different part of New South Wales. He was being supported by experts who were assisting him to change his behaviour and he was cooperating well with them.

15I was persuaded to release Mr Bragg under section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I made it clear then that did not necessarily mean that Mr Bragg would not go back to gaol. I needed to know how Mr Bragg would perform in order that I could assess what form of sentence to impose upon Mr Bragg, and the length of any sentence imposed.

16He has done well since that time. A report from the Community Justice Program tendered to me today refers to the progress that Mr Bragg has made. The report says,

""Mr Bragg has shown consistent motivation to adhere to his bond conditions in the past three months. Mr Bragg is aware and makes conscious effort not to associate or be in proximity to children in the community. With additional support from the CRC it is anticipated that Mr Bragg will continue to lead a more structured and meaningful life, thus reducing recidivism and challenging behaviours in the community."" 

The report notes that Mr Bragg will continue to receive support, including one to one supervision from Mr Bragg's key worker, Mr Lucas Smith.

17As mentioned before, rehabilitation can still be achieved in custody, but I am satisfied that that rehabilitation would be nowhere near as effective as the rehabilitation which is available to Mr Bragg should he remain free in the community. I want to make sure, as much as I can, that Mr Bragg does not offend in the future. Having reviewed all the evidence in this matter, I am satisfied that the best way of achieving that is not to send Mr Bragg back to gaol.

18It may be that what I have said so far could be misinterpreted. I do not want to suggest that I have decided that the first step I have taken in the decision making process is to decide to impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment on Mr Bragg. That is not the way I have reasoned at all. I firstly decided that a custodial sentence was required. I next considered how long that term of imprisonment should be. Particularly in view of the time that Mr Bragg has already served in custody, and the rehabilitation that he has achieved to date, I am satisfied that the period of imprisonment should be two years, and only then have I decided how that sentence of imprisonment should be served.

19I acknowledge, of course, that there are two offences here, and it is unusual to the point of being remarkable that there be no accumulation of sentence. What I want to say is that this is a circumstance I have not overlooked. It is a deliberate decision of mine to impose concurrent sentences. I am fortified by the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal that questions of accumulation or concurrency are within the discretion of the sentencing judge. For the reasons that I have given, I have exercised my discretion to impose concurrent sentences, despite acknowledging the unusual nature of that order.

20I should note also that the offender pleaded guilty. The pleas did not come at the earliest opportunity, it is acknowledged, but upon first arraignment in this court. Thus there was no need for any trial date to be set. The two year period I have already said I will impose upon the offender includes a reduction for the utilitarian value of those pleas.

21There are people in the community, and in particular the victim of these offences and his family, who are entitled to question whether justice has been done in this case. I suspect that, no matter how much explanation is offered to them, they will consider that justice has not been done. I am not sure that, if I were the victim of a crime like this, or one of my family members was, that I would not feel the same way. But sentencing is not a personal exercise done by victims of crime or their family, and, difficult though it may be to accept, the harm occasioned to the victim of offending is but one aspect of the factors that I take into account in deciding the appropriate sentence. 

22We do not have sentencing by victims of crime; we have sentencing by judges, who take into account the interests of the victims of crime, as well as the interests of potential future victims of crime. I do not want anyone else in the future to be harmed in the same way that the complainant in this case was. That is why I have done what I am about to do.

23In each case the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two years. I suspend the execution of that sentence on condition that he enters into a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of that sentence. The conditions of that bond are as follows. 

The offender is to be of good behaviour and to appear before this court if required to do so.

He is to live at XXXXXXXX. Should he move from that address, he is to notify the registrar of this court in writing within two days.

He is to attend all appointments made for him by Rachel Green, whether that be an appointment with a doctor, another form of medical practitioner, a counsellor, or whatever kind.

He is to attend all appointments made by Aging Disability and Home Care, and comply with the written support plan and programs proposed by that organisation, including, but not limited to, the Drop In Support Package operated by the Community Restorative Centre.

He is to comply strictly with instructions and proposed programs of the Community Justice Program.

He is to comply strictly with any prohibition order to which he is subject, and he is to comply with the directions of the Probation and Parole Service, including directions as to rehabilitation, counselling, treatment and the like, and he is to take all medication prescribed for him by a medical practitioner in accordance with the directions of that medical practitioner.

He is to comply with the requirements and directions of any treating psychologist.

		12 April 2013",2013-02-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760934,R v MM [2013] NSWDC 49,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: In March 2011 a terrible tragedy overtook Ms M. On that day her mother committed suicide. She lingered on for four days until life support was discontinued. It was this incredibly distressing event which appears to have been the catalyst for Ms M revealing to the authorities what her father had been doing to her previously. She contacted one of the police officers who had been involved in attending her home upon the discovery of her mother's suicide and Ms M told her what had been happening to her.

2After her mother's suicide Ms M moved out of the home and began to live with an old family friend and her family. She chose not to have any contact with the offender. The offender did not take this well. He used Facebook to communicate with the complainant and indeed threatened to discontinue paying her private school fees if she did not communicate with him. Facebook was later used by Ms M at the suggestion of police to engage the offender in an online conversation in which the offender made generalised admissions to having done what Ms M had complained about.

3The offender now faces charges for two offences under s 61.M(1) of the Crimes Act. They are offences of aggravated indecent assault. They were committed on the complainant when she was either 12, 13 or 14 years of age. They are described at times as representative charges. It is important to understand the approach that I will take to these charges which I believe to be consistent with authority. I will sentence the offender for the misconduct covered by the two specific offences, but he does not receive any benefit through being able to say that they were isolated occasions of criminality.

4In general terms the complainant described the offender's conduct this way. She said that every time was the same and so what I am about to describe covers the two counts. She said, and I will quote a fairly lengthy passage from the statement of facts - 

""He would come into my bedroom really late at night so mum couldn't hear. I was asleep and I would either wake up with him opening my bedroom door or getting into my bed. Every single time I would be lying on my stomach and he would come into my bed and lay next to me. I could feel his naked body pressing against my back and bottom. I would always move trying to let him know I was awake but he would always keep going.



He would then pull down my pyjama pants. Sometimes he would remove my underpants and other times he would either put his hand down the front of my pants or down the back and would touch my vagina. He would rub the top part of my vagina. Whilst he was rubbing my vagina he would put his penis between the top part of my legs and his body would be moving back and forth. His penis was hard and on one occasion he ejaculated on me whilst doing this.



He would rub my vagina for some time and then he would put his hand up my pyjama top and rub my nipples. This lasted for about half an hour. He would never say anything to me and I would never say anything to him. It always happened in my bedroom and it was the same all the time. I was so scared of dad I was always worried about him coming into my room.""



5The gravity of such conduct is immediately obvious. It goes without saying that this was a breach of trust as serious as it can be. The offender was the complainant's natural father and she was entitled to look to him to protect her, not to abuse her. Instead of protecting her he appears to have used her to satisfy his sexual desires, apparently caring little, if anything, for her welfare.

6The circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown is the circumstance that the complainant was under the authority of the offender at the time of the offending. For reasons Mr Rosser explained it would be wrong for me to also regard the fact that the complainant was under the age of sixteen as a further aggravating feature. It is impossible to say, because of the time period covered by the counts on the indictment, which statutory regime operated but for a period the circumstance that the complainant was under sixteen would have exposed the offender to a higher penalty. For that reason I will not regard the age of the complainant as an aggravating feature, although I do have to say that given the circumstances of this case the issue of age would have added little to the underlying gravity of the offender's criminal conduct in any case.

7Despite the clear admissions that the offender made in the Facebook communication the pleas of guilty could not be described as early. The offender was committed for trial to this court and his pleas of guilty were only entered on the first day of that trial. At all times the offender faced a charge equivalent to count 1 on the indictment. But count 2, as originally preferred, alleged a more serious act, sexual intercourse. The offender pleaded guilty to count 2 once an offence in its present form was substituted.

8That raises the possibility of different discounts for the utilitarian value of the offender's pleas. The plea to count 1 was certainly not entered at the earliest opportunity but on one view that could not be said of count 2. However Mr Rosser accepts that in the circumstances of this particular case, and in the knowledge of what led up to the pleas of guilty being entered, there is no need for the offender to get a different utilitarian discount for the offence in count 2 when compared to the offence in count 1.

9He suggests that the value of the plea of guilty is primarily to be seen in other aspects of the sentencing process. By pleading guilty the offender has both demonstrated remorse and demonstrated his concern for the welfare of his daughter. He has avoided the need for her to re-live these distressing events by giving evidence against him and has validated her complaints, accepting that what she says was entirely true.

10The offender has no other criminal history. He is now 53 years of age and the offences occurred in circumstances which led Mr Rosser to describe them as situational. There is no suggestion that the offender represents a risk to anyone else and indeed there is no suggestion that he represents a risk to his daughter, the complainant in this case. Although the two offences did occur as part of a wider course of conduct, extending over some considerable period it is to be noted that the offender voluntarily ceased his conduct some time prior to his wife's suicide.

11This is not a case where the offender stopped doing what he was doing only because he was detected by police, or because complaint had been made to them by his daughter. The period of offending was a closed one and it came to an end because the offender, for whatever reason, stopped abusing his daughter in the terrible way he had been. That tends to suggest that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are good.

12The offender has had long-term responsible employment and two references attesting to his otherwise good character were tendered before me today. This is not a case where it was the offender's good character which enabled him to commit these offences. It was his relationship with the complainant which allowed him to do what he was doing to her.

13Of course the offender must go to gaol. General deterrence is of crucial importance in a case like this. The harm that offences of this nature cause is significant indeed. One does not need a victim impact statement in order to make that finding. To have been abused by your natural father in circumstances such as described in this case could only have ever had a significant effect on the complainant.

14As a result of his misconduct the offender's children want nothing to do with him. That, I have to say, is not surprising. Not only his daughter, the complainant in this case, but his two sons have ceased contact with him. 

15The offence is regarded as serious, not only by the courts but also by the legislature. The maximum penalty of seven years and the standard non-parole period of five years demonstrate that. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

16It is necessary that there be a level of accumulation. I certainly will not be double counting by not regarding these offences as isolated and by accumulating partially because there are two offences. I have been careful to avoid that in choosing the ultimate overall sentence which I will impose upon the offender. There are special circumstances in this case. It is the offender's first time in custody and the Crown did not speak in opposition to a finding of that kind.

17I was assisted by a table from the Public Defender's website which carries the usual disclaimer ""This table is intended to be used as a guide only. Individual cases should be read if they are to be relied upon"". Consistent with that warning Mr Rosser did provide me with a number of printouts of cases but as I said to him during the course of his submissions, having read those cases I was reminded of the repeated statements by the Court of Criminal Appeal to the effect that no two cases are alike. There were many differences between the present case and the cases handed to me by Mr Rosser, both as regards objective gravity, subjective circumstances and indeed the nature of the charges faced by the offender.

18The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. For count 1 on the indictment I set a non-parole period of two years to date from today, 15 February 2013, and there will be a head sentence of four years. On count 2 on the indictment I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 15 August 2013 and a head sentence of four years. The overall sentence is thus one of two and a half years with a head sentence of four and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 14 August 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		26 April 2013",2013-02-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760935,R v Murphy [2013] NSWDC 33,"sentence

1Late last year I sentenced two men, Joshua Upton and Steven Green for three offences of robbery in company. They were committed with another man David Murphy, whom I must now sentence. 

2The reason that Mr Murphy was not sentenced at the same time as his cooffenders is that a psychological report tendered today was not available on the last occasion. Mr Booth, who appears for Mr Murphy today, relies on the principle of parity and says that his client would have a justifiable sense of grievance if he received a longer sentence than those imposed upon his cooffenders.

3Whilst the Crown cannot rely on the principle of parity, the Crown also submits that the sentence imposed upon Mr Green and Mr Upton was appropriate to be imposed upon Mr Murphy.

4I spent some time in sentencing the cooffenders addressing the issue of drunken violence, particularly drunken violence in Newcastle. 

5Offences such as those committed by Mr Murphy and his cooffenders are distressingly commonplace in this area. Often they are committed by those who really have no purpose in their lives, people who are unemployed and whose main activity seems to be obtaining money to take drugs and then taking drugs. Mr Murphy is not in that category. He was employed in a good occupation at the time he committed these offences. Unfortunately he was on holidays and during that period he began to drink to excess and to use drugs. He was heavily intoxicated, he says, at the time of these offences.

6What occurred on 7 April I described in my earlier remarks on sentence. I can therefore be relatively brief. Three young people were walking along Hunter Street one evening, they were going to the pub when they came across three other people, Mr Murphy and his two co-offenders. It seems to have been an opportunistic decision by the three offenders that they would rob the three other people that they met. One of them, one of the offenders demanded money and when the victim said no, Mr Upton just punched him in the face. The innocent young people, not surprisingly, decided then to cooperate with the offenders.

7One of the victims took his wallet out and threw it on the ground. Mr Upton was not satisfied and said ""What about your phone?"" and when the victim said he did not have one Mr Upton hit him again. This led to that particular victim taking his iPhone, a new one, out of his pocket and throwing it on the ground while trying to get away.

8Mr Green and Mr Murphy were not just standing back watching, they approached the other two people and Mr Murphy yelled  ""Give us your phone, give us your money"" and began waving his fists around, so was Mr Green.

9One of the other victims handed over a wallet to Mr Murphy and the other one handed over a purse to him as well and they ran off.

10Fortunately there was a patrolling police car nearby. The victims waved it down, described what had happened and police eventually found and arrested the three offenders. 

11The victim who had been punched ended up with a bleeding nose, swollen and sore right side of his head and could only open his jaw halfway before pain stopped him doing so. He also had a small chip to his lower front tooth.

12Given that description of the offences it is obvious why I described them as serious. People should be entitled to walk along Hunter Street Newcastle at 10.20 in the evening without being set upon by those such as Mr Murphy who are intoxicated, affected by drugs and prepared to inflict violence simply so that they could get some money.

13Mr Murphy was born in Perth. His parents separated before he was even born and he has no contact with his father. His mother remarried and his relationship with his stepfather was very poor. Whilst his mother tried to provide for him and his half sister, she was a drug user. She exposed Mr Murphy to drugs at a very young age and thus desensitised him to their use.

14Because, in particular, of the way in which he was treated by his stepfather, Mr Murphy began to ventilate his frustrations and distress by becoming aggressive with other children. He has had problems with, what Mr Booth described, his anger for many years since. There is another area of abuse suffered by Mr Murphy that I am not going to repeat in public, which is referred to in the psychological report tendered on his behalf.

15As he was getting older he had problems at school being repeatedly expelled for fighting. His education has settled down now and he is just one month short of qualifying as a boilermaker. He intends to complete this when he returns to the community after being released from custody. If he can do so then of course his prospects for rehabilitation are enhanced. If he can keep himself busy through work it is much less likely that he will be abusing drugs and alcohol and committing offences such as those I have just described.

16As is obvious, he has been using drugs for a number of years. And as is not surprising these have caused problems in his relationships, in particular the relationship he has with the mother of his child, a boy aged seven. Despite the instability of the relationship, caused almost exclusively I gather by problems that Mr Murphy has with his anger and drug use, he maintains an amicable friendship with his former partner, although he intends to live alone when he is released from custody.

17Not all upbringings are the same and not all of us have the same opportunity to live a life which does not involve offending. Some people have parents who provide strong boundaries. Others, such as Mr Murphy, do not have that luxury. The appropriateness of his behaviour was not questioned to the same level that other children experienced as he was growing up. And this is one of a number of matters which has led to Mr Murphy offending relatively often in the past.

18He has matters on his criminal history but there is only one other similar matter which he committed as a child. He was sentenced for that matter in the Wagga Children's Court. He has served custodial sentences before but for not as long as the sentence I must impose upon him.

19Mr Murphy articulates very precisely what needs to happen. He says that in the past he was going nowhere and he needs to make some changes. He is now 28 years of age and cannot rely on any suggestion of immaturity. He is a grown man and should be able to act as a grown man. That is he should be able to take responsibility for his own actions. 

20In that regard he has expressed his remorse both to psychologists and in giving evidence today. He says that he feels horrible about what happened and is sorry as well. Consistent with his remorse he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea I will discount the sentence I would impose by twenty-five percent.

21I note that at the time of his offending he was on two bonds, one under s 10 and one under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A decision has been made that no action will be taken on the breach of the s 10 bond, but the consequences of him breaching the s 9 bond by the commission of these offences is yet to be determined. That is unfortunate. The breach of bond should have been referred to the magistrate before I sentence Mr Murphy. After I sentence him the matter will go before a magistrate who is left in an uncomfortable position. He or she can either impose token punishment upon Mr Murphy, which is not appropriate given his need to be punished for having breached the bond, or the magistrate can impose a sentence of some severity which must necessarily cut into the non parole period that I will shortly announce. That will in turn mean that there is less time for Mr Murphy to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, which in turn again makes it less likely that he will achieve the full measure of rehabilitation. 

22For these reasons it is important that people in Mr Murphy's position who have breached bonds have those breaches dealt with before they appear for sentence in this court. I trust that in future this situation will not arise. It is incumbent upon the Crown to ensure that it does not.

23Another problem is that there is a risk that Mr Murphy will be double punished for having breached the bonds by me regarding it as an aggravating feature of his offending and then by a magistrate dealing with the breach of bond without noting that he has already been punished by me for breaching it. It is therefore incumbent upon the Crown again, assisted by Mr Murphy's lawyers, to ensure that when the matter goes before the magistrate, the magistrate is made fully aware that I have regarded the breach of bonds as an aggravating feature of this offence.

24For each of the matters I will impose concurrent sentences. As I noted when sentencing the others that is unusual, but I do so as a measure of leniency towards Mr Murphy.

25For each matter he is sentenced to imprisonment. I impose a non parole period of eighteen months with a head sentence of three years to date from 7 April 2012. His non parole period will expire on 6 October 2013 on which day he is to be released to parole.

1This is an Application on behalf of S for a Suppression Order or, in the alternative, a Non-publication Order, so as not to identify him as a Defendant in proceedings listed both before Young Local and Children's Courts on 19 February 2013. 

2The Applicant was born in 1994. It is not necessary to nominate his date of birth with any greater precision. On 16 January 2013, he was charged with the following offences in the Children's Court jurisdiction -

4As I mentioned earlier, all these charges before the Children's Court and Local Court are listed for the first time on 19 February 2013. Accordingly, I have not seen Facts Sheets at the time of this Judgment. For present purposes, it is not really necessary that I do so. It is fair to assume, however, from the recitation of the charges themselves that the Applicant is alleged to have been a Retained Fire Fighter who made numerous false calls to 000 and then claimed and obtained payment for his services in attending the scene of the purported emergencies. 

5The crux of the Application is set out in correspondence from the Applicant's solicitors in the following terms - 

We wish to apply for a suppression order, or at the very least, a non-publication order in relation to this matter. In particular we are seeking that our client's name not be published on the court list to be displayed at the front of the courthouse on 19th February 2013. We submit that in doing so, our client's identity as a defendant in the children's court will be disclosed due to the following factors:

1.Young is a relatively small town;

2.[S]'s family is well known throughout the town;

3.NSW Police issued a media release and posted details of these offences on their Facebook page when [S] was initially charged. His identity was not revealed at that time as he was a child at the time of the commission of some of the alleged offences; and

4.Both local and national media have already broadcast details of this matter when our client was first charged but also did not disclose his identity as it was noted he was a child at the time of the commission of some of the alleged offences.

6The jurisdiction of the Local Court to entertain such an Application is provided for in section 3 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010. The Act sets out in section 6 that a Court must (not may) take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice. The granting of any such order is discretionary but by reference to the statutory guidelines.

7Section 8 sets out the grounds for making an order. It is worthwhile setting out that provision -

(1)A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds:


(a)The order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice;
(b)The order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security;
(c)The order is necessary to protect the safety of any person;
(d)The order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency);
(e)It is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.

8The Applicant is clearly a ""party"" to proceedings and is entitled to appear and be heard by the Court on an Application, as is the Police Prosecutor who appears for the Informant as well as any news media organisation: section 9(1)-(2).

9The upshot of the Applicant's case is that to identify him as a Defendant in the Local Court is to identify him as a Defendant in the Children's Court. The principals relating to the identifying of juveniles before a Court are well known. Procedurally, there is no Children's Court List placed on display outside a Court. Charges are heard in a closed Court from which the general public are excluded. News media representatives are often present to report the fact of an incident but not the identity of the alleged young offender. Generally, see also Division 3A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

10It is not unusual for an alleged offender to find himself (or herself) before a Local Court and a Children's Court on the same day whether for similar or different offences. It is commonplace and proper procedure for the Children's Court matters, first, not to appear on any publicly displayed list and, secondly, to be dealt with in a closed court. The Local Court charges are dealt with in an open court. In that way, the identity of an alleged young offender before the Children's Court is protected. It might seem somewhat artificial but it works. As an alleged adult offender, the Applicant is entitled to no such protection.

11The meaning of ""necessary"" as set out in section 8 was considered by the Court of Appeal in Rinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403 in the joint judgment of Bathurst CJ and McColl JA where their Honours said that Section 6 reinforces the legislative intention that an order should only be made in exceptional circumstances, a provision which prevailed at common law: John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344.

12The clearest statement, and that which appears to underlie the form of section 8, appears in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal (NSW) (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 (at 476 - 477) per McHugh JA (Glass JA agreeing): 

""The fundamental rule of the common law is that the administration of justice must take place in open court. A court can only depart from this rule where its observance would frustrate the administration of justice or some other public interest for whose protection Parliament has modified the open justice rule. The principle of open justice also requires that nothing should be done to discourage the making of fair and accurate reports of what occurs in the courtroom. Accordingly, an order of a court prohibiting the publication of evidence is only valid if it is really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in proceedings before it. Moreover, an order prohibiting publication of evidence must be clear in its terms and do no more than is necessary to achieve the due administration of justice . The making of the order must also be reasonably necessary; and there must be some material before the court upon which it can reasonably reach the conclusion that it is necessary to make an order prohibiting publication. Mere belief that the order is necessary is insufficient."" (Emphasis added) 

13The necessity requirement may also be stated by quoting Mr Justice Isaacs statement in R v Macfarlane; Ex parte O'Flanagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39; (1923) 32 CLR 518 (at 549) (approved by the plurality (Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) in Hogan v Hinch (at [87]): 

""The final and paramount consideration in all cases is that emphasized in Scott v Scott namely, 'to do justice' (Viscount Haldane LC). All other considerations are means to that end. They are ancillary principles and rules. Some of them are so deeply embedded in our law as to be elementary and axiomatic, others closely approach that position. Of the latter class is publicity, which can only be disregarded where necessity compels departure, for otherwise justice would be denied to those whom Earl Loreburn termed 'the parties entitled to justice.' "" 

14Significantly, an order is not ""necessary"" if it appears to the court ""to be convenient, reasonable or sensible, or to serve some notion of the public interest, still less that, as the result of some 'balancing exercise', the order appears to have one or more of those characteristics"": Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (2010) 240 CLR 651 at [31].

15Their Honours in Rinehart v Welker (supra) cited with approval the speech of Viscount Haldane VC in Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 437-438 in dealing with the aspect of ""open justice"" and applying that to the operation of section 6, as follows:-

""As the paramount object must always be to do justice, the general rule as to publicity, after all only the means to an end, must accordingly yield. But the burden lies on those seeking to displace its application in the particular case to make out that the ordinary rule must as of necessity be superseded by this paramount consideration. The question is by no means one which, consistently with the spirit of our jurisprudence, can be dealt with by the judge as resting in his mere discretion as to what is expedient. The latter must treat it as one of principle, and as turning, not on convenience, but on necessity. 
He who maintains that by no other means than by such a hearing can justice be done may apply for an unusual procedure . But he must make out his case strictly, and bring it up to the standard which the underlying principle requires. He may be able to shew that the evidence can be effectively brought before the Court in no other fashion. He may even be able to establish that subsequent publication must be prohibited for a time or altogether. But this further conclusion he will find more difficult in a matrimonial case than in the case of the secret process, where the objection to publication is not confined to the mere difficulty of giving testimony in open Court. In either case he must satisfy the Court that by nothing short of the exclusion of the public can justice be done. The mere consideration that the evidence is of an unsavoury character is not enough, any more than it would be in a criminal Court, and still less is it enough that the parties agree in being reluctant to have their case tried with open doors. "" (Emphasis added) 

16I fully appreciate that the identification of the Applicant in the Local Court charges will doubtless be the subject of media publicity. This will bring attendant embarrassment not only to the Applicant but to his family. However, I fail to see how this would serve to identify him in the Children's Court matters if the prescribed safeguards are applied as they will be. There is little a Court can do about rumour-mongering in ""a relatively small town.""

17In my view, the Applicant has failed factually to demonstrate to any extent, let alone exceptional, that his circumstances fall within the meaning of section 8(1) of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Act 2010, such as to warrant the making of any order as a matter of law. The Application is dismissed.

Introduction

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.

2ROTHMAN J: I agree with Adamson J.

3ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following three grounds:

(1)The Sentencing Judge failed to apply the principle of totality in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610;

(2)The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the disparity between his sentence and that of a co-offender, Joseph Harmer; and

(3)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

4The applicant was arrested and charged in respect of a number of offences committed in the course of a spree in September 2010. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence in the District Court. 

5The sentences imposed by the Sentencing Judge are summarised below:

Aggregate sentence

5 years, 6 months, commencing on 22 October 2010, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 9 months. Ratio of non-parole period to total sentence is 68%.

6The applicant was almost 19 years old at the time the offences were committed. They were committed at locations that had closed for business at the time of the break-in. No persons were present. Cash and property were stolen. The motive for the offences was to obtain money, or goods that could readily be sold, to buy drugs to feed his addiction.

7In the Remarks on Sentence (ROS) the Sentencing Judge referred to the guideline sentencing judgment of Attorney-General's Application (No. 1) R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327 (Ponfield) which applies to the offence of break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. In Ponfield, this Court said, at [42], that it was not appropriate to express the guideline in quantitative terms, but said, at [48], that greater sentences ought be imposed when one or more of eleven factors was present. The Sentencing Judge identified two such factors as being relevant: the multiplicity of offences committed and the amounts of money taken.

8The money and property stolen from the various premises included:

(1)Cash of no less that $4,498, three antique watches and electronic and computer equipment from the Albury Club;

(2)Cash of about $750 from the Classic Motor Inn;

(3)Computers and $2,000 from the Albury Townhouse; and

(4)Alcohol, a 50-inch television and $4,980.75 from the Hovell Tree Hotel.

9Although the applicant had a record for similar offences, the Sentencing Judge did not place weight on this, except to the extent that it disentitled the applicant to the leniency afforded to first offenders, because the offences had been committed when the applicant was a juvenile.

10The Sentencing Judge noted that although a degree of planning was involved, it was of a rudimentary and spontaneous kind. For example, the applicant wore socks on his hands in one of the offences to avoid leaving fingerprints. His Honour considered the offences for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed to fall below the mid-range of objective seriousness. Nonetheless his Honour considered that:

""...the series of offences committed by the offender were so serious that a total sentence of at least eight years imprisonment would have been applied if these matters had gone to trial.""

11The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing, as did his partner, Stephanie Pryor. He also relied on a report of Dr Rowe, neuropsychologist, who noted that he displayed symptoms consistent with Attention Deficit Disorder, Paranoid Schizophrenia and prior Substance Abuse Disorder.

12The applicant's subjective circumstances included that he had a disrupted upbringing that resulted in his becoming homeless at the age of 12. He began drinking alcohol and taking cannabis at that time.

13The Sentencing Judge found special circumstances on the basis that the applicant requires treatment for mental illness caused by his drug use.

14The Sentencing Judge applied a discount of 30% for the plea of guilty and the offer of assistance.

15As can be seen from the table above, the Sentencing Judge imposed an aggregate sentence in respect of the four offences of aggravated break enter and steal, as was permitted by s 53A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

16The Sentencing Judge did not, however, comply with the obligation imposed by s 54(4A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to indicate, for each of the four offences of aggravated break enter and steal, the length of the non-parole period he would have set had his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for each of the offences. 

17The applicant submitted that this omission meant that it was more difficult to understand the Sentencing Judge's process of reasoning and, more specifically, how the sentence imposed on the applicant compared with that imposed on Mr Harmer for the offence that was committed at the Hovell Tree Motel (which is considered further below). However, the applicant did not suggest that it had the effect of impermissibly inflating the sentence.

18 The Court's power under s 44(2C) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 to impose an aggregate sentence without specifying the non-parole period that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed is not qualified by s54B(4A) since no standard non-parole period has been specified for the offence.

The grounds of appeal: the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, there is an justifiable sense of grievance and the Sentencing Judge failed to apply the principle of totality

The sentence imposed on Mr Harmer

19Many of the applicant's submissions rely on a comparison between his sentence and that imposed on Mr Harmer, who was also sentenced for a number of similar offences, one of which was committed in company with the applicant at the Hovell Tree Motel on 20 September 2010.

20The Sentencing Judge sentenced the applicant on 31 August 2011. Charteris DCJ sentenced Mr Harmer almost three months later, on 24 November 2011. Charteris DCJ said, of the sentence imposed on the applicant:

""The prosecution has tendered documents in relation to a co-offender by the name of Vanderventer. Mr Vanderventer pleaded guilty in due course to a number of break and enter offences, some five in total. A number of them did not involve this offender. Indeed, as I read the charges only one of them was common to this offender. Mr Vanderventer received, for his five aggravateted break and enter with intent in company offences, an effective sentence of five years and six months with a minimum period of three years and nine months. It is unclear whether the sentencing judge imposed just one aggregate sentence or dealt with each of the matters individually. I take that matter into account. However, Mr Vanderventer was born in September 1991 and was younger than this offender. I am told that Mr Vanderventer's sentence is subject to a current appeal.""

21I infer that Charteris DCJ was informed from the bar table of the matters set out in his ROS above but was not provided with the Sentencing Judge's ROS.

22I propose to set out in some detail the matters that were taken into account by Charteris DCJ in sentencing Mr Harmer to demonstrate the extent to which the sentence imposed reflects the weighing up of objective factors germane to the offence, and subjective factors that are germane to the offender.

23The offences committed and the sentence imposed on Mr Harmer is summarised in the table below:

24Charteris DCJ was also asked to take into account the following Form 1 offences when sentencing Mr Harmer for the first offence set out above:

(1)Aggravated break enter and steal at Budget Car Rentals in about 2002, when the offender was 15;

(2)Four additional occasions of break enter and steal in the period 20 March 2007 to 13 April 2007, including at the premises of the Red Cross in Albury, where some electronic equipment was stolen, Hibernian Insurance, Snap Printing where $100 was stolen and Canteen Cuisine, where liquor was stolen; and

(3)Break enter and steal at Sam's Warehouse in September 2009.

25The total aggregate sentence imposed was five years with a two-year non-parole period, to take account of special circumstances. But for future co-operation, which gave rise to a further reduction of 3 months, the total sentence would have been 5 years, 3 months with a 2 year, 3 month non-parole period.

26Charteris DCJ found that each of the offences, with the possible exception of the Form 1 offence committed in 2002, was committed when the applicant was addicted to heroin.

27Mr Harmer was born in December 1986. He came before the Children's Court where he was initially dealt with leniently. He continued to offend. As an adult he was convicted of shoplifting for which he received a fine in 2008. In 2009 he received four s 9 bonds for a period of 15 months involving stealing, disposing of stolen property or receiving it and making a statement that was false and misleading. He was, accordingly, on conditional liberty when he committed the offences for which he was sentenced by Charteris DCJ.

28Mr Harmer lived with his mother in respect of whom he receives a carer's pension by reason of her infirmity as a result of arthritis. He had a troubled childhood and suffered violence from the age of 9 until he was 16 at the hands of his stepfather. His mother was an alcoholic. As a child he would regularly have to go to hotels to try to persuade his mother to come home. At times he sought the assistance of the police. He sought refuge with his natural father whose partner was a prostitute. He experimented with drugs and from about 2005 until 2010 he was addicted to heroin. His addiction cost him in the order of $500 per day. Since he was incapable of earning that sum, he relied on criminal activity to fuel his habit.

29Mr Harmer commenced taking methadone on 9 February 2011. Charteris DCJ was satisfied that he had been on the treatment continuously since then up to the time of sentence on 24 November 2011.

30Mr Harmer was arrested in October 2010. He agreed to be interviewed and was forthcoming about his involvement in respect of the offences for which he was being sentenced. He co-operated with police and assisted to identify co-offenders who have since been charged. He was prepared to give evidence against another co-offender for the Planet Power offence. Charteris DCJ accepted that Mr Harmer had ""extensively co-operated with police"". His Honour applied the discounts for the pleas of guilty and assistance set out in the table above.

31Charteris DCJ said of Mr Harmer, who gave evidence at the sentence hearing:

""I think he genuinely wishes to turn his life around. For virtually all of this year, he has been free of illicit drugs. He has been taking methadone; he has been abiding by his very strict bail conditions. He wants to eventually rid himself of the need to take methadone, and he has expressed the view that he wants to obtain a job, get his life back on track so to speak and support his partner and young child.

...

He has been on his rehabilitation since February of this year... he stopped taking those illicit drugs and he has had favourable urine tests with no drug in his system since April 2011... He described himself as feeling ""the best I have ever felt"". I accept his evidence... He holds his partner in high regard and he wishes to turn his life around.""

32Mr Harmer's partner gave evidence. Charteris DCJ accepted that she was a very positive influence on the applicant. Their child was born in 2008. His Honour was satisfied that there were special circumstances.

Comparison between the applicant's sentence and Mr Harmer's sentence

33Mr Harmer's total sentence for the aggravated break enter and steal at the Hovell Tree Hotel, once the discount for plea and assistance is ignored for the purposes of comparison, was 4 years. If the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term is applied to that offence alone, the non-parole period for that offence would have been 19 months.

34Because an aggregate sentence was imposed on the applicant which included the aggravated break enter and steal at the Hovell Tree Hotel, it is not possible to make a straight comparison with Mr Harmer's sentence. If one ignores the effect of the discount of 30% for the applicant's plea and assistance given, the aggregate sentence was five years for all four aggravated break enter and steal offences. One cannot take the matter further by way of comparison since the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant does not provide a guide to how the sentence would have been constructed had the Sentencing Judge been required to impose individual sentences. 

35All that can be said is that there is no basis for inferring that the portion of the aggregate sentence that is notionally referable to the Hovell Tree Hotel offence imposed on the applicant was different from the individual total sentence imposed on Mr Harmer for the same offence.

36Although for reasons given above, the Sentencing Judge could have shed further light on the sentences for individual offences by recording the non-parole period he would have imposed for the Hovell Tree Hotel offence, the total term is a more relevant figure for the purposes of comparison, since special circumstances germane to the applicant have a more significant influence on the proportion to which the non-parole period bears to the whole than does the objective seriousness of the offence. 

37Even if one were to assume that the applicant and Mr Harmer were equally culpable with respect to the Hovel Tree Hotel offence, it by no means follows that they ought to have received the same sentence. 

38To feel a sense of grievance on the basis that they received different sentences, even if it could be inferred that they did, would be to disregard the process of sentencing and the manifold relevant factors that are germane to its exercise: in particular, matters which pertain to the individual offender and to his or her prospects of rehabilitation and how the sentencing judge considers they can best be advanced.

39As the plurality said in Markarian [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357, at [27]:
Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.

40There are, sadly, many similarities between the circumstances and patterns of offending between the applicant and Mr Harmer: their disruptive and unsupportive childhoods; the age at which they became addicted to drugs; the commission of crime to feed the addiction; and their respective need for assistance to overcome drug dependency. However, there are also many differences between them as the respective ROS indicate. In light of the constellation of factors that play a part in the sentencing discretion, any sense of grievance that the applicant harbours by reason of a perceived disparity between his own sentence and that of Mr Harmer, is, in my view, not justified by reference to any objective criteria.

Whether the sentence is otherwise manifestly excessive

41The applicant contended that his sentence was excessive in itself, even if this Court were not satisfied that there was an unjustified disparity between his sentence and that of Mr Harmer.

42This Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the Sentencing Judge merely because it would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the Sentencing Judge did so: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15].

43This Court is not entitled to intervene on the ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive merely because the sentence is different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 (Hili) at [59].

44The statistical information relied on by the applicant's written submissions is of little utility in the context of an aggregate sentence for five offences.

45One cannot adjudge whether a sentence falls within an appropriate range by reasoning from particular instances. Applicants will always be able to find cases where offenders appear to have been dealt with more leniently. So, too, will the Crown be able to find cases where offenders have apparently been dealt with more severely than the applicant for leave to appeal on sentence. This is not, however, the way in which this Court determines whether a sentence is manifestly excessive.

46The sentencing consistency to which the law aspires is, as the High Court said in Hili, at [18]:

""...consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence.""

47I am not persuaded that there was any error in the way in which the Sentencing Judge applied the principles of parity, consistency and totality. Nor do I consider that any basis has been established on which it could otherwise be concluded that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

48I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		19 February 2013",2013-02-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760946,"R v ZHU, Bo Shi [2013] NSWSC 127","REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The Offender, Bo Shi Zhu, pleaded guilty to three counts of insider trading contrary to the provisions of s 1043A(1)(d) and s 1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to which I will refer to in these remarks as (""the Act""). 

2The three offences in the indictment have been referred to in submissions as three ""rolled up"" counts in the sense that each involves more than one incident of procuring contrary to s 1043(A)(1)(d) of the Act. As the Crown observed, ""rolling up"" does not prevent assessment of the criminality of the Offender's conduct within each count. It is a question of the criminality disclosed and not the number of counts. The fact that the charges are rolled up is relevant to the issues of totality, and in particular concurrency and accumulation of sentences to which I shall later refer. 

3The Offender now stands for sentence in respect of the charges to which he has entered guilty pleas. 

4As to the offences, the counts on the indictment related to offences committed by the Offender during three separate periods of employment with three different employers. The offending occurred over a period of four and a half years. 

5The particulars of the counts are as follows: 

(a) Between 6 November 2006 and 23 November 2007, the Offender was employed as an Executive in the Corporate Finance Advisory Division of Caliburn Partnership Pty Ltd, which will be now be referred to as ""Caliburn"", a leading independent corporate advisory firm. The Caliburn count consists of three separate sets of transactions between the period 8 December 2006 and 30 March 2007.

(b) Between 21 January 2008 and 9 July 2010, the Offender was employed as an Associate in the Investment Banking Division of Credit Suisse Management (Australia) Pty Ltd which I will refer to as ""Credit Suisse"" in these remarks, a multinational financial services company. The Credit Suisse count consists of two separate transactions carried out on 14 August 2008 and on 13 February 2009. 

(c) In the period between 17 July 2010 and 29 September 2011, the Offender was employed as the Vice President, Investments of Hanlong Mining Investments Pty Ltd which will be referred to in these remarks as ""Hanlong Mining"", the Australian subsidiary of a Chinese conglomerate. The Hanlong Mining count consists of five separate sets of transactions in the period 6 and 15 July 2011. 

6The Caliburn and the Credit Suisse counts each carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 5 years and/or a fine of $220,000. 

7The Hanlong Mining count is subject to an increased maximum penalty of imprisonment of 10 years and/or a fine of $495,000 or three times the value of the benefits attributable to the commission of the offence (whichever is the greater). The increased maximum penalty was effective from 13 December 2010. 

8The offence of insider trade is a Commonwealth offence. Accordingly, the Offender must be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). It is a requirement of that Part that the Court must impose a sentence of a severity that is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case: s 16A(1) of the Act. 

9Section 16A(2) of the Act provides a non-exhaustive list of mandatory considerations to be taken into account (where known and relevant) in determining the appropriate sentence. 

10Section 17A of the Act provides that a Court should not pass a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a federal offender unless, having considered all other available sentences, the Court is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. 

11In sentencing an offender in respect of an insider trading offence under the Act, it is clear that general deterrence must be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence even though there is no explicit reference to it in s 16A(2). 

12General deterrence is a particularly important consideration in relation to ""white collar"" offences which are difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute successfully. I refer to the decision in R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330.

13In the determination of the appropriate sentence, the Court must have regard to the nature and the severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to, the offender under that sentence: s 16A(3) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

14In the circumstances of the present case, additional custody sentencing alternatives are those set out in Part 2 Division 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In general terms they include home detention where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 18 months or an intensive correction order where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 2 years. 

15It has been submitted on behalf of the Crown in the present case, that neither of these alternatives would represent an appropriate sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offending conduct and the need for general deterrence. 

16The Court is also empowered as earlier indicated, where it passes a sentence or makes an order under s 20AB(1) in respect of a person convicted of an offence against the law of the Commonwealth for the imposition of a fine or other pecuniary penalty amongst other orders.

17Detailed submissions were provided by Mr Stoke, Senior Counsel on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Thangaraj, Senior Counsel on behalf of the Offender. I record my appreciation to the detailed and valuable nature of those submissions. 

18As to the relevant principles, insider trading is a serious offence. I refer to R v McKay (2007) 61 ACSR 470 and the observations of Whealy J at [60]. It has been noted that it is a serious offence because it can undermine the integrity of the stock market. I refer to the decision of R v Doff (2005) 23 ACLR 317; [2005] NSWSC 50 at [40]. In addition, it has been observed that such an offence undermines confidence in the commercial world generally. The principles of confidentiality and trust are fundamental to the operation of many commercial transactions. I refer to the decision in Hartman v R (2011) 87 ACSR 52; [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [25]. 

19An insider trading offender uses information to gain an unfair advantage over other traders in the market. As to the ""victims"" of insider trading see DPP v O'Reilly [2010] VSC 138 at [19] and R v Hartman [2010] NSWSC 1422 at [45].

20The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has characterised insider trading as a form of cheating or fraud even though its consequences may be more opaque than general fraud. I refer to Hartman v R (2011) 87 ACSR 52; [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [94]. 

21It has been observed that the ""real bite"" of general deterrence only takes hold when an actual custodial sentence is imposed. I refer to the decision of Braun v R (2008) 190 A Crim R 497; [2008] NSWCCA 269 at [85]. 

22Finally, it is to be noted that while the amount of profit derived from an insider trading offence may be relevant, the amount invested is a more important indicator of criminality. I refer to the decision in R v Doff, supra, at [31].

23Decisions and sentencing remarks in a number of well-known cases have heightened recognition that insider trading in breach of the relevant provisions of the Act does involve a serious criminal offence. 

24The theory offered as a basis for prohibiting insider trading has been suggested as involving the concepts of: 

Fairness, that is, market participants should have equal access to the relevant information from the company which issues the securities. 

Fiduciary duty, that is, a person who holds a position of trust should not make a personal profit from that position without the informed consent of beneficiaries. 

Economic efficiency, that is, insider trading is damaging to the integrity of the financial market; and 

Corporate injury, that is, insider trading injures the company which issues the securities, the shareholders in the company and the investors who deal with insiders: The Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Fair Shares For All: Insider Trading in Australia, AGPS, Canberra, 1989, (the Griffiths Report) quoted in R v Firns [2001] 51 NSWLR 548 by Mason P at [43]. 

25It has been observed that insider trading offences are not victimless and each illegal transaction may be likely to have a cost to someone who either traded or held their position without the benefit of the knowledge available to the offence; R v Hartman [2010] NSWSC 1422 per McClellan CJ at CL at [45]. I will return to that aspect. 

26As I have already said above, with such offences there is a need for general deterrence given that such conduct undermines both the efficacy and integrity of the public securities market: R v Rivkin (2003) 198 ALR 400; 45 ACSR 366; [2003] NSWSC 447 at [44]; R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [423]; and R v Pantano at [330]. 

27Further, it has also been accepted that a stern approach should be taken to offences of insider trading: R v Doff (2005) 54 ACSR 200; [2005] NSWCCA 119 at [56]. The need for appropriate sentencing in cases involving white collar crime arises by reason of the exacting standards of honesty that is expected and the difficulty in the detection of such offences: R v Doff, supra, at [56]. In R v Doff the Court of Criminal appeal observed that an insider trading offence:

""... remains a serious offence, and there needs to be a considerable deterrent aspect reflected in order to protect the integrity and the efficacy of the market. Those in a position of trust who receive prior sensitive information in relation to securities are expected to conform to exacting standards of honesty, and transgression can normally be expected to lead to custodial sentences as well as to pecuniary penalties"" at [56].


28The fact that the legislature has, in comparatively recent times, seen fit to substantially increase the maximum penalty available to be imposed upon such offenders, is likely to produce more severe penalties, everything else being equal than those hitherto imposed. 

29In R v De Silva [2011] NSWSC 243, Buddin J referred to the remarks of Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales in R v McQuoid [2009] EWCA Crim 1301; [2009] 4 All Eng 388 in which His Lordship observed that:

""[t]hose who involve themselves in insider dealing are criminals, no more and no less. The principles of confidentiality and trust, which are essential to the operations of the commercial world, are betrayed by insider dealing and public confidence in the integrity of the system which is essential to its proper function is undermined by market abuse ... The message must be clear: When it is done deliberately, insider dealing is a species of fraud; it is cheating"" [at [8]-[9].]

30In these proceedings a Statement of Facts was admitted into evidence as part of the Crown material on sentence. I have relied upon it in describing and recounting the factual background and details concerning the offences. The Offender has, in an adopting statement, stated that the facts set out in that statement are true and correct. 

FACTS

The Offender's Trading History

31The Offender first started trading in leveraged products in 2004. From about 2006, when trading CFDs for shares became popular, he used CFDs for virtually all of his securities trading. 

(1) The Caliburn Offending

32As to the facts concerning the particular offences, firstly the Caliburn offending, the offending arises from insider information that came into the possession of the Offender during his employment by Caliburn. The offences concern his acquisition of financial products, being CFDs, relating to an entity, Veda Advantage Ltd (""Veda""), an Australian credit reference company and a client of Caliburn. 

33Whilst in possession of the inside information, through his employment:

(1) Between 27 December 2006 and 25 January 2007 the Offender procured a Ms Chen to acquire 47,945 Veda CFDs for a total of investment of $8,601.85. The trading activities in this respect involved ten separate acquisitions contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Act. 

(2) On 3 January 2007 the Offender caused the acquisition by a Mr Yu of 3,700 Veda shares for a total investment outlay of $9,923.40. 

(3) On 16 January 2007 the Offender caused the acquisition by Mr Yu of 7,200 Veda shares for a total investment outlay of $19,872.00.

(4) Between 19 and 25 January 2007 the Offender caused the acquisition of 28,150 Veda CFDs through Chen's First IG Markets Account, being part of the Veda CFDs to which I have referred in the first transaction. That acquisition was primarily funded with $5,000 provided by Mr Yu on 16 January 2007, which represented half of the overall investments in Veda CFDs acquired through Chen's First IG Markets Account in the period 27 December 2006 and 25 January 2007. 

(5) On 29 and 30 March 2007, the Offender caused the acquisition of 190,000 Veda CFDs through Chen's First IG Markets Account for a total investment of $51,120.56. 

34Mr Zhu signed his contract of employment with Caliburn on 9 October 2006. It contained a confidentiality provision. The contract, amongst other things, stated that he was under an obligation to keep all ""Confidential Information"" secret and confidential. 

35On 16 November 2006 the Offender acknowledged in writing that he was aware of, accepted and agreed, to comply with what were termed ""Employee Trading Rules"". These rules were specifically directed to preventing insider trading by staff by requiring them to register and obtain approval before completing any trades in financial products. 

36On 16 November 2006 he acknowledged in writing that he had received, read and agreed with Caliburn's Compliance Manual which explained, in summary form, what insider trading offences were. 

37In his affidavit sworn 20 November 2010, the Offender stated, however, that when offered the job at Caliburn, he was desperate to sign the employment contract and did not read anything other than the clauses relating to probation and salary. He said he did not read the confidential information clause. In particular, he also said that he did not recall reading any documents about insider trading. 

38He was assigned shortly after joining Caliburn's 'Deal Team' for the proposed Veda takeover which had been codenamed to maintain confidentiality. He worked on that project until it was announced to the public on 30 January 2007, after which the price of Veda shares on the ASX increased by 20 per cent. Throughout the period from 7 December 2006 to 29 January 2007, the Offender possessed inside information about financial products relating to Veda as specified in the Statement of Facts. 

39On 16 December 2006 he instructed Ms Chen to open Chen's First IG Markets Account for him to operate on his own behalf. Ms Chen did so on 20 December 2006 following which she provided the Offender with the user name and password so that he could operate the account online. 

40An affidavit sworn by him 20 November 2012 and relied on at the sentencing hearing, his evidence was that in October 2006 he had spoken to Ms Chen, who is described by him as a close family friend, on the subject of opening a trading account and that they agreed to create a joint investment account under her name and they would purchase CFDs and split any profits. The Offender relied on this evidence on the question as to whether the acquisitions made in and after December 2006 were premeditated activities carried out with a deliberate strategy involving concealment by using Chen's First IG Markets Account. 

41The Offender's acquisition of financial products, including derivatives such as CFDs, in the period before he joined Caliburn, were transacted in his personal capacity. Four trading accounts were held by him in his own name with Commonwealth Securities Limited (""CommSec"") and IG Markets Limited. There were two trading accounts held jointly in the names of the Offender and his wife, Ms Wang. Two trading accounts were also held in the name of Ms Wang. 

42It is impossible to accept, on the evidence, that the Offender, as at December 2006, was unaware of the risk of exposure if he proceeded to acquire the Veda CFDs in his own name. The fact that in and after December 2006 he traded whilst at Caliburn through Chen's First IG Markets Account and not in his own name, is cogent evidence of his desire to trade without the risk of detection. 

43The first illegal trades through Ms Chen's account occurred approximately 11 days after the account was opened. 

44In addition to knowing he was breaching company policy, the Offender failed to disclose the Veda trades to Caliburn so as to avoid alerting his employer to his acquisitions. It is to be noted, however, that he sought approval from Caliburn on occasions for other trades during his employment, thereby demonstrating an awareness of Caliburn's policy of the need for disclosure by staff in relation to proposed trading activities. 

45In addition to the facts stated in paragraph 8, the Statement of Facts are significant. There the Offender accepted that he procured Ms Chen to open the four accounts referred to in the statement ""... and enable him to operate them for the purpose of concealing his trading activities ...""; at [8]. 

46On 21 December 2006 the Offender provided a cash payment of $5,000 to Ms Chen, and on 16 January 2007 he invited Mr Yu to also provide $5,000 to Ms Chen. The $10,000 was used to fund the acquisition of the 47,945 Veda CFDs through Ms Chen's First IG Markets Account. 

47The acquisition of the CFD's occurred in the period 27 December 2006 and 25 January 2007 for a total investment outlay of $8,601.85. In engaging in that conduct, involving ten separate acquisitions, the Offender procured Ms Chen to acquire the 47,945 Veda CFDs contrary to the relevant insider trading provisions. 

48Mr Yu, who was the same age as the Offender and had been close friends with him, entered into discussions in December 2006 with Mr Zhu on the question of acquiring financial products relating to Veda. 

49Between 8 December 2006 and 25 January 2007, whilst he was in possession of inside information relating to Veda, the Offender encouraged Mr Yu to acquire financial products. 

50On 22 December 2006, Mr Yu opened a trading account with CommSec in the name of his mother, Ming Fei (""the Ming Fei CommSec Account"") for him to operate on his own behalf. 

51On 3 and 16 January 2007 Mr Yu acquired respectively 3,700 and 7,200 Veda shares through the Ming Fei CommSec Account for an outlay of $9,923.40 for the first acquisition and $19,872 for the second. 

52On 16 January 2007 Mr Yu deposited $5,000 into the bank account of Ms Chen for financing the purchase of $5,000 worth of Veda CFDs on his behalf. 

53On 30 January 2007 the Offender caused the disposal of 47,945 Veda CFDs in Chen's First IG Markets Account. The underlying share investment value of the 47,945 Veda CFDs had increased from $135,353.40 to $168,716.40. A profit of $33,363 (less costs) was realised. 

54On 30 January 2007 Mr Yu disposed of the 10,900 Veda shares purchased on 3 and 16 January 2007. At the time of disposal the value of the 10,900 Veda shares had increased from $29,795.40 to $38,368. A profit of $8,572.60 (less costs) was realised. 

55In relation to the third set of transactions involving the acquisition of Veda CFDs, the Offender became aware that there was to be a definitive offer made in relation to the proposed Veda takeover. On 29 and 30 March 2007 he possessed inside information in relation to the imminent definitive offer to be made. On 29 and 30 March 2007, whilst in possession of the inside information, he caused the acquisition, through Chen's First IG Markets Account of 190,000 Veda CFDs for a total investment outlay of $51,120.56. 

56On 2 April 2007, prior to the opening of the share market, Veda issued an ASX announcement in relation to the takeover offer for the acquisition of all of Veda's shares. When trading resumed, the share price of Veda shares rose 7.6 per cent on the last trading. 

57On 2 April 2007 the Offender caused the disposal of 190,000 Veda CFDs. The underlying share value of the CFDs increased, and a profit of $39,548 (less costs) was realised. 

58The total profit derived from the Caliburn offending was $81,483.60 (less costs) of which the Offender's share was $55,814.50. 

59Mr Zhu's evidence was that before joining Caliburn he had held the belief that trading in securities with the advantage of inside information ""was acceptable. I definitely did not appreciate that insider trading was essentially stealing"". He said that when offered the job at Caliburn, he did not know or understand anything about the laws in relation to insider trading: I refer to his affidavit at [30]. 

60In his affidavit sworn on 20 November 2012, the Offender said he became more familiar with the Australian culture in relation to insider trading. He stated:

""I knew that I could not disclose confidential information to third parties and I knew that I could not buy securities in companies that I was working on. I knew that purchasing the second batch of Veda securities was against company policy but I didn't think that it was insider trading. During my employment at Caliburn, I was never requested to attend, and therefore never attended, any training sessions in relation to securities market regulation. Accordingly, I did not know that insider trading was a crime for which you could go to prison. I certainly didn't think that I had become a criminal as a result of my actions at that time."" (at [58]). 

Submissions

61I turn to the submissions in relation to the Caliburn offences. The Crown submitted that the Offender acted with premeditation and planning. This was said to be evidence by his instruction to Ms Chen on 16 December 2006 to open a CFD trading account for him to operate on his own behalf. The first illegal trades through the account it was noted occurred about 11 days after the account was opened. 

62The Crown further submitted that by providing further information to Mr Yu relating to the Veda takeover, the Offender lost control of the information and risked its further dissemination. 

63The Crown observed that the Offender caused the third set of transactions after he gained possession of higher quality inside information relating to an imminent, definitive takeover offer for Veda at a price above the indicative price previously announced. 

64A total profit, the Crown noted, was a figure I previously mentioned of $81,483.60 (less transaction costs) of which the Offender's share was $55,814.50 (less costs). 

65The Crown submitted that the Caliburn offending was more serious than the Credit Suisse offending, but less serious than the Hanlong Mining offending. 

66In the submissions on behalf of the Offender, reference was firstly made to what was termed ""Chinese culture"" by which it was stated in evidence meant that, generally speaking, in Chinese circles one was considered foolish if you did not take advantage of an opportunity that presented itself to you, especially if the advantage was to make money. Further, it was contended, based on the evidence presented for the Offender, that Chinese people traded in securities with inside information as being one such opportunity and it was not considered to be serious criminal conduct. 

67This claimed culture is said to be a relevant matter to be taken into account in understanding the Offender's actions. 

68As to the opening of the CFD trading account by Ms Chen, it was submitted on behalf of the Offender that it was not evidence of ""premeditation and planning"" on the basis that he and Ms Chen had agreed to open a CFD trading account in October 2006, before the Offender commenced employment with Caliburn, even though the account was in fact opened in December 2006. 

69It is also submitted for the Offender that the Caliburn offences must be considered in light of his junior status and role at Caliburn. Additionally, it was said on his behalf that he was young (35 years of age) and was ""naive and inexperienced"". 

70In the Crown's submissions in reply, it was submitted that, regardless of the original intention in setting up the trading account, the fact is that the account was only operated after the Offender had started work on Veda. The effect of the use of the account by the Offender, the Crown submitted, was to conceal the Offender's conduct in circumstances in which he was breaching company policy and that he deliberately failed to disclose Veda trades to Caliburn. He had admitted to obtaining a thrill from getting away with it. The Crown noted that in contrast to his insider trading, the Offender had sought approval from Caliburn for other trades in the same period as the Veda trades. 

71The Crown further observed that whilst the first round of Veda trades were effected from a computer in Caliburn's office, the remaining seven transactions were conducted from a nearby internet cafe. 

72There was a further issue between the parties arising from the Crown's submission as to the claimed high quality nature of the inside information.

73On behalf of the Offender, it was submitted that he had been told ""very little information"" regarding ""the Veda deal"". 

74The Crown observed that the relevant issue is the significance of the information and not the amount of it. The information it contended was significant.

75In particular, in relation to the second set of trades, the Crown relied upon his evidence that he was aware that there would be an imminent, definitive offer which the board of Veda intended to endorse at a price above the indicative offer price previously announced. 

76On behalf of the Offender in further written submissions, it was emphasised that although he had admitted having access to material confidential information, and misusing it, nonetheless because of his ""very junior role"" at Caliburn, he must be distinguished from other offenders in other cases by reason of their seniority; seniority brings with it greater access to high (and potentially higher) confidential information.

Consideration

77The seriousness of the Caliburn trading arises from the fact that the offences were plainly committed with premeditation and planning and with full knowledge that the trading was undertaken in breach of his employment obligations. The Offender accepted in evidence that he derived a thrill from getting away with the trading undetected and, in effect, thumbing his nose at company policy: Transcript 19.50 to 20.6.

78He stated in his affidavit that he knew that his acquisitions constituted a breach of company policy. However, his evidence was that he did not ask Ms Chen to set up the First IG Markets Account so that he could conceal his insider trading. 

79In relation to the second round of Veda trades in March and April 2007, the Offender accepted that at the time of the trades he knew that what he was doing was wrong: Transcript 21.8-12. 

80It is correct to say that some account is to be taken of the Offender's relative inexperience in the finance industry at the time that he joined Caliburn, and that it is possible that there may have been some influence on him by virtue of what he described as the ""Chinese culture"". As against that, he is clearly an intelligent young man who was educated in Australia and had attained a level of maturity. 

81However, accepting that the Offender did not appreciate the criminality of his trading, there is no doubt that he was fully aware of the fact that he was breaching company policy and was acting dishonestly. In utilising Ms Chen's First IG Markets Account, he consistently took steps to disguise or conceal his trading. In this respect, I rely upon the Statement of Facts and the candid admissions made by the Offender both in his affidavit and in the course of his oral evidence. 

82The nature of the offending was serious. It involved a fundamental breach of his confidentiality obligations that bound him, and of which he was aware. The inside information possessed by him was of a high quality, particularly in relation to the acquisition of the 190,000 CFDs made on 29 and 30 March 2007. Further, the Offender's primary motive in trading with inside information was to obtain personal financial benefit. The seriousness of his activities was increased by his procuring others to trade for their own profit. 

83Finally, the amount of the Caliburn offending is a relevant matter in assessing the seriousness of the offence involving the outlays I have previously referred to.

84I consider that the objective gravity of the offending conduct in relation to the Caliburn matters to be significant, although, not at the high end of the range for offences of this kind. Whilst the Offender was a true insider, his involvement was less than, for example, that of a senior executive or manager. I make that assessment based also on the amounts invested and the extent of his knowledge, that is though his conduct was ""wrong"" in the sense I earlier discussed, he at a relatively early period in his career did not possess sufficient appreciation of the criminality involved in the offending behaviour. 

85In determining sentence, it is necessary to bring into account the relevant mitigating factors which I will address later in these remarks. 

(2) Credit Suisse Offending

86I turn to the Credit Suisse offending. This offending arises out of two separate transactions. The first was procuring Ms Chen to dispose of 60,000 CFDs relating to Funtastic Limited (""Funtastic"") on 14 August 2008 and the second in procuring Ms Chen to acquire 6,300 units on 13 February 2009 in Adelaide Managed Funds Assets Backed Yield Trust (""Adelaide Managed Funds"").

87The Offender worked as an Associate in the Investment Banking Division of Credit Suisse, a multinational financial services company. By virtue of his position, he acquired inside information. 

88He commenced his employment with Credit Suisse on 21 January 2008, having signed his contract of employment on 26 November 2007. He left that employment on 9 July 2010. The contract of employment included a provision concerning ""Confidential Information"" which imposed an obligation upon him to maintain confidentiality of such information. 

89The Offender was required to understand and comply with Credit Suisse's ""Bank Information Barrier Policy"" which referred to a prohibition against trading or ""encouraging others to trade"" while in possession of inside information. It included a discussion of what constitutes ""inside information and the provision of such information"". Examples included proposed transactions such as acquisitions. 

90The Offender completed three training sessions during his employment with Credit Suisse. These addressed the prohibition against insider trading. In June 2008, he completed an online training session which referred to the prohibition on insider trading. 

91In June 2009, he attended a training session entitled ""LCD - Information Barriers"". This training addressed prohibitions against insider trading. It identified it as punishable by ""criminal charges and possible imprisonment"". 

92As to the disposal of CFDs relating to Funtastic in June 2008, the Offender became a member of the Credit Suisse deal team advising the company in relation to the proposed Funtastic takeover. He was on the team between 25 June and 8 August 2008.

93At the end of this period, he recommended to Ms Chen that she acquire CFDs relating to Funtastic. It is not alleged that at the time he had any material price sensitive information concerning Funtastic that was not generally available. Consequently, on 14 August 2008, Ms Chen acquired 60,000 Funtastic CFDs.

94On 8 August 2008, Funtastic issued a public ASX announcement that it was having discussions with Archer Consortium.

95On 13 August 2008, the Offender became aware of developments which had the potential to render Funtastic a significantly less attractive acquisition target to Archer. On 14 August 2008, he received a confidential email which tended to confirm information he already possessed. On 14 August 2008, he received a further copy of that email. 

96On the same date, he was confidentially informed by a colleague on the deal team that the proposed takeover ""wasn't looking so good"". 

97On 14 August 2008, the Offender possessed relevant inside information concerning financial products relating to Funtastic and while he was in possession of it, he telephoned Ms Chen. He told her to sell the 60,000 Funtastic CFDs. In procuring her to dispose of them, he acted contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Act. 

98On 14 August 2008 at 2.13pm, he caused the disposal of 60,000 Funtastic CFDs in the Chen CMC Account. At the time of the disposal the underlying share investment of the CFDs had decreased and a loss of $5,100 (plus costs) was realised. 

99By causing the disposal of the CFDs on 14 August 2008 at the price in question, rather than doing so after the termination of discussions between Funtastic and Archer had been announced, the Offender averted a further potential loss of $6,900.

100In relation to the Adelaide Managed Funds transactions in December 2008, Adelaide Managed Funds had been approached by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited on a confidential basis with an indicative and non-binding proposal to acquire all units in Adelaide. Credit Suisse was engaged to advise Adelaide Management Funds in relation to the proposed takeover which was referred to by codenames with a view to maintaining confidentiality.

101The Offender became a member of the Credit Suisse deal team advising Adelaide Managed Funds on or about 17 December 2008 in relation to the proposed takeover. From that date until 13 February 2009, he possessed inside information about financial products relating to Adelaide Managed Funds, which included information that Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited were planning to make a proposal for the acquisition of 100% of the units in Adelaide at a price representing a premium of more than 50% to its current trading price.

102On 13 February 2009, the Offender, whilst in possession of the inside information, caused the acquisition through the Chen CommSec account of 6,300 Adelaide units, involving a total investment outlay of $7,371.

103On 16 February 2009, Adelaide issued a public ASX announcement which stated that Bendigo had made a proposal to acquire all the units in Adelaide Managed Funds for a stated price and an estimated stated additional cash distribution representing a premium.

104After the announcement, when trading resumed, the opening price of Adelaide Managed Funds units increased 50% on the last trading price prior to the announcement.

105On 16 February 2009, the Offender caused the disposal of 6,300 Adelaide Managed Funds units in the Chen CommSec Account and did so for a profit of $3,559.50 (less costs). 

106The total profits derived from the Credit Suisse offending was $10,459.50 (less costs), of which $6,900 was the avoidance of a loss rather than a positive profit. 

Submissions

107In submissions, the Crown pointed to the evidence that established that the Offender had been advised of his obligations of confidentiality and the prohibitions against insider trading and that these had been reinforced during his employment.

108In relation to the Funtastic shares, the offending involved, as I have indicated, the avoidance of loss of $6,900 and a profit of $3559.50.

109The Crown submitted that the fact that the motivation for one part of the Credit Suisse offending was to avoid a loss, rather than make a profit, did not lessen the criminality in the conduct. That submission, with respect, should be accepted. 

110The Crown observed that whilst the offending was less serious than the other counts on the indictment, it nonetheless involved a breach of trust on two separate occasions, the possession of high quality confidential information and the use of Ms Chen's trading account to avoid detection. 

111The written submissions on behalf of the Offender stated that whilst the Offender was conscious that insider trading was wrong, he still did not understand the serious criminality of that conduct: (at [45]).

112In relation to the Funtastic deal, the Offender had only a very junior role during the six week period that he was engaged on the team and his function was limited to preparing financial models. 

113It was Ms Chen who independently suggested the possibility of purchasing Funtastic stock and at that time the Offender did not have any material price sensitive information that was not publicly available. 

114In mid-August 2008, after his time working on the Funtastic deal, he had a fleeting conversation with Mr Thompson, a Credit Suisse manager working on the deal, being a conversation I have referred to in which Mr Thompson said that the deal ""wasn't looking so good"".

115Combined with the fact that he had already considered himself responsible for Ms Chen's earlier significant losses, he immediately contacted Ms Chen after that conversation to enquire whether she had purchased Funtastic stock. It was in that context that he was told that she had and had already lost approximately $5,000. He then told her to dispose of the Funtastic CFDs immediately, in an attempt to avoid her losing more of her money. 

116In relation to the Adelaide Managed Funds transaction, the submission was that the Offender was still very troubled by the Funtastic loss and in a ""misguided attempt"" to make it up to Ms Chen, he resolved that he would acquire Adelaide Managed Funds units for her and make a profit equivalent to the Funtastic loss. 

117In the submissions for the Offender, it was emphasised that he was at the time 27 years of age and was inexperienced and held a very junior position at Credit Suisse. 

118The only insider information to which he had access was the passing conversation with Mr Thompson. It was submitted that this could not be considered to be high quality confidential information. 

119In relation to Funtastic, his motive was not to make a profit for himself, but solely to minimise loss incurred by Ms Chen.

120In relation to Adelaide Managed Funds, his motive was to make a profit for Ms Chen, to make up for the Funtastic loss for which he felt responsible. He did not benefit in any way from the profit gained from trading in the Adelaide Managed Funds units. 

121It was accepted that misusing the confidential information in relation to the Adelaide Managed Funds matter was ""a serious offence and a serious breach of trust, however the offence in this case must be distinguished from offences where the motive is purely personal gain"": Written Submissions on behalf of the Offender at [62](e). 

122The amounts involved in both transactions were said to be ""nominal and would not have had effect on the value of the shares in Funtastic or the units in Adelaide"". The conduct, it was submitted, was unlikely to have undermined the integrity of the market to any significant degree. 

123In the Crown's submissions in reply it was emphasised that an important feature of the offending was the Offender's knowledge at the time, on his own evidence, that ""insider trading was the wrong thing to do"". He also acknowledged in cross-examination that he knew that it was contrary to company policy and was dishonest and involved a conflict of interest. Notwithstanding his knowledge in those respects, he went ahead. 

124Although it is clear that the Offender's understanding of the ""wrongness"" of insider trading had increased by the time of the Credit Suisse offending, the nature and seriousness of the offences, as previously indicated, are in my assessment of a different and lower order to the offending in relation to the Caliburn offences.

125The receipt of the inside information from Mr Thompson, occurring as it did in effect by chance, therefore did not involve the deliberate acquisition of inside information that he gained on that occasion. Nonetheless, its use represented an intentional and serious breach of trust. Accepting the Offender's explanation as to the reason why he advised Ms Chen to dispose of the Funtastic CFDs, as I do, his conduct nonetheless occurred without any mitigating circumstances. The same can be said in relation to the Adelaide Managed Funds transaction, although it is noted that the amount invested ($7,371) is a factor to be taken into account in evaluating the gravity of the criminality involved. 

126The Credit Suisse offending is, in my opinion, to be regarded as falling within the lower range of insider trading offences. 

(3) Hanlong Mining Offending

127I turn to the Hanlong Mining offending. 

128The Hanlong Mining offences plainly represent the most serious offending amongst the three offences in question. It consists of five separate transactions contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Act, committed during the Offender's employment with Hanlong. 

129The Hanlong offending consists of transactions, as I have previously referred, as follows: 

(i) procuring Wingatta to acquire 1,252,753 Bannerman shares between 6 and 8 July 2011;

(ii) procuring Ms Chen to acquire 30,000 Bannerman CFDs on 8 July 2011;

(iii) Thirdly, procuring Ms Zhao to acquire 56,740 Bannerman CFDs on 8 July 2011;

(iv) procuring Wingatta to acquire 10,112,154 Sundance CFDs between 13 and 15 July 2011; and,

(v) procuring Ms Chen to acquire 450,000 Sundance CFDs between 13 and 15 July 2011. 

130Hanlong Mining is the Australian subsidiary of the Chinese conglomerate Sichuan Hanlong Group Co Limited. The latter is the parent of a number of companies incorporated in a number of countries, including Australia. 

131The Offender's employment with Hanlong Mining commenced on 26 July 2010. His contract of employment expressly required that he not disclose information received during his employment unless in specified circumstances, none of which is relevant to the present proceedings. It also provided that an employee was prohibited from dealing in securities involving inside information.

132It is necessary to say something about the entity known as the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund.

133In about September 2010, Mr Xiao, the Managing Director of Hanlong Mining, and the Offender's director supervisor, invited the Offender to co-invest in a private fund with him for the purpose of jointly conducting investment for profit. 

134The Chief Operations Officer of Hanlong Mining at the time, Mr Nelson Chen, also agreed, following an invitation from Mr Xiao, to jointly co-invest in the private fund, as did Mr Simon Yang, the Chief Financial Officer of Hanlong Mining. 

135On instructions from Xiao and Yang, a Hong Kong company, Golden Stone Partners Limited (""Golden Stone""), was set up through a firm of accountants in Hong Kong. 

136On 6 January 2011, on Xiao's instructions, the Offender then caused Wingatta to be incorporated in Australia for use as an investment vehicle for the private fund, the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund. Wingatta was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Stone. 

137On 10 January 2011, the Offender caused Wingatta to set up a bank account with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, (""the Wingatta Bank Account""). The Offender conducted all relevant transactions through that account. 

138On 13 January 2011, he also caused Wingatta to set up, in its own name, a trading account with CMC Markets Stockbroking Limited, (""the Wingatta CMC Share Trading Account"") and a CFD trading account with CMC Markets APAC, (""the Wingatta CMC CFD Trading Account"") for trading by the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund. 

139In January 2011, an amount of $1.4 million was transferred by Mr Xiao in the amount of $700,000, the Offender ($300,000), Mr Yang ($300,000) and Mr Chen ($100,000) to Golden Stone, to capitalise the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund. The four men agreed to share any profits in the same proportion as their respective investments. 

140On 15 March 2011, Xiao invested a further $100,000. 

141Accordingly, the four men were entitled to share any profits generated from the Private Fund in the following proportions: Xiao (53.3%), the Offender (20%), Mr Yang (20%) and Mr Chen (6.7%).

142In the period 21 January 2011 to 30 June 2011, investments were made by the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund that resulted in losses of approximately $1.2 million.

143On 1 July 2011, Xiao and Yang caused $US1 million (or approximately $AUD928,591) to be transferred from Hanlong Metals Limited, a related entity of Hanlong Mining, into the Wingatta Bank Account and made available for investment by the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund, specifically for the trading in what have been referred to in submissions as the Bannerman and the Sundance securities to which I will shortly refer. The transfer of the $US1 million was recorded as a loan in the accounting records of Hanlong Metals Limited.

144The Offender in due course received his share of the profits of the Private Fund through a British Virgin Islands company called Concord Rise Investments Limited.

145In accordance with the Statement of Facts (at [91]), the four men engaged in conduct, that is acts and omissions, which had the effect of concealing or obscuring the operation of, and their involvement in, the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund. This included:

(a) Making Golden Stone the sole shareholder of Wingatta (none of the four men were office holders or employees of Golden Stone);

(b) Nominating a junior employee, a Mr Fan Zhang, who had no financial interest in the Private Fund as the sole director of Wingatta (none of the four men were office holders or employees of Wingatta);

(c) Having Mr Zhang listed as the sole authorised operator of the Wingatta Bank Account, the Wingatta CMC Share Trading Account and the Wingatta CMC CFD Trading Account, when in fact the Offender operated them as part of the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund. 

(d) Xiao, Yang, Chen and the Offender, each using companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, had bank accounts in Hong Kong that they controlled to make their investments in the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund and to receive profits from it. As I have earlier indicated, the Offender did so via his company Concord Rise Investments Limited. 

(e) Each of the four men depositing the funds for their initial investments into the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund into a bank account in Hong Kong in the name of Golden Stone, which then subsequently transferred the funds to the Wingatta bank account; and,

(f) Not creating a written agreement in relation to the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund and creating very few other records evidencing the operation and the ownership of the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund.

(i) Bannerman

146I turn to the Bannerman transactions.

147The Hanlong Mining count concerns transactions which the Offender procured while working in a senior management capacity for Hanlong Mining, in relation to its proposed takeovers of Bannerman Resources Limited (""Bannerman"") and Sundance Resources Limited (""Sundance""). 

148Bannerman is an Australian uranium exploration and development company. Between July 2010 and June 2011, Hanlong Mining engaged in confidential discussions with Bannerman relating to proposals by Hanlong Mining to acquire Bannerman (""the Proposed Bannerman Takeover""). However, no agreement was reached. The discussions had been led by Xiao as Managing Director and the Offender as Vice President, Investments.

149In early July 2011, Xiao and the Offender decided, without authorisation from Sichuan Hanlong, that Hanlong Mining would make a highly conditional indicative proposal to Bannerman after the market closed on 8 July 2011.

150They did not expect the proposal to be accepted. They decided to make the proposal for the predominate purpose of enabling them to engage in insider trading in connection with the announcement of the proposal in an attempt to recover losses previously incurred by the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund.

151In particular, the four men planned to acquire Bannerman shares and/or CFDs shortly before making the proposal on 8 July 2011 and anticipated that once the proposal was announced, it would result in a significant increase in Bannerman's share price, immediately after which they could dispose of the shares and/or CFDs for a substantial profit. 

152In the relevant period, namely 6 to 8 July 2011 inclusive, the Offender possessed inside information about financial products relating to Bannerman. This was to the following effect: 

Hanlong Mining was planning to make an imminent highly conditional proposal for the acquisition of 100% of shares in Bannerman at a price of $0.612 per share.

153In the period 6 to 8 July 2011, Bannerman's share price on the ASX ranged from $0.30 to $0.39 per share.

154Between 6 to 8 July 2011, the Offender, after consultation with Mr Xiao, whilst in possession of inside information, caused the acquisition through Wingatta's CMC Share Trading Account on behalf of the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund of 1,252,753 Bannerman shares at prices between $0.32 and $0.39, for a total investment outlay of $456,105.65. In engaging in this conduct, which involved 18 separate transactions, the Offender procured Wingatta to acquire 1,252,753 Bannerman shares contrary to the provisions of s 1043A(1)(d) of the Act. 

155On 8 July 2011, the Offender caused the acquisition through Chen's Second IG Markets CFD Account of 30,000 Bannerman CFDs at a price reflecting $0.385 per Bannerman share, for a total investment outlay of $1,914.40 (referencing an underlying share investment value of $11,550). In engaging in this conduct, which involved three separate transactions, the Offender procured Ms Chen to acquire 30,000 Bannerman CFDs contrary to the insider trading provisions. 

156Also on 8 July 2011, the Offender, whilst in possession of inside information, caused the acquisition through the Zhao CommSec Account (his mother-in-law's account) of 56,740 Bannerman CFDs at a price reflecting $0.385 per Bannerman share for a total investment outlay of about $2,184.49 (referencing an underlying share investment of $21,844.09).

157After the close of trading on Friday 8 July 2011, the Offender informed Bannerman that Hanlong Mining intended to send to it a formal proposal for the acquisition of Bannerman the following day. On 9 July 2011, he sent an email to Bannerman attaching such a proposal.

158On Monday, 11 July 2011, prior to the opening of trading on the ASX, Bannerman issued a public announcement, classified as price sensitive, in which it stated it had a highly conditional proposal from Hanlong Mining for the acquisition of 100% of Bannerman for $0.612 per Bannerman share. 

159When trading on the ASX resumed at 10.00 am on 11 July 2011, the opening price of Bannerman shares was $0.495 per share, representing 28.6% increase on the last trading price prior to the announcement of the Proposed Bannerman Takeover. 

160On 11 July 2011, the Offender, after consultation with Mr Xiao, caused the disposal of the 1,252,753 Bannerman shares in the Wingatta CMC Share Trading Account (involving the profit of $97,958.20 (less costs), the disposal of 30,000 Bannerman CFDs in Chen's Second IG Markets CFD Account, (a profit of $3,480 (less costs) was realised) and the disposal of 56,740 of the Bannerman CFDs in the Zhao CommSec Account (a profit of $6,525.10 (less costs) being realised).

(ii) Sundance Resources

161I turn to the Sundance Resources matter.

162Sundance is an Australian based international iron ore company, whose ordinary fully paid shares are traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.

163In about September 2010 Hanlong Mining commenced the process for the making of a proposal for the takeover of Sundance. The project was given codenames to maintain confidentiality.

164By 18 March 2011, entities within the Hanlong Group had acquired approximately 19% of Sundance's shares. Xiao and the Offender entered into discussions with Sundance with a view to Hanlong Group becoming Sundance's strategic partner and developing its major iron ore asset in a project in Africa.

165On 16 May 2011, Hanlong Mining and Sundance entered into a confidentiality agreement to enable Hanlong Mining to conduct due diligence in the relation to Sundance and the African project. The confidentiality agreement was signed by Xiao and the Offender on behalf of Hanlong Mining. 

166The Offender worked on the proposed Sundance takeover along with Xiao. In that period he received confidential information relating to the proposed takeover.

167Particulars of the two acquisitions in relation to Sundance, the subject of the count, are as follows:

(i) Between 13 and 15 July 2011, the offender, after consultation with Xiao, whilst in possession of inside information, caused the acquisition through Wingatta's CMD CFD Trading Account on behalf of Wingatta of 10,112,154 Sundance CFDs for a total investment outlay of $1,011,215.40. This conduct involved nine separate acquisitions.

(ii) Between 13 and 15 July 2011 the offender, whilst in possession of inside information, caused the acquisition through Chen's Second IG Markets CFD Account of 450,000 Sundance CFDs involving a total outlay of $36,000.

168In relation to the acquisitions concerning Sundance, the Offender stated in his affidavit:

""During the time of purchasing the Sundance CFDs on behalf of the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund I also purchased 450,000 Sundance CFDs through the Second IG Trading Account. Again there is no excuse for this, other than I was swept up in the moment, had lost my sense of judgment and was entirely motivated by personal gain. I acquired the Sundance CFDs through the Second IG Trading Account because I wanted to conceal those trades.""

169On 18 July 2011 the Offender, following consultation with Xiao, caused the disposal of 10,012,154 Sundance CFDs in the Wingatta's CMC CFD Trading Account with a profit of 1,090,262.33 (less costs) being realised, of which the Offender's share was $218,052.46 (less costs). On the disposal of the 450,000 Sundance CFDs in Chen's Second IG Markets CFD Account, the Offender realised a profit of $57,425 (less costs).

170The total profit derived from the Hanlong Mining offending was $1,255,560.63 (less costs), of which the Offender's share, based on the original 20% investment in the Private Fund, is calculated at $305,074.20 (less costs).

Submissions

171I turn to the submissions. The Crown submitted that the Hanlong Mining offending, though occurring over a short period of time, and the associated conduct, including the Offender's role in it, exhibited a high degree of premeditation, planning and concealment.

172The Crown contended that although the Offender's conduct must be considered in light of Xiao's involvement, in particular, directions and instructions given by him, nonetheless the Offender voluntarily engaged in insider trading at Hanlong Mining after having committed similar offences at two previous employers.

173Three of the five sets of transactions, the Crown observed, were solely for the Offender's own benefit using accounts in the name of Ms Chen and his mother-in-law.

174The Offender, the Crown observed, along with other members of the fund, established an elaborate corporate structure to conceal their involvement. The Offender incorporated his own company, as I have earlier indicated, as part of the scheme. 

175The Crown also observed that the Offender was responsible for executing decisions regarding investments by Wingatta.

176It was observed that the Hanlong Mining offending involved the investment of $1,507,419.94 in Bannerman and Sundance shares and CFDs, of which the Offender's share was $333,563.10. The total profit and the Offender's share, based on his 20% interest being as I previously stated.

177The Crown also submitted that the Offender's role in the creation of the inside information relating to Bannerman was of ""critical importance"". 

178On behalf of the Offender it was submitted that consideration has to be given to the Offender's seniority and position within Hanlong Mining. It was noted that he was subordinate to Xiao, who was described as ""a domineering and authoritative"" person who became a force in the Offender's life. Additionally, the other members of the management team were older and senior to the Offender.

179It was also contended on behalf of the Offender that he was exposed to ridicule over his naïvety in relation to insider trading, which he claimed he was led to understand by Xiao that it was a widespread practice.

180Further emphasis was given to the fact that it was Xiao who had the controlling interest in the Private Fund and that he maintained control of it. The various activities undertaken by the Offender were subject to instructions and directions from Xiao.

181In relation to the proposal concerning the Bannerman takeover, it was emphasised that the Offender prepared the draft proposal under instructions from Xiao, who was placing considerable pressure on him to purchase Bannerman shares.

182It was submitted that the ""enormity"" of what the Offender was doing finally dawned on him when he recognised a serious illegality involved in drafting the takeover proposal for Bannerman, on the one hand, and buying shares on the other.

183It was submitted that at the time he was extremely torn between his conscience and realisation that, if he seriously challenged Xiao or did not comply with his instructions, he was potentially risking his job and a future in funds management planning that had been discussed between him and Xiao. It would mean also that he would be forced to give up the lavish lifestyle to which he had, by then, become accustomed.

184It was contended that the Offender endeavoured to convince Xiao to delay in sending the Bannerman proposal, but was unsuccessful in that regard. It was accepted that the Offender simply did not possess the ""courage"" to walk away from Xiao and to rebuild his future elsewhere.

185The written submissions for the Offender noted that the Offender accepts that there is no excuse for his personal acquisitions and that he was ""simply swept up in the moment and lost all sense of judgment and was entirely motivated by personal gain"". Written submissions on sentence at [97].

186In relation to the acquisition of the Sundance CFDs, it was noted in the submissions for the Offender that this occurred only days after the acquisition and disposal of the Bannerman shares. In that context, it was contended the Offender did not consider questioning Xiao's instructions.

187The submissions emphasised that the Offender at all times was subordinate to Xiao and had fallen under his influence and that it was Xiao who was the architect of the Private Fund and effectively made all the decisions in relation to its establishment, structure and funding. 

188In submissions, the subjective circumstances and other matters were addressed. These matters will be dealt with later in these remarks.

Conclusions

189The Offender in respect of all offences was, at the time of the commission, a ""true insider"", being an employee in a position of trust who took advantage of inside information obtained through his employment with Caliburn, Credit Suisse and Hanlong Mining. An offence committed by a true insider, as earlier indicated, is usually regarded as more serious than one committed by a tippee: R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643 at [28]; Doff, supra, at [57]. 

190The position and seniority of an employee, as I also indicated, is a relevant matter. Such provides, amongst other things, a greater ability to avoid detection and represents a more serious breach of trust. R v Scott (7 November 1991, unreported); R v Pantano, supra, at 338. 

191The Offender in his affidavit stated that when he joined Credit Suisse in January 2008 he knew about insider trading; [64]. As I have earlier noted, he was informed in his training at Credit Suisse that criminal punishment could be imposed for insider trading. In cross-examination he stated that by the latter part of 2007, in relation to insider trading, he had gained an understanding that it involved breaking the law, in particular the criminal law. He of course had earlier appreciated that insider trading was contrary to company policy and it involved dishonesty and provided a circumstance in which serious conflicts of interest would arise. I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the Offender's understanding and appreciation of the criminal nature of insider trading existed throughout his period of employment with Hanlong Mining. 

192In evaluating the gravity of this offending the following matters are to be taken into account. The Hanlong Mining count, as I have stated, consists of five separate sets of transactions. These were procured by the Offender while he was working in a senior management position for Hanlong Mining in relation to the proposed takeovers of Bannerman Resources Limited and Sundance Resources Limited. Three of the five sets of transactions were for his profit alone, trading in accounts in the name of others. 

193In relation to the Bannerman acquisitions, whilst he was centrally involved in the establishment of the scheme involving in the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund, his participation must be placed in its proper setting. The remarks that follow, accordingly, are directed to the relevant contextual matters. 

194The idea and the proposal for the establishment of the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund came from Xiao, the Managing Director of Hanlong Mining and who was the Offender's direct supervisor. It was Xiao who invited the Offender and the others to participate by investing in the fund. 

195Further, it was Xiao and Yang who gave instructions on 29 December 2010 to set up the Hong Kong company. Whilst the Offender caused Wingatta to be incorporated in Australia and took steps to set up the Wingatta bank account and the trading account, those matters were carried out on the instructions of Xiao. In other words, a distinction is to be made between Xiao, who proposed the establishment of the Private Fund and who issued instructions on the one hand, and the Offender's participation as to the mechanics of setting up and operating the scheme. Additionally, it was Xiao who had the major interest in the Private Fund and he at all relevant times issued instructions to the Offender as his supervisor. 

196In emphasising the Offender's somewhat lessor role than Xiao in the Bannerman acquisitions, I do not in any way overlook the fact that the Offender held a substantial interest in the Private Fund and was no doubt motivated by self-interest in complying with Xiao's directions. Those comments also apply to the Sundance acquisitions. 

197The Offender, along with other members of the company, including in particular his direct supervisor Xiao, established what the Crown properly submitted was ""an elaborate corporate structure"" designed to conceal their involvement in Wingatta. After establishing the Hong Kong company, it involved nominating a junior employee with no interest in the Private Fund as the sole director and listing him as the sole operator of the Wingatta bank and trading accounts.

198The highly conditional indicative proposal that was put to Bannerman after the market closed on 8 July 2011 involved a serious abuse of position by both Xiao and the Offender, although of the two men, Xiao must be regarded as the principal person responsible for the proposal being put forward. The conditional indicative proposal, it is also to be noted, was put forward without any authorisation from Sichuan Hanlong. It was formulated for the predominant purpose of enabling Xiao and the other investors in the private fund, including the Offender, to engage in insider trading following the announcement of the proposal in an attempt to recover the losses that had previously been incurred by the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund.

199As the Crown observed, it is clear that although the Offender was party to creating the circumstances for the illegal acquisition of Bannerman CFDs, he is to be sentenced for insider trading and not for market manipulation offences. His involvement in making the takeover proposal as the Crown submitted is, however, relevant to the nature and circumstances of the offending under s 16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

200A person who is involved in the creation and the control of a takeover offer for the predominant purpose of insider trading clearly is in possession of very high quality inside information. This is particularly so where an insider can secretly create such information. The Crown referred in its submissions to the decision in R v De Silva [2011] NSWSC 243, in which Buddin J at [60]-[61] accepted that the Offender in that case who created and controlled price sensitive inside information, used it for his own financial advantage and this was relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence.

201I further accept, as the Crown observed, that in relation to Hanlong Mining, the victims included counter-parties who traded after the announcement of the Bannerman takeover bid, unaware that the offer was disingenuous. 

202In relation to each of the offences in question, the Offender intentionally acquired the financial products the subject of the relevant acquisitions, with a view to maximising his own personal wealth and that of the Golden Stone/Wingatta Private Fund. He did so with the knowledge that such conduct was in breach of his employment obligations and was wrong, in the sense that it was in breach of his obligations as an employee and that it involved premeditated planning to avoid detection and involved dishonesty. He was additionally aware that the Hanlong Mining offences constituted offences contrary to the provisions of the insider trading provisions in the Act.

203In relation to the Caliburn, Credit Suisse and Hanlong Mining offences, I accept the Crown's submission that in this case there were at least three classes of victim, namely: 

(i) The market, including in particular the investing community at large;

(ii) The employers, by reason of the breach of trust that had been bestowed by each of the Offender's three employers. In addition, in the case of the Caliburn and Credit Suisse counts, the Offender misappropriated client's price sensitive information;

(iii) Individuals being the class of persons who trade with an Offender without having access to that inside information. In particular, in this case the Offender procured transactions prior to market announcements with counter-parties ignorant of the insider information about to be released to the public. As the Crown observed, while the Offender sought to maximise profit through the use of CFDs, those on the other side of the transactions faced the potential for increased losses. 

204In determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed, it is important to bring into account those factors which operate in the Offender's favour. They include: 

(i) His early pleas of guilty, which saved what would have inevitably been a trial of some length and complexity, and demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. On the basis of the early pleas, the Offender is entitled to the maximum discount on sentence, namely 25%. The sentence to be imposed will be determined on that basis. 

(ii) That the Offender at the time of the offences was a comparatively young man with limited experience in the financial world and whose conduct in many respects exhibited some immaturity. 

(iii) Also to be weighed in his favour is the evidence concerning his prior good character at the time of the commission of the relevant offences. He had not previously been convicted of a criminal offence. His background demonstrates that he had a disciplined attitude to his university studies and succeeded at a comparatively high level. In his relatively short career he proved himself to be a hard working employee. 

205There is no need for me to set out all the ""checklist"" items in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1912 (Cth). I have given consideration to the relevant items, in particular, in specific terms in these remarks on sentence. The checklist, as I have earlier indicated, is not exhaustive. There is one additional matter to which I should make specific reference. 

206In the assessment of the nature and circumstances of the Offender's offences and his culpability in respect of them, some account must be made of the employment environment in which he worked with Hanlong Mining. That environment was a highly unusual one. Whereas in most cases the evidence establishes that the particular employers in question established and enforced appropriate standards of integrity and the prohibitions against insider trading, the Offender's work environment at Hanlong Mining was an exception.

207The Managing Director, Xiao, was described in evidence, amongst other things, as a domineering personality. The Offender first commenced a relationship with him in mid-2009 and was always highly impressed and influenced by him. Xiao was, it appears from the evidence in the present case, a person who exerted a powerful negative influence on others. 

208The influence of a poisonous work culture or environment has been noted as a relevant circumstance. In R v Agius; R v Zerafa [2012] NSWSC 978, her Honour Simpson J in her sentencing remarks observed as follows:

""Mr Zerafa is in a very different position. He was born in October 1975. He is now almost 37 years of age. He is married with two young children (now eight and six years of age) and has no criminal convictions.""

209A little later: 

""I am satisfied that his good character is a matter appropriate to be taken into account... He took up employment in the office of Owen T Daniel & Co in 1997 when he was 21 or 22 years of age. He had previously had very little experience, and none in a professional office.

Although he could not have known it at the time, the environment into which he was inducted was morally poisonous. His employer, Mr Daniel, was a very corrupt man. He was, however, also gregarious, charming and charismatic. He was generous to Mr Zerafa, who was an impressionable and vulnerable young man. The tragedy for Mr Zerafa is that he has never been exposed to an ethical working environment.

As I have earlier mentioned, I am satisfied that he did not engage himself in this conspiracy of his own initiative, but did so under the malign influence of Mr Daniel. I also take into account, to his credit, that he did make an attempt in 2004 to persuade Mr Daniel to cease involvement and that notwithstanding Mr Daniel's rebuff, that attempt had the effect of limiting, if not bringing to an end, the participation of clients of the firm in the scheme. He is entitled to credit for that stand."" (at [80]-[82])

210In the case of Zerafa there were a number of factual circumstances that distinguish the offence and the Offender's position in that case from the present. However, the point made by her Honour Simpson J as to a morally unhealthy work environment has some relevance in assessing the Offender's culpability, although not to the same extent as it had in Zerafa.

Subjective Circumstances

211I turn to the other subjective circumstances. 

212The Offender is a young man with a five-year-old son. His wife is pregnant with their second child. The baby is due in July 2013. The evidence establishes that he is a loving and supporting husband and a dedicated family man. For some time since the offences he has been the primary carer for his son, his wife having paid employment.

213I accept that there were disadvantages in his background and that he consistently demonstrated a capacity for sustained hard work. 

214I accept, as I have indicated, that the events leading to him being charged with the present offences and the events flowing from the charges have been traumatic to him, his wife and other family members generally. He was referred by his general practitioner to Dr Mark Rowe, consultant psychiatrist. Dr Rowe in his report of 5 November 2012, stated that he considered on the clinical history that according to the DSMIV (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 4th edition) that the Offender most likely has suffered a Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified throughout his adult life and fulfils the criteria for Bipolar Disorder.

215Dr Rowe prescribed a course of medical treatment by way of a mood stabilising medical drug for which he has received some benefit.

216Dr Rowe has recommended that he have access to regular mental health reviews and treatment within the relevant facility if he is to be sentenced to a custodial sentence. 

217The imposition of a custodial sentence of course will adversely impact upon his wife and family. I accept that his family is under significant financial pressure and that their new baby will present additional challenges, his wife presently working four days a week and will be required to take maternity leave. However, I do not consider that such impact can be assessed to be so ""exceptional"" as the established sentencing principles do require before a sentence can be reduced on that account.

218Whilst I take into account in a general sense the media attention in relation to the Hanlong Mining offences (including photographs) and that the Offender has greatly suffered from the public disgrace, shame and humiliation as a result, adverse publicity may only be considered to amount to extra-curial punishment in what may be classed as exceptional or extreme cases. I have concluded that the evidence does not establish that this case rises to that level.

219I also take into account the fact that his guilty pleas to these offences may well effectively mean that he has no re-employment prospects in the finance industry and may otherwise impact adversely on his future employment prospects. 

220I have earlier indicated that the Offender's contrition and remorse is a factor to be taken into account - and in this case it is substantial - and that he has fully accepted his responsibility for his offending. Having regard to those matters, his age, family support and intelligence, I have assessed the prospects of him re-offending as remote. Indeed, on consideration of all the evidence, I consider that he has good rehabilitation prospects.

221This conclusion is reached on the basis of his good character, his plea of guilty, his obvious and genuine contrition and acceptance of responsibility for his offences, and the fact that he has the support of his family. In these circumstances there is little requirement for the sentences to be imposed to reflect the need for personal deterrence. 

222On that subject I should record that I was impressed with the Offender during the course of his oral evidence at the sentencing hearing. His answers were responsive. They were given without prevarication, notwithstanding that some answers given by him were directly against his interests. The impression given throughout his oral evidence was that he deeply regretted the offending and was fully prepared to acknowledge the seriousness of his conduct.

223A number of testimonial statements were tendered in evidence. I have read and taken into account the matters contained in the statements of Mr Robert Steiner, Mr S J Halden, Mr N Lawrence, Mr Z Huang, the affidavit of the Offender's wife sworn 20 November 2012 and the affidavit of Anthony Woods sworn 19 November 2012. They each identify particular qualities of the Offender, including his dedication to family, his capacity for hard work, his generosity and his intellectual capacity. They all testify as to his genuine remorse and contrition.

General Sentencing Factors

224Although the Offender is a comparatively young man, he nonetheless had demonstrated a significant level of intelligence and a degree of maturity, although I accept that his experience in the financial field was, at the time of his employment with Caliburn and Credit Suisse, as I have indicated, limited. He had, however, previous employment, had engaged in trading in the Australian share market and in leveraged products and was married at the age of 24.

225While the Offender's youth and relative immaturity may play a role in downgrading or lessening the importance of general deterrence, I do not consider in the circumstances of the present case that the Offender's level of maturity and experience diminishes the need to give effect to the principle of general deterrence. Indeed, it is important that young adults as well as more mature persons clearly understand that insider trading is a criminal offence and one that can attract significant custodial sentences and substantial fines. 

Increase in the Maximum Penalty for the Offence of Insider Trading

226In relation to the Hanlong Mining offence, I have considered the observations of Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) in R v O'Brien [2011] NSWSC 1553 at [61] and at [69] to [70] and the written submissions on the Offender's behalf and on behalf of the Crown.

227The High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 85 ALJR 195 has emphasised that in determining the sentence to be passed in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. What this Court is not to do is to look for some kind of numerical equivalence by reference to other sentences.

228I have had regard to the increase in penalty which occurred before the Hanlong Mining offending occurred as one of the matters to be taken into account with all other relevant sentencing considerations. 

Assistance/Co-Operation

229The Offender's co-operation with ASIC is a factor which operates in his favour and I take it into account in determining the sentence. However, that said, his co-operation has to be placed in context.

230Prior to his decision to cooperate with ASIC on 13 March 2012, ASIC had been conducting an eight-month investigation into him and others, and the evidence, in particular that of Mr Luxford, establishes that ASIC had expended considerable resources in pursuing those investigations.

231In sentencing the Offender, I take into account the evidence of his past co-operation with ASIC and assistance given, and in the other respects to which I have referred. In my assessment, however, the level of co-operation and assistance, though material, could not be rated as high or exceptional. I have determined that it should be given some weight, mindful as I am that there is a need to ensure that the sentences to be imposed are appropriate to the offending.

232I take into account, as evidence of co-operation, the fact that the Offender, in relation to an application made under the Proceeds of Crime Act, consented to an order under that Act in the sum of $371,348.20 and has paid that amount under the order. 

Future Co-Operation

233I have considered the evidence, including in particular the evidence of Mr Luxford in relation to what has been referred to as future co-operation, and the primary submissions of the Crown at [85]-[87] of those submissions and for the Offender in his Primary Submissions at [128]-[181] and in the Further Submissions for the Offender at [25]-[26]. I have concluded that the Offender is entitled to a combined discount for his guilty plea, being 25% as previously stated, and future assistance, 10%, making a combined discount of 35%. 

Other Matters

234I take into account that upon conviction the Offender is automatically disqualified from managing a corporation for a period of five years under s 206B(1)(i), (2) of the Act. Although provision exists for a court to grant leave to a disqualified person to manage a corporation: s 206G of the Act, it is appropriate for a sentencing court to take the issue of disqualification into account on sentence and note that the disqualification is a matter which is designed to protect the public. I do take that matter into account.

Sentencing Decisions

235I have been provided with submissions on behalf of the Crown and the Offender in relation to decisions and sentencing outcomes in other insider trading cases. The Crown also provided copies of relevant decisions.

236The written submissions for the Offender contain a table of comparisons of the sentencing decisions and the Crown provided a similar document.

237The decisions, of course, can only provide a guide as each case is to be determined on its particular facts and circumstances. I have, however, found the sentencing comparison of use as a general guide.

238In taking into account all the relevant factors, no other conclusion is open other than that the offending in this case, in particular the Caliburn offending and the Hanlong Mining offending, represent serious instances of insider trading. Notwithstanding the Offender's favourable subjective case, given the objective seriousness of the offences and the importance of general deterrence, I have determined that the requirements of s 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) are satisfied and that sentences of full-time imprisonment with time to serve, as I will indicate, are the only appropriate sentences.

Totality

239I am required in accordance with established principles, in particular those enunciated by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and also by the provisions of s 19(2) of the Crimes Act, to determine the appropriate sentence for each offence and the commencement date for each offence. In the course of doing so, I have considered how questions of accumulation or concurrence and totality should be dealt with.

240I have determined that whilst the sentence for the Credit Suisse offence, being the less serious of all the offences, should be concurrent with the sentence to be imposed in respect of the Caliburn offence, the sentence for the Caliburn offence should be served partly concurrently and partly cumulatively with the sentence to be imposed with respect to the Hanlong Mining offence in accordance with the terms of the sentencing orders that I will specify. In that respect I have determined that the sentence for the Hanlong Mining offence should be accumulated by a period of three months on the Caliburn sentence.

241In so doing, I consider the principle of totality will be given effect as is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. I have also determined that in all the circumstances, there is no need to impose a fine. Those circumstances include the Offender's prior good record, his genuine contrition, his good rehabilitation prospects and the punishment to be imposed by the sentencing orders.

242Mr Zhu, would you stand, please.

243Bo Shi Zhu, I sentence you to the following terms of imprisonment: 

(i) In respect of the offences committed by you between 6 November 2006 and 23 November 2007, whilst employed by Caliburn Partnership Pty Ltd, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) and s 1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of six months to commence on 15 February 2013 and to expire on 14 August 2013.

(ii) In respect of the offences committed by you between 21 January 2008 and 9 July 2010, whilst employed by Credit Suisse Management (Australia) Pty Ltd, contrary to s 1043A(1)(d) and s 1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months to commence on 15 February 2013 and to expire on 14 May 2013.

(iii) In respect of the offences committed by you between 17 July 2010 and 29 September 2011, whilst employed by Hanlong Mining Investments Pty Ltd, contrary to the provisions of s 1043A(1)(d) and s 1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of two years to commence on 15 May 2013 and to expire on 14 May 2015. I direct that you be released on 14 May 2014 at the expiration of 12 months of that sentence on a recognisance that you be of good behaviour during the balance of the term upon your giving security in the sum of $1,000 without surety. 

244Accordingly, the total effective pre-release period of imprisonment under the sentences which I have imposed will be a period of 15 months commencing on 15 February 2013 and expiring on 14 May 2014. 

245Would the officers from Corrective Services please escort the Offender.

246Any matters arising? 

247INDYK: No, your Honour.

248HIS HONOUR: Nothing? 

249MANGIONI: Only whether or not in the circumstances of the orders that have been made, whether an intensive correction order might be an appropriate remedy.

250HIS HONOUR: I've determined the matter of sentence. The only alternatives were the ones I have specified and I have sentenced in accordance with a custodial sentence, Mr Mangioni.

251MANGIONI: Thank you, your Honour.

2760947,NAR v PPC1 [2013] NSWCCA 25,"judgment

1HOEBEN JA: I agree with Beech-Jones J. I make no comment in relation to the observations of Adams J since for the reasons set out in [42]-[49] of the judgment of Beech-Jones J, the issue does not arise for consideration in this matter. With legislation of this complexity, I am not prepared to express an opinion based on hypothetical facts.

2ADAMS J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the judgment of Beech-Jones J in draft. I agree with his Honour's reasoning and conclusions, but wish to make the following comments.

3Section 298 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that compulsory processes requiring production of a protected confidence cannot be utilised except with the leave of the court. Section 299D provides that leave cannot be granted unless the protected confidence has ""substantial probative value"" (s 299D(1)(a)), other evidence ""concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates is not available"" (s 299D(1)(b)) and the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the communication is ""substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting"" the material (s 299D(1)(c)). Whether these requirements are satisfied cannot of course be considered, let alone determined, by the court without inspection (except in the most unlikely case that the applicant - which might be either defence or prosecution - is already aware of the contents of the documents sought to be produced and is in a position to establish the requirements of s 299D(1), in which case it would seem that actual production of the documents is unnecessary). Inspection requires production. In the absence of leave, production, even voluntary production, is forbidden by s 298 subject, however, to the power of the court to make an order for production under s 299B. The envisaged procedure seems to be that notice of an application for leave is to be given under s 299C, which should seek an order for production under s 299B. The reason that the documents will almost without exception need to be produced is that, otherwise, it will be impossible for the court to determine the issues prescribed by s 299D. It seems that in this case no order was made and the production of the documents was sought (and made) pursuant to the subpoena, contrary to the Act.

4Speaking generally, it is obvious that the s 299D issues cannot be considered without examining the documents themselves or having sufficient information to make what might be called the statutory inquiries. The practical reality will almost invariably be that the documents have to be examined. That, indeed, was this case. Since reading the material was essential, the learned trial judge, in my respectful view, had a duty to do so, regardless whether or not it was requested. The application for access, which enlivened s 299D, of necessity implied a request to examine the material. (In my view, it should be inferred that his Honour did examine it.) I readily acknowledge that this places a heavy burden on trial judges but it is an inescapable consequence of the draconian terms in which the legislation is drafted. It might be appropriate for the Parliament to consider empowering the judge to give access to counsel for the Crown and defence to examine the material and make submissions (perhaps in writing to preserve confidence) on whether, and in what way, the s 299D tests are or are not satisfied. This would considerably simplify the judge's task. Such access could be subject to non-publication conditions, including a prohibition on disclosing the material to any other persons, including of course, either police or the accused. 

5It was envisaged here that the subpoenaed material contained protected confidences. It was also expected that they would deal with the complainant's psychiatric state both before and after the alleged offence. To perhaps oversimplify somewhat, the applicant sought, and failed - at least at the very early stage at which the matter was argued - to show that this was or was likely to be relevant to the issues in the trial. The sexual incident alleged by the complainant is denied by the applicant and, on the face of it, it is difficult to see what relevance (let alone substantial probative value) the psychological material might have. However, it is plain that the complainant's credit will very much be in issue and it might be that that material contains information which reflects on her credit. Certainly, the extensive use of prohibited drugs is associated with other criminal behaviour undertaken to support what is usually an expensive habit and might well be relevant to credit. Furthermore, on the complainant's own account, her description of what occurred changed significantly by way of adding further very serious assaults following what she described as a ""mental crisis"". This raises several significant issues, of which the most obvious is whether, in fact, she had such a crisis and, if so, its relationship to the further disclosure and, indeed, the earlier non-disclosure. Whether the material deals with these questions is unknown and, even if it did, it might not satisfy the statutory test. All these matters plainly enough required the judge to examine the material for himself. This was all the more necessary as neither the applicant nor the Crown had access to the material and the judge has the overriding duty of ensuring a fair trial. Furthermore, the relevance of the material is not confined to the approach of the Crown to the issues in the trial. If there were information that might substantially affect the credit of the complainant it might well satisfy the s 299D test. In the very nature of things, the applicant could not identify except in the most general terms what that material might be but it is obvious that anything that dealt with the circumstances of the alleged offence or any connected facts might well be disclosable. The mere fact that the Crown would not seek to lead it does not by any means end the matter. On the other hand, it must be stated, in all fairness, that this was not the way in which the matter was put to his Honour and it is not possible, as I think with respect, to conclude that his omission to deal with the application in this light was an error.

6It is self-evident that the fact that the defence case is that no assaults of any kind occurred cannot be regarded as some sort of admission concerning consent. It is an element of the offence that the sexual acts alleged were not consented to. That element, as with all the elements of the offence, is placed in issue by the plea of not guilty. It will be necessary, in due course, for the trial judge to direct the jury as to the onus on the Crown to prove the lack of consent beyond reasonable doubt and point to the evidence that goes to the issue. It is completely legitimate for the defence to argue that, even if the jury is satisfied that the sexual acts occurred, it would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to them and, for that purpose both to cross-examine the complainant and adduce evidence that went to that issue, including evidence that went to her credit (subject to the provisions of Part 3.7, Division 2 of the Evidence Act 1995). Undertaking such a course is, for obvious reasons, fraught with danger but it is one that the applicant is entitled to take. Accordingly, if there were protected material that reflected on this issue and it satisfied the s 299D tests, it should be disclosed even if, as it were, the principal defence is that the sexual incidents did not occur at all. I mention this because of the potential materiality of the previous abuse suffered by the complainant. Of course, this would bring into play the provisions of Part 3.10, Division 1B of the Evidence Act 1995. The possible relevance of some of the confidential material to the issue of consent was raised by the applicant in reference to the significance of the alleged earlier sexual abuse. For myself, I would accept that the judge did examine the material in respect of this submission but found, if there was a relevant confidence, it did not satisfy the s 299D tests.

7BEECH-JONES J: This is an application under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against the refusal by the District Court to grant the applicant access to certain documents produced to the Court under subpoena. The District Court was not satisfied that the criteria for the grant of leave set out s 299D(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act was made out.

8On 26 April 2012 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing four counts. One count accused him of indecent assault, contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900. The other three counts allege that he sexually assaulted his victim without her consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. All of the offences are alleged to have taken place on 25 November 2010. 

9After the applicant was arraigned he caused subpoenas to be issued to four named hospitals and the Department of Family and Community Services for all their records concerning the complainant (""PPC1""). He did not seek the leave of the Court to issue the subpoenas. It appears that material was produced in response. The applicant sought leave to access this material. His application was initially listed for 4 July 2012. The application was adjourned and ultimately heard and refused on 20 August 2012. He filed his application for leave to appeal that refusal in September 2012.

10The applicant's trial was listed for hearing on 8 October 2012. It was adjourned as a result of the making of this application. It has now been listed for 11 March 2013. 

11Between the time this application was filed and the time it was heard, this Court published its judgment in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266. KS v Veitch (No 2) construed the provisions in issue on this application, namely those found within Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Court in KS v Veitch (No 2) rejected a challenge to the constitutional validity of those provisions. The challenge to the constitutional validity of the provisions is renewed by some of the proposed grounds of appeal accompanying this application.

12Both the Director of Public Prosecutions and PPC1 were made respondents to the application for leave. They were both represented at the hearing. There was no issue raised as to whether the Director had standing to be a party to the application. The Attorney General of New South Wales also intervened to make submissions in respect of the proposed constitutional challenge. 

Leave to appeal

13Before addressing the merits of the application it is necessary to note that there are a number of matters at the outset which militate against the grant of the application for leave to appeal. 

14First, one of the principal reasons for subjecting appeals from interlocutory orders in criminal cases to a requirement to obtain leave is to prevent or minimise the fragmentation of the process of criminal justice (see R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31 at [23] and the cases there cited). As I have stated one trial date has already been vacated due to this application and another trial date looms. 

15Second, the refusal of his Honour to grant leave does not represent any final determination of the applicant's rights. In particular, as I will explain, it is open to the applicant to renew the application for access if an appropriate basis emerges. 

16Third, if the application is refused and no further application for production or access is made the applicant's remedies will not be exhausted. If he is convicted and it emerges that he was wrongly denied access to materials on subpoena he maybe able to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice (see KS v Veitch [2012] NSWCCA 186 (""KS v Veitch (No 1)"") at [42] per Beech-Jones J; and Alister v R (1983) 154 CLR 404). 

17Generally, leave to appeal an interlocutory decision in a matter such as this should not readily be granted, unless an appropriate case is made out of an error of principle which is apt to cause an irregularity or injustice (see Queanbeyan City Council v Environment Protection Authority [2011] NSWCCA 108 at [25] per Whealey JA, with whom Hall and McCallum JJ agreed, citing R v Van Phu Huo (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 July 1994, unreported).

18In my view, and leaving aside the constitutional challenge, the critical question for this application is whether a sufficiently strong case has been shown that there was an error of principle on the part of his Honour which would warrant an interference with the continued prosecution of these proceedings in the District Court. In relation to those grounds that raise a constitutional challenge, I consider that the critical question is whether a sufficient basis is shown to warrant a reconsideration of the reasoning or outcome in KS v Veitch (No 2). 

19To address these issues it is first necessary to refer to the statutory regime in Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act and his Honour's judgment before addressing the proposed grounds of appeal. 

Sexual Assault Communications Privilege

20It is necessary to note the following features of the scheme of the sexual assault communications privilege established by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

21First, there is the scope of the privilege itself. It applies to a ""protected confidence"" which is defined by s 296(1) as meaning a ""counselling communication that is made, by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence."" Subsections 296(2) to (5) provide:

""296 What is a protected confidence?

...

(2) A counselling communication is a protected confidence for the purposes of this Division even if it: 

(a) was made before the acts constituting the relevant sexual assault offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or 

(b) was not made in connection with a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence or any condition arising from a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence. 

(3) For the purposes of this section, a communication may be made in confidence even if it is made in the presence of a third party if the third party is present to facilitate communication or to otherwise further the counselling process.

(4) In this section:

counselling communication means a communication:

(a) made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or

(b) made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or

(c) made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or

(d) made in confidence by or to the counsellor, by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling, or has at any time counselled, the person.

(5) For the purposes of this section, a person counsels another person if:

(a) the person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and

(b) the person:

(i) listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or

(ii) advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person,

whether or not for fee or reward.""

22In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [16] to [18] Basten JA noted an apparent tension between ss 296(2) and (4) in that the former suggests an expansion of ""the concept of a protected confidence to include counselling unrelated to the sexual assault offence the subject of the charge, or indeed any sexual assault offence"" whereas the reference to ""harm"" in s 296(4)(a) and (5) appears to confine the concept to the harm suffered by the victim as a result of the alleged offence. In KS v Veitch (No 2) the Court determined the challenge to the constitutional validity of the provisions on the basis that the broader approach was appropriate, especially having regard to s 296(2). No different contention was made on behalf of the applicant in this matter. 

23Second, s 298 provides:

""298 Protected confidences - criminal proceedings

(1) Except with the leave of the court, a person cannot seek to compel (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.

(2) Except with the leave of the court, a document recording a protected confidence cannot be produced in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.

(3) Except with the leave of the court, evidence cannot be adduced in any criminal proceedings if it would disclose a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence.""

24In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [23] Basten JA noted that the tripartite structure of this provision operates to prohibit the issue of a subpoena; the production of a document to the Court in answer to a subpoena; and the adducing of evidence recording or revealing a protected confidence except with a grant of leave. The applicant takes issue with one aspect of the Court's construction of s 298(2) in KS v Veitch (No 2). I will return to consider that matter.

25In both KS v Veitch (No 2) and this case, it appears that the subpoenas were issued without seeking the Court's leave, in contravention of 298(1). This does not have the result that the subpoena must be set aside with immediate effect and all documents produced to the Court returned (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [29] per Basten JA and [88] per Beech-Jones J). Instead, the Court can proceed to consider the next step of whether leave should be granted to allow access to the documents by a party (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [88]). 

26Third, the power of the Court to grant leave to take any of the steps contemplated by s 298 or the granting of access to documents as contemplated by s 299B(3) (see below) is circumscribed by the operation of s 299D, which provides:

""299D Determining whether to grant leave

(1) The court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the court is satisfied that:

(a) the document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced or to be produced or adduced by the party seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and 
(b) other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and

(c) the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm, the court must take into account the following:

(a) the need to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling,

(b) that the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of the confidentiality of the counselling relationship,

(c) the public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling,

(d) that the disclosure of the protected confidence is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person,

(e) whether disclosure of the protected confidence is sought on the basis of a discriminatory belief or bias,

(f) that the adducing of the evidence is likely to infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy.

(3) For the purposes of determining an application for leave under this Division, the court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted.

(4) A court must not disclose or make available to a party (other than the principal protected confider) any confidential statement made to the court under this section by or on behalf of the principal protected confider.

(5) The court must state its reasons for granting or refusing to grant an application for leave under this Division.

(6) If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any application for leave under this Division in the absence of the jury.""

27In this case his Honour was not satisfied that the relevant documents sought to be produced to the applicant would have ""substantial probative value"". Accordingly, his Honour was not satisfied that s 299D(1)(a) was established. His Honour also stated that s 299D(1)(c) was not made out, although I understood that to be a conclusion that his Honour considered followed from the applicant's failure to satisfy s 299D(1)(a). 

28In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [31] Basten JA contrasted s 299D with the accepted test ordinarily applied when parties seek access to documents produced under subpoena, namely whether a ""legitimate forensic purpose"" for their production has been demonstrated. His Honour noted that the effect of these provisions is that there will be a ""significant reduction in the material which might be made available to the accused"" (at [32]). 

29One particular constraint upon the concept of ""substantive probative value"" in this context is that, while the material sought concerned might relate only to the credibility of the complainant, s 299D(1)(a) was nevertheless concerned with admissible material. The restrictions on the admissibility of material concerning a complainant's sexual experience or lack of it as found in s 293 also engage s 299D(1) (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [37]). 

30Fourth, in some circumstances a question will arise as to whether a document that is sought to be subpoenaed or has been provided to the Court does record a protected confidence. In that regard s 299B provides:

""299B Determining if there is a protected confidence

(1) If a question arises under this Division relating to a document or evidence, a court may consider the document or evidence.

(2) If there is a jury, the document or evidence is to be considered in the absence of the jury.

(3) A court must not make available or disclose to a party (other than a protected confider) any document or evidence to which this section applies (or the contents of any such document) unless:

(a) the court determines that the document does not record a protected confidence or that the evidence would not disclose a protected confidence, or

(b) a party has been given leave under this Division in relation to the document or evidence and making available or disclosing the document or evidence is consistent with that leave.

(4) A court may make any orders it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document or evidence under this section.

(5) This section has effect despite sections 297 and 298.""

31I consider the powers conferred by ss 299B(1) and (4) below. The combination of ss 299B(1) and 299B(3)(a) confirm that a Court can ""consider"" a document for itself before determining whether it records a ""protected confidence"". A Court can also make such a document available to a ""protected confider"" without the necessity of considering whether the criteria for the grant of leave in s 299D have been satisfied. Further s 299B(3)(b) confirms that the preconditions for the grant of leave specified in s 299D must be satisfied before access to produced documents recording a protected confidence can be granted to a party, ""other than a protected confider"". ""Protected confider"" is defined in s 295 and relevantly includes the ""victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence by, to or about whom a protected confidence is made."" No doubt it extends to their legal representative.

His Honour's judgment

32At the hearing of the application his Honour was provided with a copy of the Crown case statement, two statements from the complainant and a statement from a counsellor, who had treated the complainant for a number of years. The complainant's second statement recorded aspects of the sexual assaults alleged to have been committed by the applicant that were not recorded in the first statement. In her first statement the complainant also disclosed that she had been sexually abused by her stepfather from the age of 10 or 11 to the age of 17 years, but that she did not report those assaults to the police. 

33The counsellor stated, inter alia, that the complainant had a history of self-harm and had, on multiple occasions, been admitted to mental health facilities for reasons relating to self-harm. There was other material before his Honour which indicated that the complainant has had a number of admissions to various hospitals for psychiatric treatment, including the hospitals that received the subpoenas the subject of the application for access. 

34In the judgment refusing access, his Honour identified what was said by the applicant before him to be the three issues to which the documents sought related. The first issue was whether the complainant suffered psychological injury as a result of the alleged assault, as she claimed in her first statement. 

35The second issue was whether the complainant was sexually assaulted by her stepfather, and if so what harm or damage she suffered. The applicant contended that this was an issue because, in her first statement, the complainant recounts that she told her previous case worker that she was submissive to the applicant, not because she was consenting, but because of the effects of prior sexual abuse. 

36The third issue was said to be whether the complainant had suffered a ""mental crisis"" sometime after 25 November 2010, and if so what was its cause. This was said to be an issue because in her second statement the complainant explained that, after her first statement, she had suffered a ""mental crisis"" and that as a result she had decided to tell all that had happened on the day of the alleged sexual assault. 

37His Honour recorded that counsel for the applicant advised that the issue in the trial was whether sexual intercourse had taken place at all. 

38In relation to the first issue his Honour noted that the Crown did not intend to lead evidence that the complainant suffered psychological injuries as a result of the alleged assault by the applicant. His Honour contrasted this case with the Crown case considered in JAD v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 73 where the psychological condition of the complainant was relied on by the Crown as rebutting a suggestion that the evidence was a fantasy or contrived (JAD at [13]). 

39In relation to the second issue his Honour was not satisfied that there was any relevant link between the nature of the treatment undertaken in the past by the complainant and the issue of consent. His Honour added that the question in the trial was not consent but whether the act occurred at all. 

40In relation to all of the matters relied on by the applicant, his Honour found that he was not satisfied that there was ""any relevant connection between the material sought and any issue in the trial such as that the material has substantial probative value"". As I have stated, his Honour was not satisfied that s 299D(1)(a) was established and appears to have concluded that it followed that the applicant failed to satisfy s 299D(1)(c). 

Proposed Grounds of Appeal - Alleged error on his Honour's part

41Consistent with the approach outlined above I will address the proposed grounds of appeal which allege error by his Honour in refusing the application. I will then address the constitutional challenge.

Ground 1A: Alleged failure to inspect the subpoenaed material 

42Proposed ground 1A contends that his Honour erred in failing to inspect the subpoenaed material in order to determine whether it recorded protected confidences.

43It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, whilst it was reasonable to assume that most medical records relating to suicide attempts may contain a ""protected confidence"", his Honour should nevertheless have inspected the documents to determine whether the entirety of the documents that were produced recorded protected confidences. In particular it was contended that, before his Honour determined to apply the criteria stated in s 299D, his Honour needed to be satisfied that the communications were made ""in confidence""; that all parts of the medical records related to counselling communications; and that counselling took place that satisfied s 296(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The applicant contended that, unless those issues were determined adversely to him, Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 was not engaged. If they were not, then the general law's less stringent test of whether the applicant had a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking access was applicable. 

44In my view, this complaint has no substance. His Honour was not asked to determine whether or not the documents recorded a ""protected confidence"". Instead his Honour was only asked to determine an application to access documents recording protected confidences. Thus at the outset Counsel for the applicant stated to his Honour that it was ""an application to gain access to protected confidences"". Further, his Honour was provided with an eight page submission from the applicant entitled ""Application for leave under s 299D of the Criminal Procedure Act ..."". The balance of those submissions were exclusively directed to that topic and did not make any reference to any need for his Honour to first determine whether the documents recorded a ""protected confidence"". 

45None of the parties invited his Honour to review the documents much less to first determine whether Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 was applicable. At one point Counsel for the applicant did state to his Honour that the documents sought ""could contain protected confidences"" but that was not accompanied by any request for access to those documents which did not.

46In my view the applicant does not have any prospects of demonstrating that it was erroneous for his Honour to only address the application that was made. Similarly it was not erroneous for his Honour to fail to review the documents individually when he was not requested to do so. 

47In addition, a factual assumption upon which this proposed ground is based is that his Honour did not consider the documents for himself. There is no material capable of establishing that as a fact. To the contrary, in his judgment his Honour referred to his having ""considered the material"". This could be a reference not only to the material that was placed before his Honour by the parties, but it could also be a reference to the material produced on subpoena. The Court was advised that the recollections of counsel who appeared differed as to whether his Honour inspected the documents in court. This difference does not matter as his Honour may have reviewed them in his chambers. 

48It is the applicant who alleges that that his Honour did not consider the material and he therefore bears the onus of proving it. He has no prospects of doing so.

49For the sake of completeness I note that it follows from what has been stated above that it is open to the applicant to make a further application to the District Court for production or access to so much of the material that was previously subpoenaed that does not record a ""protected confidence"". In considering such an application the Court is entitled to ""consider"" the material for itself (s 299B(1)) which clearly includes reading it. Also, as I have stated, the leave requirements in ss 298 and 299D do not preclude the Court from making the material available to the ""protected confider"" (or their legal representative) (s 299B(3)).

Ground 1B: Consent by the complainant to production

50Proposed Ground 1B asserts that his Honour erred in refusing access to the material in that the applicant contends that leave under s 298(2) was not required because the complainant had given consent to its disclosure within the meaning of s 300 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 300 of the Criminal Procedure Act specifies an exception as to the circumstance in which leave is required. It provides:

""300 Effect of consent

(1) This Division does not prevent the production of any document recording a protected confidence or the adducing of evidence disclosing a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence, in, or in connection with, any proceedings, if the principal protected confider to whom the proceedings relate has consented to the production of the document or adducing of the evidence.

(2) Consent is not effective for the purposes of this section unless:

(a) the consent is given in writing, and

(b) the consent expressly relates to the production of a document or adducing of evidence that is privileged under this Division or would be so privileged except for a limitation or restriction imposed by this Division."" 

51The evidentiary basis for the suggestion that the complainant provided her consent is said to be a paragraph in her second statement stating: ""I give police permission to access and copy all of my medical records"".

52The question of what obligation would be imposed on the police if they were to receive copies of documents recording protected confidences is a large one. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to determine it on this application. For present purposes, all that need be noted is that this form of ""consent"" is not one that satisfies s 300(2)(b). Such a consent must expressly relate to material that is privileged under Division 2 of Part 5. In this case the complainant only agreed to disclose her ""medical records"" which are not necessarily the same as documents privileged under Division 2 of Part 5. 

53Further to satisfy s 300(2) any such consent must expressly relate to the ""production of a document or adducing of evidence"". This requires, inter alia, the provision of an express written consent to the production of documents at least to, and most probably via, the Court, or the adducing of the documents in evidence. The critical aspect of such a consent is that it is an agreement for both parties to view the material. It is not sufficient that, at the investigative stage, the complainant may have agreed to their production to and copying by only the prosecution or some other entity or organisation such as the police. 

54Further I note that no argument to this effect was raised before the trial judge. 

55This proposed ground does not raise a matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 1: Alleged failure to find the subpoenaed material had substantial probative value

56Proposed ground of appeal 1 contends that his Honour erred in finding that the material sought did not have substantial probative value on the basis that ""it would only become relevant if the prosecution sought to rely upon subsequent treatment or counselling of the complainant as corroborative evidence"". 

57As formulated this ground misconceives his Honour's reasons. His Honour did not deny the relevance of the material sought, but instead applied the more stringent test of whether it had ""substantial probative value"". Further, his Honour did not state that the material would ""only"" be made available if the prosecution sought to rely upon the complainant's treatment as corroborative of her evidence that she was assaulted by the applicant. Instead, his Honour noted that, in circumstances where that was not part of the Crown case and it was the defence's case that sexual assault did not occur, his Honour was not satisfied that the material sought concerning counselling subsequent to the assault had substantive probative value. I see no error of principle in that approach. 

58The balance of the submissions advanced in support of this proposed ground simply seek to reargue the conclusions that his Honour reached in not being satisfied of the criteria in s 299D(1)(a) was satisfied. They do not identify any error of principle that would warrant a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 2: Alleged failure to consider the defence case

59Proposed ground 2 asserts that his Honour erred in addressing the question of substantial probative value on ""the assumption that the case would be run as presently intended by the prosecution in isolation from how the case may be run by the defence"". In particular it was submitted that his Honour did not have regard to the possibility that the defence may require the prosecution to call or lead evidence in the prosecution case, otherwise not relied upon by the prosecution. 

60This proposed ground also has no substance. The approach adopted by his Honour was to treat the issue of substantial probative value having regard to the way that he was advised that the Crown case was to be conducted and what he was advised the defence would be, namely, that sexual intercourse did not occur. 

61His Honour clearly contemplated the possibility that the issues may develop and change. For example his Honour stated:

""It is not presently part of the Crown case that any subsequent psychological treatment is relevant to any issue in the Crown case against the accused. Should the Crown seek to rely on the complainant's attendance [at] counselling as corroboration of her allegations against the accused then the present application can be renewed.""

62Thus, his Honour was cognisant of the possibility that the Crown case may change, and was also aware that the application could then be renewed and the question of substantive probative value assessed at that time. 

63This proposed ground does not raise a matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 3: Alleged failure to consider the complainant's medical history

64Ground 3 complains that his Honour erred in determining the probative value of the material to which access was sought, without properly considering the relevance of the complainant's known medical history. This known medical history was said to be relevant to the reliability of her claimed memory recall, and her motivation. 

65The particulars to this ground assert that it was ""not in dispute"" that the complainant had in the past complained of symptoms such as hearing voices, that she had reported using illicit drugs, that she had been scheduled upon her admission to various hospitals and that she had suicidal tendencies. I will not pause to address whether or not those matters were or are ""in dispute"". 

66The critical point is that this aspect of the application raises an entirely new basis for granting access to the produced documents. I have set out above the issues which the applicant identified as being the basis on which the documents were sought. None of them come close to the basis now formulated for this ground of appeal which appears to be directed towards an assertion that the complainant's medical history renders her a fantasist. An application for leave to appeal an interlocutory order is not an appropriate forum to raise a new basis for seeking access to documents. 

67This proposed ground does not demonstrate any error of principle on the part of his Honour, or otherwise raise any matter warranting the granting of leave to appeal. 

Ground 4: Alleged failure to consider s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act

68Proposed ground 4 complains that his Honour erred in finding that the material to which access was sought did not have substantial probative value, without having regard to s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section s 293(6) provides:

""293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience

...

(6) If the court is satisfied:

(a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:

(i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or

(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and

(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication,

the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.""

69The applicant contends that it was incumbent on his Honour to assess the question of substantial probative value on the basis that the complainant's statements disclosed that she had been the subject of similar sexual assaults at the hand of another identifiable perpetrator, who has not been prosecuted. 

70No submission concerning s 293(6) was made to his Honour. To the extent that this proposed ground has any connection to the issues identified before his Honour as a basis for the production of the documents it appears to relate to the second issue, namely, was the complainant sexually assaulted by her step-father? His Honour rejected the contention that this issue warranted the granting of access to documents on the basis that he had been advised that the issue was not consent, but instead whether or not sexual intercourse had taken place. 

71On this application, the Crown disclaimed any contention that the presentation of its case would involve it disclosing or implying that the complainant had, or may have had, a general or specified sexual experience. Nothing in the Crown case statement supports any suggestion that it would attempt to lead evidence to that effect. In those circumstances this proposed ground does not raise any matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal.

Constitutional Arguments

Ground 5: Function vested by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 repugnant to the integrity of State Courts 

72Proposed ground 5 contends that ss 298(1) and 298(2) are constitutionally invalid because the terms of s 299D imposing restrictions on the grant of leave require the Court to perform a task that it is said it cannot perform. In particular it is said that s 299D(1) cannot be applied at the stage of issuing a subpoena because the section requires consideration of the documents sought but that cannot occur as they have not yet been produced to the court. This ""problem"" is said to be accentuated by the fact that it is likely that in many cases the same source will produce some documents that do record a protected confidence and some that do not. The applicant contends that this means that a Court cannot know when it approaches the issue of whether or not to grant leave to issue a subpoena whether it is acting under s 298(1) and must apply the criteria in s 299D as it will not have the documents necessary to resolve that issue. The reposing of such a task on a court is said to be ""repugnant to the nature of the judicial power of a court or the institutional integrity of courts in [New South Wales] which are repositories of Federal judicial power"". 

73A similar argument was initially raised, but not pursued in KS v Veitch (No 2) (at [10(a)] per Basten JA). In any event, the premise of the argument was rejected in KS v Veitch (No 2). If a Court determining an application for leave to issue a subpoena which appears to attract the operation of s 298(1) considers that it is necessary to review the material sought to be produced then it has power under s 299B(4) to make an order requiring the production of the material sought to itself (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [28] and [85]). My judgment in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [85] addressed the logistics as to how that might occur. The applicant's submissions did not address this aspect of KS v Veitch (No 2) much less identify why it might warrant reconsideration.

74The applicant filed supplementary submissions challenging one aspect of KS v Veitch (No 2) which was said to be relevant to this proposed ground of appeal, namely the conclusion that s 298(2) is not directed to production to a party but rather to constraining production by a holder of documents containing a protected confidence to the Court (at [23] per Basten JA). The only real support for the applicant's contention is to be found in my reasons in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [88] where I referred to allowing ""production of the document to a party under s 298(2)"". On reflection I agree with Basten JA and Hall J on this issue. The question of granting leave to obtain access is addressed by s 299B(3). In any event, I see no reason to reopen this aspect of KS v Veitch (No 2). It would make no difference to the outcome of this ground which, as I have explained, is premised on a point that was comprehensively rejected by the Court in KS v Veitch (No 2).

75The submissions in support of proposed ground 5 do not raise any matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 6: Kable

76Ground 6 contends that Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act is invalid because the conditional prohibition found within s 299D is beyond the legislative power of the parliament of New South Wales. It is submitted that the effect of s 299D is that it is a direction to judicial officers to ""act in a manner which will lead to both an unfair judicial process and ultimately an unfair trial"". The applicant's submissions refer to a number of decisions concerning the operation of Chapter III of the Constitution and then rely on the High Court's decision in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 and the cases that have considered that decision. It is submitted that ""the legislature cannot impair the institutional integrity of a court"". The applicant asserts that Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 and especially s 299D effects such an impairment. 

77The same argument was considered and rejected in KS v Veitch (No 2). In that case the contention was that:

""39 ... although the offences arose under State law in a State court, their effect was to deprive State courts of a characteristic essential to their continued operation as repositories of federal jurisdiction under Ch III of the Constitution. Thus Ch III imposed a constitutional restraint on the power of a State to vary traditional procedures operating in the conduct of criminal trials if to do so would render such trials unfair.""

78This contention was rejected by the Court in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [63] to [67] per Basten JA (with Harrison J and myself agreeing): 

""63 Three factors are critical to the proper disposal of the constitutional challenge. First, the law in question is a State law relating to evidence and procedure which does not (and cannot) apply of its own force in federal jurisdiction. Accordingly it does not directly engage principles regarding the scope of federal judicial power. The cases in which a challenge has been raised to the constitutional validity of a law limiting the availability of commonly used procedures, or rules of evidence, have arisen in federal jurisdiction. Their application in relation to State jurisdiction is less clear, not only because the doctrine of the separation of powers has a different operation under State law, but because their relationship with aspects of the separation of powers is indirect.

64 Secondly, because it is a law relating to evidence and procedure, it stands squarely within the power of the Parliament with respect to the regulation of criminal trials. It reflects a public policy which has received greater attention and emphasis in recent years than in earlier times, but is arguably a product of more enlightened attitudes towards the victims of sexual offences and the importance of balancing the legitimate interests of the accused against the legitimate interests of victims of sexual assaults. The law is neither arbitrary nor manifestly disproportionate in its response to a perceived weakness in traditional trial procedure: cf Williamson at 117 (Isaacs J).

65 Thirdly, as noted by Gummow J in Nicholas, its effect may be to make it more difficult for an accused person in certain circumstances to defend himself. Nevertheless, to protect the confidences as between the victim and a counsellor is not to deprive the accused of some source of information to which he is presumptively entitled. Nor is the exclusion of protected confidences a law which would tend to bring the criminal trial process into disrepute.

66 There are other areas of the law where public interests justify exclusion of documents or other information from disclosure in criminal or civil proceedings. Obvious examples are public interest immunity (which may extend to national security or to the identify of police informers) and client legal privilege (which covers communications between client and lawyer). In some jurisdictions protection is given to doctor/patient communications generally (therapeutic privilege), to priest and penitent communications and to those providing information to journalists. Such matters illustrate the acceptance that the interest of the courts in determining proceedings, including criminal proceedings, on all available evidence must in some circumstances be qualified to the protection of other public interests. The protection of sexual assault communications involves a balance of policies which has been determined in a particular way by the State Parliament and in which, subject to constitutional constraints, the court should not interfere. 

67 The final step in the argument is the proposition that, although the choice was one available to the State Parliament, the imposition of the privilege diminishes the character of a State court in which it must be applied in such a way as to render the court an inappropriate vehicle for the reception of federal jurisdiction. Because the Commonwealth has no direct interest in regulating sexual offences within a State, it is largely hypothetical to ask whether the sexual assault communications privilege could be adopted as part of Commonwealth law. However, for the reasons given above, there is no reason to suppose that it would impinge unconstitutionally on the exercise of federal judicial power if the Commonwealth sought to protect victims of sexual assault from disclosure of counselling confidences. Accordingly the constitutional challenge must fail."" (emphasis added)

79The applicant's supplementary submissions takes issue with this analysis. The applicant (respectfully) submits that Basten JA was in error in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [63] in stating that the provisions in questions involve ""a State law relating to evidence and procedure which does not (and cannot) apply of its own force in federal jurisdiction"". He notes that such state laws will apply to the exercise of federal jurisdiction by the operation of s 79(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). This submission only demonstrates the correctness of Basten JA's analysis. When a state law is picked up and applied by s 79(1) of the Judiciary Act it is not applying ""of its own force"". 

80The applicant's submissions on this ground also instance examples of Commonwealth offences which, if prosecuted in New South Wales courts, may engage Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act (eg sexual slavery and servitude: s 270.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)). He submits that, with such prosecutions, the state law, being Division 2 of Part 5, ""would apply in that context"". Nothing in KS v Veitch (No 2) suggests to the contrary. The applicant also submits that Basten JA's ""reference [presumably at [63] of KS v Veitch (No 2)] to the distinct nature of the separation of powers at state level ... is not a basis to hold that the Kable principle does not apply"". Nothing in KS v Veitch (No 2) suggests that the ""Kable principle does not apply"". To the contrary, in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [63] to [67] Basten JA alluded to a potentially different standard of constitutional scrutiny of laws regulating the practice and procedure of state courts exercising federal jurisdiction (ie Kable and the cases that have considered it) compared with laws regulating the practice and procedure of courts established under Chapter III. In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [67] his Honour concluded that Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 met the standard for the latter which had the consequence that it satisfied the standard for the former.

81KS v Veitch (No 2) is a recent and considered judgment of this Court. Nothing in the applicant's submissions on these grounds warrants any reconsideration of it. 

82I propose that the application for leave to appeal be refused.

2760950,R v Fong [2013] NSWDC 48,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Cho San Fong arrived in Australia on 13 March and attempted to leave on 24 March. When he was on the aeroplane, about to leave Australia, he was arrested because Customs officers had examined Mr Fong's luggage that he was to take with him out of Australia. They found a bottle which apparently should have contained some beverage. It is described as a Tru Blue orange crush bottle. When Customs officers examined this they found a brown coloured crystallised liquid which upon presumptive testing proved positive to the presence of methylamphetamine. The net weight of the methylamphetamine was 196.4 grams. Mr Fong has therefore been charged with attempting to export a border controlled drug.

2The prosecution accepts that what Mr Fong told the authorities when he was interviewed is accurate. In particular, he told them that he had brought the ""ice"" as he described the contents of the bottle, into Australia from Hong Kong and was exporting what was left after he had used some of it within Australia. It is accepted that Mr Fong was not going to sell or supply the drug to anyone in Hong Kong which is where he was headed. I will sentence Mr Fong on the basis that he had in his possession that quantity of the methylamphetamine, that he attempted to take it out of the country and he was going to use it all himself over a period of months.

3Mr Fong was originally charged with an offence of attempting to export a marketable quantity. He offered to plead guilty to the charge for which he must now be sentenced. The prosecution at that time did not accept the offer. Matters changed in more recent times with the amended charge being preferred against Mr Fong by way of indictment to which he pleaded guilty today.

4Some discussion ensued this afternoon as I attempted to work out how I could sentence Mr Fong for attempting to export almost 200 grams of methylamphetamine and not breach the rule in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 with a marketable quantity, which is only two grams. As long as I sentence him on the basis that he had available to him the defence in 307(2)(4), as I understand it, I do not breach the rule in De Simoni and that is the approach I will take.

5It is accepted given the events that I have outlined that Mr Fong has now done sufficient time in custody to reflect the circumstances of his offending and his personal circumstances as well. Mr Fong has no criminal history. He is presently fifty-one years of age. His willingness to facilitate the course of justice came at an early stage and it was no fault of his that the prosecution did not accept in the middle of last year what it has now accepted. 

6I note also that the maximum penalty for this offence is two years and that because it is a very rare offence to prosecute, not much assistance is to be gained through examining the statistics in the sentencing information system.

7I am, however, satisfied that the joint approached taken by the parties is correct, namely that Mr Fong has done sufficient time in custody and that he should be released, therefore, immediately. Mr Fong is sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months. The sentence commenced on 24 March 2012, the day he was arrested. I set a recognisance release order which will commence today and continue until the expiration of the sentence.
