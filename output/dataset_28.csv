ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Summary
convictions—Plea of guilty—Whether right to appeal—Conditions precedent for
appeal—Whether accused can change plea on trial de novo—Whether grounds of
appeal must be stated with particularity—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 708(2), 722, 723, 726, 727.

[Page 295]

The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of impaired driving and
was summarily convicted by a magistrate. His appeal was heard and allowed by a
County Court judge notwithstanding the preliminary objections of the Crown that
the notice of appeal was not sufficient. The Crown applied for leave to appeal
to the Court of Appeal, which considered the merits of the case and ruled that
""the said leave and the appeal be and the same are hereby dismissed"".
On the Crown's application for leave to appeal to this Court, the accused
argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not a ""final
judgment"" within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act,
since that Court had not dismissed the appeal but only the application for
leave to appeal.

Held: The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
treated as one dismissing the appeal and leave should be granted.

Held further: The appeal should be allowed and the
conviction restored.

If an accused who has pleaded guilty before a magistrate at
his summary trial is able to comply with the requirements of s. 722, then his
appeal by way of trial de novo under s. 727 ""shall be set down for
hearing before the Appeal Court"", and when he enters the latter Court he
may change his plea if he can satisfy the Appeal Court that there are valid
grounds for his being permitted to do so.

In the present case, the grounds of appeal were not set forth
in such manner as to comply with s. 722. The grounds that ""the magistrate
did not apply the principle as to reasonable doubt as to the evidence"" and
that the ""conviction was contrary to the evidence and to the weight of the
evidence"", were irreconcilable with the accused's plea of guilty. Far from
the conviction being contrary to law, it was the verdict which the law required
the magistrate to enter after the plea of guilty. The setting forth of the
grounds for appeal is a condition precedent to jurisdiction, and there is no
right to a trial de novo under s. 727 upon grounds which are frivolous
or apparently lacking in substance, as was the case here.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a decision of Hanna Co. Ct. J. Appeal
allowed.

J. J. Urie, for the appellant.

K. E. Eaton, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—The respondent
herein, having pleaded guilty, was convicted by G. W. Scott, Esq., Deputy
Police Magistrate in and for the City of Vancouver, on the charge that he unlawfully drove his motor
vehicle on a highway

[Page 296]

while his ability to drive was
impaired and thereupon filed and served a notice of appeal to the County Court
of Vancouver wherein he specified the following grounds of appeal:

(a) That the said
conviction is contrary to law in that the magistrate did not apply the
principle as to reasonable doubt as to the evidence adduced at the said trial;

(b) That the said
conviction is contrary to the evidence and to the weight of the evidence.

Upon the appeal coming on to be
set down for hearing before His Honour, Judge Hanna, Judge of the County Court
of Vancouver, counsel for the Crown raised the following preliminary
objections:

(a) That no grounds
of appeal were in fact disclosed;

(b) That the accused,
having pleaded guilty in the court below, was bound by such plea unless the
grounds of appeal set out special circumstances;

(c) That the said
grounds were not reasonable, certain, adequate or sufficient as required;

(d) That the
principle as to reasonable doubt in connection with the evidence adduced at the
trial before the learned magistrate could not apply because of the plea of
guilty accepted from the accused by the learned magistrate.

Notwithstanding these objections,
the learned County Court judge heard and allowed the appeal, and in due course
counsel for the Attorney-General of British
 Columbia made application for leave to
appeal to the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia upon the following grounds:

1. That the learned County
Court judge was in error in permitting and accepting a plea of not guilty on
the trial de novo after the respondent had pleaded guilty before the
magistrate.

2. That the learned County
Court judge was in error in holding that the grounds set out in the
respondent's Notice of Appeal were reasonable, certain, adequate or sufficient
or were grounds of appeal at all.

This appeal was considered by the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] at the
same time as two others in which kindred questions were raised and a perusal of
the decisions of Sheppard J.A. and Davey J.A. clearly indicates that the merits
of this case were considered by that Court, and the concluding words of Mr.
Justice Sheppard's decision in relation thereto are:

However, for the reasons
given, the grounds of error assigned by the Crown should not succeed and the
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 297]

Some doubt and difficulty has,
however, arisen as a result of the wording of the final clause of the formal
order for judgment granted herein by the Court of Appeal which reads as
follows:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND
ADJUDGE that the said leave to appeal and the appeal be and the same are hereby
dismissed.

Upon application being made for
leave to appeal to this Court, which application was adjourned to the October
sittings thereof, it was argued on behalf of the respondent that the judgment
sought to be appealed from did not dismiss the appeal but rather dismissed the
application for leave to appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and
that as such it was not ""a final or other judgment of the highest court of
final resort in a province … in which judgment can be had in the particular
case sought to be appealed …."" within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Supreme
Court Act and that leave should accordingly be refused.

It is true that the final
paragraph of the formal judgment of the Appeal Court of British Columbia quoted
above is not entirely clear in that it purports to dismiss both the application
for leave to appeal and the appeal itself, but if there be any doubt as to whether
or not this constitutes an order dismissing the appeal then it is permissible
to consider the reasons of the Court to see what was actually done, and it then
becomes apparent that the appeal was heard on its merit and dismissed.

I am of opinion that the judgment
from which leave to appeal is now sought should be treated as one dismissing
the Crown's appeal to the Appeal Court of British Columbia and that such leave
should be granted.

The grounds raised by the present
application are:

1. That the Court of Appeal
erred in holding that having pleaded guilty before the magistrate the accused
had an appeal as of right from his conviction.

2. That the Court of Appeal
erred in holding that the Notice of Appeal to the County Court judge set forth
the grounds of appeal with sufficient particularity as required by s. 722  of
the Criminal Code .

As to the first ground, I agree
with what has been said by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal to the
effect that the words of s. 720  (a) of the Criminal Code 
""the 

[Page 298]

defendant in proceedings under
this Part may appeal to the Appeal Court"" include a defendant who has
pleaded ""guilty"" in the summary conviction Court, but it must be
borne constantly in mind that no defendant can have his appeal set down for hearing
until ""he has complied with section 722 "", and this includes the
preparation of a notice setting forth the grounds of appeal. As will be seen
from what I have said in this Court in the case of Regina v. Dennis[3],
I agree with the learned judges in other Courts (see R. v. Crawford[4]
and R. v. Tennen[5]),
who have held that the ""trial de novo"" for which provision is
made in s. 727 is to be treated as a ""trial"" in the restricted sense
of that word which does not include either arraignment or plea, but I do not
agree with those who consider that this construction precludes a defendant who
has pleaded guilty from asserting an appeal. In my view, if a man who has
entered a guilty plea before the magistrate is able to comply with the
requirements of s. 722 , then his appeal ""shall be set down for bearing
before the Appeal Court"" and when he enters that Court he is in exactly
the same position procedurally as he was immediately after pleading
""guilty"" before the magistrate and before he had been convicted. This
being so, he may change his plea if he can satisfy the Appeal Court
that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so. See Thibodeau
v. The Queen[6],

A discussion of the question
raised by the second ground follows logically from what has just been said
because if the grounds of appeal are not set out in such manner as to comply
with s. 722  then the appeal cannot be set down for hearing under s. 723,

The relevant portion of s. 722 
reads as follows:

where a Notice of Appeal is
taken under section 720 , the appellant shall

(a) prepare a Notice
of Appeal in writing setting forth

(i) with reasonable
certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed
against; and 

(ii) the grounds of appeal; ….

[Page 299]

There has been considerable conflict
of judicial opinion as to the nature of ""grounds of appeal' required by
this section, and in this regard Sheppard J.A., summarizing the view of the
Court of Appeal in this case, has said:

Hence, while in compliance
with section 722  grounds of appeal are to be given, nevertheless by reason of
the nature of the review, the grounds would not appear to be required to be
stated with the same particularity as in appeals in indictable offences where
the Appeal Court is restricted to the record of the proceedings in the lower
Court and where counsel for the respondent is entitled to know specifically the
grounds on which the conviction or dismissed is attacked.

It is true that the grounds of
appeal referred to in s. 722 (1) (a) (ii) need not be ""stated with the same
particularity as in appeals in indictable offences …"" but it must be
remembered that the setting forth of these grounds is one of the acts required
to be done as a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the Appeal Court and
although they require neither nicety of pleading nor expert draftsmanship in
their prepartion it should not be possible to obtain the trial de novo
for which s. 727 provides upon grounds which are frivolous or apparently
lacking in substance.

To appeal as the respondent did
in this case form a conviction founded on a plea of ""guilty"" on the
grounds that the magistrate did not comply with the principle as to reasonable
doubt in connection with the evidence and that the verdict was contrary to the
evidence and the weight of evidence is to present the Appeal Court with a self-evident
contradiction in terms.

Far from the conviction being
contrary to law, it was the verdict which the law required the magistrate to
enter after the plea of ""guilty"" (see s. 708(2) ), and there is,
therefore, no room for the application of the principle of reasonable doubt and
it is idle for a defendant to complain that the conviction was contrary to the
evidence and to the weight of evidence because the conviction was not based on
evidence but on the ""guilty"" plea.

Such grounds are not unacceptable
by reason of lack of particularity but because they are irreconcilable with the
plea in the Court below which is a part of the material to be kept by the clerk
of the Appeal Court with the records of that Court in accordance with the
provisions of s. 726 (1). 

[Page 300]

The plea of ""guilty""
entered in the summary conviction Court concluded against the respondent the
issues raised by the information and after the filing of the notice of appeal
in this case the Court of Appeal was faced with an outstanding plea of
""guilty"" without any reason having been put forward to support an
application for its withdrawal and without any question of law having been
raised to cast doubt on its effect.

The following observations of
Sidney Smith J.A. in R. v. Sanders[7],
although made with reference to the old Code, seem most pertinent to the
circumstances of this case:

On the face of it, there
would seem something anomalous in the law if it allowed an accused person, with
full understanding, to plead ""guilty"" before a magistrate and then,
because he found the sentence unexpectedly heavy, or had unexpected
consequences, or for some other reason having nothing to do with the merits,
allowed him to appeal to the county court and, without explanation,
blandly plead ""not guilty,"" and thus obtain a full trial on the
merits. That seems to be playing fast and loose with the administration of
justice.

(The italics are mine.)

With the greatest respect, it
seems to me that the proceedings before the County Court judge in the present
case constitute an example of the type of procedure to which this quotation
applies.

After an extensive argument had
been presented to the County Court judge and after the proceedings had been
adjourned for consideration of the questions as to whether the accused was
entitled to a trial de novo after a plea of ""guilty"" and as to
the validity of the grounds set forth in the notice of appeal, the following
exchange is reported as having taken place in the County Court:

The COURT: On the objection
raised by Crown counsel before the adjournment that the grounds of appeal were
not disclosed in the notice of appeal, I am holding that clause 1 of the notice
of appeal is sufficient statement of grounds in this particular appeal and I am
not making that as a precedent. I understand the matter is before the Court of
Appeal now—another one—but that is my present decision. I take it that plea is
the same as the Court below?

Mr. DEAN (for the accused):
There will be a plea of not guilty here.

The COURT: What was it in
the Court below?

Mr. DEAN: It was a plea of
guilty in the Court below. Should be another plea taken here.

The COURT: You will waive
the reading of the information and plead not guilty?

[Page 301]

Mr. DEAN: Yes.

The COURT: Where is your
client?

Mr. DEAN: Right here. Stand
up, please.

The COURT: This is for
impaired driving.

Mr. MACKOFF (for the Crown):
May it please your honor, the Court of Appeal in a decision handed down just
last week in the case of Baumer ruled that on these appeals apparently the
reading of the information is a prerequisite now.

The COURT: Is a what?

Mr. MACKOFF: It is required
to have a reading of the charge.

The COURT: In spite of the
waive?

Mr. MACKOFF: In spite of the
waive. Apparently that is a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.

The COURT: Well, this is
under the Criminal Code , is it not?

Mr. MACKOFF: Yes, your
honor, section 223.

The COURT: He should be in
the box. Read the charge.

The accused was accordingly
arraigned and permitted to plead ""not guilty"" without any reason
being given to support his change of plea. This quotation indicates that the
learned County Court judge erred in determining the validity of the notice of
appeal without any reference to the nature of the plea in the summary
conviction Court with the result that he upheld the validity of a ground of
appeal alleging that a conviction made pursuant to the mandatory provisions of
s. 708(2)  of the Criminal Code  and without taking evidence was contrary
to law in that the principle of reasonable doubt was not applied in connection
with the evidence.

From all the above it will be
seen that I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal did not err in holding that
the accused had an appeal as of right from his conviction subject to compliance
with s. 722 , but that I have concluded that the same Court did err in holding
that the notice of appeal to the County Court judge in this case set forth
""the grounds of appeal"" as required by s. 722(1)  (a) (ii) of
the Criminal Code .

I would accordingly allow the
appeal and set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the County
Court of Vancouver.

[Page 302]

The result is that the conviction
entered by the learned magistrate is restored.

Appeal allowed;
conviction restored.

Jury trial—Ex parte case—Whether plaintiff entitled to
jury trial—Whether inscription for hearing only sufficient—Code of Civil
Procedure, arts. 421, 423.

A trial by jury may be had in ex parte cases. The
application to have a case placed on the special roll for trial by jury must be
made within ten days following the inscription for proof and hearing, whether
the issue has been joined or whether the case proceeds ex parte. The
Code does not require the prior filing of the pleadings.

An inscription for trial using the word ""audition""
alone and omitting the word ""enquête"" is a sufficient inscription
within the meaning of art. 423 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Appeal dismissed.

G. Emery and P. Forest, for the
defendants, appellants.

L. Corriveau, for the plaintiff, respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau
J.:—La demanderesse-intimée Dame Beatrice Rekosh Kleinberg a réclamé
personnellement de la demanderesse-appelante Dumont Express Limitée et de
Raphaël Guillemette, la somme de $60,000, et une somme additionnelle de $69,212.15 en sa qualité de tutrice à ses enfants mineurs. Elle allègue que le ou
vers le 7 mai 1958, alors que son époux Isaac Kleinberg était l'un des occupants dans
une voiture automobile, celle-ci fut frappée par un camion, propriété de
l'appelante Dumont Express Limitée et conduite par l'autre appelant Raphaël
Guillemette qui,

[Page 618]

à ce moment, était dans l'exercice de ses
fonctions comme employé de Dumont Express Limitée. A la suite de cet accident,
ledit Kleinberg est décédé.

Les appelants ont comparu par le ministère de
leurs procureurs, mais défaut a été enregistré contre eux parce que le
plaidoyer n'avait pas été produit dans les délais légaux. La cause;
a en conséquence été inscrite ex parte et, s'autorisant de l'art. 421 du Code de procédure civile, la
demanderesse, vu qu'il s'agissait d'une action en recouvrement de dommages
résultant d'un quasi-délit, a demandé un procès par jury. La demanderesse a
également fait signifier dans les délais prévus à l'art. 423 une requête demandant que le cause soit
placée sur le rôle spécial des procès par jury. Lors de l'audition de cette
requête, les procureurs de l'appelante se sont opposés à ce que la cause soit
entendue par un jury, et le savant juge a rejeté la requête parce que
l'inscription, au lieu d'avoir été faite pour enquête et audition ex parte, ne
l'avait été seulement que pour audition ex parte. La Cour du banc de la
reine2 a unanimement renversé ce jugement et a
décidé que l'omission du mot ""enquête"" lors de l'inscription ne vicie
pas celle-ci, et que le mot ""audition"" seul était suffisant.

Elle a de plus décidé une autre question qui
avait été soulevée en Cour supérieure, mais sur laquelle il n'y avait pas eu
d'adjudication, à l'effet qu'il peut y avoir lieu à un procès par jury, même
lorsqu'il n'y a pas de contestation écrite et que la cause est inscrite ex
parte.

Je crois que la Cour du banc de la reine a
bien jugé en décidant que l'omission du mot ""enquête"" dans l'avis
d'inscription ne constituait pas une erreur fatale. Comme elle je suis
d'opinion qu'il faut préférer le libre exercice d'un droit à l'application d'un
formalisme trop exagéré.

La demanderesse-intimée avait droit à un
procès par jury. Ce droit lui est conféré par l'art. 421
C.P., mais rien dans le Code ne défend ce recours, même si
la cause est inscrite ex parte. Il serait trop facile à un défendeur de
ne pas produire son plaidoyer et de laisser procéder ex parte, pour
priver le demandeur de son droit de faire déterminer par un jury le sort de sa
réclamation. Ce n'est pas ce que veut la loi.

[Page 619]

Quand, en vertu de l'art. 421 C.P., le demandeur peut exiger un procès
par jury, il doit dans les dix jours de l'inscription pour enquête et audition,
que la contestation soit liée ou que l'on procède ex parte, demander par
requête que la cause soit placée sur le rôle spécial des procès par jury (423 C.P.). Cette demande ne peut être faite
qu'après l'inscription, et le Code ne dit pas qu'il faut que le plaidoyer écrit
ait été produit.

Il est nécessaire de ne pas oublier qu'avant 1954, date où le Code de procédure a été
amendé, la situation pouvait être différente, car l'ancien art. 293 C.P. stipulait que seules les causes qui ne
devaient pas être instruites devant un jury pouvaient être inscrites pour
preuve et audition, mais la loi est maintenant changée et l'ancienne
jurisprudence ne trouve plus son application.

Pour les raisons ci-dessus, et pour celles
données par MM. les Juges Casey, Rinfret et Choquette, je crois que le présent appel, doit être rejeté avec
dépens.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Trial—Practice—Jury sent back to reconsider
their answers to questions submitted to them—Whether course followed by trial
judge a proper one.

In the course of a trial in a motor
negligence action certain questions were submitted to the jury. The trial judge
was dissatisfied with the answers and, without referring to counsel, instructed
the jury to reconsider their findings. On the second set of answers judgment
was given dismissing the action with costs. The Court of Appeal, by a majority,
who were of opinion that the course followed by the trial judge was not a
proper one, allowed the plaintiff’s appeal and directed a new trial. The
defendant then appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.

The first set of answers, read in the light
of the evidence and of the charge, made it apparent that the jury had failed to
grapple with the essential point which they were required to determine. In
these circumstances, the trial judge had the power and it was his duty to
instruct the jury to reconsider their answers. Napier v. Daniel and Welsh,
(1837), 6 L.J.C.P. 62 at 63, and Regina v. Meany, (1862), 9 Cox C.C. 231
at 233, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], reversing a
judgment of Wells J. and directing a new trial. Appeal allowed.

A.T. Hewitt, Q.C., and J.L. Nesbitt, for
the defendant, appellant.

D. Boyle, for the plaintiff, respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment
of of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, by a majority, allowed the
plaintiff’s appeal from a judgment of Wells J. dismissing the action and
directed a new trial; Schroeder J.A. dissenting, would have dismissed the
appeal.

[Page 603]

The action was for damages for personal injuries
suffered by the respondent in a collision between a motor car owned and driven
by one Menard, in which the respondent was a passenger carried gratuitously,
and a motor car owned and driven by the appellant.

The collision occurred in the City of Ottawa at
the intersection of Laurier Avenue and Waller Street, on September 26,
1955, at about 6.30 a.m. Laurier Avenue runs east and west; Waller Street runs
north and south. The movement of traffic at this intersection is
controlled by signal lights, as provided by s. 41(2) of the Highway Traffic
Act, R.S.O. 1950 c. 167. The car in which the respondent was carried was
being driven south on Waller Street and the appellant was driving west on
Laurier Avenue. Each driver claimed that he entered the intersection with
the green signal light in his favour and the crucial question was as to which
of them was right in this assertion. The evidence of the two drivers on this
point was definite and in direct conflict. One of them must have been mistaken.

In the course of an admirable charge the learned
trial judge repeatedly impressed upon the jury that their main task was to
decide which driver had the traffic light in his favour. He said, for example:—

You will have to decide which of these
stories you believe, that is the key to this case, because whoever did not have
the green light was negligent, I think it is as simple as that.

* *
*

There is a concrete wall apparently 8 feet
high obscuring vision until you are fairly close to the intersection, but if
Menard had a green light, even if he saw Herd coming along, he was entitled to
proceed through and entitled to assume Herd would stop. That applies equally to
Herd who couldn’t see up Waller because of that wall, and who had every right
to assume, if the light was green, any traffic coming up or down Waller would
stop on the red light. I think the whole key to the question is who had the
light and the man who went through on the red light is negligent.

The learned trial judge did not withdraw the
question of contributory negligence from the jury; he instructed them
accurately and adequately as to the duty of a driver who has the signal light
in his favour and went on to tell them, quite properly, that on the evidence
there was little room for a finding of negligence on the part of whichever
driver did in fact have the signal light in his favour.

[Page 604]

The following questions were submitted to the
jury:

1. Was there any negligence on the part of
the defendant driver, James Herd, which caused or contributed to the injuries
suffered by the plaintiff, Zvone Terkuc? Answer Yes or No.

2. If your answer to Question No. 1 is
“Yes” then state fully, giving the facts on which you base your conclusions,
the particulars of such negligence.

3. Was there any negligence on the part of
the driver of the Plaintiff’s car, Jacques Menard, which caused or contributed
to the injuries suffered by the Plaintiff? Answer Yes or No.

4. If your answer to Question No. 3 is
“Yes”, then state fully, giving the facts on which you base your conclusions,
the particulars of such negligence.

5. If your answer should disclose that
there was negligence on the part of both drivers which caused or contributed to
the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, then state in percentage the respective
degrees of negligence of each:


 
  
  James Herd 
  
  
  %
  
 
 
  
  Jacques Menard
  
  
  %
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
  100%
  
  
 


6. At what amount and irrespective of any
other consideration do you assess the total damages suffered by the Plaintiff,
Zvone Terkuc?

After deliberating for some two hours the jury
returned to the court room and stated that they had reached a verdict. The list
of questions was handed to the learned trial judge and contained the following
answers:

To Question 1: Yes.

To Question 2: Excess of speed shown by
force of impact.

To Question 3: Yes.

To Question 4: Failure in looking for
cross-bound traffic.


 
  
  To Question 5: James Herd 
  
  
  60%
  
 
 
  
                             Jacques
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
                                     Menard
  
  
  
  40%
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
  100%
  
  
 


To Question 6: $16,940.00

The learned trial judge without referring to
counsel or inviting any submission from them said to the jury:

You see your difficulty is you haven’t
answered the essential questions. You say “Yes” to Question 1 and say
“excessive speed shown by force of impact”. In so far as this driver is
concerned, if he had the green light he was entitled to go through. If he had
the traffic light he did not have to look for anything unless it was apparent
to him that something was coming through against the light. Try to grapple with
the essential points in this case. You have a duty to do; now try and do it.

[Page 605]

The jury thereupon retired and after
deliberating for a further two hours returned the following answers to the
questions:

To Question 1: No.

To Question 2: No answer.

To Question 3: Yes.

To Question 4: Failure to stop at red
light.

To Question 5: No answer.

To Question 6: $16,940.00

On these answers the learned trial judge, on
motion of counsel for the defendant gave judgment dismissing the action with
costs.

The majority in the Court of Appeal were of
opinion that the course followed by the learned trial judge was not a proper
one. With respect, I am unable to agree with this conclusion.

The answers of a jury must, of course, be read
in the light of the evidence and of the charge; on so reading the answers first
made by the jury it was apparent that they had failed to grapple with the
question as to which driver had the signal light in his favour which had been
clearly presented to them as the essential point which they were required to
determine. In these circumstances the learned trial judge had the power and it
was his duty to instruct the jury to deal with that question. Particularly in
view of the full and accurate charge which he had given on this point, his
redirection, which is quoted in full above, while brief was adequate.

That the learned judge had the power to send the
jury back to reconsider their answers is made plain by the authorities
collected in the reasons of Schroeder J.A. I would add a reference to two
decisions relied upon by counsel for the appellant. In Napier v. Daniel and
Welsh[2], Tindal
C.J. said:

I have always understood the rule to be,
that the jury are at liberty to alter the verdict before it is recorded, but
not after. This is laid down in Co. Litt. fol. 227, b, where it is said,
“after the verdict recorded, the jury cannot vary from it, but before it be
recorded they may vary from the first offer of their verdict, and that verdict
which is recorded shall stand.”

[Page 606]

In Regina v. Meany[3], Pollock C.B. said:

There is no doubt that a Judge, both in a
civil and criminal court, has a perfect right, and sometimes it is his bounden
duty, to tell the jury to reconsider their verdict. He may send them back any
number of times to reconsider their finding. The Judge is not bound to record
the first verdict unless the jury insist upon its being recorded. If they find
another verdict that is the true verdict.

While no doubt this power is not one to be used
lightly, the circumstances of the case at bar appear to me to have required its
exercise and I conclude, as did Schroeder J.A., that the course followed by the
learned trial judge was a proper one.

For the above reasons and for those given by
Schroeder J.A. with which I am in substantial agreement I would allow the
appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant is
entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Constitutional law—Provincial legislation respecting
duties of drivers involved in accidents—Whether matter so related to substance
of s. 221(2)  of the Criminal Code  as to be brought within scope of the criminal
law—Whether ultra vires—The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, s.
147(1)—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 221(2).

Criminal law—Power to grant leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada.

The accused was convicted in magistrate's court for having
failed to remain at or return to the scene of an accident for certain defined
purposes, contrary to s. 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act of Manitoba,
and he then appealed to the County Court, which held that s. 147(1) of the Act
was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature. On appeal it was decided, by
a majority, that the section was intra vires. The Court of Appeal
granted the accused leave to appeal to this Court, where it was determined that
the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction so to do. A constitutional question
being involved, leave to appeal was granted by this Court.

Held (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The two pieces of legislation (s. 147(1) of
the Act and s. 221(2) of the Code) differ in legislative purpose and in legal
and practical effect. The section in the Act was enacted for provincial
purposes by creating a duty to stop, render assistance and give information,
whereas the section of the Code creates an offence to omit certain acts if done
with a specified intent. Regina v. Dodd, [1957]
O.R. 5, overruled; Regina v. Yolles, [1959] O.R.
206, approved; O'Grady v. Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804; Rex v. Corry, 26
Alta. L.R. 390; Regina v. Mankov, 28 W.W.R. 433,
referred to.

[Page 824]

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: Where
Parliament has, in the valid exercise of its exclusive power under head 27 of
s. 91 of the British North America Act to make laws in relation to the
criminal law, enacted that a certain course of conduct shall be punishable as
an offence against the state provided it is accompanied by a specified intent,
it is not within, the power of the Legislature to enact that the very same
course of conduct shall be punishable as an offence whether or not that
specified intent exists.

The whole subject-matter of the charge against the appellant
has been drawn by Parliament within the ambit of the criminal law with the effect
of suspending the provincial legislative authority in relation to that
subject-matter.

Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan, [1941] S.C.R.
396: Regina v. Dodd, supra, referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, reversing the judgment of Philp Sr.
Co. Ct. J. Appeal dismissed, Locke and Cartwright JJ.
dissenting.

No oral argument was presented, as this case was to be
decided at the same time and in the same way as the case of O'Grady v.
Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—The
appellant, William E. Stephens, was convicted in magistrate's court in the City
of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, on the 4th day of September 1958, for
that he at the City of Winnipeg, on the 7th day of August, A.D., 1958,

did unlawfully operate a motor vehicle on Furby St., and
being involved in an accident fail to remain at the scene of the accident, fail
to render all reasonable assistance and fail to give in writing to the parties
sustaining loss or injury his name and address and the number of his driver's
licence contrary to the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act 147-1 in such
case made and provided.

He appealed to the County Court of Winnipeg and His
Honour Judge Philp without hearing any evidence decided on a motion by counsel
for Stephens that s. 147(1) was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature
and set aside the conviction. On an appeal against this order to the Court of
Appeal1 for Manitoba, Tritschler J.A., with whom Schultz
J.A. agreed, decided (Chief Justice Adamson dissenting) that the section
was intra vires. The order of the Court was

[Page 825]

that the appeal should be allowed and the matter
remitted to the Senior County Court Judge for the County Court of Winnipeg to
hear the evidence and dispose of the charge.

The Court of Appeal granted Stephens leave to appeal to this
Court. After notice to the parties we determined that that Court had no
jurisdiction so to do. Stephens was prosecuted in accordance with The
Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 254, s. 7 of which provides for
the application of certain named sections of the Criminal Code  of
Canada. The 1954 Revised Statutes of Manitoba and the new Criminal Code  of
Canada came into force on the same day but whether one refers to the sections
of the old Code or of the new Code the result is the same. No power is given to
a provincial Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from its judgment setting aside a conviction of a non-indictable offence. That
power is conferred upon this Court and then only in respect of a question of
law or jurisdiction. A constitutional question is involved in the present case
and although, as will appear later, the point is now determined by what the
majority of this Court holds in O'Grady v. Sparling2, we
granted leave so that the matter might be disposed of at the same time as the
last mentioned case and Smith v. The Queen3.

Section 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act, under
which the charge against Stephens was laid, reads:

147. (1) Where an accident occurs on a highway, the driver,
owner, or other person in charge of a vehicle, street car or trolley bus that
is in any manner, directly or indirectly, involved in the accident shall

(a) remain at or
immediately return to the scene of the accident; and

(b) render all reasonable
assistance; and

(c) give in writing to any
one sustaining loss or injury or to any peace officer or to a witness his name
and address, and also the name and address of the registered owner of the
vehicle and the number of the driver's licence, and the registration number of
the motor vehicle or such of the information as is requested.

We were advised that this provision originated in an
amendment to the Act in 1930 by s. 61(1) of c. 19 of the Statutes of that year.
Subsection (2) of s. 221 of the new Criminal Code  requires
consideration:

221.................................................................................................................................

(2) Every one who, having the care, charge or control of a
vehicle that is involved in an accident with a person, vehicle or cattle in
charge

[Page 826]

of a person, with intent to escape civil or criminal
liability fails to stop his vehicle, give his name and address and, where any
person has been injured, offer assistance, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable
on summary conviction.

This subsection originated in an amendment to the Criminal
Code  by s. 2  of c. 13 of the Statutes of 1910.

Judge Philp, with whom Chief Justice Adamson agreed,
considered that s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act and s.
221(2) of the new Criminal Code  were in pari materia and that,
therefore, the former could not stand. As indicated earlier the point is really
determined by the judgment of this Court in O'Grady v. Sparling4,
as the reasons of Judson J., which are those of the majority, referred to Regina v. Dodd5, a decision of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario relied upon by the County Court Judge in this case. It is
pointed out in O'Grady v. Sparling that the problem there in question
was the same ""as that raised by the side-by-side existence of provincial
legislation dealing with the duty to remain at or return to the scene of an
accident for certain defined purposes, and s. 221(2)  of the Criminal Code  dealing
with failure to stop at the scene of an accident 'with intent to escape civil
or criminal liability' "". Judson J. continues by considering the Dodd case,
Rex v. Corry6, Regina v.
Mankow7, a decision of the Alberta Court
of Appeal, and the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in the present
case. It suffices to reiterate that the two pieces of legislation differ in
legislative purpose and in legal and practical effect. The County Judge in this
case considered that (a), (b), (c) of s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway
Traffic Act referred to something that had happened after an accident and
that all infractions against the rules of driving, for negligence, and other
provisions for prevention of accidents and injuries to persons and property,
were over and completed prior to the time of the alleged offences as charged.
He states further that there was no degree of care such as in Regina
v. Yolles8, a decision of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario. While we had refused leave to appeal

[Page 827]

to this Court because Yolles had been found not guilty on
another ground, his counsel took part in the argument of the present appeal.

Here the County Judge considered that what was in question
in s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act was one act (a)
""remain at … the scene of the accident""; (b) ""render …
assistance""; (c) ""give in writing … information"". However, I
agree with Tritschler J.A. that the section of the Manitoba Act was enacted for
provincial purposes by creating a duty to stop, render assistance and give
information, while the section of the Code creates an offence to omit certain
acts if done with a specified intent. The result is that the decision of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. Dodd9
is overruled and that of the same Court in Regina v.
Yolles10 approved.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):—The charge against the appellant and the proceedings in
the courts below are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.

The question to be decided is stated in the written argument
of the Attorney-General for the Province of Manitoba as follows:

The issue on this appeal is whether or not the matter of
Section 147(1) of The Highway Traffic Act R.S.M. 1954 Cap. 112 is so related to
the substance of Section 221(2)  of the Criminal Code  as to be brought within the
scope of the criminal law and so rendered ultra vires or inoperative.

I think it clear that s. 147(1) would be intra vires of
the legislature if there were no legislation of Parliament dealing with similar
subject matter and I do not understand the appellant to argue the contrary. The
question before us is that stated by Duff C.J. in Provincial Secretary of
P.E.I. v. Egan11:

We have to consider the effect of legislation by the
Dominion creating a crime and imposing punishment for it in effecting the suspension
of provincial legislative authority in relation to matters prima facie within
the provincial jurisdiction.

[Page 828]

The inquiry in the case at bar is directed to the specific
charge brought against the appellant. It will be observed that to substantiate
the charge the prosecution would have to prove (i) that the appellant was
operating a motor vehicle that was involved in an accident on Furby Street
causing loss or injury, (ii) that he failed to remain at the scene of the
accident, (iii) that he failed to render all reasonable assistance, and (iv)
that he failed to give in writing to the parties sustaining loss or injury his
name, address and driver's licence number.

If the charge against the appellant had been laid under s.
221(2)  of the Criminal Code  instead of under s. 147(1) of The Highway
Traffic Act, it would have been necessary for the prosecution to prove not
only the matters set out above but also that the failure of the accused was
accompanied by the intent to escape civil or criminal liability. This is a
substantial difference which is somewhat lessened in practice by the terms of
subsection (3) of section 221 of the Code making proof of the objective
fact of the failures mentioned prima facie evidence of the existence of
the guilty intent.

It is not, and could not successfully be, argued that the
enactment of s. 221(2)  and (3)  is not a valid exercise of the exclusive power
conferred on Parliament by head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America
Act. The question before us may therefore be stated in the following terms.
Where Parliament has, in the valid exercise of its exclusive power under head
27 of section 91 to make laws in relation to the criminal law, enacted that a
certain course of conduct shall be punishable as an offence against the state
provided it is accompanied by a specified intent, is it within the power of the
Legislature to enact that the very same course of conduct shall be punishable
as an offence whether or not that specified intent exists? With the greatest
respect for all those who have, in this and other cases, expressed a different
view I am of opinion that so long as section 221 (2) of the Code continues
in force, the Legislature has no such

[Page 829]

power, and I am in agreement with the
conclusion reached in the case at bar by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba
and by the learned County Court Judge and also with the conclusion reached by
Laidlaw J.A. in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario in Regina v. Dodd12.

The whole subject-matter of the charge against the appellant
has, in my opinion, been drawn by Parliament within the ambit of the criminal
law with the effect of suspending the provincial legislative authority in
relation to that subject-matter.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court
of Appeal and restore the order of the learned County Court Judge setting aside
the conviction and directing the return of the fine, costs and security paid by
the appellant.

Ritchie J.:—I
agree with the Chief Justice that s. 147(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic
Act is valid legislation enacted for provincial purposes and that the
subject-matter with which it deals is substantially different from the offence
defined in s. 221  of the Criminal Code  in that the specific intent required
under the latter section forms no part of the offence created by the provincial
statute.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed without costs, Locke and Cartwright JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Further appeal in summary conviction
matter—Application for leave to appeal—Question of law—The Summary Convictions
Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 325, s. 15.

Professions and trades—Dental mechanic fitting set of
false teeth—Unlawful practice of dentistry—The Dental Association Act, R.S.A.
1955, c. 82, s. 37(a).

The accused, who did not hold a valid certificate to practise
dentistry, fitted a complete set of false teeth for one H, for which he was
paid $90. According to his uncontradicted evidence this payment was simply for
the manufacture of the dentures, and no charge was made for any part of the
other dental work. On a charge of practising dentistry for hire, contrary to s.
37(a) of The Dental Association Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 82, the
accused was acquitted in magistrate's court, and an appeal from this acquittal
was dismissed by the District Court judge.

On an ex parte application to a Supreme Court judge,
made under s. 15 of The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 325,
leave to appeal to the Appellate Division was granted as a question of law was
involved of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal. The Appellate
Division allowed the appeal and from this decision the accused appealed to this
Court. The appellant contended that s. 15(1) makes no provision for an appeal
by the informant from an acquittal, and is confined to applications made by
""the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him"".

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Sections 581 to 592 inclusive of the Criminal Code , as
adopted by s. 15(2) of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta, are
limited in their effect to matters of procedure and are in no way related to
the right of appeal itself which is fully stated in s. 15(1). As the informant
is a ""person affected by the conviction or order"" to which the Act
applies, it follows that he is accorded a right to apply to a Supreme Court
judge under s. 15(1).

The contention that because of the omission of the term
""order of dismissal"" from s. 15 of The Summary Convictions Act, the
right of appeal to the Appellate Division does not apply where there has been
an acquittal by the District Court, failed in view of the provisions of s.
692(1)  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 914]

The argument that the Appellate Division exceeded its
jurisdiction which was limited to a question of law alone also failed. As the
facts were not in dispute, the only question at issue was as to the true
construction to be placed upon ss. 30 and 37(a) of The Dental
Association Act. This is a question of law and was so dealt with in the
majority judgment.

As the appellant's ""skill and experience"" in doing
dental work were part of the value or price he was able to obtain for the
finished dentures, it followed that the appellant's conduct constituted
""practising the profession of dentistry … for hire"" within the
meaning of the statute.

Furthermore the words ""for hire"" as used in s. 37(a)
do not necessarily import the payment of money and should be construed as
including any kind of compensation or reward. At least part of the compensation
which the appellant received for doing the dental work was that he thereby
obtained an order to manufacture the dentures.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of
Edwards D.C.J. Appeal dismissed.

E. M. Woolliams, for the appellant.

S. J. Helman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta2 allowing an appeal by the private
prosecutor from a judgment of His Honour Judge M. J. Edwards and entering a
conviction against the appellant for practising the profession of dentistry
within the Province of Alberta ""for hire"" contrary to the provisions
of s. 37(a) of The Dental Association Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 82.

At all times relevant to these proceedings, the appellant,
who did not hold a valid certificate of registration from the Alberta Dental
Association, resided at Drumheller in the Province of Alberta where he carried
on the business of a dental mechanic in an office, over the door of which there
was a sign reading ""Valley Dental Lab"". In the Autumn of 1958 a man
by the name of Hill came to this office by

[Page 915]

appointment to be fitted for a complete set of false teeth.
On his first visit a preliminary impression was taken of his jaws and he paid
$42.33. On his second visit a ""final impression"" was taken. On his
third visit ""bite blocks"" were placed in his mouth to determine the
relation of the upper and lower jaws, and at the fourth appointment the teeth
were set up in wax and placed in his mouth and a further appointment was then
made for the ""finished date"" at which time the plates were put in his
mouth and he paid the appellant a further sum of $47.63, making a total of $90.
All this work was done by the appellant.

The above facts are not in dispute, but the appellant's
uncontradicted evidence was that the $90 charge was ""simply for the
manufacture of those dentures"" and that no charge whatever was made for
obtaining ""the bite"", making the impression or any of the other
dental work. The sole question before the Appellate Division was whether or
not, under these circumstances, the appellant was practising dentistry within
the meaning of The Dental Association Act.

Section 37 of The Dental Association Act reads as
follows:

37. A person not holding a valid certificate of registration
and a subsisting annual certificate who

(a) practises the
profession of dentistry within the Province either publicly or privately for
hire, gain or hope of reward,

* * *

is guilty of an offence and
liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars and
not less than fifty dollars for the first offence, and to a fine of four
hundred dollars for each and every subsequent offence.

The practice of dentistry is described in the following
words in s. 30 of the same statute:

30. A person who, for a fee, salary, reward or commission,
paid or to be paid by an employer to him, or for fee, money or compensation,
paid or to be paid either to himself or an employer or any other person

(a) examines, diagnoses or
advises on any condition or the tooth or teeth in the jaw or jaws of any
person,

(b) directly in the oral
cavity of any person takes, makes, performs or administers any impression,
operation or treatment or any part of any impression, operation or treatment of
any kind of or

[Page 916]

upon the tooth or teeth or jaw or
jaws, or of, for or upon any disease or lesion of the tooth or teeth or jaw or
jaws, or the malposition thereof, in the mouth of any person,

(c) fits any artificial
denture, tooth or teeth in, to or upon the jaw or jaws of a person, or

(d) advertises or holds
himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or any of the above
things,

shall be deemed to be practising the profession of dentistry
within the meaning of this Act.

On October 30, 1958, the appellant was arraigned before
Magistrate Hardcastle and pleaded not guilty to an Information sworn against
him by Dr. Ronald G. Dickson, a dentist of Drumheller, it being submitted on
his behalf that as he had charged nothing for doing any of the work described
in s. 30 but only for his work as a dental mechanic in manufacturing the
dentures he could not be found guilty of practising dentistry ""for
hire"" within the meaning of s. 37(a), and that he was, in fact,
guilty of no offence under that section. In dismissing the charge, the learned
magistrate said:

According to the evidence as I see it, I cannot see where
there was a charge made for dentistry. The witness distinctly stated he paid
$90.00 for the making of the teeth.

An appeal from this acquittal was duly asserted to the Divisional
Court of the District of Southern Alberta by the informant's solicitor pursuant
to the provisions of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code  which, except as
otherwise specifically provided, are made to apply ""to all convictions and
all orders and the proceedings relating thereto made by a justice"" by s. 5
of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta.

At the trial de novo held before
His Honour Judge Edwards the informant's, solicitor was expressly authorized to
act on behalf of the Crown by the Department of the Attorney General of
Alberta, and the above facts, including the fact that the money was paid simply
for manufacturing the teeth were sworn to both by the appellant and by Mr.
Hill.

[Page 917]

In dismissing this appeal, the learned District Court judge
said:

The evidence before me, and uncontradicted, is that the
$90.00 was paid to the accused for making a set of dentures, and not for doing
any of the things specifically itemized in Section 30, of the Dental
Association Act.

The relevant section of The Summary Convictions Act of
Alberta governing an appeal from a judgment or a decision of a District Court
judge in such circumstances as these reads as follows:

15. (1) Where it is made to appear to a judge of the Supreme
Court, on the application of the Attorney General or any person affected by a
conviction or order to which this Act applies, that a judgment or decision of a
judge of the district court made on appeal from any such conviction or order
involves a question of law of sufficient importance to justify a further
appeal, the judge of the Supreme Court may so certify, and thereupon an appeal
lies to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court from the judgment or
decision of the judge of the district court.

(2) The procedure on the appeal shall be the same as that
provided by sections 581  to 592  of the Criminal Code  and the rules
relating thereto in so far as they are applicable where the ground of appeal
involves a question of law.

In purported compliance with this section, the informant's
solicitor, who, for this purpose, does not appear to have been instructed by
the Attorney General, made an ex parte application to Mr. Justice W. G.
Egbert of the Supreme Court who duly certified that a question of law was
involved of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal, and Notice of
Appeal having been served the appeal came on for hearing before the Appellate
Division.

It was urged before the Appellate Division that Mr. Justice
Egbert lacked jurisdiction to make the order embodying the aforesaid certificate
because the accused had been given no notice of the application. Although this
ground of appeal was included in the notice pursuant to which leave to appeal
to this Court was granted, it was specifically abandoned at the hearing of this
appeal.

[Page 918]

It was, however, contended before the Appellate Division and
before this Court that Mr. Justice Egbert lacked jurisdiction on another
ground, viz., that s. 15(1) of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta
makes no provision for an appeal by the informant from an acquittal, and is
confined to applications made by ""the Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him"".

In this regard the argument was advanced that because the
procedure provided by s. 584  of the Criminal Code , for appealing from a
verdict of acquittal in proceedings by indictment, is adopted by s. 15(2) 
""in so far as … applicable"" and because that section of the Code only
refers specifically to appeals by ""the Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him"", it, therefore, follows that there can be no appeal by
an informant under s. 15 of The Summary Convictions Act of Alberta.

In my opinion ss. 581  to 592  inclusive of the Criminal
Code , as adopted by the said s. 15(2) , are limited in their effect to
matters of procedure and are in no way related to the right of appeal itself
which is fully stated in s. 15(1)  (see Scullion v. Canadian Breweries
Transport Limited3, per Fauteux J.) and as I take
the view that the informant is a ""person affected by the conviction or
order"" to which The Summary Convictions Act applies, it follows
that I am of opinion that the informant is accorded a right to apply to a
Supreme Court judge under s. 15(1).

The application ""of the Attorney General or any person
affected by a conviction or order to which this Act applies"" for which
provision is made in s. 15(1) of The Summary Convictions Act is only to
be granted when it has been made to appear to a Supreme Court judge

… that a judgment or decision of a judge of the district
court made on appeal from any such conviction or order involves a
question of law of sufficient importance to justify a further appeal … (The
italics are mine.)

[Page 919]

It was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant that

the legislature, having omitted the term ""order of
dismissal"" from s. 15 of the Summary Convictions Act, the right of appeal
to the Appellate Division does not apply where there has been an acquittal by
the district court. (The quotation is from the factum of the appellant.)

As the ""conviction or order"" from which an appeal
lies to a District Court judge is the ""conviction or order"" of the
justice, I am of opinion that those words as used in s. 15(1) can only refer to
such a ""conviction or order"", and as the summary conviction
provisions of the Criminal Code  apply ""to all orders and the
proceedings relating thereto made or to be made by a justice"", it follows
that the word ""order"" as used in s. 15(1) is to be given the meaning
assigned to it by s. 692(1)  of the Criminal Code  which provides that:
"" 'Order' means any order, including an order for payment of money.""
These words are, in my opinion, sufficiently wide to include an ""order of
dismissal"". If it were otherwise it would mean that there could be no
appeal to the Appellate Division under The Summary Convictions Act of
Alberta in any case in which an order of dismissal had been made by a justice
even if that order had later been reversed and the accused had been convicted
by a District Court judge. That the legislature should have intended such a
result is, in my opinion, so unlikely that I would have been inclined to attach
the wider meaning to the word ""order"" as used in s. 15(1) even if it
had not been for the provisions of s. 692(1) of the Code.

I am, accordingly, of opinion that Egbert J. had
jurisdiction to grant the order which he did and that the Appellate Division
was clothed with jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal, but it is said
on behalf of the appellant that that Court exceeded its jurisdiction which was
limited to a question of law alone because the reasons of Chief Justice Ford
and Mr. Justice Porter

… are based on facts found by them and inferences drawn by
them and not on facts found by the trial judge and inferences drawn by him.

[Page 920]

As the facts are not in dispute, the only question at issue
is as to the true construction to be placed upon ss. 30 and 37(a) of The
Dental Association Act. This is a question of law and was so dealt with by
Ford C.J. in rendering the decision on behalf of the majority of the Appellate
Division, in which he held that as the appellant's ""skill and
experience"" in doing dental work were part of the value or price he was
able to obtain for the finished dentures, it followed that the appellant's
conduct constituted ""practising the profession of dentistry … for
hire"" within the meaning of the statute.

I am in full agreement with the reasoning and conclusion of
the Appellate Division, but I am of opinion that the dental work was also done
""for hire"" in another sense. The words ""for hire"" as used
in s. 37(a) do not necessarily import the payment of money and should,
in my view, be construed as including any kind of compensation or reward. In
the present case, at least a part of the compensation which the appellant
received for doing the dental work was that he thereby obtained Mr. Hill's
order to manufacture the dentures and incidentally received it for a better
price than the dentists had been in the habit of paying for such work so that
even if it could be said that the appellant was paid no money for doing the
work of a professional dentist it would, nevertheless, be apparent that he was
compensated for such work by receiving a profitable order for his work as a
dental mechanic, and this, in my opinion, was one measure of his hire. I am,
accordingly, of opinion that the transaction between the appellant and Mr.
Hill, as the appellant himself described it, constituted practising dentistry
""for hire"" within the meaning of ss. 37(a) and 30 of The
Dental Association Act.

I would dismiss the appeal, but in view of the circumstances
of this case there should be no costs.

Appeal dismissed without costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.

Criminal law—Acquittal at non-jury trial on charge of
criminal negligence causing death—No evidence offered by accused after Crown's
case— Crown nonsuited— Reasonable doubt—Duty of trial judge—Whether Crown
entitled to appeal—Whether finding of non-criminal negligence question of law
alone—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 91, 558, 584.

On a trial by a judge alone on a charge of causing death by
criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, the accused, who had
driven through a red light and killed W, was acquitted. He did not put in any
defence because the trial judge expressed the opinion that the Crown had not
furnished sufficient evidence to support the charge. The trial judge held that
the facts did not constitute criminal negligence as defined by s. 191  of the Criminal
Code . On appeal by the Crown claiming that the trial judge had misdirected
himself on what constituted criminal negligence and that this was a question of
law alone, the Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, ordered a new trial.
The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of
acquittal restored.

The appeal involved a combined question of law and fact,
therefore the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction to hear it. That the accused
did not see the red light through an oversight was a question of fact which the
trial judge determined after hearing all the witnesses and weighing all the
circumstances of the case. The trial judge sitting without a jury was
fulfilling a dual capacity. He directed himself properly and, when he decided
on the facts submitted that criminal negligence ought not to be inferred, he
was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a question of fact.

The contention that the trial judge at the conclusion of the
evidence of the Crown should not have given the accused the benefit of the
doubt cannot be entertained. Sitting as a jury, the trial judge must reject a
motion to dismiss when there is a prima facie case. Then, there is no room for
the benefit of the doubt. It is only when all the evidence is adduced that this
benefit may be granted. Here, no motion was made. The trial judge expressed his
views on the case, but he did not then deliver judgment. When, after an
adjournment requested by the accused, the latter declared that he had no
evidence to offer, the case was complete, and it was then the imperative duty
of the trial judge to give the accused the benefit of the doubt he may have
had, after hearing the argument of the Crown.

[Page 442]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, reversing a judgment of Riley J. and
ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

N. D. Maclean, Q.C., for the appellant.

H. J. Wilson, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—The
appellant was charged that on the 17th of January, 1958, at Edmonton, he, by
criminal negligence, caused the death of Brynjulf Wetting, in the operation of
a motor vehicle. He was acquitted by the trial judge, sitting without a jury,
but the Appellate Division, Supreme Court of Alberta2, quashed
the judgment of acquittal and ordered a new trial, Mr. Justice Porter
dissenting.

It is contended on behalf of the appellant that there was no
question of law alone, such as to enable the Attorney General to appeal the
judgment of acquittal to the Supreme Court of Alberta. The majority of the
Appellate Division held that the finding of fact of the trial judge raised a
question of law, as to whether the accused was guilty of criminal negligence in
the operation of his motor vehicle.

This exceptional and limited right which the Attorney
General has to appeal a verdict of acquittal, is given by s. 584  of the Criminal
Code , which says:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him
for the purpose may appeal to the Court of Appeal.

(a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial
court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a
question of law alone.

The Court of Appeal is therefore incompetent to hear the
case if the question raised is not a pure question of law, but involves a mixed
question of law and fact. I have reached the conclusion that appellant's
argument on this point must prevail, as the question raised was not a matter of
law alone.

The learned trial judge considered all the evidence. He
found that the appellant went through a red light, was not keeping a proper
look-out, that his speed was not above

[Page 443]

the normal at that intersection and that he stopped within a
reasonable distance. He reached the conclusion that he did not see the red
light, and that it was his failure to do so that was the determining cause of
the accident. That the appellant did not see the red light through an oversight,
is a question of fact, which the learned trial judge determined after hearing
all the witnesses and weighing all the circumstances of the case. This
heedlessness may create civil liability, but the degree of inattention which he
found, did not show necessarily in the circumstances, wanton or reckless
disregard of the lives or safety of other persons, (Cr.Code
191), which the statute requires to make the act criminal.

The trial judge sitting without a jury was fulfilling a dual
capacity. He had, therefore, to discharge the duties attached to the functions
of a judge, and also the duties of a jury. As a judge he had to direct himself
as to whether any facts had been established by evidence from which criminal
negligence may be reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say whether, from
those facts submitted, criminal negligence ought to be inferred. Metropolitan
Railway Company v. Jackson3, King v. Morabito4. I think
that the trial judge directed himself properly, and that when he decided on the
facts submitted to him that criminal negligence ought not to be inferred,
he was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a question of fact.

It was also contended on behalf of the respondent that the Morabito
case, supra, should govern here, and that the judge at the conclusion
of the evidence of the respondent, should not have given the appellant the
benefit of the doubt. In the latter case, the accused through counsel had made
to the trial judge, sitting without a jury, a motion to dismiss, alleging lack
of evidence, before declaring whether or not he had any evidence to adduce. In
this Court it was said by Kellock J. concurred in by Rand and Locke JJ.:

It is clear, I think, that no other application could have
been made at that stage in the absence of an election on the part of the
defence to call or not to call evidence. Had a jury been present, the learned
trial judge could have done no more, on the application of the defence, than
have decided whether or not there was evidence upon which the jury might
convict.

[Page 444]

Of course, when the trial judge sits as a jury, he has to
instruct himself as if he were instructing the jury, and if there is a prima
facie case he must reject a motion to dismiss. Then, there is no room for
the benefit of the doubt. It is only when all the evidence is adduced that this
benefit may be granted to the accused.

Here, no motion was made. It is true that the trial judge
expressed, at that stage, his views on the issue of the case, but he did not
then deliver judgment. After an adjournment requested by the accused
appellant's counsel, the latter declared that he had no evidence to offer. (558
new Cr. Code) (944 old Cr. Code.) The
case was then complete, it was ready to go to the jury or judge, and it was
then not only open, but it was the imperative duty of the trial judge to give
the accused the benefit of the doubt, he may have had, after hearing the
argument for the Crown.

I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and
the judgment of acquittal restored.

Appeal allowed, judgment of acquittal restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge to jury—Drunkenness—Provocation—Rule
in Hodge’s case—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can), c. 51, ss. 201(a)(ii), 203.

The appellant was convicted of the murder of
a woman at whose house he was a boarder. After the appellant and the woman had
returned home from a drinking party, a quarrel took place between them. The
woman’s husband intervened, brought the quarrel to an end, and the woman
proceeded to a wash-room. She was shortly after followed by the appellant, and
in a matter of minutes one witness heard a shot while another heard the
appellant calling the woman an insulting name, and the latter retaliating in a
similar fashion, and then the shot. The woman was found fatally injured. The
conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Leave was granted by this Court to appeal on
questions of law respecting the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the issues
of drunkenness, provocation, and the rule in Hodge’s case.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The conviction should be affirmed.

Per Taschereau,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The trial judge related the defence
of drunkenness to the capacity to form the intent specified in s. 201 (a) (ii)
of the Criminal Code . The jury was, therefore, properly instructed
on that defence.

With respect to provocation, culpable
homicide committed in the heat of passion generated by a provocation lacking
the feature of suddenness does not come within the terms of the opening
paragraph of s. 203  of the Criminal Code . In this case, there was no
evidence of sudden provocation within the meaning of the section, and therefore
there was no duty on the trial judge to instruct the jury on the subject. In
any event, no fault could be found with the instructions given to the jury on
this matter.

[Page 405]

On the facts of this case, a reasonable jury,
even applying the rule in Hodge’s case, could only, if acting
judicially, reach the conclusion that the appellant, having entered the room,
produced his revolver and fired it at the woman, either at once or upon the
exchange of insults. It was no part of the case for the prosecution, but for
the defence, to explain away this fact attending actus reus and mens
rea, by evidence showing accident, self-defence, sudden retaliation to
sudden provocation, or drunkenness affecting the capacity to form the relevant
specific intent. Drunkenness and provocation were adequately put before the
jury and rejected. Accident or self-defence were not raised, nor was there any
evidence to support either.

Per Locke J.:
The trial judge’s charge adequately and accurately stated the law to the jury
with regard to the defence of drunkenness.

There was no evidence of provocation within
the meaning of s. 203  of the Criminal Code  and therefore the appellant
was not entitled to have the issue put to the jury. An accused person who, as
the appellant did, provokes another to fight by striking or abusing him and is
struck in self-defence and kills such person in an ensuing fight, cannot escape
conviction for murder by saying that the killing was committed in the heat of
passion.

The rule in Hodge’s case was to be
followed only when the evidence relied upon was wholly, or to a material
extent, circumstantial. In this case, the instruction was unnecessary since no
other inference was possible than that the appellant had fired the fatal shot.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: On the question of provocation, there was non-direction
amounting to misdirection which may well have affected the verdict. The trial
judge did not make it clear to the jury that in dealing with the question
whether the accused was in fact provoked they should consider the accused’s
condition of drunkenness, and certain passages in his charge tended to give the
jury the impression that they should not consider, it. There was, furthermore,
no room for the application of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal
Code .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
appellant’s conviction for murder. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

J. O’Driscoll and J.H. Gillies, for the
appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., and F.L. Wilson, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by:

FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal, by leave of this
Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the verdict of a jury
finding the appellant guilty of having, at the city of London, in the province of
Ontario, on the 26th day of July 1958, murdered one Joyce Alexander.

[Page 406]

The appellant, a “freedom fighter” during the
1956 Hungarian revolt, having escaped to Austria in November of that year, arrived in Canada in January 1957 and, from the end of February 1957 to the date of
his arrest, lived and worked in the city of London. At the time of the fatal occurrence, he was residing with
Mrs. Alexander, her husband and her child at 499
 Hamilton Avenue and had for some time entertained a
close relationship with her and contributed to her support and that of her
child.

In the morning of the 25th of July, he and
Mrs. Alexander arranged to meet at a certain place, about 4 o’clock of the afternoon. The latter failed to
keep the appointment and the appellant, apparently looking for her, proceeded
to visit beverage rooms, where he met Joseph Kish, one of his acquaintances,
and consumed beer with the latter. Both returned to 499
 Hamilton Avenue, where Joyce Alexander was and each of
the three had two bottles of beer. The three left at 9 o’clock, conveyed the
child to a baby-sitter and went to the Brunswick Hotel where they stayed from
9.30 to 11.30, drank beer and were, on the occasion, joined by John Gnay and
Alex Kapler. A heated discussion on communism took place and was brought to an
end by the intervention of a waiter. Kish, on the invitation of Kapler and Gnay, and the appellant and Mrs. Alexander,
on the invitation of Kish, then
proceeded to 5 Prospect Avenue,
the home of one Olejnik, fetching the child on their way, and arriving there at
about midnight. While at that
place, wine was consumed; Kapler asked Mrs. Alexander to accompany him to
his farm; and once again, appellant became involved in an argument on
communism. Being requested to leave, he asked Mrs. Alexander to accompany
him and upon her refusal, left, but returned for the purpose, he testified, of
asking Kish to prevail upon her
to go home. To attract Kish’s
attention, he rapped on a window and broke a pane of glass. Kapler came out, a
struggle ensued between the two, appellant broke away, fired five shots in the
air with his revolver and eventually found his way to 499
 Hamilton Avenue. When later, between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., Alexander arrived home, the accused, who
was lying on his bed fully clothed, got up and asked him whether he had seen
Joyce Alexander; the husband answered in the negative and went to bed.
Appellant had consumed a

[Page 407]

certain quantity of beer and was, for some time,
either lying or sitting on his bed when, it being close to 4 o’clock a.m.,
Mrs. Alexander entered the house with Kish and the child. Salamon came out of his room, asked her and received
an explanation for her failure to keep the afternoon appointment. An argument
followed between the two. He requested her to give him immediately the shoes
and skirt she was wearing and which he had bought for her. She told him that
she would give them the next day. He insisted, assaulted her. Blows were
struck, her skirt torn off and they began throwing dishes at each other.
Alexander testified that, at this stage, he came out of his room, brought the
quarrel to an end and told his wife to go to the adjoining bathroom to wash the
blood off the back of her neck, which she did. It is the contention of the
Crown that, at that moment, appellant went to his room to get his revolver. Kish testified that the appellant did go to
his room and Alexander said he did not. Appellant himself, when examined in
chief, testified that he remembered nothing of what took place then or
thereafter; on cross-examination, however, he admitted having some recollection
of going to his room and this, he said he did because he wanted the quarrel to
end. He was seen by both Kish
and Alexander entering the wash-room but neither of these two saw what took
place therein. However, the door having been left open, in a matter of moments
after the entrance of Salamon, Alexander heard a shot while Kish said he heard, in quick sequence,
appellant calling the woman a dirty name, then the latter retaliating in a
similar fashion, and then the shot. Appellant immediately emerged from the
wash-room, carrying his revolver in the right hand and pointing it at Alexander
and Kish, picked up his coat
and left the room. When apprehended by the police a few minutes later at the
back door of the house, he had his revolver, cocked, in his right hand. The
police, who wrested it from him, found, in the barrel, five live bullets and
one discharged cartridge, indicating that appellant’s revolver, having seven
cartridge-chambers, had been re-loaded, subsequent to the discharge of the five
shots at Olejnik’s place, and either prior or subsequent to the fatal shot. On
the

[Page 408]

evidence, it is not open to say that between the
two shootings, that is the one at Olejnik’s and the fatal one, any one, but the
accused, had the physical possession of this revolver or knew where it was.

As the trial judge indicated to the jury, with
the apparent approval of counsel for the accused, the defence was provocation
and drunkenness which defence, in the circumstances of this case, implied that
Salamon was in fact the author of the death. There was no suggestion of
accident or self-defence nor is there any evidence in this respect. The jury
rejected the defence of provocation and drunkenness and found the prisoner
guilty.

The grounds upon which leave to appeal was
granted are, in the order in which they will be considered, the following:

(1) Did the learned trial Judge err in his
charge to the jury in regard to the defence of drunkenness?

(2) Did the learned trial Judge err in his
charge to the jury in regard to the defence of provocation?

(3) Did the learned trial Judge err in
failing to instruct the jury in accordance with the rule in Hodge’s case?

Defence of drunkenness. The substance of the
submissions of counsel for the appellant is (a) that the trial judge failed to
direct the jury that they should consider whether, at the time Salamon fired
his revolver, he was affected by drunkenness to the point of being unable to
form the intent specified in s. 201 (a) (ii), and (b) that he
misdirected them in telling them that if they believed that to be the case, or
were left in doubt, they could—instead of directing them that they
should—reduce murder to manslaughter. On a careful reading of the charge, I am
satisfied that the jury was properly instructed on the defence of drunkenness.
The learned trial judge did relate the defence of drunkenness to the capacity
to form the intent indicated. While, in a general reference to the power of the
jury to reduce murder to manslaughter, he used the word “may”, which is the
word mentioned in s. 203(1), he made it clear that it was their duty to do so
should they find, or be left in doubt, that the situation, where such a
reduction is open, was present in the case.

Defence of provocation. The relevant part of s.
203  reads as follows:

203. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise
would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it
did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

[Page 409]

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular wrongful
act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was
deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he
received,

are questions of fact, but no one shall be
deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a
legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in
order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to
any human being.

Appellant testified that when he left Olejnik’s
house, he “was not mad” at Joyce Alexander; he wished her to go home with him.
On his own story, he cannot be said to have then been in a state of
provocation. Even assuming there had been, at that stage, provocation from her,
the length of time elapsing from this point to that of the fatal occurrence would
negative any relation of suddenness between the fact of such provocation at
Olejnik’s place and the fact of the alleged retaliation at 499 Hamilton Avenue.
As stated by Rand J. in The Queen v. Tripodi[1]: “Suddenness must characterize both
the insult and the act of retaliation”. Evidence of sudden provocation, if any,
must then be found in the events taking place subsequently at the home of the
deceased woman. In the consideration of these events, again it must be kept in
mind that culpable homicide committed in the heat of passion generated by a
provocation lacking the feature of suddenness does not come within the terms of
the opening paragraph of the section. The evidence shows that from the time
Joyce Alexander entered her home to that of the fatal shot, the appellant, and
not she, took, and kept throughout, the initiative of the events leading to her
death. He was evidently waiting for her arrival. He started the quarrel during
which she retaliated. The dispute subsided with the intervention of the husband
and, as instructed by the latter, she proceeded to the wash-room. Appellant
went to his room, then proceeded to the wash-room, called her a dirty name,
causing her to retaliate in a similar fashion, and then shot, or shot without
anything being said.

[Page 410]

On this evidence, appellant cannot justify or
excuse his actions in saying that he was facing a situation characterized with
suddenness, unexpectedness or lack of premonition He had and kept the
initiative of the situation in which he found himself. There was no sudden
provocation on the part of Joyce Alexander causing sudden retaliation on his
part. On this view that there was no evidence of sudden provocation within the
meaning of the section, there was no duty for the trial judge to charge the
jury on the matter and it is unnecessary to consider the minute criticism which
counsel for the appellant made of the address of the trial judge in the matter.

Assuming there was such evidence, I must say
that no fault can be found as to the manner in which the trial judge dealt with
the question. The only submission as to which comment may be found necessary is
the alleged omission of the trial judge to direct the jury that, in order to
decide whether the appellant was actually provoked, they had to take into
consideration the question of drunkenness. The jury having been told that there
were two distinct defences, i.e., that of provocation and that of drunkenness,
the trial judge proceeding to deal with the first, invited them to consider the
question in two stages: (i) Whether an ordinary person would be deprived
of his self-control because of anything said or done by the deceased woman and (ii)
Whether the accused had been actually provoked by her conduct. With respect
to the first question, he told them: “At this stage you must not consider the
character, background, temperament, or condition of the accused”, implying that
such matters were not ruled out of the consideration in the second stage. With
respect to the second question, he instructed them to consider the “background,
temperament, psychological background” of the accused, the concluding
directions in the matter being reported as follows in the transcript of the
charge:

I think I mentioned to you the fact that if
you get over the hurdle of whether the ordinary man would be provoked and
decided that this man was also provoked, you can also consider how drunk he
was, and that is something which you should take into consideration.

With the following opening sentence, he then
proceeded to deal with the defence of drunkenness: “The other defence is that
of drunkenness itself”.

[Page 411]

Counsel for the Crown suggested and, I think,
rightly so, that what the trial judge is reported to have said when concluding
his instructions on provocation, is, in part, in accurately reported in the
transcript in that he did not say “and decided”, but said “in deciding”. Be
that as it may, read as a whole, I think that the address in the matter makes
it clear that the jury were instructed that it was their duty to consider the
condition of drunkenness of the accused to decide whether he had acted on
provocation.

The Hodge’s Case[2] rule. The proposition that the trial
judge erred in failing to instruct the jury in accordance with the rule in the Hodge’s
Case is predicated on the submission that there was no direct evidence
that: (i) the appellant had a gun when he entered the wash-room, (ii) that
the appellant was the one who fired a shot and (iii) that if the
appellant did fire the shot, such was not accidental or in self-defence or the
result of provocation by the deceased in the wash-room. Hence it is said that
there is only circumstantial evidence both as to actus reus and mens
rea.

From all the facts preceding, accompanying and
following the fatal shot, and particularly from the fact that when Joyce
Alexander proceeded to the wash-room, for the purpose indicated, she had no
knowledge that the appellant would follow her to that room, and much less
knowledge as to where the revolver was, and from the direct evidence of what
was heard to take place, either instantaneously or in quick succession, in the
wash-room, a reasonable jury, even applying the Hodge rule, could only,
if acting judicially, in the absence of evidence explaining it away, reach the
conclusion that appellant, having entered the room, produced his revolver and
fired it at the woman, either at once or upon the exchange of insults. It was
no part of the case for the prosecution, as suggested in (iii) above,
but for the defence to explain away this fact attending actus reus and mens
rea, by evidence showing accident, or self-defence, or sudden retaliation
to sudden provocation, or drunkenness affecting the capacity to form the
relevant specific intent. Appellant is presumed to have intended the natural
consequences of his act and, as stated by Lord Birkenhead in the Beard Case[3], this presumption is not

[Page 412]

rebutted by evidence of drunkenness falling
short of an incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime. The defences of drunkenness and provocation were
adequately put before the jury and rejected by them. Accident or self-defence
were not raised at trial, nor is there any evidence in support thereof.

On these views, this ground of appeal is
ill-founded and it is unnecessary to deal with the real purport and limits of
application of the Hodge’s Case rule or with what was said by this Court
in this regard, with respect to the particular circumstances in the case of Lizotte
v. The King[4].

I would dismiss the appeal.

LOCKE J.:—The questions of law upon which leave
to appeal was granted are stated in other reasons to be delivered in this
matter.

I consider that the judge’s charge adequately
and accurately stated the law to the jury in regard to the defence of
drunkenness.

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
provocation within the meaning of that expression as it is used in s. 203  of
the Criminal Code  and, accordingly, this was not a ground upon which the
offence committed might be reduced to manslaughter.

As the evidence of the witness Kish shows, when
Joyce Alexander returned to the premises where she lived with her husband, the
appellant was the aggressor in the dispute and the struggle which was followed
within a very few minutes by her death. According to Kish, after reproaching
the woman for failing to keep an appointment with him that afternoon, the
appellant attempted forcibly to take off her shoes, saying that he had given
them to her, and this precipitated a struggle in which each struck the other.
After failing to remove the shoes, he forcibly removed her skirt and
immediately thereafter the two commenced throwing dishes at one another. At
this stage, the woman’s husband appeared and stopped them and, as his wife was
bleeding from a cut at the back of her neck, told her to go into the adjoining
wash‑room to remove the blood. How the woman received this wound is not
explained. She then

[Page 413]

walked into the wash-room through a door which
was standing almost wide open and, according to Alexander, she was immediately followed
by the appellant and, within a matter of a few seconds, the shot was fired
which caused her death. Kish, however, said that after the woman went to the
wash-room the appellant went to another room in the house and returned
apparently immediately thereafter and went into the wash-room. He was then
heard by Kish to call the woman a vile name and she thereupon called him one
equally objectionable and the shot followed immediately. Alexander’s account
and that of Kish differ in this respect that it was only the latter who said
that the appellant left the room and returned before going into the wash-room
and Alexander did not remember hearing his wife and the appellant calling each
other names while in the wash-room. Also, while Alexander said that it was a
matter of seconds between the time that the appellant went into the wash-room
and the time the shot was heard, Kish said it was “a couple of minutes”.

While the door of the wash-room was open,
apparently the woman and the appellant were not visible to Kish and Alexander
when the shot was heard. Immediately thereafter the appellant came out of the
wash-room with a revolver in his hand and, after menacing Kish and Alexander
with it, left the room and was shortly after arrested on the premises.
Alexander, entering the wash-room, found his wife lying dying upon the floor
and she shortly afterwards expired. The revolver which the police took from the
appellant was loaded, with the exception of one chamber from which a shot had
been discharged, and it was this bullet that killed Joyce Alexander.

It will be seen from this account that it was
the appellant who provoked, first, the argument, and then, the struggle with
the woman and, as the evidence of Kish showed, it was he who first applied to
her a vile name when he followed her into the wash-room. In my opinion, under
these circumstances, it cannot be successfully contended that if the accused
became angered “on the sudden” he was provoked by the actions of the woman
which followed upon his assaulting her in the manner described. An accused
person who provokes another to fight by striking or abusing him and is struck
in self-defence and kills such person in

[Page 414]

an ensuing struggle cannot, in my opinion,
escape conviction for murder by saying that the killing was committed in the
heat of passion. It was the unlawful act of assaulting the woman that led to
whatever steps she took to defend herself, and what occurred in the wash-room
when the shot was fired was merely a continuation of the struggle which had started
in the adjoining room, whether, as Alexander stated, the appellant followed her
immediately into the wash-room or after a short interval.

In these circumstances, there was, in my
opinion, no evidence of provocation within the meaning of s.203 . The learned
trial judge, considering that there should be a question left to the jury on
the point, in a passage of his charge used language which, with respect,
appears to me to have been ambiguous in referring to the bearing that the
drunkenness of the appellant might have upon the matter. Since, however, the
appellant was not entitled to have the issue put to the jury, in my opinion no
consequences injurious to the accused resulted.

The third question is based upon the failure of
the learned trial judge to charge the jury in accordance with the instructions
in Hodge’s Case[5].

The only respect in which any portion of the
evidence could be said to be circumstantial was due to the fact that no witness
saw the shot actually fired: accordingly, that it was fired by the appellant
was a matter of inference. The rest of the evidence upon which the appellant
was found guilty was direct. As the examination of the record shows, the
learned trial judge told the jury that, upon the evidence, no question of
accident or self-defence arose and it was proven that the woman was killed by a
shot fired from the revolver which the appellant had in his hand when he came
out of the wash-room.

The rule in Hodge’s Case is to be
followed when the evidence relied upon is wholly or to a material extent
circumstantial. In my opinion, however, in the circumstances of this case when
no other inference was possible than that the appellant had fired the fatal
shot, any such instruction to the jury was unnecessary.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 415]

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This is an
appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court on November 18, 1958,
from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an
appeal from the conviction of the appellant on September 12, 1958, after trial
before Stewart J. and a jury on a charge of the murder of Joyce Alexander.

The questions of law on which leave to appeal
was granted were as follows:

1. Did the learned trial judge err in
failing to instruct the jury in accordance with the rule in Hodge’s case?

2. Did the learned trial judge err in his
charge to the jury in regard to the defence of provocation?

3. Did the learned trial judge err in his
charge to the jury in regard to the defence of drunkenness?

I find it necessary to deal only with the second
of these questions and as, in my opinion, there should be a new trial I do not
propose to make any extended reference to the evidence.

It was not suggested that the death of Joyce
Alexander was not caused by a bullet fired from a revolver in the hand of the
appellant. The shooting took place in a wash-room in a basement apartment at
499 Hamilton Road, London, Ontario, the door of which was open so that the
witnesses in the room off which the wash-room opened could hear although they
could not see what went on between the appellant and the victim in the very
short period of time that elapsed between the former following the latter into
the wash-room and the firing of the fatal shot.

Without going into the details of the evidence
it may safely be affirmed that it would have been open to the jury to find such
provocation as would reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.

No exception is taken to the manner in which the
learned trial judge charged the jury as to how they should approach the
question whether the acts and insults alleged to constitute provocation were of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control. He made it plain that on this branch of the inquiry no account
should be taken of the idiosyncrasies of the appellant and that the standard to
be applied was that of an ordinary person.

[Page 416]

What is said to constitute a fatal defect in the
charge is the alleged failure of the learned trial judge to make it clear to
the jury that in approaching the question whether the appellant was in fact
provoked and fired the shot in the ‘heat of passion caused by the provocation
they were entitled, and indeed bound, to take into consideration his condition
of drunkenness.

After dealing with the question whether an
ordinary person would have been provoked, the learned trial judge continued:

If you do not think so then you can forget
all about provocation as a ground for reducing the charge from murder to
manslaughter. If you do think, if you do think that there was provocation, that
is that an ordinary man would be provoked to violence, then the next thing you
have to decide is was the accused provoked to violence to such an extent
that he suddenly lost control and committed the act which he did? In doing that
you are entitled to consider the background of the individual. Now this is a
difficult problem for you, but let me repeat: it is not provocation until the
ordinary man would be provoked to violence. Forget about the ordinary man and say
was the accused provoked, and if so you can say why. You have already answered
that by saying the ordinary man would be provoked, but to determine whether or
not the accused was provoked take into consideration his background,
temperament, psychological background, and, if he was provoked, did he do this
in the heat of the moment suddenly, or did he have the power to reflect,
because provocation is only a defence in law if acted upon immediately and
before there is power to reflect.

The learned judge then reviewed the evidence
bearing on the question whether the appellant was in fact provoked; in so doing
he made no mention of his drunkenness. He concluded this part of his charge as
follows:

I think I mentioned to you the fact that if
you get over the hurdle of whether the ordinary man would be provoked, and
decided that this man was also provoked, you can also consider how drunk he
was, and that is something which you should take into consideration.

From this last quoted passage it seems to me
that the jury would understand that it was not until after they had decided (i)
that an ordinary person would be provoked and (ii) that the appellant was in
fact provoked that they could consider how drunk he was.

This view is strengthened by the circumstance
that the learned trial judge immediately proceeded to deal with the defence of
drunkenness as a separate defence, and his charge contains such statements as
the following:

Now the test, so far as drunkenness is
concerned, is, has it, has drunkenness, so affected the mind that it has caused
a lack of capacity in the accused to form the intent to do what he did? If
drunkenness only

[Page 417]

extends to the extent that the man was so
affected as to be more inclined to fight, more belligerent, more argumentative,
more disposed to, let us say, shoot, that is not enough. Before drunkenness can
be a defence there must be inebriety to such an extent that the man is
incapable of forming a specific intent essential to constitute the crime.

I do not suggest that this is not a perfectly
accurate direction as to the defence of drunkenness but it might well
strengthen the impression which I think had already been given to the jury that
drunkenness did not enter into the question of provocation in fact.

After reading and re-reading the charge in its
entirety it is my opinion (i) that at no point in his charge did the
learned trial judge make it clear to the jury that in dealing with the question
whether the accused was in fact provoked they should consider his condition of
drunkenness and (ii) that certain passages in the charge would tend to give the
jury the impression that they should not so consider it.

In my respectful view, this was non-direction
amounting to misdirection which may well have affected the verdict of the jury.

It could not be seriously contended that on all
the evidence a jury, acting reasonably, might not have found a verdict of
manslaughter and there is no room for the application of s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code .

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and order a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Theft—Admissibility of statement of
accused—Whether dissent on question of law—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, s. 597(1)(a).

The appellant was convicted on a charge of theft and appealed
on the ground that a statement made by him had been wrongfully admitted at
trial. The majority in the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction

[Page 370]

on the ground that the conviction did not
depend upon the admissibility of the statement, and that, in any event, there
had been no injustice done. The dissenting judge considered that the statement
had been improperly admitted and was highly prejudicial to the appellant.

Held: The conviction must be affirmed.

This Court was without jurisdiction as there was no dissent on
any ground of law. The judgment of the majority resulted from an examination of
the evidence, while the dissenting judgment was as to the sufficiency of the
evidence for a conviction, which is a question of fact.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division, affirming the conviction of the appellant by McLaurin C.J.
Appeal dismissed.

A. M. Harradence, for the appellant.

H. J. Wilson, Q.C., and J. W. Anderson,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—The
appellant was convicted by the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the
Province of Alberta sitting without a jury on a charge that whilst an employee
of Alberta Pacific Grain Co. (1943) Ltd. he did fraudulently and without colour
of right convert to his own use certain goods:—grain of a total quantity of
approximately 11,300 bushels of a total value of about $8,863, the property of
the said company, and did thereby commit a theft contrary to the Criminal Code  of
Canada. An appeal from that conviction was dismissed by the Appellate Division
with Mr. Justice Hugh John Macdonald dissenting. The respondent alleges that
there is no dissent on a question of law within s. 597 (1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  and therefore no appeal to this Court. This argument is entitled to
prevail.

The reasons for judgment of the majority of the Appellate
Division are very short and read as follows:

The majority of the Court think that the conviction for
theft does not depend upon the admissibility of the statement of the accused
that was admitted in evidence by the learned Trial Judge.

[Page 371]

It is our opinion that quite apart from
this statement there is ample evidence in the sales of grain by him to prove
the offence of theft as charged, and that no injustice has been done to the
accused in the verdict of guilty. Therefore, without arriving at any decision
on the question of admissibility of the statement, we dismiss the appeal, and
affirm the conviction. The time in custody pending the appeal will be allowed
to count on the term of imprisonment.

The important parts of the dissenting judgment are as
follows :

Amongst the grounds raised on appeal is a submission that
the learned Chief Justice improperly admitted a statement of the accused. That
statement was admitted in the trial as Exhibit 2, and is unequivocably a
confession of guilt.

On the voir dire, an attempt was made by counsel for the
defence to show by cross-examination that the statement was not voluntary.

Counsel for the appellant contends that the learned Chief
Justice admitted the statement before counsel was given an opportunity of
advising the Court if the defence would call evidence. On the voir dire on the
question of admissibility two witnesses were called by the Crown, namely,
Albert William Meston and Timothy James Corkery. Meston was examined and
cross-examined, followed by Corkery's examination and cross-examination. At the
conclusion of the cross-examination of Corkery, according to the record, there
were remarks by Mr. Thurgood for the Crown and the learned Chief Justice as
follows:

""Mr. THURGOOD: That is all I
have in connection with this matter, my Lord. My learned friend has the right
to call witnesses.

THE COURT: That is all, Mr.
Corkery. You might—we have been conducting a trial within a trial, Mr. Corkery,
you might just withdraw and we will have you back later. Oh, I think I will let
it in. Recall Mr. Meston.""

Counsel stated on the hearing of the appeal that it was his
intention to call such evidence on the voir dire, but owing to the ruling made
by the learned Chief Justice he was denied such opportunity. The defence must
be given every opportunity to show that any statement of an accused, proposed
to be tendered in evidence, was not voluntary. I have reached the conclusion
that in the case at bar the defence was not given such opportunity.

It seems to me that the confession of the accused was
improperly admitted at trial. That confession was of a very damaging character
and was highly prejudicial to the accused. Its admission could very well have
changed the strategy of the defence in the trial.

I do not think that the remaining evidence conclusively
establishes the guilt of the accused. I would accordingly quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

It is apparent that the majority of the Appellate Division
in the first part of their reasons in using the word ""admissibility""
were referring to the question whether the statement of the accused was
properly admitted and

[Page 372]

that in the second paragraph they decided that if the
statement were improperly admitted then, within the meaning of s. 592 (1)(b) of
the Code, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. There is no
doubt as to the rule referred to by counsel for the appellant that the onus
rests on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have
been the same if a charge to a jury had been correct or if no evidence had been
improperly admitted: Schmidt v. The King1. On this branch of the
case the judgment of the majority resulted from an examination of the evidence
while the dissenting judgment was as to the sufficiency of the evidence for a
conviction which is a question of fact. There was no dissent on any ground of
law dealt with by the dissenting judge and upon which there was a disagreement
in the Appellate Division and therefore this Court is without jurisdiction: The
King v. Décary2; Rozon v. The King3.

The appeal should be dismissed but the time spent in custody
allowed to count on the term of imprisonment.

Appeal dissmissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Bribery—Conspiracy—Minister
of the Crown—Whether an ""official""—Offences under the old Code—Prosecution
commenced after coming into force of new Code—Whether limitation period
provided by old Code applicable—Effect of transitional provisions in new Code—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, ss. 158, 1140—Criminal Code , 1958—54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 102(e), 745, 746.

The appellants were charged under ss. 158(1) (e) and
573 of the former Criminal Code , S, for accepting bribes from his co-accused
while he was the Minister of Lands and Forests of British Columbia, and the
others for giving these bribes, and all of them, for conspiracy to commit these
offences. They were convicted by a jury and the verdict was affirmed by a
majority in the Court of Appeal. In this Court, the two questions of law involved
were: (1) whether a Minister of the Crown in the Province of British Columbia
is an ""official"" within the meaning of s. 158(1)(e) of the
former Code; and (2) whether the prosecution was barred by s. 1140(1) (b)(i)
of the former Code.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

A Minister of the Crown in British Columbia is an
""official"" within the meaning of s. 158(1)(e) of the former
Code. It is impossible to agree with the proposition that s. 158(1)(e)
applies only to non-political officials as distinguished from political
officials. At common law, corruption of any official, either judicial or
ministerial, is an offence, and with respect to ministerial officers, an
offence in the essence of which the distinction between political and non-political
officers has no significance. The history of the Canadian statutory provisions
do not indicate, either expressly or by any kind of implication, an intention
of Parliament to make such a fundamental departure from the law as would
represent the exclusion of Ministers of the Crown and persons involved with
them in bribery, from the application of the Act.

[Page 679]

The prosecution was not barred by s. 1140(1) (b)(i) of
the former Code. The operation of this statutory limitation was conditioned by
the expiration of the time limit indicated and the failure to have, within the
same, instituted the proceedings, and before these facts could come into being,
the former Code was repealed and the new one substituted therefor. The
proceedings here were commenced after the coming into force of the new Code
which does not provide for limitation of actions with respect to offences under
s. 158. So that as s. 1140 was not the law governing in this case, there was no
longer any text of law supporting any exception to the common law principle of nullum
tempus occurrit regi. The transitional provisions of the new Code (s. 746)
indicate, by necessary implication if not in express terms, that the repeal of
the former Code did not affect any offence committed against the criminal law
prior to the repeal, and this whether proceedings for their prosecutions were
commenced or not at the time of the coming into force of the new Code. They
also prescribe, for such offences, the procedure obtaining after that time,
either in continuance or for the commencement of the proceedings. Finally, they
provide for the penalty, forfeiture or punishment to be imposed, after that
time in like cases. Thus, for the purposes of the transition, the section
specially, and exhaustively, deals with such matters which are covered, for
general purposes, in s. 19 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
158. The case here came clearly within the language of s. 746(2) (a) of
the new Code. for the substantive offences were committed prior to, but the
proceedings were commenced after, the coming into force of the new Code. So
that, with respect to procedure, these offences had to be ""dealt with,
inquired into, tried and determined"" in accordance with the provisions of
the new Code.

Finally, s. 19(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act had no
application since, in the circumstances of this case, the right claimed under
that section on behalf of the appellants never came into existence. The two
facts conditioning the coming into force of the statutory limitation, i.e.,
the expiration of the time limit and the failure to have, within the same,
commenced the proceedings, never came and never could possibly come into being,
because of the change in the adiective law.

APPEALS from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the conviction of the appellants. Appeals
dismissed.

A. E. Branca, Q.C., and N.
Mussallem, for the appellant, Sommers.

J. R. Nicholson, for the
appellants Gray and Others.

V. L. Dryer, Q.C., and G.
L. Murray, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The appellants Robert
E. Sommers, H. Wilson Gray, Pacific Coast Services Ltd., and Evergreen Lumber
Sales Ltd., were convicted before Wilson J. and a

[Page 680]

jury, at the assizes held in and
for the county of Vancouver in the province of British Columbia, of offences
under sections 158(1) (e) and 573 of the former Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1927 c. 36, to wit: (i) Sommers, of accepting bribes from his co-accused,
and the latter, of giving him these bribes while he was an official of the
government, i.e Minister of Lands and Forests of the province; and (ii) All of
them, of conspiracy to commit these indictable offences.

The verdict, having been appealed
to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, was affirmed by a majority
decision[2], Davey
J. A. dissenting on two questions of law which now, and pursuant to s. 597(1)
(a) of the new Code, form the basis of these appeals by Sommers and his co-accused.

The first of these two questions
which, if answered negatively, as was done by the dissenting judge, strikes at
the root of all the convictions, is:

Whether or not a Minister of
the Crown in the Province of British Columbia is an official within the
meaning of s. 158(1)(e) of the old Code.

The parts of s. 158 which are
relevant, as well as those which are referred to in the dissent, read as
follows:

158. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence who,

(a) makes any offer,

of such official or person to promote either the procuring of any

dissenting judge have been italicized.)

It was recognized in the Courts
below and conceded here by counsel for the appellants that, taken in its
ordinary and natural sense, the word ""official"" is wide enough to
include a Minister of the Crown. It is suggested, however, that there are
reasons pointing to ""official"" as meaning, under this provision, non
political officials of the permanent Civil Service and officials holding
government offices analogous thereto, as distinguished from Ministers of the Crown
who are political and non permanent officials. A like distinction, it is said,
is recognized in Anson's The Law and Custom of the Constitution, 3rd ed., vol.
2, part 2,

[Page 682]

p. 69, and also in The Senate
and House of Commons Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 249, s. 10 and The
Constitution Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 65, s. 23, both of these Acts
forbidding any person in receipt of any salary, fee or emolument from the
government, to be a member of the House of Commons or the Provincial
Legislature, respectively. That Parliament intended such a distinction to
obtain in the matter here under consideration flows, it is suggested, from
various inferences to be drawn from: (i) the association of the word
""official"" with the words ""employee of the government"" in
s. 158(1) (e); (ii) the particular provisions of s. 158(1)(f), (g)
and (h) of the old Code and those of s. 102 which, in the new Code, is
the counter-part of s. 158, and (iii) the scale of punishment prescribed for
corruption of various officials according to the importance of their position
and the seriousness of their offence.

With deference, I am unable to
agree with the proposition that s. 158(1)(e) applies only to non-political
officials as distinguished from political officials.

At common law, corruption of any
official, either judicial or ministerial, is an offence, and with respect to
ministerial officers, an offence in the essence of which the distinction
between political and non-political officers has no significance. This clearly
appears from what was said in 1769 by Lord Mansfield in Vaughan's case[3], and
applied, as still being a true statement of the common law, nearly two
centuries later, in 1914, by Lawrance J., in Whitaker[4].
In Vaughan's case,
the accused was charged with an attempt to bribe a Privy Councillor, the First
Lord of the Treasury. Noting that where it is an offence to take a bribe, it is
an offence to give it, the question, said Lord Mansfield, was whether a
""great officer"", at the head of the Treasury and in the King's
confidence, could not be guilty of a crime by selling his interest with the
King, in procuring the office sought by the accused. He said:—""A terrible
consequence will result to the public if everything that such an officer is
concerned in advising the disposal of, should be set up for sale"". The
answer was that an offer to bribe a Privy

[Page 683]

Councillor constituted, as well
as an offer to bribe a Judge, a criminal offence at common law and the
conviction of the accused was affirmed.

In 1883, Parliament adopted the
first Canadian statutory provisions dealing with the matter of corruption of
ministerial officials. The Act, which is 46 Victoria, c. 32, is entitled
""An Act for the better prevention of fraud in relation to contracts
involving the expenditure of public monies."" Sections 1, 2 and 3 form the
three substantive provisions, section 3 being the source of s. 158(1)(e)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. In these three substantive
sections, the word ""officer"" is associated with the words
""employee of the government"" or ""person in the employment of the
government"". In my view, neither this association of words nor anything
else in the Act of 1883 indicates, either expressly or by any kind of
implication, an intention of Parliament to make such a fundamental departure
from the law as would represent the exclusion of Ministers of the Crown and
persons involved with them in bribery, from the application of the Act. A
rational and reasonable raison d'être of this association of words is to
cover, amongst other cases, that of a Minister of the Crown who is not an
""employee"" or a ""person in the employment of the
government"", but part of the government and who, as such, was and still is
recognized, both under the common law and, as will be shown hereafter, under the
Canadian statutory law, as an ""officer"" of the government. An intent
to bring such a limitation to the scope of the law is inconsistent with the
very title of the Act of 1883, to which one is entitled to refer for the
purposes of throwing light on the construction of the Act. Maxwell On
Interpretation of Statutes, 9th ed., p. 44.

Nor can such an intent be found
in the language of the provisions of the ensuing legislation involving, in this
respect, no modification of the Act of 1883:—(i) The Revised Statutes of
1886, c. 173 reproduce the provisions of the Act of 1883, in sections 20 to
24 inclusively; (ii) ""An Act respecting Frauds upon the
Government"", 54-55 Vict., c. 23, (1891), where, for the first time,
the word ""official"" is substituted for the word ""officer"",
and where the provisions of section (1) (e) are identical with s. 158(1)
(e) of

[Page 684]

the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36; (iii) The first Criminal Code of 1892, 55-56 Victoria, c.
29, where the provisions of s. 133 are similar to those of s. 158 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36.

Furthermore, it is to be assumed
that Parliament used the word ""officer"" or the word
""official"" in their ordinary and natural sense. These words,
particularly in view of the provisions of the interpretation section, i.e. s.
155, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, include a Minister of the Crown. There are many
statutory enactments where the word ""officer"" is used in clear
reference to or designation of the holder of the highest government ministerial
offices. Of these statutory provisions, the following may be mentioned:—Section
58 of the B.N.A. Act refers to the Lieutenant-Governor of a province as
an ""officer""; in the provisions of s. 31(l) and (m) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, there is a clear implication that a Minister of the
Crown is an ""officer""; section 2 of c. 253 of The Solicitor
General of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1952, authorizes the Governor in Council to
appoint an ""officer"" called the Solicitor General; The Demise of
the Crown Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 65, as well as its original predecessor, The
Act respecting Commissions, and Oaths of Allegiance and of Office, 1868, 31
Vict., c. 36, with reference to the continuance in office in the event of a
demise of the Crown, covers the case of every ministerial or judicial officer
by the following words:—""any officer of Canada, any functionary in Canada,
or any judge of a Dominion or Provincial Court in Canada."" It may be added
that, while the matter must be determined on the language used by Parliament in
s. 158(1)(e), the Act respecting the Constitution of the Province
R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 65, designates, in s. 9, the Prime Minister and the other
Ministers constituting, with the Lieutenant-Governor, the Executive Council of
the province, as ""officials"". The cases of MacArthur v. The
King[5]
and Belleau v. Minister of National Health and Welfare et al.,[6]
quoted by counsel for the appellants, are only relevant to illustrate that the
natural meaning of a word may, because of the context in which it is found, or
the origin of the statutory enactment

[Page 685]

in which it appears, or the
judicial history of such enactment, be restricted for the purpose of a
particular Act or a particular provision thereof. These cases respectively
decide that the meaning of the term ""officer or servant of the Crown"",
in s. 19(c), and the term ""officer of the Crown"", in s. 30(c),
of the Exchequer Court Act , do not include a Minister of the Crown.

The contention that the word
""official"" in s. 158(1)(e) is used in a restricted sense, is
predicated, in law, on the rule of interpretation according to which the same
meaning is implied by the use of the same expression in every part of an Act
and, in fact, on the association of the word ""official"" with the word
""Minister"" in s. 158(1) (f) and with the words ""Head of
the Department"" in sections 158(1) (g) and (h), or with
similar words under s. 102 of the new Code, the counter-part of s. 158 of the
old Code. This rule of interpretation is only tantamount to a presumption, and
furthermore, a presumption which is not of much weight. For the same word may
be used in different senses in the same statute: Whitley v. Stumbles[7]
and even in the same section Doe v. Angell[8].
The case of The Queen v. Allen[9]
shows that the interpretation contended for by the appellants does not obtain in
cases where, as in the present. it would, in the result, leave untouched a
portion of the mischief aimed at by the enactment. In these views, it is
unnecessary to consider the argument submitted by the parties on the question
whether one may validly resort to the new Code by the purpose of interpreting
the earlier one.

Finally, and for the reason that
the punishment prescribed in s. 158(1) (e) would be, if applicable to a
Minister of the Crown, out of proportion with the more severe punishment
provided in other sections in the case of less important ministerial officers,
it is suggested that one must infer that the word ""official"" in s.
158(1) (e) does not include a Minister of the Crown. The premise of this
reasoning is quite inapt, in my view, to convey an implied intent of Parliament
to render immune from prosecution, under s. 158(1) (e), a Minister of
the Crown and other persons involved with him in bribery.

[Page 686]

Before parting with the
consideration of this first question of law, it may be added that it was
contended, in the Court of Appeal, that the case of a Minister of the Crown was
to be dealt with by impeachment and not in the ordinary way before the Criminal
Courts. This submission was abandoned in the Court below, as well as before
this Court.

The second question of law upon
which there was a dissent in the Court of Appeal is:

Whether or not the
prosecution for the substantive offences, as distinguished from the charge of
conspiracy, was barred by the provisions of s. 1140(1) (b) (i) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36.

The question arises out of the
following circumstances. Section 1140 deals with limitation of actions in the
case of certain indictable offences including those under s. 158. With respect
to offences under the latter section, s. 1140(1) (b) (i) provides that
no prosecution shall be commenced after the expiration of two years from their
commission. If, as contended by counsel for the appellants, s. 1140(1) (b)
(i) is the law governing in this case, the question must admittedly be answered
affirmatively, for the prosecution of these substantive offences was commenced
after the expiration of the two years from their commission. However, the
operation of this statutory limitation is conditioned by the expiration of the
time limit indicated and the failure to have, within the same, instituted the
proceedings, and before these two facts could come into being, the old Code was
repealed and the new Code was substituted therefor. The proceedings in this
case were commenced after the coming into force of the new Code which, while
still providing for limitation of actions in the case of some of the indictable
offences mentioned in s. 1140, did not do so with respect to others, including
those described in s. 158. So that if, as contended by counsel for the
respondent, s. 1140(1) (b) (i). is not the law governing in this case,
the answer to the question must clearly be negative, for there is no longer any
text of law supporting any exception to the common law principle nullum
tempus occurrit regi.

Anticipating that situations of a
character similar to that of the one here considered would naturally arise,
during the transitional period consequential to the repeal of the

[Page 687]

old Code and the substitution
therefor of the new one, Parliament has, in Part XXV of the latter, entitled
""Transitional and Consequential"", enacted special provisions of a
transitional nature respecting proceedings and punishment. These provisions are
to be found in section 746.

Section 746 reads as follows:

746. (1) Where proceedings
for an offence against the criminal law were commenced before the coming into
force of this Act, the offence shall, after the coming into force of this Act,
be dealt with, inquired into, tried and determined in accordance with this Act,
and any penalty, forfeiture or punishment in respect of that offence shall be
imposed as if this Act had not come into force, but where, under this Act, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment in respect of the offence is reduced or
mitigated in relation to the penalty, forfeiture or punishment that would have
been applicable if this Act had not come into force, the provisions of this Act
relating to penalty, forfeiture and punishment shall apply.

(2) Where proceedings for an
offence against the criminal law are commenced after the coming into force of
this Act the following provisions apply, namely,

(a) the offence,
whenever committed, shall be dealt with, inquired into, tried and determined in
accordance with this Act;

(b) if the offence
was committed before the coming into force of this Act, the penalty, forfeiture
or punishment to be imposed upon conviction for that offence shall be the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment authorized or required to be imposed by this
Act or by the law that would have applied if this Act had not come into force,
whichever penalty, forfeiture or punishment is the less severe; and

(c) if the offence is
committed after the coming into force of this Act, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment to be imposed upon conviction for that offence shall be the penalty,
forfeiture or punishment authorized or required to be imposed by this Act.

The provisions of this section
indicate, by necessary implication if not in express terms, that the repeal of
the former Code does not affect any offence committed against criminal law
prior to the repeal, and this whether proceedings for their prosecution were
commenced or not at the time of the coming into force of the new Code. They
also prescribe, for such offences, the procedure obtaining after that time,
either in continuance or for the commencement of the proceedings. And they
finally provide for the penalty, forfeiture or punishment to be imposed, after
that time, in like cases. Thus, for the purposes of the transition from the
former to the new Code, the section specially, and, in my view, exhaustively,
deals with such matters which are covered, for general purposes, in s. 19 of
the Interpretation

[Page 688]

Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, in paragraphs (1) (d)
and (e) and (2) (b), (c) and (d). Hence, there is
no necessity to resort to these provisions of s. 19 of the Interpretation
Act to find, as it was contended by counsel for the appellants, an
authority for the commencement or continuance of proceedings for the
prosecution of such offences, or to determine which of the former or the new
Code, should these proceedings, at any phase of a case, and the sanctions of
the law, be in accordance with. These special provisions of s. 746 would be
futile if the matters they regulate were to be determined by reference to these
general provisions of s. 19 of the Interpretation Act.

The case here under consideration
clearly comes within the language of s. 746(2) (a), for the substantive
offences were committed prior to but the proceedings were commenced after the
coming into force of the new Code. So that, with respect to procedure, these
offences had to be dealt with, inquired into, tried and determined in
accordance with the provisions of the new Code. The provisions of s. 1140(1) (b)
(i), limiting the time within which a prosecution under s. 158(1) (e)
may be commenced, being undoubtedly merely procedural, ceased from the date of
the coming into force of the new Code, to be afterwards effective with respect
to proceedings commenced after that date. And as there is no text of law, in
the new Code, to support, in the matter, an exception to the common law
principle nullum tempus occurrit regi, a prosecution for an offence
committed prior to the new Code, under s. 158(1) (e), can no longer be
subject to any limitation of action. With deference, I cannot attach, as did
the learned dissenting judge, any significance to the lack of reference to the
provisions of s. 1140 in s. 746(2) (a) of the new Code. The language of
s. 746(2) (a) is clear, unambiguous, imperative and all-embracing; it
must be given its effect.

In these views, only one further
point requires consideration. Reference was made to s. 19(1) (c) of the Interpretation
Act providing that:

19. (1) Where any Act or
enactment is repealed, or where any regulation is revoked, then, unless the
contrary intention appears, such repeal or revocation does not, save as in this
section otherwise provided,

(a)

[Page 689]

(b) 

(c) affect any right,
privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under
the Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked.

Counsel for the appellants
submitted that these provisions are effective to protect, against the
consequences of the repeal of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, and
of the substitution therefor of the new Code, any right acquired, accrued or
accruing under the former, including, it is said, a right for the appellants to
oppose as a defence, in the prosecution for the substantive offences under s.
158(1) (e), the limitation of action provided in s. 1140(1) (b)
(i).

These provisions of s. 19(1) (c)
of the Interpretation Act deal with substantive rights which, subject to
the qualifications of the opening words of the section, they aim to protect
against the consequences of the repeal of the Act under which their existence
is claimed. Had the time limit under the former Code expired before the new
Code came into force, the question, then being entirely different from the one
here considered, would call for other considerations. In the circumstances of
this case, the right claimed on behalf of appellants never came into existence.
The two facts conditioning the coming into play of the statutory limitation,
i.e., the expiration of the time limit and the failure to have, within the
same, commenced the proceedings, never came and never could possibly come into
being, because of the change in the adjective law.

In The King v. Chandra
Dharma[10],
the prosecution was commenced more than three but less than six months after
the date of its commission; the time limit having been extended from three to
six months between the date of the commission and that of the prosecution of
the offence. On a Crown case reserved, Lord Alverstone, C. J., with the
concurrence of Lawrance, Kennedy, Channell and Phillimore JJ., having said, at
page 338, that statutes which make alterations in procedure are prima facie
retrospective, added:

It has been held that a
statute shortening the time within which proceedings can be taken is
retrospective, and it seems to me that it is impossible to give any good reason
why a statute extending the time within which proceedings may be taken should
not also be held to be retrospective.

[Page 690]

The law, as stated in that case,
has been followed by this Court in McGrath v. Scriven and McLeod1,
affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia2. The
decision of this Court in Upper
 Canada College v.
Smith3, quoted by counsel for the appellants, has no application
in the matter. As stated by Turgeon J.A., in Beattie v. Dorosz and
Dorosz4, the statute considered was not a statute creating a
time limit for the bringing of actions, it was a statute making unenforceable
certain oral contracts which had previously been valid and enforceable. The
question considered was whether such a statute affected contracts already
entered into.

The appeals should be dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Possession of stolen bonds—Whether
guilty knowledge—Evidence—Explanation—Whether reasonably true—Whether
inconsistent with any rational explanation—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 296.

The appellant was convicted under s. 296  of
the Criminal Code  of having in his possession stolen bonds “knowing that
they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an indictable offence”. On June 26 and July 15, 1958, the
appellant had cashed at a bank in Windsor, five bonds which had been stolen. His explanation was that he had
received the bonds from a man named Moore whom he had met at a bar in Detroit. Moore told him that he had some bonds which he wished to cash but that he
could not cross the border because he was having trouble with the Canadian
Immigration authorities. Moore
offered to pay him $100 for each bond that he cashed, and the appellant
received this payment and accounted to Moore for the rest of the proceeds.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed and the conviction affirmed.

While there were certain expressions in the
reasons of the trial judge which might indicate that he thought there were
elements of probability in the story told by the accused, on a weighing of the
story as a whole and after consideration of it, step by step, he rejected it
decisively in his conclusions that the explanation could not be reasonably
true, that it could not be believed by anyone and that there was nothing before
him whereby he could possibly believe it. There was therefore no misdirection
in the consideration of the accused’s defence.

The trial judge, furthermore, did not direct
himself that if he disbelieved the explanation he was bound to convict. On a
consideration of all the evidence, the trial judge reached the conclusion that
it was inconsistent with any rational explanation other than the guilt of the
accused. He reached and stated the conclusion that the accused “could not
possibly not have known” that the bonds were stolen.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.

E.P. Hartt, for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

[Page 653]

JUDSON J.:—The appellant was convicted under s.
296  of the Criminal Code  at Windsor, Ontario, in the County Court Judge’s
Criminal Court on two charges of having in his possession stolen Government of
Canada bonds “knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an indictable offence”. These
bonds had undoubtedly been stolen from a branch of the Bank of Montreal in the Province of Quebec on April 22 or April 23, 1958, during the course of a break-in
in which the safety deposit boxes were looted. On June 26 the appellant cashed one
of these stolen bonds having a face value of $1,000 at the Windsor branch of the Provincial Bank of Canada and on July 15, 1958, at the same
bank, he cashed four more bonds of the same denomination. He was arrested on August 27, 1958. He was duly cautioned and made
no statement but two days later, on August 29, he did make a statement to the
police in which he gave an explanation similar to the one which he gave at the
trial. His explanation was that he had received the bonds from a man named
Moore whom he had met in a bar in the city of Detroit. He said that Moore
explained that he had the bonds which he wished to cash but could not cross the
border because he was having trouble with the Canadian Immigration authorities.
He offered to pay the appellant $100 for each bond that he cashed and the
appellant said that he received this payment and accounted for the rest of the
proceeds to the person from whom he had received the bonds.

The sole theory of the defence was that the
accused had offered an explanation of his possession of the bonds which might
reasonably be true, and the main ground of appeal to this Court was that the
learned trial judge had misdirected himself in his consideration of this
defence. The duties of a trial judge in connection with this defence are well
defined and they have been authoritatively stated by this Court in Richler
v. The King[1], in the
following paragraph at p. 103:

The question, therefore, to which it was
the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was
convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the
explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the
Crown

[Page 654]

had discharged the onus of satisfying the
learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the
accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.

The error assigned by counsel for the appellant
is that the learned trial judge did actually find that the explanation given by
the accused might reasonably be true but that, in spite of this, he proceeded
to convict because the accused should have known that the bonds were stolen. If
this were so, the appeal would succeed because an approach such as this would
place an onus on the accused of offering an exculpatory explanation going
beyond the bounds laid down by the authorities. I am, however, satisfied that
the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge are not open to this
construction. While there are certain expressions in the reasons which might
indicate that he thought there were elements of probability in the story told
by the accused, on a weighing of the story as a whole and after a consideration
of it, step by step, he rejected it decisively in the following conclusion:

The explanation that the accused has given
on the stand, by his actions and all that he has done all through these
transactions, could not reasonably be true, and the explanation could not be
believed by anyone, and there is nothing before me whereby I could possibly
believe it, and that being the case, all I can do is find the accused guilty as
charged.

It was also argued for the appellant that the
learned trial judge erred in law in that he directed himself that if he
disbelieved the explanation of the accused he was bound to convict. In my
opinion the learned judge did not so direct himself. He appears on a
consideration of all the evidence to have reached the conclusion that it was
inconsistent with any rational explanation other than the guilt of the accused.
He clearly reached and stated the conclusion that the appellant “could not
possibly not have known” that the bonds were stolen.

I am, therefore, of the opinion that there was
no misdirection in this case, that the explanation offered was submitted to the
proper tests and properly weighed and that the prosecution on ample evidence
has discharged the onus as stated in the Richler case.

[Page 655]

I would dismiss the appeal. Time spent in
custody pending this appeal should count as part of the term of imprisonment
imposed by the trial judge.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Summary
convictions—Jurisdiction of magistrates—When waiver of jurisdiction required—""Commencement""
of proceedings—The Criminal Code , 1952—58 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 695, 697, 698—The
Municipalities Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 232, ss. 417, 418.

The respondent was arrested without warrant on a charge of
""driving while impaired"". He was taken the following morning before
P, a deputy magistrate appointed for the district under s. 418 of the Municipalities
Act with power to act ""only in the absence or during the illness of
the salaried Police Magistrate"". P took an information, released the
accused on bail, and adjourned the hearing. The accused was subsequently tried
and convicted by H, the regular magistrate for the district, who had returned
in the meantime. The accused moved by way of certiorari and the
conviction was quashed on the ground that H, in the circumstances, lacked
jurisdiction. This judgment was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal.
The Crown appealed by leave.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

Per Taschereau, Abbott and Martland JJ.: The word
""trial"", as used in ss. 697(4) and 698, is synonymous with the word
""hearing"", as used in s. 697(3). In enacting these provisions,
Parliament has provided for three distinct periods of time during the course of
proceedings under Part XXIV within which jurisdiction of an individual justice
or justices may be different. These three periods are as follows: (1) after the
laying of an information but prior to plea being taken, when no justice or
summary conviction Court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
determine the matter; (2) after a plea is taken but before hearing has
commenced, when the summary conviction Court that has received the plea is vested
with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, but such
jurisdiction may be waived under s. 697(4); (3) after the hearing has
commenced, when no other justice has jurisdiction except in the circumstances
set out in s. 698. Since no plea had been entered when H assumed to exercise
jurisdiction, the proceedings had not been ""commenced"" and he had
full jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing and to make the conviction.

Per Rand J.: The proceedings were ""commenced""
by the laying of the information before P and no other magistrate could then
exercise jurisdiction under the provisions of the Criminal Code  unless P
signed the waiver under s. 697(4) . P's jurisdiction, however, existed only in
the absence of H, since he had not taken a plea. He was accordingly superseded
when H returned to the district and H was fully clothed with jurisdiction.

[Page 514]

Per Locke J.: The proceedings were not
""commenced"" before P within the meaning of s. 697(4) and since no
plea was taken by him he did not acquire exclusive jurisdiction to deal with
the charge. In these circumstances, no question of waiver arose and the
proceedings before H were regularly taken.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Whittaker J[2].
quashing a conviction. Appeal allowed.

John J. Urie, for the
appellant.

J. S. P. Johnson, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau,
Abbott and Martland JJ. was delivered by

ABBOTT J.:—The respondent was
convicted before Magistrate Harris of the District of Powell River in British Columbia, for ""driving while impaired"". The jurisdiction of the
magistrate was questioned in certiorari proceedings issued in aid of a
writ of habeas corpus, in which proceedings an order was made quashing
the conviction, and that judgment was affirmed in the Court below, Davey J.A.
dissenting.

The charge was laid before
Magistrate W. L. Parkin, also of the District of Powell River, who took the
information against the accused and later granted bail to the accused and adjourned
the hearing. The trial was held on May 10, 1957, before Magistrate Harris. At
that time respondent refused to plead and objected to the jurisdiction of the
magistrate but his objection was overruled. The magistrate directed a plea of
not guilty to be entered, and proceeded with the hearing.

Magistrate Harris was appointed
as police magistrate for the Corporation of the District of Powell River by
order in council dated April 17, 1956, ""with power to exercise the jurisdiction
conferred on a Magistrate by Part XVI of the Criminal Code "". Magistrate
Parkin was on the same date appointed police magistrate for the same district
""to act only in the absence or during the illness of Magistrate
Harris"". Magistrate Harris was absent from the district when the information
was laid and the other proceedings were taken as above set out. On his return
to the district on May 3, Magistrate Harris assumed

[Page 515]

jurisdiction over the proceedings
and conducted the trial. Magistrate Parkin had not waived jurisdiction in
favour of Magistrate Harris.

The question in issue in this
appeal turns primarily upon the interpretation to be given to s. 697  of the Criminal
Code  and in arriving at such interpretation, it is necessary, I think, to
consider as well the provisions of ss. 695  and 698 .

These three sections are as
follow:

695. (1) Proceedings under
this Part shall be commenced by laying an information in Form 2.

(2) Notwithstanding any
other law that requires an information to be laid before or to be tried by two
or more justices, one justice may

(a) receive the
information,

(b) issue a summons
or warrant with respect to the information, and

(c) do all other
things preliminary to the trial.

697. (1) Nothing in this Act
or any other law shall be deemed to require a justice before whom proceedings
are commenced or who issues process before or after the trial, to be the
justice or one of the justices before whom the trial is held.

(2) Where two or more
justices have jurisdiction with respect to proceedings they shall be present
and act together at the trial, but one justice may thereafter do anything that
is required or is authorized to be done in connection with the proceedings.

(3) Subject to section 698,
in proceedings under this Part no summary conviction court other than the
summary conviction court by which the plea of an accused is taken has
jurisdiction for the purposes of the hearing and adjudication, but any justice
may

(a) adjourn the
proceedings at any time before the plea of the accused is taken, or

(b) adjourn the proceedings
at any time after the plea of the accused is taken for the purpose of enabling
the proceedings to be continued before the summary conviction court by which
the plea was taken.

(4) A summary conviction
court before which proceedings under this Part are commenced may, at any time
before the trial, waive jurisdiction over the proceedings in favour of another
summary conviction court that has jurisdiction to try the accused under this
Part.

(5) A summary conviction
court that waives jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (4) shall name the
summary conviction court in favour of which jurisdiction is waived, except
where, in the province of Quebec, the summary conviction court that waives
jurisdiction is a judge of the sessions of the peace.

698.(1) Where a trial under
this Part is commenced before a summary conviction court and a justice who is
or is a member of that summary conviction court dies or is, for any reason,
unable to continue the trial, another justice who is authorized to be, or to be
a member of, a summary conviction court for the same territorial division may
act in the place of the justice before whom the trial was commenced.

[Page 516]

(2) A justice who pursuant
to subsection (1), acts in the place of a justice before whom a trial was
commenced

(a) shall, if an
adjudication has been made by the summary conviction court, impose the
punishment or make the order that, in the circumstances, is authorized by law,
or

(b) shall, if an
adjudication has not been made by the summary conviction court, commence the
trial again as a trial de novo.

I am of opinion that the word
""trial"" as used in s. 697(4) and in s. 698 is synonymous with the
word ""hearing"" as used in s. 697(3) and that in enacting these
sections Parliament has provided for three distinct periods of time during the
course of proceedings taken under Part XXIV, within each of which periods the
jurisdiction of an individual justice or justices may be different. These three
periods are as follows: (1) after the laying of an information but prior to
plea being taken; during which period no justice or summary conviction Court is
vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter; (2) after
a plea is taken but before hearing has commenced; during which period the
summary conviction Court which has received the plea is vested with exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, but such jurisdiction may be
waived under s. 697(4); (3) after the hearing has commenced, when s. 698 comes
into play.

No plea had been entered when
Magistrate Harris assumed to exercise jurisdiction and for the reasons which I
have given, as well as for those of Davey J.A., with which I am in substantial
agreement, I am of the opinion that Magistrate Harris had jurisdiction to enter
upon the hearing.

I would therefore allow the
appeal and restore the conviction.

RAND J:—In the face of the specific language of s. 697(4) 
of the Criminal Code , ""A summary conviction court before which
proceedings under this part are commenced"", of s. 697(1) , ""Nothing in
this Act … shall be deemed to require a justice before whom proceedings are
commenced"", and of s. 695 , ""Proceedings under this Part shall be
commenced by laying an information"", I am unable to agree that where the
information, as here, has been taken by a police magistrate as such, the
proceedings were not then ""commenced"" by a Court so as to require a
waiver of jurisdiction under s. 697(4) . The contrary 

[Page 517]

view involves a distinction
between the jurisdiction contemplated by subs. (4) and that by subs. (3); it
gives to the word ""jurisdiction"" in subs. (4) the meaning of
""exclusive jurisdiction"" as that is taken to be provided by subs.
(3): in other words, that ""commencing proceedings"" within subs. (4)
means taking the plea, that taking the plea vests the only jurisdiction that
can be and is required to be waived, and that up to that point no jurisdiction
as at common law is or can be acquired by any summary conviction Court. All
acts preliminary to the plea are thus conceived to be merely authorized but not
affecting or vesting jurisdiction. That may be the case where a single justice,
as distinguished from a summary conviction Court, takes the information and
some other act by a Court is required to attach jurisdiction. But once a Court
is seized by taking the information or doing that further act, technical
jurisdiction thereupon arises. If anything else was intended by Parliament the
language used does not appear to me to be apt to the purpose.

The other view requires us to
introduce a conclusive presumption that up to the taking of the plea, a
magistrate acts in the capacity of a functionary with the jurisdiction of one
justice only, a view which breaks down where a summary conviction Court is one
with the jurisdiction of a single justice, and a presumption for which I find
no warrant in the relevant sections of the Code.

On this ground I am against the
Crown.

But a further submission by Mr.
Urie remains to be examined. By s. 417 of the Municipalities Act,
R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 232, police magistrates are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor
in council. Where an appointment carries a salary, s. 418 permits the
appointment of another magistrate ""who shall act only in the absence or
during the illness of the salaried Police Magistrate"". The magistrate was
a salaried justice and the deputy was appointed under the power so given. Is
the limitation of jurisdiction that he may act ""only in the absence or
during the illness"" of the magistrate significant to the circumstances
before us?

The Court of Appeal took the view
that once the deputy entered upon a matter, his authority, unless waived under
subs. (4), continued to the end notwithstanding that the 

[Page 518]

regular magistrate had returned
to the district. I am forced to disagree with this. The rule that a justice
seized of jurisdiction retains it to the exclusion of others unless he
voluntarily waives it, assumes that as between two or more justices there is
equality of status, that the jurisdiction of each is independent of the
presence or absence of the other; and to avoid the impropriety of an unseemly
competition between them the rule was laid down. But that is not the relation
between the two magistrates here. The intention is that primarily the regular
magistrate shall act, and for that purpose a substantial salary is paid him.
The deputy may or may not be paid and in this case the allowance to him was
$12.50 a month. This indicates that the deputy acts for and in the stead of the
regular magistrate; that, sitting in the same seat of justice, he maintains a
continuity of authority; but that the primary jurisdiction, where a particular
act undertaken by the deputy is finished, may at any time be resumed unless a
statute forbids it. If the deputy had taken the plea he would be obliged, by s.
697(3), subject to waiver, to continue to the conclusion of the trial. Short of
taking the plea I see nothing to limit the language of s. 418; the provisions
the Code mentioned point to the propriety and desirability of preliminary
action by justices up to the plea; and since the stage reached by the deputy
did not go beyond the adjournment he could be and was, by the intervention of
the regular magistrate, superseded.

That was evidently the
understanding of the deputy. His adjournment to Friday, and his not being then
available to continue the proceeding, indicates that he did not consider
himself bound to do anything further. The adjudication was, therefore, by a
magistrate who was authorized to make it.

I would allow the appeal and
restore the conviction.

LOCKE J.:—For the reasons given
by Mr. Justice Davey, it is my opinion that the proceedings in this matter were
not ""commenced"" before Magistrate Parkin within the meaning of subs.
(4) of s. 697  of the Criminal Code  and as no plea was taken by him he
did not acquire exclusive 

[Page 519]

jurisdiction to deal with the
charge. In these circumstances, no question of waiver arises and the
proceedings before Magistrate Harris were regularly taken.

I would allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Conspiracy to commit offence—Distinction
from substantive offence—Inapplicability of limitation-period prescribed for
substantive offence—The Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, ss. 50-52, 56.

[Page 604]

A charge of conspiracy to commit
offences under the Immigration Act is one of criminal conspiracy
under the Criminal Code  and is neither in form nor in substance a charge
under the Immigration Act. Consequently the provisions of the latter Act
as to time-limits for instituting prosecutions have no application to such a
charge.

Criminal law—Appeals—Whether accused
""acquitted"" by trial Court—Judgment on motion to quash
indictment—Proper order on appeal if judgment set aside—The
Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 584(1)(a), 597(2)(a).

A motion to quash an indictment was made on the arraignment of
the accused and the trial judge granted the motion in the following words: ""Acte d'accusation cassé et les deux accusés sont acquittés.""

Held: This judgment constituted an acquittal within the
meaning of s. 584(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  and the Crown had a
right to appeal from the decision. The Court of Appeal having reversed the
judgment of the trial judge, the accused were entitled to appeal to the Supreme
Court under s. 597(2)  (a).

Held, further: The proper order for the Court of Appeal
to make in such circumstances was that the record be returned to the Court
below and that there be a new trial.

APPEAL by the accused from a judgment of the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, setting aside a
judgment of a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace. Appeal dismissed subject to a
variation.

The two accused were charged in an indictment containing
numerous counts summarized as follows by Owen J. in the Court of Queen's Bench
:

The Respondents were charged with having, between the 1st
January 1950 and the 31st December 1952, conspired together and with others to
commit the following criminal acts:

(a) Bribing an agent of the Crown to issue false
visas (Sec. 408 and 368 Cr. C.).

(b) ringing immigrants into Canada illegally (Sec.
408 Cr. C.).

(c) Obtaining by false pretences (Sec. 408 and
304, 323 and others Cr. C.).

(d) Making false documents (Sec. 408 and 309 Cr. C.).

(e) Using forged documents (Sec. 408 and 311 Cr. C.).

(ƒ) Defrauding certain persons of several thousand
dollars (Sec. 408 and 323 Cr. C.).

In the same indictment the Respondents were accused of
having between the same dates committed the following criminal acts:

[Page 605]

1. (a) Using false documents.

(b) Causing persons to use
these documents as though they were genuine (Sec. 311 and 21 Cr. C.).

2. (a) Doing or omitting to do certain things for
the purpose of enabling persons to use false documents.

(b) Assisting persons to commit the same criminal
acts (Sec. 311 and 21 Cr. C.).

On the arraignment of the accused, their counsel moved to
quash the indictment and this motion was granted by Proulx J.S.P.,
whose reasons for judgment contained the following paragraphs :

PREAMBULE

Dans cet acte d'accusation, il est clair
qu'on a essayé de contourner la loi, par le truchement de la conspiration!

Toutes les infractions substantives dont il est question dans les différents chefs d'accusation sont
couvertes par les arts. 50, 51, 52 de la Loi sur
l'Immigration, même les infractions commises hors du Canada selon l'art. 54
de la dite loi.

L'article 5, para. 2,
du Code Criminel  stipule que ""nul ne doit être
condamné au Canada pour une infraction commise hors du Canada"" mais
""sous réserve de la présente loi [le Code Criminel ] ou de toute
autre loi du Parlement du Canada"".

En principe, on aurait dû poursuivre sous
la Loi sur l'Immigration. Mais voilà! toutes les infractions prévues par
la Loi sur l'Immigration sont poursuivables sur déclaration sommaire de
culpabilité, sauf les infractions prévues par l'art. 51, qui
peuvent être poursuivies par voie de mise en accusation avec le consentement du
ministre.

Or, l'art. 56 de la Loi
sur l'Immigration stipule que les procédures sur déclaration sommaire de
culpabilité doivent être intentées dans les trois ans qui suivent la date de
l'infraction.

L'acte d'accusation allègue que les
infractions auraient été commises du 1er janvier 1950
au 31 décembre 1952, et
la dénonciation est datée du 28 mars 1956. Il est évident que la poursuite a procédé en vertu du Code Criminel ,
parce que la procédure sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité en vertu de
la Loi sur l'Immigration était prescrite; on passait outre à l'intention
du législateur.

* * *

CONCLUSION

On retrouve aux arts. 50, 51 et 52 de la Loi sur l'Immigration, toutes
ces accusations de complicité et infractions substantives du
Code Criminel . Nous pouvons même aller jusqu'à dire que les éléments de
conspiration se retrouvent dans le para, (j) de l'art. 50 de la Loi sur l'Immigration. C'est comme si l'on avait mis cette
loi et le Code Criminel  côte à côte et recherché dans le code ces
infractions prescrites sous la Loi sur l'Immi-

[Page 606]

gration ou pour
la poursuite desquelles il fallait le consentement du ministre. Ensuite, on a
logé des accusations de conspiration pour justifier la poursuite sous le Code
Criminel  et contourner la loi.

Dans mon humble opinion, cet acte
d'accusation est une parodie de la procédure, un déni de justice, une moquerie
de la loi et surtout un souverain mépris du législateur.

Le Tribunal conclut que tous ces chefs
d'accusation sont irréguliers, illégaux et nuls, de nullité absolue!

En l'occurrence, la Cour ne peut rien
modifier, comme on pourrait le faire en certains cas sous l'art. 510(3)  du Code Criminel : en toute conscience, elle ne peut que casser
un tel acte d'accusation et acquitter les accusés.

The Crown appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench which allowed the appeal and ordered
""that the record be returned to the Court below in order that the trial of
the accused may proceed according to law"".

The accused obtained leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada.

appellant Lattoni.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—This
is an appeal by the accused against the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench
(Appeal Side), Province of Quebec, setting aside the judgment of Judge W.
Proulx, a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal,
which latter judgment had granted a motion to quash the indictments preferred
against the appellants. The first argument on their behalf is that Judge Proulx
did not acquit them and that there was no right of appeal by the Crown from his
decision. It might be pointed out that, if this argument were correct, there
would be no appeal to this Court, because under s. 597  of the Criminal Code  the
accused would not be persons who had been acquitted of an indictable offence
and whose acquittal had been set aside by the Court of Appeal.

[Page 607]

However, the appellants' first contention cannot prevail.
The following appears at the end of the formal judgment of Judge Proulx:

Le Juge rend le jugement suivant: Acte
d'accusation cassé et les deux accusés sont acquittés. Annexé au présent
jugement le Jugement de M. le Juge W. Proulx cassant l'acte d'accusation et
acquittant les accusés.

His reasons conclude:

… en toute conscience, elle [la cour] ne peut
que casser un tel acte d'accusation et acquitter les accusés.

His report to the Court
of Appeal ends:

Pour toutes ces raisons, j'ai cru de mon
devoir de casser un tel acte d'accusation, en toute conscience, justice et
équité.

Reading all of these documents in their entirety I agree
with the Court of Appeal that the judgment of Judge Proulx was a final judgment
quashing the indictment because he considered that all criminal proceedings as
a result of the alleged acts of the accused were prescribed. I also agree that
it was not a judgment on procedural grounds owing to a defect in the indictment
and therefore if the accused were charged subsequently with the same offences
as those embodied in the indictment, they could plead autrefois acquit. It
was a decision on a question of law alone and being a judgment or verdict of
acquittal was appealable under s. 584 of the Code.

As to the grounds upon which Judge Proulx proceeded, there
was no obligation on the Crown to lay charges under the Immigration Act, but
it was entitled to prefer an indictment, as it did, charging conspiracy which
could be laid only under the Code. Any period of prescription that might apply
under the Immigration Act is not applicable to charges of conspiracy
under the Code.

The appeal should be dismissed but the judgment of the Court
of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) should be amended by striking out the last
paragraph thereof* and inserting in lieu thereof the following:

Doth Order that
the record be returned to the Court below and that there be a new trial.

Appeal dismissed subject to a variation in the
judgment.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Summary
convictions—Parties to proceedings—Appeal—Service of notice of appeal—Who is
""respondent""—Information laid by police officer—Service on
informant's superior—The Criminal Code , 1958—54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 722.

The appellant was convicted by a magistrate on an information
laid by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He served a notice of
appeal from his conviction on the corporal in charge of the detachment to which
the informant was attached. The County Court Judge dismissed the appeal for
want of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal had not been served on the
informant. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. A further appeal
was taken by leave.

Held (Kerwin C.J. and Martland J. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: In proceedings
under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code , at least if the Attorney General
does not intervene, the parties to the proceedings are the informant and the
accused. If the accused, having been convicted, appeals, the
""respondent"" on whom the notice of appeal must be served under s.
722(1)  (b) (ii) is the informant. Section 722(3)  makes it clear by
implication that the informant may be a person other than one engaged in
enforcement of the law, but it also makes it clear that, unless an order is
obtained from the appeal Court, the notice of appeal must be served on the
informant personally. The fact that the informant in laying the information
describes himself as doing so ""on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen""
does not change the position, nor does the style given to the proceedings
before the magistrate and the County Court Judge.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Martland J., dissenting: The
""respondent"" mentioned in s. 722(1) (b) (ii) is not
necessarily in all cases the person who laid the information. Where, as in the
present case, the information is laid by a police officer, the Crown is in name
and substance the respondent, and service of the notice of appeal on the informant's
superior officer is sufficient service within the meaning of the subsection.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Fraser Co.

appellant.

Lee A. Kelley, Q.C., for

[Page 474]

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and
Martland J. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—Vern
Glen Dennis appeals by leave against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2]. That Court had dismissed his appeal from a finding
by Judge Fraser that his Honour had no jurisdiction to hear his appeal from his
conviction by Magistrate Krell on a charge under s. 223  of the Criminal Code 
of driving a motor vehicle while his ability so to do was impaired by alcohol.
The information was sworn to by Laurence Martin, a constable of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police stationed at Haney, ""on behalf of Her Majesty the
Queen"". At the hearing before the magistrate, Corporal A. Calvert, in
charge of the Haney detachment, appeared as prosecutor and Constable Martin
testified. Notice of appeal from the magistrate's decision, which was given July 31, 1956, was
duly served upon the magistrate and upon Corporal Calvert but not on Constable
Martin. The reason given for this was that Constable Martin had left on his
vacation for three or four weeks from August 1, 1956, and hence it was
impracticable, if not impossible, to serve him.

The matter came before the learned
County Judge on March 12, 1957, and,
as we are advised, counsel appeared for the Crown and stated that the
preliminary matters were in order. However, it appeared to the judge that this
was not so and the hearing was adjourned to March 26, 1957,
in order to enable counsel for Dennis to submit written argument. This was done
on March 22, 1957, and on March 26, 1957, the judge indicated that he proposed to dismiss the
appeal for reasons then given. Formal dismissal of the appeal was withheld
until May 28, 1957, in order to permit Dennis to file a notice of appeal,
perfect his appeal and apply for bail pending its disposition. The reasons of
the judge and of the Court of Appeal proceed upon the basis that Constable
Martin was the ""respondent"" and as he had not been served with notice
of the appeal there was no jurisdiction.

The term ""respondent""
is not defined in Part XXIV of the Criminal Code , ""Summary 
Convictions "", with which we are concerned. By s. 719(f) ""appeal
court"" means in

[Page 475]

British Columbia the County Court of the county in which the cause of
the proceedings arose and by s. 720 the defendant in proceedings under Part
XXIV may appeal to the appeal court from a conviction made against him. Section
722 reads in part as follows:

722. (1) Where an appeal is
taken under section 720, the appellant shall

(a) prepare a notice
of appeal in writing setting forth

(i) with reasonable
certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed
against, and

(ii) the grounds of appeal;

(b) cause the notice
of appeal to be served upon

(i) the summary conviction
court that made the conviction or order or imposed the sentence, and

(ii) the respondent,

within thirty days after the
conviction or order was made or the sentence was imposed; and

(c) file in the
office of the clerk of the appeal court

(i) the notice of appeal
referred to in paragraph (a), and 

(ii) an affidavit of service
of the notice of appeal,

not later than seven days
after the last day for service of the notice of appeal upon the respondent and
the summary conviction court. . . . 

(3) Where the respondent is
a person engaged in enforcement of the law under which the conviction or order
was made or the sentence was imposed, the appeal court may direct that a copy
of the notice of appeal referred to in subsection (1) be served upon a person
other than the respondent, and where the appeal court so directs, that service
shall, for the purposes of this section and section 723, be deemed to be
service upon the respondent.

Under s. 727 the appellant would
have the right to a trial de novo before the County Court Judge and by
the orders under review he is deprived of that right. Undoubtedly the general
rule is that there is no appeal unless expressly given by statute and that any
conditions imposed thereby must be strictly complied with. An appeal is given
by s. 720 and the sole question is whether the service of the notice thereof
upon Corporal Calvert was service upon the ""respondent"". I have
examined the numerous decisions upon the point referred to by counsel, most of
which are mentioned in the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina
ex rel. Payne v. Feron[3],
and in the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Bird on behalf of the
Court of Appeal in the present matter[4]. To the
list might be added the recent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Desaulnier
v. Desaulnier[5].

[Page 476]

It is quite true that some were
decided before the enactment of the new Code, when subs. (3) of s. 722 was
added, although it may be mentioned, as Mr. Justice Bird noted, that s. 750(b)
of the old Code gave power to a judge of the Court appealed to to direct that
service be made upon a person other than the respondent. It was argued on
behalf of the Crown and so found in the Courts below that subs. (3) of s. 720
left no room for any decision other than that the informant was the respondent.
With respect, my view is that the ""respondent"" mentioned in s. 722(1)
(b) (ii) is not confined in all cases to the person who laid the
information. In the present case we are not dealing with circumstances where a
private individual laid an information or where at the latter's request a
police officer did so, and the proceedings were carried on without the
intervention of the Crown authorities. In such cases the subsection may have
its operation to prevent an appeal being heard unless the informant is served
with notice thereof or an order obtained. I agree with the submission of
counsel for Dennis that the subsection does not apply where, as here, the Crown
is in name and substance the respondent and it is a matter of public order. The
charge was laid by Constable Martin ""on behalf of Her Majesty the
Queen"" and the proceedings before the magistrate are intituled:

The reasons of the County Judge are headed:

REGINA

vs.

VERN GLEN DENNIS

His
final order is headed:

REGINA

Complainant 

(Respondent)

VERN GLEN DENNIS

Defendant

 (Appellant)

and his report to the Court of
Appeal:

Respondent

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN

against

VERN GLEN DENNIS

Appellant

[Page 477]

Corporal Calvert, the officer in
charge of the Haney detachment, conducted the proceedings before the magistrate
and counsel for the Crown appeared before the County Judge, before the Court
of Appeal and before this Court. The notice of appeal to the County Court was
headed:

REGINA

Complainant

 (Respondent)

VERN GLEN DENNI

Defendant

 (Appellant)

The latter, by itself, might be
taken as being self-serving but the others indicate that in the minds of all
concerned the Queen was the real respondent. Service of the notice of appeal
upon Corporal Calvert was, within the meaning of s. 722(1) (b) (ii),
service upon the respondent.

The appeal should be allowed, the
orders below set aside and the matter remitted to the County Court of New
Westminster to be heard upon the merits.

The judgment of Taschereau, Locke
and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—On the information of
Constable Martin, of the Haney detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
in British Columbia, the appellant was tried by way of summary
conviction and found guilty under s. 223  of the Criminal Code . An appeal
lodged against this conviction, to the County Court of Westminster, was quashed
for lack of jurisdiction, for the reason that the notice of appeal had not been
served on the informant. In fact, the notice was served on Corporal A. Calvert,
a superior officer at the detachment who had conducted the case at trial.

A further appeal to the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia was likewise and for the same reason dismissed by a
unanimous judgment[6] .

Hence, pursuant to s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the appellant sought and obtained leave to
appeal to this Court on the following grounds of law: 

(1) Was the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia right in holding that ""the respondent"" mentioned
in section 722(1)  (b) (ii) of the Criminal Code  means the informant in cases
where the defendant is the Appellant.

[Page 478]

(2) Was the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia right in holding that service on Corporal A. Calvert
who conducted the prosecution before the convicting Court was not proper
service on the Respondent within the meaning of section 722(1)  (b)(ii)
of the Criminal Code .

(3) Was the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia right in holding that service must be made on the
informant in all cases where an order for substitutional service has not been
obtained pursuant to section 722(3) in order to perfect an appeal by the
defendant pursuant to section 722  of the Criminal Code .

Reduced to proper dimensions, the
real questions to be determined in this appeal are (i) whether, in the
circumstances of this case, the informant Constable Martin was the respondent
within the meaning of s. 722(1)  (b) (ii) of the Criminal Code ,
upon whom notice of appeal should have been served and, if so, (ii) whether the
failure to serve the notice of appeal upon him goes to the jurisdiction of the
Court appealed to.

Dealing with the first question:
As there is no definition of the term ""respondent"", it may be
expedient to examine the status of the informant under Part XXIV, both in
proceedings at first instance as well as on an appeal to the County Court.

Sections 701 to 719 of Part XXIV
are related to proceedings at first instance. That the informant, whether a law-enforcement
officer or not, is at that stage a party to the case, cannot be doubted. He is
the person at whose initiative the proceedings are commenced by the laying of
the information: ss. 692(a) and 695(1). For the conduct of the
proceedings, he is also given the status of prosecutor and, as such, is
entitled to conduct the case, examine and cross-examine witnesses, personally
or by counsel or agent: ss. 692(e) and 709. While the Attorney General
of the Province is also given a similar status, i.e., the status of
prosecutor, the latter is not, qua prosecutor and within the definition
of the latter term, a party to the case. The failure of the informant or the
Attorney General or their respective counsel or agents to appear for the trial
permits the summary conviction Court to either dismiss the information or
adjourn the trial to some other time: ss. 706 and 710(4). Upon adjudication of
the case, the Court may, in its discretion, award and order costs to be paid to
the informant by the defendant, in the case of a conviction or 

[Page 479]

an order against the latter, or
to be paid by the informant to the respondent in the case of a dismissal
of the information: s. 716.

Sections 719 to 733 deal with the
appeal to the County Court from the conviction, order or sentence terminating
the proceedings at first instance. That the informant may also be a party to
this appeal is clear. Under s. 720, the right of appeal is given, namely, (i)
to the defendant from the conviction or order made against him or the sentence
passed upon him and (ii) to the informant or the Attorney General of the
Province or, in certain cases, to the Attorney General of Canada, from an order
dismissing the information or against the sentence passed upon the defendant.

In the case of an appeal entered
by the defendant, as in the present instance, there is nothing, either
expressed or implied, in these provisions, suggesting that the Attorney General
of the Province, qua prosecutor, or the Attorney General of Canada, may
be a party to the appeal as respondent; and if this is a true view of the
provisions relating to such an appeal, it follows that the only possible
respondent, for purposes of service of the notice of appeal, is the informant
himself.

That this is the situation flows
from the nature and the form of this appeal as well as from the provisions of
s. 722 .

Indeed, and under s. 727, the
appeal is heard and determined as a trial de novo in conformity with ss.
701 to 716, in so far as they are not inconsistent with ss. 720 to 732. This so-called
appeal is not really an appeal, but a trial; and in the case of an appeal by
the defendant, the judge presiding over the Court appealed to must himself find
him guilty before affirming the conviction. The informant and the
defendant, the parties in first instance, are thus the parties in such proceedings
and, for their purpose, are designated as respondent and appellant,
respectively.

The conditions precedent to the
exercise of this right of appeal are set forth in s. 722  enacting:

722. (1) Where an appeal is
taken under section 720, the appellant shall

(a) prepare a notice
of appeal in writing setting forth

(i) with reasonable
certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed
against, and

(ii) the grounds of appeal;

[Page 480]

(b) cause the notice
of appeal to be served upon

(i) the summary conviction
court that made the conviction or order or imposed the sentence, and

(ii) the respondent,

within thirty days after the
conviction or order was made or the sentence was imposed; and

(c) file in the
office of the clerk of the appeal court

(i) the notice of appeal
referred to in paragraph (a), and

(ii) an affidavit of service
of the notice of appeal,

not later than seven days
after the last day for service of the notice of appeal upon the respondent and
the summary conviction court.

(2) In the Northwest
Territories, the appeal court may fix, before or after the expiration of the
periods fixed by paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1), a
further period not exceeding thirty days within which service and filing may be
effected.

(3) Where the respondent is
a person engaged in enforcement of the law under which the conviction or order
was made or the sentence was imposed, the appeal court may direct that a copy
of the notice of appeal referred to in subsection (1) be served upon a person
other than the respondent, and where the appeal court so directs, that service
shall, for the purposes of this section and section 723, be deemed to be
service upon the respondent.

The provisions of the last
subsection of this section are specially and exclusively applicable in the case
of an appeal entered by the defendant, who then becomes the appellant. In
express terms, these provisions show that the respondent in such an appeal may
be a person engaged in enforcement of the law or, as they also show by
necessary implication, a person other than one engaged in enforcement of the
law. In either case, such respondent must of necessity be the informant himself
for—with the exception of a party intervening in the first instance, if this be
legally possible—who else but the informant could, under the provisions related
to such an appeal, and at least in a case such as the present, be suggested as
respondent? In the case under consideration, and this is all that needs to be
decided, there is no doubt, in my view, that Constable Martin, the informant in
this case, was the respondent and, as such, the person upon whom the notice of
appeal had to be served.

The provisions of s. 722(3) are
clear and call for no construction; they must be given effect to.

The fact that, in laying the
information, Constable Martin alleged that he was doing so ""on behalf of
Her Majesty the Queen"", adds nothing to the other allegation 

[Page 481]

that he was laying it as a
constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, i.e., as a person
engaged in enforcement of the law; as such, he was indeed acting on behalf of
the Crown for the enforcement of criminal law; and the case, for the purpose of
the service of the notice of appeal to the County Court, was clearly one to
which the special provisions of subs. (3) were applicable.

Nor can the style given to the
proceedings, before the Magistrate and the County Court Judge, to wit: ""REGINA v.
VERN GLEN DENNIS"", affect the operation of the subsection, in this case.

With respect, I am unable to accept
the submission that service on Corporal Calvert amounted to a substantial
compliance with s. 722 . The impossibility of serving the notice upon Constable
Martin was precisely one of the grounds which would, had an application been
made under subs. (3) of s. 722 , have permitted the Court appealed to to direct
copy of the notice of appeal to be served upon a person other than Constable
Martin, such service, if so directed, then availing as service upon the latter.
The provisions of subs. (3) would be absolutely nugatory were appellant's
submission accepted. Furthermore, referring to the exceptional nature of a
right of appeal, this Court in Welch v. The King,[7]
said at p. 428:

That all the substantive and
procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded as exhaustive and
exclusive, need not be expressly stated in the statute. That necessarily flows
from the exceptional nature of the right.

Dealing with the second question:
I am also in respectful agreement with the unanimous conclusion of the Court of
Appeal that the County Court Judge was right in deciding he had no jurisdiction
in the matter, in view of the failure of appellant to comply with the
requirements of s. 722 , and I did not Understand counsel for appellant to
challenge the suggestion that non-compliance with the provisions of s. 722 
fatally affected the jurisdiction of the County Court.

In Wills & Sons v.
McSherry et al[8].,
where circumstances as to facts and law were different, it was held that
notwithstanding the want of service, the Court, in that particular case, had
jurisdiction to hear the appeal. An examination

[Page 482]

of this qualified decision shows
that it rested on an application of the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia
aut inutilia. The general principles were stated as follows by Channell J.
at pp. 25-6:

The statute gives this Court
jurisdiction to hear appeals from justices by way of case stated subject to
certain conditions. The law applicable to the point is clearly stated in
Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (5th ed.) at p. 621: ""Enactments
which impose duties on conditions are, when there are not conditions precedent
to the exercise of a jurisdiction, subject to the maxim that lex non cogit ad
impossibilia aut inutilia. They are understood as dispensing with the performance
of what is prescribed, when performance is idle or impossible. In such cases,
the provision or condition is dispensed with, when compliance is impossible in
the nature of things. It would seem to be sometimes equally so where compliance
was, though not impossible in this sense, yet impracticable, without any
default on the part of the person on whom the duty was thrown."" The author
then refers to Morgan v. Edwards, 5 H. & N. 415, Woodhouse v.
Woods, 29 L.J.(M.C.) 149, and Syred v. Carruthers, E.B. & E.
469, and says: ""If the respondent in an appeal kept out of the way to
avoid service of the notice of appeal, or at all events could not be found
after due diligence in searching for him, the service required by the statute
would probably be dispensed with … Where, however, the act or thing required by
the statute is a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the
tribunal, compliance cannot be dispensed with; and if it be impossible, the
jurisdiction fails."" That last passage shews that there is a difficulty in
holding that the Court has power to dispense with the performance of the
conditions precedent laid down in this statute. If the point is put in that way
I think the Court clearly cannot do so. But that is not quite the question
which we have to decide. The question is whether the statute has been
sufficiently complied with if the party has done everything in his power to
effect service and it is clearly impossible for him to do so.

(The last phrase has been
italized by myself.)

The provisions of the Summary
Jurisdiction Act, 1857, which were considered in the case just quoted, are,
as well as the facts to which they were applied, different from those here
under consideration. Under s. 723(1) of our Code, it is only ""where an
appellant has complied with section 722 "" that arises the duty of the Court
appealed to to set down the appeal for hearing. Under s. 727(1), it is also
only ""where an appeal has been lodged in accordance with this Part""
that there arises the duty of the Court appealed to, to hear and determine the
appeal. These enactments impose duties on conditions which are precedent to the
exercise of the jurisdiction and compliance cannot be dispensed with. It is,
however, quite unnecessary to decide the case upon that basis, for even if the conditions
prescribed in these enactments were not conditions precedent to the exercise of
jurisdiction, the maxim lex non cogit ad 

[Page 483]

impossibilia aut inutilia could have no application in the circumstances of
this case. Indeed, the record does not show, nor was it ever suggested at the
hearing, that it was impossible for appellant to resort to the relief specially
provided by Parliament under subs. (3) of s. 722 . I find it impossible to
ignore the latter provisions.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiracy in restraint of
trade—Defences—Whether intended prevention or lessening of competition “undue”—Validity
of indictment—Whether different offences created by the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, s. 498(1)(d)—Application and effect of the Combines Investigation
Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, s. 41, enacted by 1949 (2nd sess.), c. 12, s. 3,
renumbered and amended by 1952, c. 39, ss. 6, 8—The Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 158, s. 19.

It is not necessary, to support a charge
under s. 498(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , 1927, that the
prosecution should establish any detriment to the public from the agreement
made, nor is it a defence to such a charge that the agreement resulted in
public benefit, through reasonable prices and profits. The section is
designed to protect free competition, and any agreement for the prevention or lessening
of that competition, to an extent that is “undue” within the authorities, is
punishable. The section proceeds on the footing that the preventing or
lessening of competition is in itself an injury to the public, and is not
concerned with public injury or public benefit from any other standpoint.

An indictment alleging that the accused
conspired “to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production,
manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply” of goods is not
bad for duplicity, or as charging several offences in the alternative. A single
conspiracy is contemplated by s. 498(1) (d), viz., one to “prevent
or lessen competition”, and the words following are merely means by which that
competition may be prevented or lessened. For the same reason, it is not
correct to strike out the words “production” and “manufacture” from the
conviction merely on the ground that there was no evidence of a conspiracy
expressly directed to the prevention or lessening of competition in these two
respects.

Section 41 of the Combines
Investigation Act, 1927, as enacted in 1949 and amended and renumbered in
1952, applies on a prosecution for a conspiracy completed before the coming
into force of the 1952 amendment. The effect of the section is to render
admissible in evidence written communications, described as “inter-office
memoranda”, from one servant of an accused corporation to another even if they
never left the premises of the company in whose possession or on whose premises
they have been found. Such documents, when admitted, are prima facie evidence
not only against the corporation in whose possession they were found but
against other alleged conspirators mentioned in them.

[Page 404]

APPEAL by 22 companies and one individual
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction of the appellants
and one other company by Spence J.[2] on an
indictment under s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36 (one other company and another individual, also indicted and
convicted, did not appeal to the Court of Appeal), and a cross-appeal by the
respondent. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.

Leave was granted by Cartwright J. on November
22, 1955, to appeal on the following questions of law:

1. Did the Courts below err in holding that
section 41 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, Ch. 314 as
enacted by, 1949 (Second Session) Ch. 12, section 3, and as amended by
1952, 1 Elizabeth II, Ch. 39, was applicable to this case?

2. Did the Courts below err in law in
holding that a number of documents consisting of written communications from
one servant of an accused corporation to another servant of the same
corporation, which documents were referred to at the trial as “inter-office
memoranda”, were admissible in evidence against all the accused?

3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err
in not holding that the indictment and/or the conviction was void for duplicity
in that it states two separate offences in the alternative under
section 498(1) (d) of The Criminal Code  namely the offence of
agreeing to unduly lessen competition and the offence of agreeing to unduly
prevent competition?

4. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err
in not holding that the indictment and/or the conviction was void for duplicity
in that it states in the alternative the several offences under
section 498(1)(d) of agreeing as to manufacture, purchase, barter,
sale, transportation or supply?

5. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
not holding that the effect of wartime control orders, directives and requests,
proven in evidence, was to constitute a break in the continuity of any alleged
agreement or agreements between the accused and in not holding that the
conviction was bad in law as being a conviction on one count with reference to
two alleged agreements which are distinct in time?

6. Did the Courts below err in holding that
the element of “undueness” required by section 498(1) (d) may be
proved by reference only to the scope and extent of the agreement or
arrangement complained of and without proof of detriment to the public?

7. Did the Courts below err in ruling that
they were precluded from having regard to evidence tending to show public
benefit, reasonableness of prices and profits, and, particularly, did the
learned Trial Judge err in the ruling which he expressed (at 1954, O.R. p. 572)
in the following words, “In considering the evidence adduced I am not free to
find that the lessening intended was not undue on the basis of any necessity of
the industry, reasonableness of prices resulting or reasonableness of profits
obtained”?

[Page 405]

The application for leave to appeal was opposed.
Counsel for the respondent moved for leave to cross-appeal but stated that such
leave was sought only if the application of the appellants should be allowed.
Leave was granted to cross-appeal on the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err as a matter of law in varying
the conviction by striking out the words “production” and “manufacture”?

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., John J. Robinette,
Q.C., Hazen Hansard, Q.C., John D. Pickup, Q.C., A. Laurendeau, Q.C., D.K.
MacTavish, Q.C., and John M. Coyne, for the appellants.

N.L. Mathews, Q.C., and B.J. MacKinnon, for
the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—I agree with Mr. Justice
Kellock and desire merely to make a reference to the refusal by this Court of
leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Regina v. Morrey[3]. There the accused had been found guilty of
an indictment preferred under the Combines Investigation Act, but the
Court of Appeal set aside the conviction. The Crown did not appeal to this
Court on any dissent expressed by Mr. Justice Davey, but desired leave in
order to raise a number of questions. This Court thought that, irrespective of
these questions, the order made by the Court of Appeal setting aside the
conviction and, if the Crown so desired, ordering a new trial could be
justified on other grounds, and that if any of the points suggested by the
Crown arose in the present appeal they could be dealt with when judgment was
delivered. It is apparent, however, that none is involved in the present
determination.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The appellants were charged under
s. 498(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , as in force prior to November 1, 1952, on an indictment, the material
portion of which, for the purposes of the present appeal, reads as follows:

During the period from 1933 to the 31st day
of October, 1952, both inclusive,...did unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or
arrange together and with one another and with...[others named in the
indictment] to

[Page 406]

unduly prevent, or lessen competition in
the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply
of articles or commodities which may be the subject of trade or commerce, to
wit, book papers including general printing and converting papers, fine papers
including rag content and sulphite writing paper, coated papers, miscellaneous
fine papers including blotting and bristols, groundwood printing and specialty
papers containing more than 50% groundwood and other fine papers, and did
thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to the provisions of the Criminal
Code , section 498 , subsection (1)(d).

The appellants were found guilty by
Mr. Justice Spence, sitting without a jury, and this judgment was unanimously
confirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Mr. Justice Cartwright granted leave to appeal to this Court
on questions of law, and leave was also granted to cross-appeal on the
following question:

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err as a matter of law in varying
the conviction by striking out the words “production” and “manufacture”?

The facts are not in dispute, and as they have
been summarized by my colleagues, it is unnecessary to deal with them once
more.

I agree with Kellock and Cartwright JJ. and I am
of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.

I wish however to add a few observations
concerning the necessity of showing detriment to the public, and as to the
meaning of the word “unduly” found in s. 498(1)(d) of the old Criminal
Code , under which the charge is laid.

It has been argued on behalf of the appellants
that the offence is not complete, unless it has been established by the Crown
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the agreement was detrimental to the public, in
the sense that the manufacture or production was effectively lessened, limited
or prevented, as a result of the agreements entered into. It has also been
suggested that there is no offence, if it is shown that the acts complained of
were beneficial to the public. With these submissions I entirely disagree.
Conspiracy is a crime by itself, without the necessity of establishing the
carrying out of an overt act. Stephen (Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th ed.
1950, p. 24), basing his opinion on Regina v. Whitchurch et al.[4], goes as far as saying:

When two or more persons agree to commit
any crime, they are guilty, of a misdemeanour called conspiracy whether the
crime is committed or not, and though in the circumstances of the case it
would be impossible to commit it.

[Page 407]

The public is entitled to the benefit of free
competition, and the prohibitions of the Act cannot be evaded by good
motives. Whether they be innocent and even commendable, they cannot alter the
true character of the combine which the law forbids, and the wish to accomplish
desirable purposes constitutes no defence and will not condone the undue
restraint, which is the elimination of the free domestic markets.

It is my strong view that traders, manufacturers
and producers cannot, as the law now stands, monopolize a substantial part of
the markets of the country in given industries, to promote their own business
interests, and then set themselves up as public benefactors, by saying to the
Courts that the conspiracy was organized in order to achieve the stabilization
of prices and production.

I believe that the law has been clearly
expressed by Mr. Justice Mignault in Stinson-Reeb Builders Supply
Company et al. v. The King[5]:

Injury to the public by the hindering or
suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding any advantage which may
accrue to the business interests of the members of the combine, is what brings
an agreement or a combination under the ban of section 498  Cr. C.

Vide also Container Materials, Limited et al.
v. The King[6] where
Sir Lyman Duff, then Chief Justice, said at p. 152:

The enactment before us, I have no doubt,
was passed for the protection of the specific public interest in free
competition. That, in effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman
v. Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1, in the judgments of the learned Chief
Justice, of Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Anglin, as well as
by myself. This protection is afforded by stamping with illegality agreements
which, when carried into effect, prevent or lessen competition unduly and making
such agreements punishable offences; and, as the enactment is aimed at
protecting the public interest in free competition, it is from that point of
view that the question must be considered whether or not the prevention or
lessening agreed upon will be undue… That is only another way of putting what
was laid down in Stinson-Reeb v. The King [supra], which, it may
be added, was intended to be in conformity with the decision in Weidman v.
Shragge, as indicated in the passages quoted in the judgment.

Weidman et al. v. Shragge[7]
and Rex v. Elliott[8] are
also to the same effect.

[Page 408]

I have therefore reached the conclusion that
this appeal should be dismissed, and I would dispose of the cross-appeal as
proposed by my brother Kellock.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—As the questions submitted to this
Court are questions of law, our jurisdiction being limited to such questions,
the findings made by the Courts below upon the evidence are not in question. It
will be convenient to deal first with questions 6 and 7.

The offence of which the appellants have been
convicted is provided for by s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, which provides that:

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence...who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person, or
with any railway, steamship, steamboat or transportation company,...

(d) to unduly prevent or
lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale,
transportation or supply of any such article or commodity, or in the price of
insurance upon person or property.

“Such” refers back to the earlier paragraphs in
which the article or commodity is described as “any article or commodity which
may be a subject of trade or commerce”.

It is contended that as the word “prevent” is
used in s. 498(1)(d) in the sense of absolute elimination, the
word “unduly” is meaningless unless it be interpreted as involving injury to
the public. It is therefore argued that it is a defence to a charge under the
section if it be shown that the agreement entered into by the accused had
in view the interests of the parties or public benefit such as “reasonableness
of prices” or obviation of the “hardships of a depression by keeping all mills
working part-time as a result of which a real public advantage is gained”, to
use language employed by the appellants in their factum. While “prevent” quite
commonly is used in the above sense it is also used in the sense of “hinder” or
“impede”. In the French version the word is “prévenir” which also is commonly
used in the sense of “empêcher”. In this sense the word “unduly” is appropriate
in connection with both “prevent” and “lessen”.

[Page 409]

The appellants further contend that the word
“unduly” in the statute should be interpreted by calling in aid the provisions
of the definition of “combine” in the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1927, c. 26, as amended by 25-26 Geo. V. (1935), c. 54, s. 2, where it is
defined for the purposes of that statute as, inter alià, a combination
which “has operated or is likely to operate to the detriment or against the
interests of the public whether consumers, producers or others”. It is
contended that if s. 498(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  is to
be construed without reading similar words into it “parties to the same
agreement might be found guilty if charged under section 498(1) (d),
without proof of public detriment, while they would go free on the same
evidence if charged under the Combines Investigation Act”.

I cannot accept this contention. If there is a
difference between the offences described in the two statutes, Parliament has
deliberately so intended. It will be seen, however, that s. 498 (d) does
have in view injury to the public but injury to the public of a character
expressly specified by the section itself.

In the course of his judgment in Container
Materials, Limited et al. v. The King[9],
Duff C.J.C. said:

The second point arises from the contention
of the appellants that the essence of the offence is an agreement to do
something injurious to the public; that such injury to the public must appear
from the evidence and must be found as a fact in order to establish a legal
basis for a conviction.

At p. 152, the learned Chief Justice dealt with
this contention as follows:

The enactment before us, I have no doubt,
was passed for the protection of the specific public interest in free
competition. That, in effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman v.
Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1, in the judgments of the learned Chief Justice,
of Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Anglin, as well as by myself.
This protection is afforded by stamping with illegality agreements which, when
carried into effect, prevent or lessen competition unduly and making such
agreements punishable offences; and, as the enactment is aimed at protecting
the public interest in free competition, it is from that point of view that
the question must be considered whether or not the prevention or lessening
agreed upon will be undue… That is only another way of putting what was laid
down in Stinson-Reeb v. The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276, which, it may be
added, was intended to be in conformity with the decision in Weidman v.
Shragge, as indicated in the passages quoted in the judgment.

The other members of the Court who took part in
the judgment expressed in other words the same principle.

[Page 410]

When it is considered that in the course of his
dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal in the above case[10] Henderson J.A. had said at pp.
195-6(D.L.R.):

In many of the cases the purpose or
objective of the alleged conspiracy has been, per se, a crime. A very
different situation arises where the purpose of the agreement is a proper one
on its face and entered upon in good faith in the belief not only that it is
within the legal rights of the parties, but in the case of a trade agreement,
is for the good of the particular industry and the public who are concerned.

At p. 196:

The Crown accepts the view that there
having been an association of manufacturers in this industry prior to 1931, and
the industry being in a bad way financially, having taken heavy losses and
being in danger of collapse, the object of the accused was to form an
association which would stabilize the industry, put it on a sound footing and
make it prosperous.

It is charged by the Crown that in
effecting this object the accused did unduly stifle competition. No evidence is
offered in support of the view that in standardizing their products the accused
did any injury to the public or to their consumers. For all that appears to the
contrary, one is entitled to conclude that this stabilization and
standardization was all for the benefit both of the industry and of the
consuming public…

At 204:

I do not find in this huge record… evidence
to prove injury to trade and commerce. To the contrary, I find that the
evidence indicates that Canadian manufacturers in this industry have, by their
efforts, stabilized the industry, greatly increased its sales to the benefit of
shareholders, employees and the public interest,

it is plain that the contention now put forward
by the appellants was effectively negatived by the judgment of this Court.

Anglin J., as he then was, in Weidman et al.
v. Shragge[11] had
said at pp. 42-3:

...the prime question certainly must be,
does it, however advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the
business interests of the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive, or
oppressive restrictions upon that competition the benefit of which is the right
of every one? The King v. Elliott, 9 C.C.C. 505, at p. 520.

This judgment received the approval of this
Court in Stinson-Reeb Builders Supply Company v. The King[12], per Mignault J. at p. 278. At p.
280 Mignault J. said:

Injury to the public by the
hindering or suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding any advantage
which may accrue to the business interests of the members of the combine, is
what brings an agreement or a combination under the ban of section 498 
Cr. C.

[Page 411]

It is therefore clear that the Courts below
dealt with the matter before them from the proper point of view. The statute
proceeds upon the footing that the preventing or lessening of competition is in
itself an injury to the public. It is not concerned with public injury or
public benefit from any other standpoint.

It was contended that the case at bar was
distinguishable from all previous cases of a similar character which had
reached this Court in that the agreement constituting the conspiracy was not to
be found within the four corners of a written document but had to be deduced
from oral evidence, correspondence, minutes and other writings. This contention
is, in my opinion, untenable. It relates merely to a matter of evidentiary
proof.

The answer to questions 6 and 7 must, therefore,
be in the negative.

With respect to question 5, it is not necessary,
in my opinion, to discuss the argument which was addressed to us in so far as
that argument was founded upon matters of evidence. The essence of the argument
is that although the agreement, which the Courts below have found to contravene
the provisions of s. 498(1) (d), continued without break throughout the
period mentioned in the indictment, and although s. 498(1) (d) remained
unrepealed, the agreement ceased to come within the ban of the
section during the period of the wartime controls for the reason that all
possibility of competition in fine papers was eliminated by virtue of the
legislation then in effect.

In my opinion the short answer to this
contention is contained in part of the reasons for judgment of Duff C.J.C. in
the Container Materials case, supra. At p. 153 the learned Chief
Justice, after pointing out that the Court of Appeal had held that the aim of
the parties to the agreement there in question had been to secure effective
control of the market in Canada and that they had been very largely successful
in effectuating that aim, went on to say: “But the fact that such was the
agreement affords in point of law a sufficient basis” for a finding that
the section had been contravened.

[Page 412]

Assuming that during any part of the period of
control the aim of the parties to the agreement could not have been
successfully carried into execution, such a fact would not, in law, constitute
any answer to the indictment.

In Regina v. Aspinall et al.[13], Brett J.A., as he then was, said, at pp.
58-9:

Now, first, the crime of conspiracy is
completely committed, if it is committed at all, the moment two or more have
agreed that they will do, at once or at some future time, certain things. It is
not necessary in order to complete the offence that any one thing should be
done beyond the agreement. The conspirators may repent and stop, or may have no
opportunity, or may be prevented, or may fail. Nevertheless the crime is
complete; it was completed when they agreed.

In his Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th ed. 1950,
Stephen J. says at p. 24:

When two or more persons agree to commit
any crime, they are guilty of the misdemeanour called conspiracy whether the
crime is committed or not, and though in the circumstances of the case it would
be impossible to commit it.

The authority relied on is Regina v. Whitchurch et al.[14],
and, in my opinion, it fully justifies the statement in the text.

The appellants referred to the decision of the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England in Rex v. West et al.[15]
In that case, however, the regulations in question had been amended so that in
effect there were three separate offences charged. Nothing of that kind is in
question here. Section 498(1) (d) remained in force
throughout. The fact that the wartime controls were of a temporary nature no
doubt influenced the parties to the conspiracy in continuing their agreement
throughout. That the agreement did continue is sufficient in itself in point of
law even had the Courts below been unable to find, as in fact they did find,
that the agreement was not as ineffective during the period of the controls as
the appellants contend.

In my opinion, therefore, question 5 must also
be answered in the negative.

With regard to question 3, it is contended that
the indictment states two separate offences in the alternative, namely, the
offence of agreeing to unduly lessen competition and the offence of agreeing to
unduly prevent competition.

[Page 413]

Again, with regard to question 4, the error the
Court below is alleged to have fallen into is in failing to hold that the
indictment was void for duplicity in that it states in the alternative the
several offences under s. 498(1)(d) of agreeing as to
manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply.

To return to the statutory language that
everyone is guilty of an indictable offence “who conspires, combines,
agrees or arranges with any other person...(d) to unduly prevent or
lessen competition in the production”, etc., in my opinion, upon the proper
construction of these words, there is but one offence created. To adopt in part
language used by Meredith J., as he then was, in Rex v. Elliott[16]:

The crime is in the conspiracy, not in the
unlawful acts comprehended in it.

A little later on the same page the learned
judge pointed out that

By looking at the acts agreed to be done,
instead of only at the agreement to do them, the crime is apt to be wrongly
multiplied.

As the question involved in the cross-appeal is
allied to questions 3 and 4, I propose to consider it at this point also. That
question is as to whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in striking from the
conviction the words “manufacture” and “production”. In the course of its
judgment the Court of Appeal[17]
affirmed the finding of the trial judge that

the Mills as a group and the Merchants as a
group did conspire with one another to lessen or prevent competition in
the fine paper industry in Canada; the Mills at the production level, the Merchants at the wholesale
level. Within that broad, over-all, all‑embracing agreement each group
had its part to play in accomplishing their common purpose.

The Mills, pursuant to a common
understanding between them and the Merchants, co‑operated with the
Merchants to prevent, if possible, any inroads by others into the wholesale
field in which the Merchants operated; and the Merchants in turn, pursuant to a
common understanding between them and the Mills, co-operated with the Mills to
prevent, if possible, any mill competition from the only source where it
really existed, namely, foreign manufacturers.

(The italics are mine.)

There was, of course, evidence upon which such a
finding could be made.

[Page 414]

In my opinion, on the plain reading of s.
498(1) (d), the accused may be charged with conspiring “to unduly
prevent” competition in any one or more of the modes mentioned in para. (d)
depending upon the evidence to be adduced, or, similarly, “to unduly
lessen” competition and he may also and no doubt will invariably be charged
with conspiring “to unduly prevent or lessen” by any one or more of such means.
The fact that, as in the case at bar, there was no evidence directed to the
word “barter” has no effect upon the result nor would it have had if that word
or any of the other intended modes of carrying the conspiracy into effect had been
omitted, so long as one of the statutory means was specified. The Crown could,
for example, if it did not intend to adduce evidence with regard to any of the
other words contained in the section, confine itself to charging a conspiracy
with regard to “manufacture” only.

Accordingly, the form of the present indictment
is authorized by s. 498(1) (d) and that being so, it falls within
ss. 852(3)  and 854  of the Criminal Code . The decision of this Court in Belyea
v. The King; Weinraub v. The King[18], is
authority for the view I have expressed and is unaffected by the fact that s.
1010(2)  of the Criminal Code  as it then stood no longer exists.

With regard to the question raised by the
cross-appeal, it will be observed that in the extract from the reasons of Roach
J.A., quoted above, the learned judge was directing his mind to the essence of
the charge under s. 498(1) (d), namely, the conspiracy to prevent
or lessen “competition”. Subsequently, however, when the learned judge came to
deal with the question which is now the subject of the cross-appeal in this
Court, he did so in the following two passages:

I do not think that the evidence
establishes that they conspired to prevent or lessen production and
manufacture in Canada, but
of that I shall have more to say later[19].

And subsequently:

As earlier stated herein, I do not think
that as between the two groups there was a conspiracy to lessen or prevent production
or manufacture[20].

[Page 415]

With respect, these passages appear to lose
sight of the nature of the charge, namely, the conspiracy to unduly prevent or
lessen “competition” in production, manufacture, etc. There is, therefore, here
an error in a matter of law, namely, an erroneous construction of the statutory
offence and the charge contained in the indictment, and not in the question of
fact as to whether or not there existed or did not exist any evidence of
conspiracy to lessen or prevent competition in production or manufacture, as to
which the learned Justice of Appeal had made a contrary finding, namely, that

the Mills as a group and the Merchants as a
group did conspire with one another to lessen or prevent competition in
the fine paper industry in Canada; the Mills at the production level, the Merchants at the wholesale
level. Within that broad, over-all, all‑embracing agreement each group
had its part to play in accomplishing their common purpose[21].

In my opinion, this a finding that the mills and
merchants together did conspire to unduly prevent or lessen competition in both
production and manufacture as well as in purchase and sale. The object of the
mills was to limit competition in production and manufacture to themselves as
against outsiders and in this they were aided by the common agreement of the
merchants. Even if the mill competition which was in view was from foreign
manufacturers, the finding expressly includes this, namely, that there was a
common understanding between mills and merchants “to prevent, if possible, any mill
competition from the only source where it really existed, namely, foreign manufacturers”.
In my opinion, therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in striking out the words
“production” and “manufacture” from the indictment.

It is contended on behalf of the appellants that
there is no jurisdiction in this Court under the provisions of s. 1025  of the Criminal
Code  to entertain the cross-appeal as it is said that there was no “setting
aside” of the conviction within the meaning of s. 1014 . I cannot agree. A
conviction upon a charge of conspiring to unduly prevent

[Page 416]

or lessen competition in the barter of any
commodity is, to my mind, as I have already pointed out, not the same as a
conviction of conspiring with respect to the preventing or lessening of
competition in the purchase or sale of a commodity. Accordingly, in substituting
a conviction of conspiring to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the
purchase, barter, sale, transportation and supply of an article, the Court of
Appeal necessarily set aside the conviction made by the trial judge, namely,
that of conspiring to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production,
manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of that
commodity.

With regard to question 1, the contention of the
appellants is essentially founded upon the language of subs. (2) of s. 41 of
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as enacted by 1949
(2nd sess.), c. 12, s. 3, and amended by 1952, c. 39, ss. 6 and 8. By virtue of
s. 6 of the 1952 Act the former s. 39A was renumbered as s. 41.

It is contended for the appellants that s. 41 is
not a procedural but a substantive enactment and can have no restrospective
operation, and further, that the reference to s. 498  in subs. (2) is confined
to s. 498  of the Criminal Code  as enacted by s. 11 of the statute of
1952, which begins with the following words:

11. Sections four hundred and
ninety-eight and four hundred and ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code  chapter
thirty-six of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, are repealed and the
following substituted therefor:

The contention is that the words
“section four hundred and ninety-eight” in subs. (2) of s. 41 refer to the
s. 498  enacted by the statute of 1952 and, accordingly, that even though s. 41
is to be considered a procedural enactment, it is expressly made applicable
only to prosecutions under the new s. 498 . It is therefore said also that, as
the prosecution here in question is in respect of the period ending with
October 31, 1952, to which s. 498  of the Criminal Code  as it stood on
that date is the applicable section, resort cannot be had to the antecedent of
s. 41 , namely, s. 39A , enacted in 1949 by 13 Geo. VI, c. 12, as that section,
although continued by s. 6 of the 1952 legislation as s. 41 , ceased,

[Page 417]

by reason of its amendment by s. 8 of the same
statute, to have any application to a prosecution under the old s. 498 .

There is no question, in my opinion, that s. 41
is procedural in its nature and in so far as the appellants’ argument is
dependent upon a contrary view it cannot be supported.

In my opinion the Interpretation Act, now
R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, affords an answer to the appellants’ contention. By s.
19(1), it is provided that where any Act or enactment is repealed, then, unless
the contrary intention appears, such repeal does not, save as in the
section is otherwise provided,

(d) affect any offence
committed against any Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked, or
any penalty or forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect thereof, or

(e) affect any...legal
proceeding or remedy in respect of any such...penalty, forfeiture or punishment
as aforesaid,

and any such...penalty, forfeiture or
punishment may be imposed, as if the Act...had not been repealed.

Accordingly, regardless of any repeal of s. 498 
of the Criminal Code , the liability to prosecution thereunder continued.
This, of course, the appellants concede.

It is further provided by subs. (2) of s. 19
that

Where other provisions are substituted for
those so repealed or revoked, then, unless the contrary intention appears,...

(c) in the recovery or enforcement
of penalties and forfeitures incurred...under the Act, enactment or regulation
so repealed or revoked,...the procedure established by the substituted
provisions shall be followed as far as it can be adapted.

This appears to be a clear enactment that s. 41,
as enacted or amended by the statute of 1952, is to apply with any necessary
adaptation to a prosecution under s. 498  as it stood prior to the legislation
of 1952. The “necessary adaptation” is, of course, to read “section four
hundred and ninety-eight of the Criminal Code ” as referring to the “old
section” 498.

In my opinion also, the objection raised by the
appellants which is the subject-matter of the second question

[Page 418]

is completely answered by the language of s. 41.
Granted the applicability of the section to the prosecution here in
question, para, (c) of subs. (2) provides that

a document proved to have been in the
possession of a participant or on premises used or occupied by a participant or
in the possession of an agent of a participant

shall not only be “admitted in evidence” without
further proof but

shall be prima facie evidence…

(ii) that anything recorded in or by the
document as having been done, said, or agreed upon by any participant or
by an agent of a participant was done, said or agreed upon as
recorded and, where anything is recorded in or by the document as having
been done, said or agreed upon by an agent of a participant, that it was
done, said or agreed upon with the authority of the participant.

(The italics are mine.)

It is, in my opinion, the plain language of this
legislation that where a document of the character mentioned states, for
example, that two participants agreed upon a thing, that is prima facie evidence
against both notwithstanding that the statement may appear in a document which
is an “inter-office memorandum” which never left the premises of the
participant in whose possession or on whose premises (“used or occupied”) it
was found. This subject does not lend itself to extended comment. There was, accordingly,
no error on the part of either Court below in the respect raised by the second
question.

In this view, the appellants fail, the
cross-appeal succeeds and the conviction made by the learned trial judge should
be restored.

The judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. [after quoting the indictment and
setting out the questions on which leave to appeal and to cross-appeal was
given]:—The facts are set out in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial
judge[22] and in
those of the Court of Appeal[23], and
it is not necessary to repeat them.

[Page 419]

I propose to deal with the questions in regard
to which leave to appeal was granted in the order in which they are set out
above.

As to the first question two submissions were
made. It was argued, first, that s. 41 does not fall within the general rule
that enactments dealing with procedure apply to bygone transactions, that the
radical changes it makes in the law of evidence go beyond any mere matter of
procedure, and that consequently it ought not to be given retrospective effect;
and, secondly, that on the true construction of An Act to Amend the Combines
Investigation Act and the Criminal Code, 1952, 1 Eliz. II, c. 39, s. 41
does not apply to breaches of s. 498  which occurred before the repeal of that
section and its re-enactment, in a slightly different form, by s. 11 of
the 1952 Act.

As to the first of these submissions, it may
well be that the circumstance that a statute deals with a matter of evidence is
not necessarily conclusive as to its having retrospective effect. I agree with
the following observations of the learned author of Phipson on Evidence, 9th
ed. 1952, p. 1:

Law is commonly divided into Substantive
Law, which defines rights, duties and liabilities; and Adjective Law, which
defines the procedure, pleading and proof by which the substantive law is
applied in practice.

The rules of Procedure regulate the
general conduct of litigation; the object of Pleading is to ascertain
for the guidance of the parties and the Court the material facts in issue in
each particular case; Proof is the establishment of such facts by proper
legal means to the satisfaction of the Court, and in this sense includes
disproof. The first-mentioned term is, however, often used to include the other
two.

In Gardner v. Lucas et al.[24], Lord Blackburn says, at p. 603:

Now the general rule, not merely of England
and Scotland, but, I believe, of every civilized nation, is
expressed in the maxim, “Nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non
praeteritis”—prima facie, any new law that is made affects future
transactions, not past ones. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that the
subject-matter of an Act might be such that, though there were not any express
words to shew it, it might be retrospective. For instance, I think it is
perfectly settled that if the Legislature intended to frame a new procedure,
that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should proceed in another
and a different way; clearly there bygone transactions are to be sued for and
enforced according to the new form of procedure. Alterations in the form of
procedure are always retrospective, unless there is some good reason or other
why they

[Page 420]

should not be. Then, again, I think that
where alterations are made in matters of evidence, certainly upon the reason of
the thing, and I think upon the authorities also, those are retrospective,
whether civil or criminal.

It will be observed that Lord Blackburn
differentiates between enactments making alterations in the form of procedure
and those making alterations in matters of evidence but appears to regard both
as prima facie retrospective; he continues:

But where the effect would be to alter a
transaction already entered into, where it would be to make that valid which
was previously invalid—to make an instrument which had no effect at all, and
from which the party was at liberty to depart as long as he pleased, binding—I
think the prima facie construction of the Act is that it is not to be
retrospective, and it would require strong reasons to shew that is not the
case.

The very question raised in this first
submission is dealt with by Casey J., giving the unanimous judgment of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, in Eddy Match Co. Ltd. et al. v. The
Queen[25],
particularly at p. 13, which was followed by the learned trial judge. I am in
substantial agreement with the reasons of Casey J. on this point. While s. 41
makes a revolutionary change in the law of evidence, it creates no offence, it
takes away no defence, it does not render criminal any course of conduct which
was not already so declared before its enactment, it does not alter the
character or legal effect of any transaction already entered into; it deals
with a matter of evidence only and, in my opinion, the learned trial judge was
right in holding that it applied to the trial of the charge before him.

As to the second submission of the appellants,
in regard to the effect of s. 11 of the 1952 Act, set out above, for the
reasons given by my brother Kellock I agree with his conclusion that this
submission must be rejected.

It follows that I would answer question 1 in the
negative.

As to question 2, I am in agreement with the
reasons and conclusion of my brother Kellock.

Questions 3 and 4 may conveniently be dealt with
together. In opening his argument on these questions Mr. Robinette called
attention to the fact that the very point involved appears to have been
decided, adversely to his

[Page 421]

contention, by the judgment of this Court in Belyea
v. The King; Weinraub v. The King[26],
particularly at pp. 281-2; but he argued that the judgment of this Court in Archer
v. The Queen[27] is
inconsistent with that in Belyea v. The King and that we are free to
examine the matter de novo. The question raised in the Archer case
was as to the validity of a conviction in proceedings under The Summary
Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379. This Court was unanimously of opinion
that a conviction on an information charging two offences in the alternative
was invalid and that the defect was not cured by s. 723 or s. 725 of the 1927 Criminal
Code . The governing principle is stated by my brother Locke at p. 40,
quoting from the judgment of Avory J. in Rex v. Surrey Justices; Ex parte
Witherick[28]:

It is an elementary principle that an
information must not charge offences in the alternative, since the defendant
cannot then know with precision with what he is charged and of what he is
convicted and may be prevented on a future occasion from pleading autrefois
convict.

That this principle, except in so far as it may
have been modified by statute, is equally applicable to a count in an
indictment does not appear to me to admit of doubt. It is so decided in many
cases and it is sufficient to refer to the statement of Humphreys J. giving the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. West et al[29]:

...it is elementary law that no more than
one offence may be charged in any one count of an indictment.

I can find nothing in the judgments of this
Court or of the Court of Appeal in the Belyea case to indicate that
those Courts decided whether the fifth count in the indictment, which is set
out in the report of the trial judgment[30],
and was in substance identical with that in the case at bar, charged only one
offence or charged in the alternative more offences than one; although there is
a sentence in the judgment of the trial judge, Wright J., which suggests that
he assumed for the purposes of his decision that the count contained charges of
separate offences.

[Page 422]

That learned judge said, at p. 205:

I do not think the fact that the offences
were stated in the alternative, under the particular circumstances of this
case, leaves the indictment open to be quashed.

As at present advised, I do not think that the
judgment of this Court in the Belyea case requires us to hold that more
offences than one can validly be charged in a single count whether in the
alternative or otherwise and I desire to reserve my opinion on that question
until it becomes necessary to decide it. The reason that I do not find it necessary
to pursue the matter further is that I agree with the conclusion reached by my
brother Kellock and by Roach J.A., that the indictment in the case at bar
charges only one offence, a single conspiracy. I would accordingly answer
questions 3 and 4 in the negative.

As to question 5, I agree with the reasons and
conclusion of my brother Kellock.

Questions 6 and 7 may conveniently be dealt with
together as the answers to them depend upon the interpretation of s. 498(1) (d)
of the Criminal Code .

In approaching these questions it is convenient
to consider first how they were dealt with in the Courts below. We must proceed
upon the facts as found in those Courts. These are summarized in the following
passages in the reasons of Roach J.A.[31]:

On all the evidence, the trial judge made
specific findings of fact as follows:

1. “...that well before the year 1933 these
seven accused companies [the Mills] and the J.R. Booth company had entered into
a firm agreement to control and fix prices and deal with many other elements.
and that agreement has continued from then until the end of the period charged
in the indictment, the 31st October 1952”. (O.R., p. 579.) (I should perhaps
here state that the E.B. Eddy Company leased the assets of J.R. Booth Company
on 1st January 1945 and purchased those assets, except certain Crown leases and
water-rights, in April 1946.)

2. “...with the exception of some very
unimportant merchants…these accused merchants controlled all of the wholesale
trade in fine paper in Ontario
and Quebec. The co‑conspirator
merchants occupied a similar position in the remainder of Canada, and the accused merchants and
co-conspirator merchants through their membership in the Canadian Paper Trade
Association engaged actively in agreeing amongst themselves as to the complete
and absolute control of the wholesale paper trade in the Dominion of Canada.”
(O.R., p. 580.)

[Page 423]

3. That the two groups came together
through the agency of the Mills Relation Committee of the Merchants; “that the
merchants and the mills on many occasions did make agreements and that those
agreements were merely supplementary to and carrying out the main mill-merchant
agreement to lessen competition in fine paper throughout the whole of Canada
(O.R., p. 585); that the accused corporations [both Mills and Merchants] and
Mr. Turgeon, were parties to the main agreement lessening competition, and
that the accused Moffitt aided and abetted the original creation of that
agreement and was, if anything, the most effective agent—so far as the merchants
were concerned—in carrying out the agreement…”

* *
*

In my opinion the learned trial judge was
right in holding that the Mills as a group and the Merchants as a group did
conspire with one another to lessen or prevent competition in the fine paper industry
in Canada; the Mills at the production level, the Merchants at the wholesale
level. Within that broad, over-all, all-embracing agreement each group had its
part to play in accomplishing their common purpose.

The Mills, pursuant to a common understanding
between them and the Merchants, co‑operated with the Merchants to
prevent, if possible, any inroads by others into the wholesale field in which
the Merchants operated; and the Merchants in turn, pursuant to a common
understanding between them and the Mills, co-operated with the Mills to
prevent, if possible, any mill competition from the only source where it really
existed, namely, foreign manufacturers.

At p. 733, Roach J.A. concludes that, on the
evidence as to what happened in the case at bar, “the consumer or whoever buys
from the wholesaler does not get the benefit of any competition at either the
manufacturing or the wholesale level”.

The learned trial judge having rightly held that
the interpretation of s. 498(1) (d) and particularly of the word
“unduly” is a matter of law proceeds to a careful review of most of the
decisions of the Courts of this country which deal with the meaning of the
section and, while he does not, in any one passage, formulate a positive
interpretation of the clause, he reaches the conclusion which he expresses as
follows[32]:

Therefore I have come to the conclusion
that in determining whether an agreement had as its object to lessen
competition unduly, I must be guided by the interpretation of that adverb
assigned in the decisions of the Courts to which I have referred, and in
considering the evidence adduced I am not free to find that the lessening
intended was not undue on the basis of any necessity of the industry,
reasonableness of prices resulting or reasonableness of profits obtained.

[Page 424]

As to the meaning of the word “unduly”, the
views expressed by Roach J.A. do not appear to me to differ in any matter of
substance from those expressed by the learned trial judge. The learned Justice
of Appeal deals with the matter as follows[33]:

As to what is meant by “unduly”, we can
start with the decision of this Court in Rex v. Elliott (1905), 9 O.L.R.
648 at 657... Osler J.A. delivering the judgment of this Court said that
competition is lessened or prevented “unduly” if it is lessened or prevented
“in an undue manner or degree, wrongly, improperly, excessively, inordinately”.

In Weidman et al. v. Shragge (1912),
46 S.C.R. 1 at 37...Duff J., as he then was, said: “... I have no hesitation in
holding that as a rule an agreement having for one of its direct and governing
objects the establishment of a virtual monopoly in the trade in an important
article of commerce throughout a considerable extent of territory by
suppressing competition in that trade, comes under the ban of the enactment”.

In the same case at p. 42, Anglin J., as he
then was, said: “...the prime question certainly must be, does it, however
advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business interests of
the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive, or oppressive restrictions
upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of every one”.

What Duff J. and Anglin J. there said was
quoted with approval later in Stinson-Reeb Builders Supply Company et al. v.
The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276...

In Rex v. Container Materials Ltd. et
al., 76 C.C.C 18 at 43...Robertson C.J.O. said: “Competition from which
everything that makes for success is eliminated except salesmanship is not the
free competition that s. 498  is mainly designed to protect”.

In the same case in the Supreme Court of
Canada, sub nom. Container Materials, Limited et al. v. The King, [1942]
S.C.R. 147...Kerwin J., as he then was, with whom Hudson and Taschereau JJ.
concurred, having first referred to the Stinson-Reeb case and Weidman
et al. v. Shragge, continued: “Under the decision of the Stinson-Reeb case,
the public is entitled to the benefit of free competition except in so far as
it may be interfered with by valid legislation, and any party to an
arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate,
excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an
offence,...the matter must be looked at in each case as a question of fact to
be determined by the tribunal of fact upon a common sense view as to the direct
object of the arrangement complained of”.

The defence introduced evidence which was
intended to show that the prices charged by the Mills were reasonable having
regard to the necessities of the Mills. Such evidence, in my opinion, is no
answer to a charge laid under s. 498  for the reason stated by Anglin J. in Weidman
et al. v. Shragge, supra.

Applying the test laid down in the cases to
which I have referred the agreement between the two groups was one to lessen or
prevent competition unduly.

[Page 425]

In the last sentence in this passage Roach J.A.
appears to regard the decisions from which he has quoted as laying down a
single test for he speaks of “the test laid down”. I must confess that I have
found difficulty in discerning just what that test is. As was pointed out by
Anglin J., in Weidman et al. v. Shragge, supra, at p. 41, the conclusion
is inescapable that Parliament contemplated that there may be agreements to
prevent or lessen competition which do not fall within the prohibition of s.
498(1) (d); the intended prevention or lessening must be “undue” to
render the agreement criminal. “Undue” and “unduly” are not absolute terms
whose meaning is self-evident. Their use presupposes the existence of a rule or
standard defining what is “due”. Their interpretation does not appear to me to
be assisted by substituting the adjectives “improper”, “inordinate”,
“excessive”, “oppressive” or “wrong”, or the corresponding adverbs, in the
absence of a statement as to what, in this connection, is proper, ordinate,
permissible or right.

The conclusion of the learned trial judge in the
case at bar, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, appears to me to be that because
the purpose and effect of the agreement of the appellants was the virtual
elimination or prevention of all competition which would otherwise have entered
into wholesale dealings in the products in question in Canada, the object of
the agreement is necessarily “undue”, and the making of it is criminal, even
although it be affirmatively proved (a) that the prevention of competition
intended to be brought about, and in fact brought about, was no more than was
necessary to permit the industry to develop and survive in Canada, (b) that the
participants derived only reasonable profits, and (c) that the prices charged
to the purchasers of the products were at all times reasonable. I do not intend
to imply that I regard these three matters as having been proved; the question
of law is whether the Courts below were right in holding that, if proved, they
would afford no answer to the charge, and in treating the evidence tendered to
prove them as irrelevant.

[Page 426]

Had the matter been one with which we were
called upon to deal unaided by earlier decisions which are binding upon us, I
would have found this conclusion a surprising one. As was said by my brother
Rand in Re The Farm Products Marketing Act[34]:

The provisions of the Combines
Investigation Act and the Criminal Code  envisage voluntary
combinations or agreements by individuals against the public interest that
violate their prohibitions.

A similar view was expressed by Lord Atkin in Proprietary
Articles Trade Association et al. v. Attorney-General for Canada et al.[35]

Had the three matters mentioned above, which the
learned trial judge regarded as irreleveant, been proved, I would have found it
difficult to regard the agreement as being in either intention or operation
“against the public interest”. But the matter is not res integra; and,
in my view, the learned judges in the Courts below are right in interpreting
the decisions to which they refer as supporting the conviction of the
appellants on the findings of fact which are summarized in the passages quoted
above from the reasons of Roach J.A.

In essence the decisions referred to appear to
me to hold that an agreement to prevent or lessen competition in commercial
activites of the sort described in the section becomes criminal when the
prevention or lessening agreed upon reaches the point at which the participants
in the agreement become free to carry on those activities virtually unaffected
by the influence of competition, which influence Parliament is taken to regard
as an indispensable protection of the public interest; that it is the
arrogation to the members of the combination of the power to carry on their
activities without competition which is rendered unlawful; that the question
whether the power so obtained is in fact misused is treated as irrelevant; and
that the Court, except I suppose on the question of sentence, is neither
required nor permitted to inquire whether in the particular case the intended
and actual results of the agreement have in fact benefited or harmed the
public,

[Page 427]

In other words, once it is established that
there is an agreement to carry the prevention or lessening of competition to
the point mentioned, injury to the public interest is conclusively presumed,
and the parties to the agreement are liable to be convicted of the offence
described in s. 498(1) (d). The relevant question thus becomes the
extent to which the prevention and limitation of competition are agreed to be
carried and not the economic effect of the carrying out of the agreement. In
each case which arises under the section the question whether the point
described has been reached becomes one of fact.

In the case at bar, accepting the interpretation
of s. 498(1) (d) set out above, to which I think the authorities
bind us, the agreement made by the appellants appears to me, on the facts as
found, to fall within the terms of the section.

I conclude that questions 6 and 7 must be
answered in the negative.

Nothing would be gained by my attempting to form
an opinion as to whether the state of the law, brought about by the
interpretation of the section to which I think we are bound, is a
desirable one. If it should be that in construing the word “unduly” the Courts
have failed to discern the true intention of Parliament it is, under the
principle of stare decisis, too late for us to reopen the question, and
the remedy, if one is required, lies in the hands of Parliament.

It follows from what I have said above that, in
my opinion, the appeals should be dismissed.

In view of the dismissal of the appeals, the
cross-appeal ceases to have any great importance. Having concluded for the
reasons given above in dealing with questions 3 and 4 that the indictment,
following as it does the words of s. 498(1) (d), charges only one
offence, although it describes alternative modes of committing it, I am of
opinion that

[Page 428]

the amendment of the conviction ordered by the
Court of Appeal was not necessary and I concur in the disposition of the
cross-appeal proposed by my brother Kellock.

Appeals dismissed; cross-appeal
allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Narcotic drugs—Possession—What
constitutes—Physical possession of package without knowledge of true nature of
contents—The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, s. 4(1)(d).

One who has physical possession of a package
which he believes to contain a harmless substance but which in fact contains a
narcotic drug, cannot be convicted of being in possession of the drug under s.
4(1)(d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The essence of
that crime is the possession of the forbidden substance and in a criminal case
there

[Page 532]

is in law no possession without knowledge of
the character of the forbidden substance. Section 4(1)(d) is
not an enactment of the class that excludes mens rea as an essential
ingredient of the offence, and there is nothing in the wording of s. 17 of the
Act requiring such a construction of s. 4(1)(d). It is,
therefore, misdirection for a trial judge to tell the jury that, if possession
of a package is established, the only question for them to decide is whether or
not the package in fact contained a narcotic drug, and that the accused’s
knowledge or lack of knowledge of that fact, or even his honest but mistaken
belief that it was a harmless substance, are wholly irrelevant to the question
of his guilt or innocence and must not be considered by them.

Rex v. Hess, [1949]
1 W.W.R. 577, approved; Morelli v. The King (1932), 58 C.C.C. 120; Rex
v. Lawrence, [1952] O.R. 149, overruled.

Per Fauteux
and Abbott JJ., dissenting: The statute creates an absolute prohibition
and mens rea is therefore not an essential element of the offence of
possession. The principle underlying the Act is that possession of drugs
covered by it is unlawful and where any exception is made to this principle
that exception is made subject to particular controlling provisions and conditions.

APPEAL by the accused from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal from convictions. Appeal allowed in part.

C.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant.

Walter M. Martin, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Rand, Locke and Cartwright JJ.
was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—The appellant was tried jointly
with one Max Beaver before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury in the Court of
General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York on an indictment reading as follows:

The jurors for our Lady the Queen present
that LOUIS BEAVER and MAX BEAVER, at the City of Toronto, in the County of
York, on or about the 12th day of March, in the year 1954, unlawfully did sell
a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, without the authority of a license from the
Minister of National Health and Welfare or other lawful authority, contrary to
Section 4(1)(f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1952, Chapter 201 and amendments thereto.

2. The said jurors further present that the
said LOUIS BEAVER and MAX BEAVER, at the City of Toronto, in the County of
York, on or about the 12th day of March, in the year 1954, unlawfully did have
in their possession a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, without the authority of
a license from the Minister of National Health and Welfare or other lawful
authority, contrary to Section 4(1)(d) of the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, Chapter 201, and amendments thereto;

AND FURTHER that the said LOUIS BEAVER is
an habitual criminal;

AND FURTHER that the said MAX BEAVER is an
habitual criminal.

[Page 533]

On September 19, 1955, the accused were found
guilty on both counts and on the same day the learned trial judge found them to
be habitual criminals. On October 17, 1955, the learned judge sentenced them to
7 years’ imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently, and
also imposed sentences of preventive detention.

Max Beaver has since died and we are concerned
only with the case of the appellant.

The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal
for Ontario against both
convictions and against the finding that he was an habitual criminal. These
appeals were dismissed.

On February 19, 1957, the appellant was given
leave to appeal to this Court from the convictions on the two counts on the
following grounds:

1: The learned trial Judge erred in failing
to instruct the jury that if they accepted the evidence of Louis Beaver or were
in doubt as a result of it, he was not guilty of the offence.

2: The learned trial Judge erred in holding
that the accused Louis Beaver was guilty of the offence charged whether he knew
the package handed by the accused Max Beaver to the Police were drugs or not.

3: The learned trial Judge erred in
instructing the jury that the only point that they had to decide was whether in
fact the package handed the police by the accused Max Beaver was
diacetylmorphine.

4: The charge to the jury by the learned
trial Judge and the Court of Appeal is in error in holding that the accused
Louis Beaver could be convicted of the offence charged in the absence of
knowledge on his part that the substance in question was a drug.

By the same order, leave to appeal from the
finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal was granted, conditionally
upon the appeals from the convictions being successful.

It is not necessary to set out the facts in
detail. There was evidence on which it was open to the jury to find (i) that
Max Beaver sold to a police officer, who was working under cover, a package
which in fact contained diacetylmorphine, (ii) that the appellant was a party
to the sale of the package, (iii) that while the appellant did not have the
package on his person or in his physical possession he and Max Beaver were
acting jointly in such circumstances that the possession which the latter had
of the package was the possession of both of the accused,

[Page 534]

and (iv) that the appellant had no knowledge
that the substance contained in the package was diacetylmorphine and believed
it to be sugar of milk.

I do not mean to suggest that the jury would
necessarily have made the fourth finding but there was evidence on which they
might have done so, or which might have left them in a state of doubt as to
whether or not the appellant knew that the package contained anything other
than sugar of milk.

The learned trial judge, against the protest of
the appellant, charged the jury, in effect, that if they were satisfied that
the appellant had in his possession a package and sold it, then, if in fact the
substance contained in the package was diacetylmorphine, the appellant was
guilty on both counts, and that the questions (i) whether he had any knowledge
of what the substance was, or (ii) whether he entertained the honest but
mistaken belief that it was a harmless substance were irrelevant and must not
be considered. Laidlaw J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court
of Appeal, was of opinion that this charge was right in law and that the
learned trial judge was bound by the decision in Rex v. Lawrence[2], to direct the jury as he did. The main
question on this appeal is whether this view of the law is correct.

The problem is one of construction of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, and particularly the following
sections, which at the date of the offences charged read as follows:

4. (1) Every person who…

(d) has in his possession any
drug save and except under the authority of a licence from the Minister first
had and obtained, or other lawful authority;…

(f) manufactures, sells, gives away,
delivers or distributes or makes any offer in respect of any drug, or any
substance represented or held out by such person to be a drug, to any person
without first obtaining a licence from the Minister, or without other lawful
authority;…

is guilty of an offence, and is liable

(i) upon indictment, to imprisonment for
any term not exceeding seven years and not less than six months, and to a fine
not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, and,
in addition, at the discretion of the judge, to be whipped; or

[Page 535]

(ii) upon summary conviction, to
imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding eighteen
months and not less than six months, and to a fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars and not less than two hundred dollars.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal
Code , or of any other statute or law, the court has no power to impose less
than the minimum penalties herein prescribed, and shall, in all cases of
conviction, impose both fine and imprisonment;…

11. (1) No person shall, without lawful
authority or without a permit signed by the Minister or some person authorized
by him in that behalf, import or have in his possession any opium pipe, opium
lamp, or other device or apparatus designed or generally used for the purpose
of preparing opium for smoking, or smoking or inhaling opium, or any article
capable of being used as or as part of any such pipe, lamp or other device or
apparatus.

(2) Any person violating the provisions of
this section is liable, upon summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding
one hundred dollars, and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding three months, or to both fine and imprisonment.

15. Where any person is charged with an
offence under paragraph (a), (d), (e), (f), or (g)
of subsection (1) of section 4, it is not necessary for the
prosecuting authority to establish that the accused had not a licence from the
Minister or was not otherwise authorized to commit the act complained of, and
if the accused pleads or alleges that he had such licence or other authority
the burden of proof thereof shall be upon the person so charged.

17. Without limiting the generality of
paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 4, any
person who occupies, controls, or is in possession of any building, room,
vessel, vehicle, enclosure or place, in or upon which any drug or any article
mentioned in section 11 is found, shall, if charged with having such drug
or article in possession without lawful authority, be deemed to have been so in
possession unless he prove that the drug or article was there without his
authority, knowledge or consent, or that he was lawfully entitled to the
possession thereof.

In the course of the argument counsel also
referred to the following provisions of other statutes of Canada:

The Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s.
28(1):

28(1) Every Act shall be read and construed
as if any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described
or referred to as an indictable offence;

(b) punishable on summary
conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and

all provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every
such offence.

The Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 5:

5. In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,…

(b) having in one’s
possession includes not only having in one’s own personal possession, but also
knowingly,

[Page 536]

(i) having in the actual possession or
custody of any other person, and

(ii) having in any place, whether belonging
to or occupied by one’s self or not, for the use or benefit of one’s self or of
any other person.

2. If there are two or more persons, and
any one or more of them, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has or
have anything in his or their custody or possession, it shall be deemed and
taken to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.

The judgment in appeal is supported by earlier
decisions of appellate Courts in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, but a directly contrary view has been expressed by the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia.
While this conflict has existed since 1948, this is the first occasion on which
the question has been brought before this Court.

It may be of assistance in examining the problem
to use a simple illustration. Suppose X goes to the shop of Y, a druggist, and
asks Y to sell him some baking-soda. Y hands him a sealed packet which he tells
him contains baking-soda and charges him a few cents. X honestly believes that
the packet contains baking-soda but in fact it contains heroin. X puts the
package in his pocket, takes it home and later puts it in a cupboard in his
bathroom. There would seem to be no doubt that X has had actual manual and
physical possession of the package and that he continues to have possession of
the package while it is in his cupboard. The main question raised on this
appeal is whether, in the supposed circumstances, X would be guilty of the
crime of having heroin in his possession?

It will be observed at once that we are not
concerned with the incidence of the burden of proof or of the obligation of
adducing evidence. The judgment of the Court of Appeal states the law to be
that X must be convicted although he proves to the point of demonstration that
he honestly believed the package to contain baking-soda.

I have examined all the cases referred to by
counsel in the course of their full and helpful arguments but do not propose to
refer to them in detail as the differences of opinion which they disclose are
not so much as to the principles by which the Court should be guided in con-

[Page 537]

struing a statute which creates a crime as to
the result of applying those principles to the Act with which we are concerned.

The rule of construction has often been stated.

In The Company of Proprietors of the Margate
Pier v. Hannam et al.[3], Lord
Coke is quoted as having said:

Acts of Parliament are to be so construed
as no man that is innocent, or free from injury or wrong, be by a literal
construction punished or endamaged.

In The Attorney General v. Bradlaugh[4], Brett M.R. said:

Now, to my mind, it is contrary to the
whole established law of England (unless the legislation on the subject has
clearly enacted it), to say that a person can be guilty of a crime in England
without a wrongful intent—without an attempt to do that which the law has
forbidden. I am aware that in a particular case, and under a particular
criminal statute, fifteen judges to one held that a person whom the jury found
to have no intent to do what was forbidden, and whom the jury found to have
been deceived, and to have understood the facts to be such that he might with
impunity have done a certain thing, was by the terms of that Act of Parliament
guilty of a crime, and could be imprisoned. I say still, as I said then, that I
cannot subscribe to the propriety of that decision. I bow to it, but I cannot
subscribe to it: but the majority of the judges forming the Court so held
because they said that the enactment was absolutely clear.

In Reynolds v. G.H. Austin & Sons Ld.[5], Devlin J. says at pp. 147-8:

It has always been a principle of the
common law that mens rea is an essential element in the commission of any
criminal offence against the common law. In the case of statutory offences it
depends on the effect of the statute. In Sherras v. De Rutzen, [1895] 1
Q.B. 918, 921, Wright, J., in his well-known judgment, laid it down that there
was a presumption that mens rea was an essential ingredient in a statutory
offence, but that that presumption was liable to be displaced either by the
words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which
it dealt… Kennedy, L.J., in Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation, [1910] 2
K.B. 471, 483, thought that in construing a modern statute this presumption as
to mens rea did not exist. In this respect, as he said, he differed from
Channell, J., in the court below. But the view of Wright, J., in Sherras v.
De Rutzen has consistently been followed. I need refer only to the dictum
of Lord Goddard, C.J., in Harding v. Price, [1948] 1 K.B. 695, 700: “The
general rule applicable to criminal cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit
rea, and I venture to repeat what I said in Brend v. Wood (1946), 62
T.L.R. 462, 463: ‘It is of the utmost importance for the protection of

[Page 538]

the liberty of the subject that a court
should always bear in mind that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary
implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the court
should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he
has a guilty mind’.”

In Regina v. Tolson[6], Stephen J. says at p. 188:

...I think it may be laid down as a general
rule that an alleged offender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts
which he in good faith and on reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did
the act alleged to be an offence.

I am unable to suggest any real exception
to this rule, nor has one ever been suggested to me.

and adds at p. 189:

Of course, it would be competent to the
legislature to define a crime in such a way as to make the existence of any
state of mind immaterial. The question is solely whether it has actually done
so in this case.

I adhere to the opinion which, with the
concurrence of my brother Nolan, I expressed in The Queen v. Rees[7], that the first of the statements of
Stephen J. quoted above should now be read in the light of the judgment of Lord
Goddard C.J., concurred in by Lynskey and Devlin JJ., in Wilson v. Inyang[8], which, in my opinion, rightly decides that
the essential question is whether the belief entertained by the accused is an
honest one and that the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds for
such belief is merely relevant evidence to be weighed by the tribunal of fact
in determining that essential question.

In Watts and Gaunt v. The Queen[9], Estey J. says:

While an offence of which mens rea is
not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view of the general
rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless
Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an
intention.

I do not suggest that the principle stated in
the above excerpts was absent from the minds of the learned judges in the
Courts of Appeal in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia who decided the cases on
which the respondent relies. Those decisions are founded on the judgment of

[Page 539]

the Court of King’s Bench, Appeal Side, in Morelli
v. The King[10], in
which Bond J., at p. 128, concluded his reasons as follows:

I therefore reach the conclusion that while
it is a principle of our law that to constitute an offence there must be a
guilty mind, and that principle must be imported into the statute (per Cockburn,
C.J., 8 Cox C.C., at p. 478), yet by apt words Parliament may exclude such a
requirement, and in the case now under consideration has effectively done so.

When the decisions as to the construction of the
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act on which the respondent relies are examined
it appears that two main reasons are assigned for holding that mens rea is
not an essential ingredient of the offence created by s. 4(1)(d), these
being (i) the assumption that the subject-matter with which the Act deals is of
the kind dealt with in the cases of which Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation[11] is typical and which are sometimes
referred to as “public welfare offence cases”, and (ii) by implication from the
wording of s. 17 of the Act.

As to the first of these reasons, I can discern
little similarity between a statute designed, by forbidding the sale of unsound
meat, to ensure that the supply available to the public shall be wholesome, and
a statute making it a serious crime to possess or deal in narcotics; the one is
to ensure that a lawful and necessary trade shall be carried on in a manner not
to endanger the public health, the other to forbid altogether conduct regarded
as harmful in itself. As a necessary feature of his trade, the butcher holds
himself out as selling meat fit for consumption; he warrants that quality; and
it is part of his duty as trader to see that the merchandise is wholesome. The
statute simply converts that civil personal duty into a public duty.

A few passages from the judgment in Hobbs v.
Winchester Corporation will show the view taken of the purpose of the
legislation there under consideration:

Cozens-Hardy M.R., at p. 476:

Before reading the material words of these
sections it is perhaps convenient to indicate what is the plain and
apparent object of the Act with regard to the sale of unsound meat. The object
is to prevent danger to the public health by the sale of meat for human
consumption in a state or condition in which it is dangerous to human health.

[Page 540]

Farwell L.J., at p. 481:

Who is to take the risk of the meat being
unsound, the butcher or the public? In my opinion the Legislature intended that
the butcher should take the risk and that the public should be protected,
irrespective of the guilt or innocence of the butcher. The knowledge or
possible means of knowledge of the butcher is not a matter which affects the
public; it is the unsound meat which poisons them; and I think that the
Legislature intended that the butcher should sell unsound meat at his peril.

Kennedy L.J., at pp. 484-5:

A man takes upon himself to offer goods to
the public for their consumption with a view to making a profit by the sale of
them. Those goods may be so impregnated with disease as to carry death or at
any rate serious injury to health to any one consuming them. To say that the
difficulty of discovering the disease is a sufficient ground for enabling the
seller to excuse himself on the plea that he cannot be reasonably expected to
have the requisite technical knowledge or to keep an analyst on his premises,
is simply to say that the public are to be left unprotected and must submit to
take the risk of purchasing an article of food which may turn out to be
dangerous to life or health. I think that the policy of the Act is this: that
if a man chooses for profit to engage in a business which involves the offering
for sale of that which may be deadly or injurious to health he must take that
risk, and that it is not a sufficient defence for any one who chooses to embark
on such a business to say “I could not have discovered the disease unless I had
an analyst on the premises.”

Assuming that Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation
was rightly decided I do not think that its reasoning supports the decision
of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. The difference between the
subject-matter of the legislation there considered and that of the Act with
which we are concerned is too wide.

As to the second reason, the argument is put as
follows: Using again the illustration I have taken above, it is said (i) that
the words of s. 17 would require the conviction of X if the package was found
in his bathroom cupboard “unless he prove that [it] was there without his
authority, knowledge or consent”, that is, he is prima facie presumed to
be guilty but can exculpate himself by proving lack of knowledge, and (ii) that
since no such words as “unless he prove that the drug was in his possession
without his knowledge” are found in s. 4(1)(d) it must be held
that Parliament intended that lack of knowledge should be no defence.

In my view all that s. 17 accomplishes, still
using the same illustration, is, on proof that the package was in his cupboard,
to shift to X the onus of proving that he did not have possession of the
package. To this X would

[Page 541]

answer: “Of course I had possession of the
package, I bought it, paid for it, carried it home and put it in my cupboard.
My defence is that I thought it contained baking-soda. I had no idea it
contained heroin.” If it be suggested that X could not usefully make this reply
if what was found in his house was not a sealed package but an article of the
sort described in s. 11 the answer would appear to be that many persons might
not recognize an opium lamp or an article capable of being used as part of such
a lamp. The wording of s. 17 does not appear to me to compel the Court to
construe s. 4 as the Court of Appeal has done. It still leaves unanswered the
question: Has X possession of heroin when he has in his hand or in his pocket
or in his cupboard a package which in fact contains heroin but which he
honestly believes contains only baking-soda? In my opinion that question must
be answered in the negative. The essence of the crime is the possession of the
forbidden substance and in a criminal case there is in law no possession
without knowledge of the character of the forbidden substance. Just as in Regina
v. Ashwell[12] the
accused did not in law have possession of the complainant’s sovereign so long
as he honestly believed it to be a shilling so in my illustration X did not
have possession of heroin so long as he honestly believed the package to
contain baking-soda. The words of Lord Coleridge C.J. in Regina v. Ashwell at
p. 225, quoted by Charles J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the
Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Hudson[13]:

In good sense it seems to me he did not
take it till he knew what he had got; and when he knew what he had got, that
same instant he stole it.

might well be adapted to my illustration to
read: “In good sense it seems to me he did not have possession of heroin till
he knew what he had got.”

In my view the law is correctly stated in the
following passage in the judgment of O’Halloran J.A., with whom Robertson J.A.
concurred, in Rex v. Hess[14]:

To constitute “possession” within the
meaning of the criminal law it is my judgment that where, as here, there is
manual handling of a thing, it must be co-existent with knowledge of what the
thing is, and both these

[Page 542]

elements must be co-existent with some act
of control (outside public duty). When those three elements exist together, I
think it must be conceded that under sec. 4(1)(d) it does
not then matter if the thing is retained for an innocent purpose.

If the matter were otherwise doubtful I would be
drawn to the conclusion that Parliament did not intend to enact that mens
rea should not be an essential ingredient of the offence created by s. 4(1)(d)
by the circumstance that on conviction a minimum sentence of 6 months’
imprisonment plus a fine of $200 must be imposed. Counsel informed us that they
have found no other statutory provision which has been held to create a crime
of strict responsibility, that is to say, one in which the necessity for mens
rea is excluded, on conviction for which a sentence of imprisonment is
mandatory. The legislation dealt with in Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation,
supra, provided that a sentence of imprisonment might, not must, be imposed
on a convicted person. As to this Kennedy L.J. said at p. 485:

Great stress is laid on the character of
the punishment that may be inflicted under s. 117. I protest for myself
that we are not to assume that where a judicial discretion is granted by the
Legislature the tribunal, whatever its rank may be, exercising that discretion
will exercise it otherwise than in a judicial manner. Because there may be a
case, as there obviously may be, in which a man unknowingly exposes for sale
food which is dangerous to health, and because the offence created by the
statute is punishable by imprisonment in the first instance, that to my mind is
not a ground for holding that a mens rea must be shewn in every case. If it is
shewn that the man had no guilty knowledge the magistrate would probably
inflict a merely nominal fine…

At p. 481 Cozens-Hardy M.R. expressed himself in
similar terms.

It would, of course, be within the power of
Parliament to enact that a person who, without any guilty knowledge, had in his
physical possession a package which he honestly believed to contain a harmless
substance such as baking-soda but which in fact contained heroin, must on proof
of such facts be convicted of a crime and sentenced to at least 6 months’
imprisonment; but I would refuse to impute such an intention to Parliament
unless the words of the statute were clear and admitted of no other
interpretation. To borrow the words of Lord Kenyan in Fowler v. Padget[15]:

[Page 543]

I would adopt any construction of the
statute that the words will bear, in order to avoid such monstrous consequences
as would manifestly ensue from the construction contended for…

The conclusion which I have reached on the main
question as to the proper construction of the word “possession” makes it
unnecessary for me to consider the other points raised by Mr. Dubin in his
argument as to the construction of s. 4(1)(d). For the above reasons I
would quash the conviction on the charge of having possession of a drug.

As to the charge of selling, as is pointed out
by my brother Fauteux, the appellant’s version of the facts brings his actions
within the provisions of s. 4(1)(f) since he and his brother jointly
sold a substance represented or held out by them to be heroin; and I agree with
the conclusion of my brother Fauteux that the conviction on the charge of
selling must be affirmed.

For the above reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal as to the first count (that is, of selling) but would direct that the
time during which the appellant has been confined pending the determination of
the appeal shall count as part of the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
that conviction. As to the second count (that is, of having possession) I would
allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial. As leave to
appeal from the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal was granted
conditionally upon the appeal from the convictions being successful, and as the
appeal as to one conviction has failed, we are without jurisdiction to review
the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal and in the result that
finding stands.

The judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—The appellant
Louis Beaver appeals, with leave of this Court, from a unanimous judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[16]
affirming his conviction by a jury on an indictment charging him, jointly with
his brother Max Beaver, on two counts: (i) possession

[Page 544]

and (ii) sale, on March 12, 1954, of a drug, to
wit, diacetylmorphine, contrary to s. 4(1)(d) and s: 4(1)(f),
respectively, of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201.

Subsequent to this conviction, the appellant was
found to be an habitual criminal and this conviction, being appealed, was also
unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal as to this
conviction has been granted, conditionally upon the appeal against the
conviction on the primary charge being successful.

To appreciate and determine the points of law
raised on behalf of the appellant on the appeal related to the primary charge,
it is expedient but sufficient to relate the following facts.

The evidence for the prosecution shows that in
the forenoon of March 12, 1954,
Constable Tassie of the R.C.M.P., known and operating under the name of Al
Demeter, was introduced to the appellant by one Montroy, a drug addict, as one
who was interested to obtain, jointly with him, one ounce of heroin. The price
asked by the appellant for such a quantity being $800, it was agreed that only
half an ounce would be bought and, further, that delivery and payment would be
made at four o’clock in the afternoon, at the same place; the appellant
insisting, however, that only one of either Tassie or Montroy was then to
appear. At the appointed time and place, Tassie arrived and boarded the car
driven by the appellant, then in company of his brother Max Beaver. Having
travelled a certain distance, the car stopped; Max Beaver walked out towards a
lamp-post, picked up a parcel, came back and boarded the car, and while
proceeding to another destination, gave the parcel to Tassie who paid him the
agreed price. Admittedly, this package contained half an ounce of
diacetylmorphine.

The appellant did not challenge these
incriminating facts but, testifying in his own defence, gave the following
evidence: The day before the above-related occurrences, appellant and Montroy
met together. The latter explained to the former that one Al Demeter had
“double crossed” him, that he wanted to “get even” with him and, to achieve
this purpose, made the following proposal, to which appellant acceded. It was
agreed that Montroy

[Page 545]

would introduce Demeter, who wanted to have
drugs, to appellant as one from whom they could be obtained; a sale would be
made; but sugar of milk instead of drugs would be delivered and the price
received by the appellant would be remitted to Montroy. Feeling indebted to
Montroy, from whom he and his brother, Max Beaver, had received certain favours
while in a penitentiary, appellant executed this fraudulent plan.

Hence, on his story, appellant’s defence was
that he never intended to deal in drugs and never knew that the parcel
delivered contained any. This was not accepted by the trial judge or by the
Court of Appeal as being a valid defence in law under the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act. The jury, therefore, did not consider that defence which was
withdrawn from them.

The grounds of law upon which leave to appeal
was granted are the following:

1: The learned trial Judge erred in failing
to instruct the jury that if they accepted the evidence of Louis Beaver or were
in doubt as a result of it, he was not guilty of the offence.

2: The learned trial Judge erred in holding
that the accused Louis Beaver was guilty of the offence charged whether he knew
the package handed by the accused Max Beaver to the Police were drugs or not.

3: The learned trial Judge erred in
instructing the jury that the only point that they had to decide was whether in
fact the package handed the police by the accused Max Beaver was
diacetylmorphine.

4: The charge to the jury by the learned
trial Judge and the Court of Appeal is in error in holding that the accused
Louis Beaver could be convicted of the offence charged in the absence of
knowledge on his part that the substance in question was a drug.

The first proposition of law, submitted by
counsel for the appellant, is that want of knowledge as to the nature of a
substance found in the possession of an accused is a good defence to a charge
that he had in his possession a drug, contrary to s. 4(1)(d) of
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.

This submission rests on the presumption that mens
rea is a necessary ingredient in every offence. But, as stated by Wright J.
in Sherras v. De Rutzen[17], this
presumption is liable to be displaced and this may be done either by the words
of the statute creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which it
deals, both of which must be considered. This view of the law and of the method

[Page 546]

of interpreting a statute when the question
arises, is expressed in many other cases, such as Hobbs v. Winchester
Corporation[18], and Reynolds
v. G.H. Austin & Sons Ld.[19]

It appears convenient to deal first with the
subject-matter of the Act and consider afterwards the provisions directly
relevant to the offence of possession.

The plain and apparent object of the Act is to
prevent, by a rigid control of the possession of drugs, the danger to public
health, and to guard society against the social evils which an uncontrolled
traffic in drugs is bound to generate. The scheme of the Act is this: The
importation, exportation, sale, manufacture, production and distribution of
drugs are subject to the obtention of a licence which the Minister of National
Health and Welfare may issue, with the approval of the Governor General in
council, and in which the place where such operations may be carried on is
stated. Under the same authority are indicated ports and places in Canada where
drugs may be exported or imported, the manner in which they are to be packed
and marked for export, the records to be kept for such export, import, receipt,
sale, disposal and distribution. The Act also provides for the establishment of
all other convenient and necessary regulations with respect to duration, terms
and forms of the several licences therein provided. Without a licence, it is an
offence to import or export from Canada and an offence for any one who, not being a common carrier, takes
or carries, or causes to be taken or carried from any place in Canada to any other place in Canada, any drug. Druggists, physicians,
dentists and veterinary surgeons stand of course, in a privileged class; but
even their dealings in drugs for medicinal purposes are the object of a
particular control. Under penalties of the law, some of them have to keep
records of their operations, while others have the obligation to answer
inquiries in respect thereto. Having in one’s possession drugs without a
licence or other lawful authority, is an offence. In brief, the principle
underlying the Act is that possession of drugs covered by it is unlawful; and
where any exception is

[Page 547]

made to the principle, the exceptions themselves
are attended with particular controlling provisions and conditions.

The enforcement sections of the Act
manifest the exceptional vigilance and firmness which Parliament thought of the
essence to forestall the unlawful traffic in narcotic drugs and cope
effectively with the unusual difficulties standing in the way of the realization
of the object of the statute. Substantive and procedural principles generally
prevailing under the Criminal Code  in favour of the subject are being
restricted or excepted. The power to search by day or by night, either premises
or the person, is largely extended under s. 19 . Special writs of assistance are
provided for under s. 22 . The consideration of the provisions of ss. 4  and 17 
being deferred for the moment, the burden of proof is either alleviated or
shifted to persons charged with violations under ss. 6 , 11 , 13 , 16  and 18 .
Minimum sentences are provided or are made mandatory, under ss. 4  and 6 .
Deportation of aliens found guilty is also mandatory and this notwithstanding
the provisions of the Immigration Act or any other Act, under s. 26 . And
the application of the Identification of Criminals Act , ordinarily
limited to the case of indictable offences, is, by s. 27 , extended to any
offence under the Act.

All of these provisions are indicative of the
will of Parliament to give the most efficient protection to public health
against the danger attending the uncontrolled use of drugs as well as against
the social evils incidental thereto, by measures generally centred and directed
to possession itself of the drugs covered by the Act. The subject-matter, the
purpose and the scope of the Act are such that to subject its provisions to the
narrow construction suggested on behalf of appellant would defeat the very
object of the Act. Such narrow construction is repugnant to the clear terms of
s. 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158. In Chajutin v.
Whitehead[20], Lord
Hewart C.J., referring to the provisions of art. 18 of

[Page 548]

para. 4(d) of the Aliens’
Order, 1920, which made an offence of the possession, without lawful authority,
of a forged passport, said, at p. 509:

In my opinion the Order—the circumstances
giving rise to which are

sufficiently familiar—would be reduced
almost to waste paper if the offence could not be established unless the
prosecution proved that the person having in his possession the forged passport
had guilty knowledge of the fact that it had been forged. It is not easy to see
how that knowledge, except in rare circumstances, could be directly proved; but
not only, in my opinion, is there nothing in this part of the article to put any
such burden upon the prosecution, but the words of the article negative the
view that the prosecution is required to carry such a burden.

In that case, the appeal committee found, as a
fact, that the appellant did not know that the passport had been altered, and
honestly believed, on reasonable grounds, that it had been issued to him in the
ordinary course, by the proper authority. The language of art. 18, para. 4(d),
of the Order was as follows:

Any person shall be guilty of an…offence
if…he…

(d) without lawful authority
uses or has in his possession any forged, altered or irregular certificate,
passport, or other document, or any passport or document on which any visa or
endorsement has been altered or forged.

It was none the less decided that it was neither
necessary for the prosecution to prove guilty knowledge of the alteration, nor
open to the defendant to secure acquittal by proof that he did not know and had
no reason to suspect that the passport was altered. This case, amongst others,
such as Rex v. Wheat; Rex v. Stocks[21],
is a clear authority supporting the proposition that the presumption that mens
rea is an ingredient of an offence, as well as the defence flowing from an
honest belief as to the existence of a state of facts may, by reason of the subject-matter
of the Act or of the language of its provisions, or of both, cease to obtain.
The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act comes, in my view, within these classes
of Acts referred to by Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen, supra.

With these considerations related to the
subject-matter of the Act, it is appropriate now to turn to the language of the
provisions of the statute directly related to the offence of possession.

[Page 549]

The main provisions to consider are those of s.
4(1)(d), reading as follows:

4. (1) Every person who…

(d) has in his possession any
drug save and except under the authority of a licence from the Minister first
had and obtained, or other lawful authority;…

is guilty of an offence, and is liable…

On the plain, literal and grammatical meaning of
the words of this section, there is an absolute prohibition to be in possession
of drugs, whatever be the various meanings of which the word possession may be
susceptible, unless the possession is under the authority of a licence from the
Minister first had and obtained, or under other lawful authority. As to the
meaning of these provisions, I am in respectful agreement with and content to
refer to the reasoning of Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal for
Ontario, in Rex v. Lawrence[22].

The language of the section and the
subject-matter of the Act in which it is found, both considered in the light of
the provisions of s. 15 of the Interpretation Act, cannot justify the
narrow meaning of the word possession which is contended for by counsel for the
appellant. I find no reason which would render inapplicable to this case what
was said by Lord Hewart C.J. in the case of Chajutin v. Whitehead, supra. The
question is not what is the meaning ascribed to the word possession in civil or
in criminal cases, at common law or under statutory laws, but what is the
meaning of the word under the Act and the provisions here considered. The case
of Regina v. Ashwell[23] is, I
think, of no application in the matter. The question there considered was
possession in relation to the offence of larceny. Larceny is an offence
involving the violation of possession; it is an offence against a possessor.
This is not the type of possession with which this Act is concerned.

In The Attorney-General v. Lockwood[24], Alderson B. said at p. 398:

The rule of law, I take it, upon the
construction of all statutes, and therefore applicable to the construction of
this, is, whether they be penal or remedial, to construe them according to the
plain, literal and gramma-

[Page 550]

tical meaning of the words in which they
are expressed, unless that construction leads to a plain and clear
contradiction of the apparent purpose of the act, or to some palpable and
evident absurdity.

The interpretation of s. 4(1)(d), as made
particularly in Bex v. Lawrence, supra, cannot, I think, be said to
lead “to a plain and clear contradiction of the apparent purpose of the Act”.
On the contrary, of the construction suggested by the appellant and the one
submitted by the respondent, the latter appears to be the only one really
consistent with the apparent purpose of the Act. Nor, in my respectful view,
can this latter construction be said to lead “to some palpable and evident
absurdity”. Such a view was not the one reached by Lord Hewart C.J. in Chajutin
v. Whitehead, supra, where the provision of the law creating the offence
was couched in language substantially similar to the one here examined. Indeed,
and when the provisions of s. 4(1)(d) are further considered in
the light of those of s. 17, it would seem to me that the construction
suggested on behalf of the appellant would, as it will appear, bring an
astonishing result.

Section 17 reads:

17. Without limiting the generality of
paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 4, any person who
occupies, controls, or is in possession of any building, room, vessel, vehicle,
enclosure or place, in or upon which any drug or any article mentioned in
section 11 is found, shall, if charged with having such drug or article in
possession without lawful authority, be deemed to have been so in possession
unless he prove that the drug or article was there without his authority,
knowledge or consent, or that he was lawfully entitled to the possession
thereof.

The language of the section is clear.
Parliament has provided: (i) that either one of these three facts, i.e., occupation,
or control, or possession, of any place in or upon which a drug covered by the
Act is found, makes without more one who occupies, controls or has in his
possession such a place, a possessor of drug without lawful authority, and (ii)
that the occupier of such a place “shall, if charged with having such
drug or article in possession without lawful authority, be deemed to have
been so in possession unless he prove that the drug or article was there
without his authority, knowledge or consent, or that he was lawfully entitled
to the possession thereof”. In the circumstances described in this section,
knowledge in any sense is not an essential ingredient of the offence; but

[Page 551]

lack of knowledge, if proved, is a defence. Yet,
on the submission of appellant, if a drug is found on the very person of the
accused, knowledge as to the nature of the substance would be an essential
ingredient of the offence and would, therefore, have to be proved as part of the
case for the prosecution of a charge laid under s. 4(1)(d). The
essential ingredients of unlawful possession, under the Act, are the same under
s. 4(1)(d) and under s. 17; the opening words of the latter
section forbid us to construe the offence in a manner varying from one
section to the other. This, however, is the result flowing from the
appellant’s submission. Furthermore, and if it is argued that knowledge is of
the essence of unlawful possession under both s. 4(1)(d) and s. 17, then
one is at a loss to understand why Parliament should have, in the latter
section, provided for a defence resting on the proof of lack of knowledge. A
like interpretation of s. 17 strips this exculpatory provision of any meaning
and effect. The language of the two sections can only be rationalized, I
think, by interpreting s. 4(1)(d) as meaning what it says, i.e., as
creating an absolute prohibition, and by interpreting s. 17 as extending the
meaning of s. 4(1)(d), i.e., this absolute prohibition, to the
circumstances described in s. 17, with, however, and only in such
circumstances, a defence resting on the proof of lack of knowledge.

This is the first occasion which this Court has
to consider this submission of appellant which, ever since the decision
rendered in 1932 in Morelli v. The King[25],
the judges of the provincial Courts of Appeal have, with a few exceptions,
refused to accept. The majority judgment rendered in 1948 in Rex v. Hess[26] stands as the first expression of judicial
opinion contrary to these views. In the majority of judgments rendered
subsequently to the Hess case, the views therein expressed were not
followed. This decision has no reference to the Morelli case and it
rests principally on a concept of possession which, in my respectful view, the
subject-matter, purpose and scope of the Act and the language of s. 4(1)(d)
and s. 17 do not warrant.

[Page 552]

The more recent reported case, where a similar
question was considered by the English Court of Criminal Appeal, is that of Regina
v. Hallam[27]. The
provision considered was s. 4(1) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883,
the relevant part of which reads:

Any person who… knowingly has in his
possession or under his control any explosive substance, under such
circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that he… does not have
it in his possession or under his control for a lawful object, shall, unless he
can show that he… had it in his possession or under his control for a lawful
object, be guilty of felony…

On this language, it was decided that knowledge
that the substance was an explosive was an essential ingredient of the offence.
Arguments such as the one related to the concept of possession, which feature
the reasoning in the Hess case, supra, are foreign to this
decision, which indeed was reached because the word possession was there
qualified by the word “knowingly”. Such a word, as noted by Laidlaw J.A. in the
Lawrence case, supra, is absent from s. 4(1)(d). Furthermore,
while possession of explosive substances is not, under the English Act of 1883,
subject to a licence first had and obtained or other lawful authority, the
contrary is the case with respect to the possession of drugs under the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. Finally, the existence of “such circumstances as to
give rise to a reasonable suspicion” that possession is for an unlawful object
is an essential ingredient of the offence under the Explosive Substances
Act; this ingredient does not appear under s. 4(1)(d). Reading the
reasons for judgment in the Hallam case, one reaches the view that had
the provisions therein considered been worded as are those of s. 4(1)(d)
and as were also those of the section considered in Chajutin v.
Whitehead, supra, a decision similar to the one rendered in the latter case
would have been made.

As interpreted by most of the members of the
Canadian Courts of Appeal since 1932, the provisions of s. 4(1)(d) are,
like many other provisions of the Act, undoubtedly severe. The duty of the
Courts is to give effect to the language of Parliament. And notwithstanding that
the views expressed in Morelli and Lawrence, in particular, had been prevailing
ever since 1932 and are still prevailing, Parliament has not seen fit to
intervene. For all these

[Page 553]

reasons, I find it impossible to accede to the
proposition that knowledge of the nature of the substance is of the essence of
the offence of unlawful possession under the Act.

Even assuming the correctness of this view of
the law, argues counsel for the appellant, the latter could not be found guilty
of either possession under s. 4(1)(d) or sale under s. 4(1)(f).

As to possession: Contrary to what is admittedly
the fact in the case of Max Beaver, it is said, Louis Beaver the appellant did
not have physical possession. The application of the relevant provisions of s.
5 of the 1927 Criminal Code  in like matters has never been doubted. As
stated by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Rex v. Colvin and Gladue[28],
there is joint possession where one has a right to exercise some measure of
control over the thing in the possession of another. On the admitted facts of
this case, there is no doubt that the appellant was, to say the least, in full
command and control of all the operations.

As to sale: Though the substance delivered to
and paid for by Tassie was a drug, as admittedly it was represented and held
out to be by appellant, it is said that the latter could not be guilty of the
offence of sale under s. 4(1)(f) because, on his story, he intended and
thought the substance sold to be sugar of milk. To this submission, the
provisions of s. 4(1)(f) afford, I think, a complete answer:

4. (1) Every one who…

(f)... sells,… any drug, or any
substance represented or held out by such person to be a drug, to
any person without first obtaining a licence from the Minister, or without
other lawful authority;...

In the case of any sale made without first
obtaining a licence from the Minister or without other lawful authority, the
accuracy or inaccuracy of the representation made by the seller to the
purchaser as to the nature of the substance sold and the honesty or dishonesty
attending the representation, if inaccurate, are quite immaterial if the
substance sold is represented or held out to be a drug by the seller to the
purchaser. The relevant count of the indictment does not in terms say that
appellant did sell a substance represented or held out by him to Tassie to be a
drug, but that “he did sell a drug, to wit, diacetyl-

[Page 554]

morphine”; in this language, however, is
necessarily implied the allegation of the fact that appellant represented or
held out the substance sold, delivered and paid for, to be a drug. Hence
appellant’s version of the facts brings this case within the provisions of s.
4(1)(f) and, if believed, would leave no alternative to a reasonable
jury acting according to law but to return a verdict of guilty.
Section 4(1)(f), as well as those previously referred to in the
analysis of the Act, is indicative of the intent of Parliament to deal
adequately with the methods, which are used in the unlawful traffic of drugs to
defeat the purpose of the Act, ingenious as they may be. That the enforcement
of the provisions of the Act may, in exceptional cases, lead to some injustice,
is not an impossibility. But, to forestall this result as to such possible
cases, there are remedies under the law, such as a stay of proceedings by the
Attorney General or a free pardon under the royal prerogative.

I would dismiss the appeal against the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the conviction on the
primary charges and, in view of this result, the unanimous judgment of the
Court of Appeal, affirming the decision that appellant is an habitual criminal,
remains undisturbed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Criminal law—Criminal sexual psychopaths—Sufficiency of
evidence— Whether accused ""likely"" to act as set out in the Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 659(b)—Meaning of ""inflict""—Validity
of legislation.

The Crown appealed from the reversal of a finding by a trial
judge that the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath.

Held (Taschereau and Locke JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J.: It was proved that the
respondent had shown ""a lack of power to control his sexual
impulses"", and proof that he was likely to repeat his conduct would have
brought him within the definition in s. 659 (b) of the Criminal Code . It
was possible to ""inflict"" evil, in the sense of causing another
person to suffer or incur it, by mere persuasion and without any use of force
or coercion. But it was not shown that he was likely to repeat his conduct; the
proper conclusion on the evidence was that such a repetition was improbable,
and one essential element of the definition was therefore not satisfied.

Per Rand J.: Parliament intended by the definition in
s. 659 (b) to describe a condition of impulse that in certain
circumstances of normal control would become uncontrollable. The medical
evidence in this case was only to the effect that the respondent's impulses
were ""uncontrolled or uncontrollable"" and the medical witnesses
further said that normally a man in possession of his faculties (which the
respondent was) could control his criminal sexual impulses. It had not been
shown, as was essential, that the respondent's impulses were uncontrollable,
rather than merely uncontrolled.

Per Cartwright J.: The primary meanings of the word
""inflict"" involved an element of force, violence or coercion and the
word was not apt to describe conduct consisting solely of temptation and
persuasion. It was therefore not shown on the evidence that the respondent,
even assuming that he was likely to repeat his offences, was ""likely to …
inflict … evil"" on other persons. Further, the evidence did not indicate
that the respondent was likely to repeat acts of the kind in respect of which
he had been convicted.

Per Taschereau and Locke JJ., dissenting: The
long course of criminal conduct of the respondent inflicted ""injury … or
other evil"" upon his victims within the meaning of s. 659 (b) and
there was ample evidence on which the trial judge might properly find that it
was likely that he would in the future act in the same manner with other
children. The finding of the trial judge should therefore be restored.

[Page 686]

Per Kerwin C.J. and Rand, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: A
psychiatrist called as a witness on a hearing under s. 661(1) should not be
asked to give his opinion upon the very question that is to be determined by
the Court, viz., whether or not the accused is a criminal sexual
psychopath.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The
trial judge, on the hearing of an application under s. 661(1)  of the Criminal
Code , has not only the right but the duty to consider the evidence given on
the substantive charges against the accused, and that evidence should form part
of the record on an appeal from his decision.

Constitutional law—Criminal law and procedure—Validity
of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 659-667.

Sections 659  to 667  of the Criminal Code  are intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, being
legislation in relation to ""the Criminal Law, … including the procedure in
Criminal Matters"" within s. 91(27) of the British North America Act.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing a judgment of Boyd McBride J. finding the
respondent to be a criminal sexual psychopath.

H. J. Wilson, Q.C., and J. J. Frawley,
Q.C., for the appellant.

M. E. Shannon, for the
respondent.

D. H. W. Henry, Q.C., and M.
M. de Weerdt, for the Attorney General of Canada, intervenant.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Abbott J. was
delivered by

The Chief Justice:—By
leave of this Court the Attorney General of Alberta appeals from a decision of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside a finding
of Mr. Justice McBride under s. 661  of the Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, that the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath. The appeal
to the Appellate Division was under s. 667 of the Code and the leave to appeal
to this Court was granted under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 259, as amended by 1956, c. 48, s. 3, so that we are not restricted to
questions of law. Section 659(b) of the Code defines criminal sexual
psychopath as

a person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters,
has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who as a result is
likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.

[Page 687]

Mr. Justice McBride had presided
over the trial with a jury of the respondent on two counts of an indictment
charging :

1. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary,
on or about the 1st day of September, A.D. 1955, being a male person, did
commit an act of gross indecency with Hugh Ernest Helmer, another male person,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

2. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary,
on or about the 31st day of March, A.D. 1956, being a male person, did commit
an act of gross indecency with George Melville Gibson, another male person,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

The respondent was convicted on both counts and,
pursuant to s. 661(1) of the Code, the Court heard evidence as to whether the
respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath and made the finding in question.
No appeal was taken from the conviction on the two counts and on the appeal by
the respondent to the Appellate Division from the finding and sentence of
preventive detention no application was made by the Crown to have the record of
the trial proceedings before that Court, which thereupon proceeded to hear the
appeal on the record of the application made under s. 661(1) . Oral reasons were
delivered as follows:

The Court feels, with our brother Mr. Justice Johnson in
doubt, that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed, on the
grounds that the Crown has failed to bring the evidence of the psychiatrists
within the definition of criminal sexual psychopath.

The trial judge was, of course, not only entitled but
obliged to consider the evidence adduced at the trial on the two counts and
that should have been produced before the Appellate Division. It is in the
record before this Court and we have had the advantage of argument of counsel
with reference as well to it as to the proceedings under s. 661(1) .

The details appear elsewhere and need not be repeated. Upon
a consideration of them and of all the evidence I am satisfied that it was
proved that the respondent ""has shown a lack of power to control his
sexual impulses"". In my opinion the evidence of his actions with young
boys and his own testimony on the application under s. 661(1)  makes that clear.
As to the last part of the definition, ""and who as a result is likely to
attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person"",—if,
because of his lack of power to control his sexual impulses, he is likely to
repeat the actions referred to, then the mere fact that he would not use force
upon the other party is not sufficient to take

[Page 688]

it out of the phrase. Parliament has distinguished
""attack"", which indicates force, from inflicting injury, pain or
other evil. One may inflict, that is, cause another to suffer or incur,
something that is inherently evil by persuading him without the use of force to
commit the act, the effect of which may remain with him for many years. I am
unable to restrict the meaning of the words Parliament has chosen to carry out
its intention to those cases where coercion is used.

There remains the question whether the respondent is likely
to inflict that evil upon another in the future. The disease is a terrible
one and requires treatment, but the penalty imposed is severe. The sentence of
preventive detention is to be served in a penitentiary. By s. 664 it does not
commence until the two years shall have been served, although the Governor in
Council may commute the latter to a sentence of preventive detention. By s. 666
where a person is in custody under a sentence of preventive detention, the
Minister of Justice shall, at least once in every three years, review the
condition, history and circumstances of that person for the purpose of
determining whether he should be permitted to be at large on licence, and if
so, on what conditions.

I have the greatest sympathy with the object desired to be
attained by Parliament, but each case must be decided on its own circumstances.
After careful consideration of these, I have come to the conclusion, by virtue
of the powers conferred as a result of leave having been given to appeal to
this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, that the respondent is
not likely to repeat the acts with young boys of which he has been found
guilty, or similar acts, and, therefore, he is not likely to inflict
evil on any person in the future. Undoubtedly the trial judge had an advantage
in seeing and hearing the respondent who gave evidence upon the application to
declare him a criminal sexual psychopath, but on that application the two
doctors were asked by counsel for the Crown questions that should not have been
put and gave evidence that should not have been received. The nature of these
questions and answers appears elsewhere. Even though the application under s.
661(1)  was made to a judge alone, the fact that the doctors gave their opinion
upon the very question to be determined by the

[Page 689]

Court makes it impossible for me to
read the learned judge's reasons as showing that he came to his conclusion
without ' being swayed by these opinions.

For this reason I am, with respect, unable to agree with
him. Even if s. 592(1)(b)(iii) applies to appeals under s. 667  and if
""procedure on appeals"" in subs. (3) of s. 667  is applicable, not only
am I not satisfied that no substantial wrong or miscarriage has occurred, but I
have reached the conclusion that the Appellate Division was right in setting
aside his finding.

At the argument, and without calling upon counsel for the
Attorney General of Canada, we disposed of the respondent's contention that the
sections were ultra vires of Parliament on the short ground that they
were legislation in relation to criminal law, including procedure in criminal
matters, within head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Taschereau J.
(dissenting):—I agree with my brother Locke that this appeal should be
allowed, and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.

I do not find it necessary, however, for the determination
of this case, to give any opinion as to the legality of the evidence of Drs.
Michie and Carnat, who testified that the respondent was a criminal sexual
psychopath who had a lack of power to control his sexual impulses, and was
likely to inflict injury, pain, or other evil on any person.

The other evidence adduced, and particularly the continued
misconduct of the respondent, was, I think, sufficient to justify the trial
judge in reaching the conclusion at which he arrived.

The appeal should be allowed.

Rand J.:—This
appeal calls for the interpretation of the definition, in s. 659 (b) of
the Criminal Code , of a criminal sexual psychopath. The definition is in
these words:

""Criminal sexual psychopath"" means a person who,
by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to
control his sexual impulses and who as a result is likely to attack or
otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.

[Page 690]

The accused respondent was found by the trial judge to come
within that definition but that finding was reversed in the Appellate Division.
The facts have been set forth by my brother Cartwright and it will not be
necessary for me to deal with them. The provision is new, and involving, as it
may, the deprivation for years of a person's liberty, it calls for a careful
examination of its terms and the considerations which lie behind it.

The essence of the defence is that what the definition
describes is one who, in circumstances within the range of normal control over
sexual impulses or tendencies, has no control; that within that range his
desires are such as may seek satisfaction to the point of physical attack or
its equivalent on another person. Sexual desires and impulses express
themselves in a gamut of modes, and that fundamental characteristic of human
beings must be kept in mind as the background to gross manifestations. By a
loose sense of the word ""lack"", the definition is broad enough to
include all the degrees of demand for gratification within or beyond the point
of government; but the word may also signify the absence of control within that
range as the essential factor; and applying the long-established rule for
interpreting statutes creating criminal offences, the stricter and more limited
scope must be attributed to the definition. In each case the distinctive
features pertinent to that issue must be given the fullest enquiry and the
conclusion reached beyond a reasonable doubt.

The question of the elements of control and their presence
or absence becomes, then, of fundamental importance. In this, the will in
action which dominates such emotional . pressures, the act of volitional
rejection, is associated with ideas and feelings; they may be moral, ethical,
religious or of any other character, and the resulting action executes or
fulfils one or more of them. The criminal psychopath is afflicted with a
constitutional endowment which in the particular respect does not provide that
strength of restraint that keeps within the band of normal behaviour; and the
critical degree lies at the point when the forces acting present a danger
sufficiently great to be brought under social control. Here that point is
argued to be where uncontrollability is present as abnormality.

[Page 691]

Parliament has dealt with the dereliction of indecency in the
extreme manner in s. 149  of the Criminal Code , by which the offence as
of April 1, 1953, was extended to embrace any two persons. Under that provision
the accused was found guilty and sentenced to a term of two years in prison.

In the light of all this, I cannot but think that
Parliament, by the definition, intended to describe a condition of impulse that
in certain circumstances of normal control would become uncontrollable. The
language applies to persons of both sexes and all ages. In matters involving
boys in their 'teens, as here, there is in fact a consent on their part and
that becomes relevant to the determination of controllability. As was put to
counsel, if at any stage of the approach, upon a boy's turning away or
resenting suggestions made, the accused had at once desisted, how could it be
said that he was a victim of uncontrollable impulses? I do not think it can be.
Dr. Michie spoke of the homosexual ""drive"" of the accused as either
""uncontrolled or uncontrollable"" (and these would, in the particular
circumstances of the case, seem to distribute the alternatives) and that he
(the doctor) had always ""had the feeling that the person who is not
mentally disturbed can control his impulses. All do not agree with that.""
Dr. Carnat agreed that to a ""great extent"" a man who has possession
of his faculties can control his ""criminal sexual impulses"". He was
of the opinion that the accused was sane and had possession of his mental
faculties; and that the trial and exposure to which he had been subjected could
quite possibly act as a permanent deterrent of the practices indulged in.

The opinion of both psychiatrists that the accused was a
criminal sexual psychopath was on their own interpretation of the definition,
an interpretation which was not elaborated or even attempted to be stated to
them but which, on a reading aloud of the definition, was assumed by both, and
evidently by the trial judge and counsel prosecuting, to be of such plain and
understandable simplicity as not to require any examination or analysis. Dr.
Carnat agreed with every ""material part"" of the evidence of Dr.
Michie ""relevant to this case"", and I take this to include the
statement that the ""drive"" was either ""uncontrolled or

[Page 692]

uncontrollable"". The impulse was patently ""uncontrolled""
in the sense that it was given expression ; but the vital question was whether,
at the critical time, it was uncontrollable. On this we have no confirmatory
medical opinion which s. 661  requires.

I should repeat, by way of emphasis, that the section
applies to sexual manifestation in relation to both sexes and all ages. It is
not merely a protection to young persons. It may be that it would be socially
desirable to subject victims of this weakness to indefinite detention merely
for a tendency that involved young boys. That can easily be understood. But the
statute, in my opinion, does not go so far: such an extension of criminality
and magnitude of punishment have not been deliberated upon by Parliament ; and
the Courts are not the constitutional organs to enter upon questions of
legislative policy.

The constitutionality of the statute was raised but I cannot
think that its validity can be seriously challenged.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

Locke J. (dissenting)
:—We were informed upon the argument of this matter that the evidence taken
at the trial of the respondent upon the two offences of which he was found
guilty by the jury was not made part of the record considered by the Appellate
Division.

The oral reasons delivered in the Appellate Division for
setting aside the finding that Neil was a criminal sexual psychopath simply say
that:

The Crown has failed to bring the evidence of the
psychiatrists within the definition of criminal sexual psychopath.

With respect, the meaning of this appears to me to be
obscure.

Subsection (2) of s. 661  of the Criminal Code  requires
that on the hearing of an application under subs. (1) the Court ""may hear
any evidence that it considers necessary, but shall hear the evidence of at
least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by the Attorney
General"".

Dr. T. C Michie and Dr. Morris Carnat, whose qualifications
are unquestioned, gave evidence on the application, the former having been
nominated by the Attorney General. Dr. Michie had heard all of the evidence
given at the trial before the jury and on the application. Dr. Carnat had

[Page 693]

heard all of that evidence and, in addition, had examined
Neil for some one and one-half hours while he was in custody to assist him in
forming an opinion as to his mental state.

Paragraph (b) of s. 659  defines ""criminal sexual
psychopath"" as meaning

a person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters,
has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who as a result is
likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.

Offences of the nature described in s. 661(1) (a)(iv),(v)
and (vi) suggest mental infirmity and it was presumably for this reason that
subs. (2) requires that in deciding such applications the Court should hear the
opinions of at least two psychiatrists as to the sanity of the convicted person
and as to whether he is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or
other evil on any person.

The decision as to whether Neil had shown by the
long-continued course of misconduct in sexual matters, proven at the trial and
on the application, a lack of power to control his sexual impulses was, of
course, for the judge alone. Counsel appearing for the Crown, however (who did
not appear on the argument in this Court), asked both Drs. Michie and Carnat if
they considered Neil to be a criminal sexual psychopath and both answered in
the affirmative. No objection was made by counsel for the convicted man but the
question was clearly improper and should not have been permitted.

The oral reasons given by McBride J. for his finding show
clearly, in my opinion, that that learned judge determined the question on his
own view of the effect of the evidence and that the evidence of the doctors was
treated by him as opinion evidence only as to the man's sanity, his power to
control his sexual impulses and the likelihood of his attacking or otherwise
inflicting pain or other evil on any person.

Had the matter been one for determination by a jury it would
be my opinion that the improper admission of this evidence would have
necessitated a rehearing for the reasons stated by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J.
in Allen v. The King 1,
and by Lord Herschell L.C. in Makin et ux. v. The Attorney-General for New South Wales 2. In the

[Page 694]

present case, where the matter was one for the decision of a
single judge, and in the circumstances above stated, I would apply s. 592(1)(b)(iii),
since, in my opinion, no wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

I consider that the long course of criminal conduct of this
respondent inflicted ""injury … or other evil"" upon the children who
were his victims within the meaning of that language in s. 659 (b). There
was ample evidence upon which the learned trial judge might properly find that
it was likely that he would in the future act in like manner with other
children.

For the reasons so clearly stated by McBride J., I would
allow this appeal and set aside the order of the Appellate Division.

Cartwright J.:—On
May 24, 1956, the respondent was convicted after trial before Boyd McBride J.
and a jury on the two following counts:

1. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary,
on or about the 1st day of September, A.D. 1955, being a male person, did
commit an act of gross indecency with Hugh Ernest Helmer, another male person,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

2. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary,
on or about the 31st day of March, A.D. 1956, being a male person, did commit
an act of gross indecency with George Melville Gibson, another male person,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

Following these convictions, and before sentence was
passed, counsel for the Crown made application to the learned trial judge,
pursuant to s. 661(1)  of the Criminal Code , to hear evidence as to
whether the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath. Evidence was heard
accordingly and at the conclusion of the hearing the learned trial judge found
the respondent to be a criminal sexual psychopath, sentenced him to two years'
imprisonment on each of the counts set out above, the sentences to run
concurrently, and also imposed a sentence of preventive detention.

The respondent did not appeal from the convictions of the
two substantive offences but did appeal against the sentence of preventive
detention, pursuant to s. 667(1) of the Code.

On October 10, 1956, the Appellate Division, Johnson J. dubitante,
set aside the finding that the respondent was a criminal sexual psychopath
and the sentence of preventive detention.

[Page 695]

On November 26, 1956, the appellant was granted leave to appeal
to this Court from the judgment of the Appellate Division. Leave having been
granted pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
259, as amended by 1956, c. 48, s. 3, our jurisdiction is not restricted to
questions of law.

Prior to the appeal coming on for hearing, the respondent
gave notice to the Attorney General of Canada that he questioned the validity
of ss. 659  to 667  of the Criminal Code  and leave to intervene was
granted to the Attorney General. At the hearing the Court was unanimously of
opinion that these sections were intra vires of Parliament as being
legislation in relation to the criminal law, including the procedure in
criminal matters, within s. 91 , head 27, of the British North America Act, and
did not find it necessary to call upon counsel for the Attorney General of
Canada.

We were informed by counsel that the Appellate Division was
not furnished with the transcript of the evidence given at the trial of the two
substantive offences but this was included in the appeal case in this Court. In
my opinion the learned trial judge was entitled, and indeed required, to
consider that evidence in addition to the evidence given before him on the
application under s. 661(1) .

As the definition of ""criminal sexual psychopath""
in s. 659(b) of the Code necessitates a consideration of the
respondent's ""course of misconduct in sexual matters"", it is
desirable to set out in chronological order the facts regarding that misconduct
which are disclosed by the evidence.

There is no direct evidence as to the age of the respondent
but he was teaching in a high school in 1937. The respondent did not give
evidence on the trial of the substantive offences but did on the hearing under
s. 661(1) . He stated that he first remembered ""homosexual activities""
taking place in his own life when he was about 13 or 14. He was not asked to
say what these activities were. Two witnesses were called who had associated
with the respondent in the years 1938 and 1939. The first, Nares, gave evidence
of no importance. The second, Stapley, stated (i) that the respondent had
shared a bed with him and had handled his penis and that he had done the same
to the respondent; (ii) that the respondent had committed sodomy upon him

[Page 696]

on several occasions; and (iii) that he and the respondent
had engaged in acts of fellatio with each other on several occasions.
The respondent explicitly denied statements (ii) and (iii) and stated that the
thought of such actions was repugnant to him. He was not cross-examined and no
finding of fact was made by the learned trial judge in regard to these two
statements. In these circumstances counsel for the appellant stated in answer
to a question from the bench that he did not ask the Court to proceed on the
basis that either of these statements (ii) and (iii) was true, and in my
opinion he was right in taking this position.

Apart from the respondent's own testimony, to be mentioned
later, there is no evidence of other sexual misconduct until the years 1954,
1955 and 1956. During these years the respondent engaged in indecent acts with
Gibson and Helmer and with two other youths in regard to whom no charges were
laid. The course of conduct described was substantially the same in all cases
and culminated in what counsel for the appellant described as ""mutual
manual masturbation"". At the time of these occurrences the ages of the
youths concerned varied from 14 to 17 years.

The testimony of the respondent, mentioned above, from which
it might be inferred that there were other similar acts, is as follows:

Q. Now when do you first remember homosexual activities
taking place in your own life? I mean, how far back does it go? A. I would
think when I was about 14 or 13.

Q. Now, can you tell the Court how frequent those episodes
have occurred in your life? Has it been a continuous thing, or have they broken
off? A. They have broken off from time to time. The only times that there has
been any pattern, if you could call it such, has been when the pressure of
school work or some other such thing has forced me into the company of students
whose problems actually became part of my own pattern of life, you might say.
That is, in all cases I have tried to help whenever I could. In the case of the
two boys that are mentioned in the indictment here, it seemed to me that they
both had real problems, problems that were real to them, and I was trying to
help build those people up mentally, to give them more confidence in
themselves, and give them a better physique in order that they could appear to
better advantage among other fellows. In the case of months of close
association with them, then this very pattern grew out of it.

Q. You mean, those homosexual practices? A. Yes, but there
has never been any, as it were, impulse that has grown up suddenly or anything,
like that.

[Page 697]

Questioned as to the future the respondent gave the
following evidence:

Q. What do you have to say as to the likelihood of ever
indulging in these homosexual practices in the future? A. I began to say, Mr.
Shannon, that I can state unequivocally that it could never possibly happen
again. For the first time in my life I have seen how this looks to other
people. It is the first time in my life I have ever been confronted with public
opinion and I can only say this, that under no circumstances would it ever
happen again. In the first place, I voluntarily sent my school certificate to
Edmonton to have it cancelled by my request so that at no time in the future
could I be associated with schools or with young people. Furthermore, I have no
intention of at any time associating with them, and the only reason it has
happened in the past is where that association has been possible. As I see
these actions now through other people's eyes I can merely say it will never
happen again, it simply could not, my whole attitude, I think, has been
entirely changed.

Q. What do you feel has been effect of the trial and your
conviction on your attitude in this regard? A. It has been a tremendous shock,
it was from the very first time, as a matter of fact, that Detectives Gilkes
and Evans spoke to me in the morning of April 3rd, but the shock has been
accumulative ever since and culminated as it has today. It has been a
tremendous upheaval, but I will also say this, in those two months that have
elapsed in between I have given very serious thought to my mental condition and
all circumstances pertaining to this trial and to my past actions. And I say
that not merely under oath, but with the deepest sincerity with which I am
capable.

Q. Have you ever been in trouble with the law before? A. I
have not.

Q. You have no previous convictions of any kind? A. No.

Q. How important do you feel the steps are that you have
taken so that you will not be associated with young boys again, how important
do you feel that will be? A. It means a complete reorientation of my life. I
have always been associated with schools. From this time on I will not have any
association with schools, Scout Troops or anything else. I intend, as a matter
of policy, regardless of where I am, to keep entirely disassociated with
anything to do with young people in any form.

Q. You said previously, as I understood your evidence, it
was only through a period of time of associating with young people that those
practices had developed, is that right? A. That is correct, yes.

Up to this point I have been dealing with the factual
evidence. Its effect may be summarized as follows. From the age of 13 or 14 the
respondent has had a recurring abnormal desire to indulge in homosexual
practices. Those practices have been uniform; the other party concerned has
been a youth between 14 and 17 with whom the respondent had for some time
previously to their commencement been in close association as a teacher. In
each case a considerable period of time has been taken in inducing the youth to
participate in the practices. There is no suggestion of the

[Page 698]

respondent ever having employed anything in the nature of
force. The word ""seduction"", used by Dr. Michie, aptly describes his
method.

In allowing the appeal the Appellate Division gave brief
oral reasons as follows:

The Court feels, with our brother Mr. Justice Johnson in
doubt, that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed, on the
grounds that the Crown has failed to bring the evidence of the psychiatrists
within the definition of criminal sexual psychopath.

The two main grounds on which it was sought to support
this judgment are (i) that even if the evidence supports the view that on
regaining his liberty the respondent is likely to continue the same course of
criminal conduct this does not bring him within the words of the definition in
s. 659 (b) ""a person who … is likely to attack or otherwise inflict
injury, pain or other evil on any person"", and (ii) that the evidence does
not warrant a finding that the respondent has shown such a lack of power to
control his sexual impulses as makes it likely that he will in the future be
unable to control them and be guilty of the same sort of conduct as that of which
he has been convicted.

The validity of the first ground depends upon the proper
construction of the definition in s. 659 (b), and that of the second upon
the effect of the evidence.

After anxious consideration I have reached the conclusion that
Mr. Shannon is right in the first of the two submissions mentioned. S. 659 (b)
reads as follows:

""criminal sexual psychopath"" means a person who,
by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to
control his sexual impulses and who as a result is likely to attack or
otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.

Assuming for the purposes of this branch of the matter that
the course of misconduct in sexual matters pursued by the respondent has shown
a lack of power on his part to control his impulses to engage in homosexual
practices of the sort of which he has been convicted and that, therefore, when
set at liberty he is likely to engage in similar practices, the question is
whether this shows him to be ""likely to attack or otherwise inflict
injury, pain or other evil on any person"". On the evidence there is no
room for the suggestion that the respondent has ever attacked or is ever likely
to attack anyone, and in the course of his full and helpful argument Mr.
Frawley disclaimed any suggestion

[Page 699]

that the respondent had used, or was likely to use, anything
in the nature of force or compulsion to bring about the gratification of his
abnormal desires. The submission of counsel for the appellant was that, on the
assumption made at the opening of this paragraph, the respondent ""is
likely to … inflict … evil"" on other youths. To persuade a youth to
participate in acts of gross indecency is in itself a crime and there is no
need to expatiate on the heinousness of such conduct; but the person who so
persuades a youth is causing him to do evil rather than inflicting evil upon
him. The primary meanings of the word ""inflict"", given in the Shorter
Oxford Dictionary, are ""to lay on as a stroke, blow or wound; to impose;
to cause to be borne"". In my opinion, neither of the verbs ""to
attack"" or ""to inflict"" is apt to describe conduct, however evil
in its ultimate purpose, which contains no element of force, violence or
coercion but consists solely of temptation and persuasion.

I have reached this conclusion on the construction of the
words of the definition, but it appears to me to be strengthened by a
consideration of the evil which the enactment of the sections dealing with
criminal sexual psychopaths was intended to remedy. The purpose of the
enactment appears, from the related sections read as a whole, to be to protect
persons from becoming the victims of those whose lack of power to control their
sexual impulses renders them a source of danger; and the danger envisaged is, I
think, that of coercive conduct resulting in the active infliction of pain,
injury or other evil on the victim, not merely the persuading or seducing of
another to participate in sexual misconduct. This view is also, in my opinion,
supported by a consideration of the drastic nature of the preventive measure
provided, that is, incarceration which may continue for life.

Having reached the above conclusion as to the meaning of the
definition, it follows that I would dismiss the appeal, but I propose to deal
also with the second main ground mentioned above on which it was sought to
support the judgment of the Appellate Division.

The reasons of the Appellate Division are susceptible of the
interpretation that, in their view, the evidence does not support a finding
that the respondent has shown such a lack of power to control his sexual
impulses as to render it

[Page 700]

likely that he will in the future commit further criminal
acts of the sort of which he has been convicted. I do not find it necessary to
decide whether the words in the definition ""a lack of power to
control"" mean, as was submitted for the respondent, a total absence of
power to control or, as was argued for the appellant, such a deficiency in
power to control as renders it likely that control will not in fact be
exercised, because, in my opinion, even if the latter meaning be adopted it
cannot be said that the Appellate Division erred in their view that it was not
established that the appellant was likely to repeat acts of the sort mentioned.


I have already quoted the evidence of the respondent to the
effect that he is confident that there will be no repetition of his misconduct.
Against this is to be set the evidence of the two psychiatrists. I have no
criticism of these witnesses. They possess high professional qualifications and
their answers were responsive to the questions put to them; but, in my
respectful opinion, their examination was conducted in an improper manner.
Under s. 661(3) it is the duty of the Court to find whether an accused is a
criminal sexual psychopath. Section 661(2) provides that the Court may hear any
evidence that it considers necessary but shall hear the evidence of at least
two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General. This
provision does not effect any alteration in the rules as to the nature of the
evidence which may be given by an expert witness, or as to the manner in which
his examination should be conducted.

It will be sufficient to state briefly the course of the examination
of Dr. Michie by counsel for the Crown. Having proved his professional
qualifications, counsel asked him if he had listened to all the evidence both
on the trial of the substantive offences and on the hearing under s. 661(1) .
The witness having answered in the affirmative, he was next asked whether he
had listened for the purpose of determining to himself whether the accused was
a criminal sexual psychopath. His answer was ""Yes"". He was then asked
if he had ""arrived at a decision"". His answer was ""Yes"";
and he was then asked to make his decision known to the Court. His examination-in-chief
concluded as follows:

Q. Just one step further in clarification of your final
finding that he is a criminal sexual psychopath. The definition in the Code of
criminal

[Page 701]

sexual psychopath includes all of the following, and with
leave of the court I would read it to- you, Doctor. I am reading 659,
subsection (b) of the Code in the following words:

"" 'Criminal sexual
psychopath' means a person who, by a course of misconduct in sexual matters,
has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who, as a result,
is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any
person.""

Do you find, Doctor, that each one of the isolated requirements
set forth in section 659 , subsection (b) are found affirmatively
against the accused? A. It is my opinion that that is so.

The objections to such a method of examination are obvious.
The witness is being asked to weigh conflicting evidence; the Court does not
know, for example, whether he accepted as true the evidence of Stapley, as to
acts of fellatio and sodomy, which was denied by the respondent and
which counsel for the appellant did not ask this Court to accept. The witness
may have disbelieved the testimony of the respondent in toto. The
witness could not be expected to know the rules as to weighing the evidence of
an accomplice or to appreciate the significance of the respondent not having
been cross-examined. The Court is unaware of the foundation of assumed facts on
which the opinion of the witness was based. The witness is also, in effect,
being called upon to interpret the definition contained in s. 659 (b),
a task the difficulty of which is emphasized by the different submissions
as to its meaning made by counsel in the course of the argument before us.

In the cross-examination of Dr. Michie the following
appears:

Q. I notice in your evidence, Dr. Michie, that you said, I
think you used the term ""sex impulses"", I think that was the term you
used, ""are either uncontrollable or uncontrolled""? A. That is what I
said, uncontrollable or uncontrolled.

Q. Uncontrollable or uncontrolled. May I draw the inference
from that that Neil could control his sexual impulses? A. I have always had the
feeling that the prisoner, that the person who is not mentally disturbed can
control his impulses. All do not agree with that,

Q. That is your opinion? A. Yes.

And in the cross-examination of Dr. Carnat:

Q. Do you agree with Dr. Michie that a man, and here I do
not misrepresent what Dr. Michie said, that a man who has possession of his
mental faculties can control criminal sexual impulses. A. A man in possession
of his mental faculties can control them?

Q. Yes? A. To a great extent, he probably can.

[Page 702]

Q. Do you have any reason to believe that the accused,
Sidney Keith Neil, does not have possession of his mental faculties? A. He is
mentally sane.

Q. Does he have possession of his mental faculties? A. Yes.

Q. In your opinion, could a public trial and conviction and
all of the publicity and humiliation that goes with it, bearing in mind the
circumstances of this case, could that have a therapeutic effect on this
accused? A. It is quite possible it could. It could definitely act as a
deterrent.

Q. It could make sufficient impression on him that he would
no longer indulge in those practices? A. It is possible.

The question as to whether an accused who has shown a lack
of power to control his sexual impulses is as a result likely to continue to
fail to control them is one of fact in deciding which the trial judge
undoubtedly has certain advantages over an appellate tribunal, but these
advantages are not decisive in the case at bar where the finding depends on
inferences to be drawn from past facts as to future probabilities. After a
careful reading of all the record I have, as indicated above, reached the
conclusion that it cannot be said that the Appellate Division was wrong in
deciding that the evidence does not warrant a finding that the respondent is
likely in the future to repeat the criminal conduct of which he has been found
guilty.

I rest my decision, therefore, on both of the two main
grounds set out above urged on behalf of the respondent.

I would dismiss the appeal.

the Criminal Code , (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36 as enacted by S. of C. 1947-48,
c. 39, s. 34), to appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment
of a Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario hearing an appeal by way of a
stated case in proceedings under the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O.
1950, c. 379, on grounds involving a question of law alone.

[Page 513]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1], quashing an appeal
by an informant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario in a stated
case.

W.C.Bowman, Q.C. for the appellant.

J. Sedgwick, Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Fauteux
and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX J.:—The respondent company was, in
February 1954, convicted by a magistrate of an offence under the Public
Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 304; and this conviction, having
been questioned on a stated case, was quashed by Stewart J. in chambers.
Thereupon, the informant obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal for
Ontario which followed its recent decisions in Regina ex rel. Morrison v.
Canadian Acme Screw and Gear Limited[2],
and Regina ex rel. Irwin v. Duesling[3], and dismissed the appeal1 Hence
the appeal to this Court, leave being granted under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act, on the following question of law:—

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that it had
no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by an informant from the judgment of a
Justice of the Supreme Court hearing an appeal by way of stated case in a
summary conviction matter?

The prosecution was taken under the provisions
of the Ontario Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379, s. 3(1) of
which enacts:—

Except where inconsistent with this Act,
Part XV and sections 1028 , 1029 , 1035A, 1054 , 1055 , 1121 , 1124 , 1125 , 1131  and
1142  of the Criminal Code  (Canada) as amended or re-enacted from time to
time, shall apply mutatis mutandis to every case to which this Act
applies as if the provisions thereof were enacted in and formed part of this
Act.

Under Part XV of the Criminal Code , a
decision rendered in first instance may be questioned by means of a trial de
novo (s. 749  to s. 761 ), as was the situation in the cases above referred
to, or by means of a stated case (s. 761  to s. 769A), as in the present
instance; and the decision

[Page 514]

rendered, upon either one of such modes of
appeal may itself be brought for revision under section 769A(1)
providing:—

(1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal, as
defined in s. 1012 against any decision of the Court under the provisions of s.
752 or s. 765 with leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge thereof, may be
taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone. (1948, ch. 39, s.
34).

(2) The provisions of sections 1012 to
1021, inclusive, shall mutatis mutandis insofar as the same are
applicable, apply to an appeal under this section. (1948, ch. 39, s. 34).

(3) The decision of the Court of Appeal
shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as if it had
been made by a Justice at the hearing. (1948, ch. 39, s. 34)

No one disputes that a right of appeal,
particularly against an acquittal, must be given in clear, express and
unambiguous language. The only issue, in the premises, is whether, contrary to
what was decided in the Court below, the provisions of s. 769A  meet with this
requirement.

Sub-section (1). As is the case under s. 41(1)
of the Supreme Court Act, and as was also the case in the much more
general terms of the enactment considered, in the House of Lords, in Cox v.
Hakes[4], the
formula, here adopted by Parliament to give a right to appeal against any of
the decisions of the nature therein specified, says nothing in terms as to whom
this new right is given. Such general language is not apt, per se, to
justify the inference of any limitation such as the one contended for by
respondent. On the contrary and evidently because no limitation was intended,
nothing was said. Nothing more needed to be said to vest the “prosecutor or
complainant as well as the defendant” with this new right of appeal when, under
the then state of the law, they were equally entitled by s. 749 or s. 761 to
seek, in an appeal against the judgment of a magistrate, a decision under s.
752 or s. 765, henceforth made appealable under sub-section (1) of section
769A . The appeal is clearly against the decision, whatever it may be and
whoever in the case may have cause to complain.

Sub-section (2). To give effect to, but not to
affect, this new right of appeal, comprehensively stated in1,
Parliament adopted by reference the procedure already established under
sections 1012 to 1021 inclusive, “mutatis mutandis insofar as
applicable”. The latter expressions are not in any way related to the right of
appeal fully

[Page 515]

stated in[5],
but only to the method by which such right may be perfected. They imply an
obligation to make, to such of the provisions of sections 1012 to 1021
inclusive as may be apt to effectuate the true purpose of the section, such
changes—material as they may be—not inconsistent with the provisions of the
section. It appears that in considering this particular sub-section, the Court
below formed the view that section 769A , read together with s. 1013(4),
does not provide for an appeal by the informant against an acquittal. Section
1013(4) gives to the Attorney-General—and not to “the prosecutor or
complainant”, whose status as party to the case has long been lost at that
stage of the procedure by indictment—a right to appeal against any judgment or
verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence. With deference, I
cannot agree with these views. In reaching them, no sufficient account appears
to have been taken of the fact that the right of appeal under s. 769A  is fully
stated under sub‑section (1) and unqualified by sub-section (2); and, in
the result, proper and full effect was not given to the expressions “mutatis
mutandis and insofar as applicable”. Properly and fully implemented, these
expressions are as apt to justify, in s. 1013(4), a substitution of the words
“the prosecutor or complainant” to the words “the Attorney-General” as they are
recognized to be, for the substitution of the word “offence” simpliciter to the
words “indictable offence” appearing in the same provision. As stated, in part,
by Roach J.A. when granting leave to appeal in Regina ex rel. Morrison v.
Canadian Acme Screw and Gear Limited5:

…where the parties to the appeal… are the
complainant and the accused, the complainant, as well as the accused, has a
further right of appeal, by leave, to the Court of Appeal, and subs. 2 of s.
769A  has not the effect of preserving that right of the accused and destroying
the otherwise equal right of the complainant.

Sub-section (3). The sub-section states the
effect of the decision rendered in an appeal under s. 769A  and provides for the
method of its enforcement. Its language has no bearing upon the construction of
sub-section (1) wherein the right of appeal is comprehensively established. For
this reason, the decision in Cox v. Hakes (supra), while of
assistance insofar as general principles are concerned, has no application
here.

[Page 516]

The only question of law upon which leave was
granted to this Court must be affirmatively answered. The appeal should be
allowed and the case returned for consideration to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

The judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was
delivered by:-

KELLOCK J.:—The respondent was convicted of
operating a public commercial vehicle without a licence contrary to the Public
Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 304, s. 2(1). This conviction was
made in summary proceedings under the provisions of the Summary Convictions
Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379. Section 3, s-s. (1) of this statute provides
that, except where inconsistent with the statute, Part XV and certain named
sections of the Criminal Code  shall apply mutatis mutandis. S-s.
(2) provides that where a case is stated under Part XV of the Criminal Code ,
it shall be heard and determined by a judge of the Supreme Court in
chambers.

Stewart J., who heard the appeal by way of
stated case, allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction. The appellant,
having obtained leave, launched an appeal to the Court of Appeal[6] under s. 769A  of the Criminal Code  enacted
by 1948, c. 39, s. 34 , Canada.
That court, however, quashed the appeal upon the ground that the section did
not give any right of appeal to a private prosecutor such as the appellant.

In this decision the court followed its earlier
decisions in Regina
ex rel. Morrison v. Canadian Acme Screw and
Gear, Limited[7] and Regina ex rel. Irwin v. Duesling[8], the
latter having been based upon the former. The present appeal is in reality,
therefore, an appeal from the decision in Morrison’s case. Before
considering that decision, it will be convenient to consider the relevant
provisions of Part XV of the Criminal Code  before the new Code of
1955.

Upon its conviction two remedies by way of
appeal were open to the respondent, one under s. 749 to the County Court
Judge, and the other, which was in fact followed, by

[Page 517]

way of stated case to a judge of the Supreme
Court under s. 761. The right of appeal given by s. 749 is expressly conferred
upon

any person who thinks himself aggrieved by
any such conviction or order or dismissal, the prosecutor or complainant, as
well as the defendant.

Again, in the case of s. 761, “any person
aggrieved, the prosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant” may appeal.

In the case of an appeal under s. 749, it is
provided by s. 754 that the judge “may confirm, reverse or modify the decision
of such justice, or may make such other conviction or order in the matter as
the court thinks just.” In the case of an appeal by way of stated case under
s. 761, it is provided by s. 765 that the court appealed to “shall hear and
determine the question or questions of law arising thereon, and shall thereupon
affirm, reverse or modify the conviction, order or determination in respect of
which the case has been stated.” The section also provided that any order so
made “shall be final and conclusive upon all parties.”

By sections 31 and 32 of the amending statute of
1948, s-s. (1) of s. 752 and s-s. (1) of s. 765 were amended to bring them into
accord with the new s. 769A , which was enacted by s. 34, s-s. (1) reading as
follows:

769A. (1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal,
as defined in section one thousand and twelve, against any decision of
the court under the provisions of section seven hundred and fifty-two or
section seven hundred and sixty-five with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge
thereof may be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone.

As the right of appeal thus given is against any
decision made under s. 752 or s. 765, such right is plainly conferred upon
the person who was unsuccessful below, whether he was a person convicted or the
complainant.

In Morrison’s case, Schroeder J.A., who
delivered the judgment on behalf of the court, would appear to have based his
decision upon what he considered to be the effect of s-s. (2) of s. 769A ,
which reads as follows:

(2) The provisions of sections one thousand
and twelve to one thousand and twenty‑one, inclusive, shall mutatis
mutandis in so far as the same are applicable, apply to an appeal under
this section.

After pointing out that, historically, appeals
in criminal cases had long been confined to convicted persons and to the well
settled principle of statutory construction that in

[Page 518]

order to establish any other right of appeal it
is necessary to find clear and unambiguous language to that effect, the learned
judge considered that, as s. 1013 (1) is expressly limited to an appeal by a
convicted person and that the only right of appeal against an acquittal given
by s-s. (4) is limited to a provincial Attorney-General, the learned judge
concluded that he must construe s. 769A  as providing no appeal in favour of a
private prosecutor.

The view of the learned judge sufficiently
appears from the following extract from his judgment, where, at p. 521, he
deals with the contrary view:

To give effect to this contention would be
to ignore the fact that s. 1013 is incorporated by reference into s. 769A , and
although other sections so incorporated are procedural, s. 1013 is clearly
substantive in character. It provides who shall have a right of appeal in the
case of an indictable offence, and by incorporating it into s. 769A  it provides
who shall have the right of appeal by leave conferred by s. 769A . The last
mentioned section does not.

While no doubt the provisions of s. 1013 are mutatis
mutandis incorporated into s. 769A , such incorporation is to be, however,
only “in so far as the same are applicable” and it cannot be said that any
provisions of ss. 1012 to 1021 can be considered “applicable” if to apply them
would contradict the right of appeal expressly given by s-s. (1).

In my opinion, therefore, the Court of Appeal is
clothed with jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the character of that here
in question. This accords with the view expressed by Roach J. on the
application for leave to appeal in Morrison’s case[9].

I would allow the appeal and remit the matter to
the Court of Appeal for a decision upon the merits.

LOCKE J.:—The respondent was convicted by a
magistrate at Chatham, Ont. of a charge of operating a public commercial
vehicle without a licence, contrary to the provisions of the Public
Commercial Vehicles Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 304, s. 2(1)).

The Summary Convictions Act (R.S.O. 1950,
c. 379) provides by s. 3 that, except where inconsistent with that Act, Part XV
of the Criminal Code , as amended or reenacted

[Page 519]

from time to time, shall apply mutatis
mutandis to every case to which the Act applies as if the provisions
thereof were enacted in and formed part of it.

Upon the application of the respondent, the
magistrate, after reciting the terms of the conviction, stated the following
question for the opinion of a judge of the Supreme Court:—

On the facts as stated, was I right in
holding that the defendant was not, as a matter of law, exempted from the
provisions of The Public Commercial Vehicles Act by reason of the fact
that it, being a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Breweries Ltd., carried
goods only for other wholly owned subsidiaries of Canadian Breweries Ltd.?

The stated case was heard by Stewart J. who
answered the question propounded in the negative and quashed the conviction,
acquitted the respondent of the charge and directed that the fine imposed be
remitted.

From this decision the present appellant
appealed to the Court of Appeal, relying upon the provisions of s. 769A  of the Criminal
Code . I refer throughout to the sections of the Code in force prior to
April 1, 1955. That appeal was quashed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal
delivered by the Chief Justice of Ontario on the ground that the court was
without jurisdiction to entertain it.

By special leave of this court, the present
appeal was brought to determine the following question:—

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in
law in holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by an
informant from the judgment of a Justice of the Supreme Court hearing an appeal
by way of stated case in a summary conviction matter?

In Reg. ex rel Morrison v. Canadian
Acme Screw and Gear Ltd.[10], the
Court of Appeal of Ontario quashed an appeal taken to that court from the
judgment of a county court judge on an appeal from a magistrate under Part XV
of the Code which resulted in the acquittal of the accused. That
decision was followed by the same court in Reg. ex rel Irwin v. Duesling[11]. While the appeal in the present matter
was taken from a judgment of a judge of the Supreme Court upon a stated case,
the learned Chief Justice of Ontario was of the opinion that there was no
distinction in the principles to be applied.

[Page 520]

The Criminal Code  provides alternative
means whereby a conviction such as this under the Summary Convictions Act may
be questioned. S. 749 provides in the Province of Ontario for an appeal to the
County Court from a conviction or an order dismissing an information or
complaint by:—

any person who thinks himself aggrieved by
any such conviction or order or dismissal, the prosecutor or complainant as
well as the defendant.

S. 761 under which the case was stated in the
present matter provides that:—

any person aggrieved, the prosecutor or
complainant as well as the defendant who desires to question a conviction,
order, determination or other proceeding of a justice under this Part on the
ground that it is erroneous in point of law

may apply to such justice to state a case,
setting forth the facts and the grounds on which the proceeding is questioned.

S. 769A , so far as it need be considered,
reads:—

(1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal, as
defined in section one thousand and twelve, against any decision of the court
under the provisions of section seven hundred and fifty-two or section seven
hundred and sixty-five with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof may
be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone.

(2) The provisions of sections one thousand
and twelve to one thousand and twenty‑one, inclusive, shall mutatis
mutandis in so far as the same are applicable, apply to an appeal under
this section.

This section, enacted in 1948 (c. 39, s. 34),
replaced s. 752A, enacted in 1947, which permitted a further appeal in appeals
arising under ss. 749 et seq. but did not deal with decisions upon stated
cases.

Unlike s. 749, which permits in terms an appeal
either from a conviction or an order dismissing an information, and s. 761,
which permits either the prosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant who
desire to question a conviction, order, determination or other proceeding under
Part XV, to apply to the Justice to state a case, s. 769A  merely says that an
appeal to the Court of Appeal against any decision of the court may be
taken.

It is an elementary principle of the law that an
acquittal by a court of competent jurisdiction, acting within its jurisdiction,
cannot as a rule be questioned and brought before any other court. In Benson
v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board[12], Lord Simon said that very

[Page 521]

clear statutory language by way of exception to
the general rule would be required to establish a right of appeal from a
decision dismissing a criminal charge. The question to be determined is whether
s. 769A  fulfils these requirements.

When the Criminal Code  was first enacted
in 1892, it provided certain exceptions to the general rule above referred to.
Ss. 879 and 900 of the Code, as then enacted, permitted the propriety of
an acquittal to be questioned, either by an appeal or by a stated case. With
amendments which do not affect the present consideration, these sections were
enacted as ss. 749  and 761  in the revisions of the statutes of 1906 and 1927.
No further appeal lay until the amendments of 1947 and 1948 above referred to.

It is not my opinion that the decisions in Benson’s
Case or in Cox v. Hakes[13],
referred to by Lord Simon, are decisive of the question. If the point was, as
in Benson’s Case, whether an appeal lay under a section worded as is the
first subsection of s. 759A from a court of first instance such as a
magistrate’s court, I think that, on the authority of that case, there could be
no appeal from an acquittal. The situation here, however, seems to me to be
essentially different. Parliament has, in clear and unmistakable terms,
provided for an appeal from an acquittal by s. 749 and for what is in essence
an appeal by the provisions of s. 761. The common law rule is abrogated by
these sections. The decision of the court whether proceedings are taken under
s. 749 or s. 761 may be, inter alia, either to affirm a conviction or to
acquit the accused. The appeal provided by s-s. 1 of s. 769A  is against any
decision of the court: that this includes a decision acquitting the accused
appears to me to be perfectly clear. This is, in my view, statutory language
which complies with the requirements stated by Lord Simon. It is not the
language of s-s. 1 which establishes the exception to the general rule that a
man shall not be vexed twice for the same wrong: the exceptions to that rule
were already provided for in ss. 749 and 761.

As to s-s. 2 of s. 769A , counsel for the Crown
contends that this neither adds to or limits the meaning to be assigned to s-s.
1. In Reg. ex rel. Irwin v. Duesling[14], Pickup C.J.O., referring to this
subsection, said that he did

[Page 522]

not consider that s-s. 4 of s. 1013 could be
said to be applicable to a summary conviction proceeding at the instance of a
private prosecutor. With this I respectfully agree. None of the other sections
of the Code referred to in s-s. 2 can affect the matter to be decided
here.

I would allow this appeal.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Rape—Aiding and
abetting—Crown's case, that accused assisted another—Indictment charging him
with carnal knowledge—Whether indictment valid—Criminal Code , ss. 69 , 852 .

The respondent was convicted of rape on a charge that ""he
did have carnal knowledge of V.B., a woman who was not his wife, without her
consent"", . The Crown's case was that while he did not in fact have sexual
intercourse with the woman he had aided others to do so. The Crown sought a
conviction under s. 69(1) of the Code as an ""aider and
abettor"". By a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction and ordered an acquittal on the ground that the indictment failed to
allege the facts in support of the Crown's case.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): That the appeal should
be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: Since an
aider and abettor may be indicted as principal simpliciter, it follows that an
indictment so charging an aider, being valid in law, must therefore be
construed not as exclusively charging the accused as having in fact actually
committed the offence, but as having in the eyes of the law committed it. It
also follows, since the reason for such construction being that all
participants are by law principals, that the same construction obtains whether
the indictment charges them jointly or each of them alone of the offence in the
ordinary form, as if they had actually committed it, or whether the offence is
stated ""in popular language"" or ""in words of the enactment
describing the offence"" as authorized by s-s. 2 and 3 of s. 852  of the Criminal
Code .

While it was open to the respondent, before or during the
trial, to move for the different reliefs he might then have considered
desirable for his defence, he, admittedly being at all times fully informed of
the case against him, elected not to do so; he cannot now complain in appeal of
matters which, subject to their merits, could have been corrected at trial.

Per Rand J.: The charge as laid included the offence in
law attributable to the respondent through his act of aiding and abetting. The
evidence of assistance only was, after verdict, sufficient to convict (Rex
v. Folkes and Ludds 168 E.R. 1301 followed).

Per Kellock J.: The indictment complied with s. 852(3)
of the Code and was a valid and appropriate indictment.

Per Locke J.: When a person has abetted another to
commit the offence of rape, it is a literal compliance with the requirements of
s. 852(3) of the Code to charge him of the offence as a principal.

[Page 490]

Per Cartwright J. (dissenting): The wording of the
charge not only failed to inform the respondent of the case against him but was
actually misleading. The charge should have contained at least a statement that
someone had raped the complainant and that the respondent had done an act for
the purpose of aiding him to do so. The rape with which he was charged was not
one committed by someone else but by himself personally and there was no evidence
of any such rape. Where the criminality of an act depends on the existence or
non-existence of a particular relationship between the individual personally
committing the act and another person, it is essential that the charge should
specify whether the accused did the alleged act personally or merely aided
another to commit it.

Furthermore, since there was evidence by the complainant of
two separate rapes, the charge was bad either for uncertainty or for charging
two separate crimes in one count.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside, Robertson and Bird JJ.A. dissenting,
the respondent's conviction on a charge of rape.

Lee A. Kelley, Q.C. and
J.J. Urie for the appellant.

T. P. O'Grady for the
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J.,
Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX J.:—The material facts
giving rise to this case are related by the complainant; they may be summarized
as follows: At 9 o'clock p.m., on the 23rd day of May, 1954, the respondent,
Kie Singh, Pew Singh and Jumbo Singh invited the complainant to board the
automobile in which they were and eventually abducted her to a secluded place
where each of the three Singhs raped her; respondent himself had no carnal
knowledge of the girl but, by use of force, assisted in subduing her;
immediately after the occurrence, the latter was driven back to a short
distance from her home and upon entering her residence, complained to her
mother of the assault and the police were notified.

The accused was arrested and upon
evidence of these facts related by the complainant at the preliminary inquiry,
was committed for trial and tried upon an indictment charging him in the very
words of the enactment describing the offence of rape (s. 298), to wit:—

That at or near Newton, in
the Municipality of Surrey, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the 23rd
day of May in the year of Our Lord 1954, he, the said Kenneth Harder, a man,
did have carnal knowledge of

[Page 491]

(Christian name and surname
mentioned in the indictment are here omitted), a woman, who was not his wife,
without her consent, against the form of the statute in such case made and
provided and against the peace of Our Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity.

The issue at trial was whether,
during the whole of the transaction, rape had been committed by a person or
persons other than the accused and whether the accused aided in its commission.
The latter, assisted by counsel, did not testify and was found guilty by the
jury.

This conviction was appealed and
quashed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.

The point upon which the appeal
turned is centred upon the indictment and, as indicated by Davey, J.A., had
never been raised at trial. The majority (O'Halloran, Smith and Davey, JJ.A.),
relying primarily on the decision of this Court in Brodie v. The King
[2],
expressed the view that the indictment, containing no averment that Harder had
assisted Jumbo Singh or any one else to have carnal knowledge of the girl, must
on a proper construction, be held to charge respondent as having himself
physically raped the complainant; and there being admittedly no evidence to
support the indictment as thus construed, the Court maintained the appeal and
directed an acquittal to be entered. Robertson and Bird JJ.A. dissenting, held:—

That the indictment charging
the accused as principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver
that the accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally.

With deference, I cannot agree
with the views held by the majority. Admitting that the construction they
placed upon the indictment is justified, on the restrictive basis upon which it
was made i.e. the literal wording of the document, it cannot be supported, on
the entirely different legal basis upon which indictments can be framed and
must therefore be construed, according to law. And while it was open to the
accused, before or at any stage during the trial, to move for the different
reliefs he might then have considered desirable for his defence, he, admittedly
being from the moment of his committal for trial to the end of the trial fully
informed of the case against him, elected not to do so; he cannot now complain
in appeal of matters which, subject to their merits, could have been corrected
at trial, had he then chosen to so move.

[Page 492]

The indictment. An indictment
cannot properly be construed without regard to the substantive and procedural
provisions of the criminal law related to its substance and its form. As stated
by Willes J., with the concurrence of all the Judges who advised the House of
Lords, and with the approval of the latter, in the case of Mulcahey v. The
Queen [3]:

…an indictment only states the
legal character of the offence and does not profess to furnish the details
and particulars. These are supplied by the depositions, and the practice of
informing the prisoner or his counsel of any additional evidence not in the
depositions, which it may be intended to produce at the trial. To make the
indictment more particular would only encourage formal objections upon the
ground of variance, which have of late been justly discouraged by the
Legislature.

This statement was acted upon by
Sir William Ritchie C.J. and Strong J. in Downie v. The Queen [4].


At common law, the actor or
actual perpetrator of the fact and those who are, actually or constructively,
present at the commission of the offence and aid and abet its commission, are
distinguished as being respectively principal in the first degree and
principals in the second degree; yet, in all felonies in which the punishment
of the principal in the first degree and of the principals in the second degree
is the same, the indictment may charge all who are present and abet the fact as
principals in the first degree. (Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and
Practice, 33rd ed., p. 1499). In Hawkins's Pleas of the Crown, Vol. II, p. 316,
s. 64, it is stated:—

That where several are
present and one only actually does it, an indictment may in the same manner as
in appeal, either lay it generally as done by them all or specially as done
only by the one and abetted by the rest.

The reason for the rule is
evident. It is stated as follows in East's Pleas of the Crown, Vol. I, at page
350:—

For in these cases all the
parties are principals, and the blow of one is, in law, the blow of all. For
which reason an indictment that A. gave the mortal blow and B., C. and D. were
present and abetting, is sustained by evidence, that B. gave the blow and A.,
C. and D. were present and abetting, Upon the like indictment, evidence that
E., though not named therein, gave the blow, and that A., B., C. and D. were
present and abetting, would be sufficient; or even that a person unknown gave
the blow.

[Page 493]

In The Queen v. James
[5],
the indictment charged the accused with the larceny of a letter; the question
raised in that case was whether he was a joint thief with the postman whom he
had induced to intercept and hand him over the letter, or whether he was an
accessory before the fact to the larceny committed by the servant of the Post
Office. Lord Coleridge, C.J., with the concurrence of Pollock, B., Hawkins,
Grantham and Charles, JJ., stated at page 440:—

I can entertain no doubt in
this case. Either the prisoner was a joint thief with the postman from whom he
obtained the letter, or he was an accessory before the fact, in which case, by
24 & 25 Vict. c. 94, s. 1, he was liable to be convicted in all respects as
if he were a principal felon. In either case, therefore, he was rightly
convicted.

Section 1 of c. 94, therein
referred to, reads:—

1. Whosoever shall become an
Accessory before the Fact to any Felony, whether the same be a Felony at Common
Law or by virtue of any Act passed or to be passed, may be indicted, tried,
convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a principal Felon.

This Imperial statute, later
adopted into Canadian law (R.S.C. 1886, c. 145) practically brought to an end
the distinctions between accessories before the fact and principals in the
second degree.

By the enactment of section 61,
the predecessor to section 69 , these distinctions in the substantive law
entirely disappeared from our criminal laws when codified in 1892. With them,
of course, also disappeared, because being made no longer necessary, the
relevant adjective rules related to the framing of the indictment of such
persons who, not actually committing the offence charged, were then made, by
statute, principals and equally party to, guilty of and punishable for the
offence as if actually committed by them. It is unthinkable that, getting rid
of the difficulties arising out of these prior distinctions, Parliament would,
in the same breath, have created new ones by refusing to the Crown the right to
indict—which right it had before, under common and statutory law—as principal
simpliciter, either a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the
fact, and this, under the regime of this new law holding each and all particeps
criminis as being nothing less than principals.

[Page 494]

Sir Elzéar Taschereau, in his Criminal
Code , deals with the matter and, indicating how an abettor may be indicted,
says at page 29:—

For instance: A. abetted in
the commission of a theft by B. The indictment may charge A. and B. jointly or
A. and B. alone as guilty of the offence in the ordinary form, as if they had
actually stolen by one and the same act.

In Rémillard v. The
King [6], is
evidenced the practice more generally followed since this change of the law.
The facts in that case were that, on the counsel of his father, a son killed
another person. Father and son were separately indicted; the indictment against
the father, as appears in the file of this case in this Court, was for murder
simpliciter, there being no averment, either of the fact that he counselled the
commission of the crime or of the fact that another person was involved
therein. The son was found guilty of manslaughter but the father, guilty of
murder. The conviction of the latter was upheld by this Court.

Relying on the decision of this
Court in Rémillard v. The King (supra), Chief Justice Robertson,
in Rex v. Halmo [7],
dealing with the same matter though arising in a different way, expressed the
following views, at p. 118:—

Appellant was charged in
express terms with an offence against s. 285(6), and if he did aid, abet,
counsel or procure Mayville to drive his motor-car in the manner in which it
was in fact driven, he was guilty of a breach of that subsection, and s. 69 ,
beyond question, warrants his prosecution for an offence under s. 285(6); Remillard
v. The King (1921), 59 D.L.R. 340, 35 Can. C.C. 227, 62 S.C.R. 21. It
was unnecessary to allege in the charge that appellant ""did aid, abet,
counsel or procure Wilfred Mayville,"" for by force of s. 69  it would have
been sufficient, and perhaps, better pleading, to charge him simply with the
offence that Mayville in fact committed. The insertion of the unnecessary words
did not, in my opinion, invalidate the charge, nor prevent its being a good and
sufficient charge under s. 285(6). Appellant was assisted rather than injured
by the more specific statement of his relation to the offence with which he was
charged.

In this state of the law, an
aider and abettor may be indicted as principal simpliciter. It follows that
such an indictment, valid in law, must therefore be construed, not—as was done
in the Court below—as exclusively charging an accused as having in fact
actually committed the offence charged, but as having in the eyes of the law
committed it.

[Page 495]

And, the reason for the
construction being that all particeps criminis are by law principals, it also
follows that the same construction obtains whether, as stated in Taschereau's
Criminal Code , the indictment charges them jointly or each of them alone of the
offence in the ordinary form, as if they had actually committed it, or whether
the offence is stated ""in popular language"" or ""in the words of
the enactment describing the offence"" as Parliament authorized it to be
done at the option of the prosecution, under sub-sections 2  and 3 ,
respectively, of s. 852 .

It is said that charging a man
with rape or to have had carnal knowledge of a woman when he only aided another
to do the act is repugnant and, therefore, misleading. This is so if the
indictment is literally construed but not so if legally construed. Countenance
must be given to the law as laid down and not to arguments prompted by logic
without regard to what the law is. In Simcovitch et al. v. The King
[8],
the argument was that, neither of the appellants falling within the description
of the classes of persons to whom indictable offences of which they were
charged are imputed by statute, they could not physically for that reason
commit, and therefore be convicted of, such offences. This argument was not
accepted to defeat the law as interpreted by the Court.

The Brodie case (supra),
relied on by the majority in the Court below, has, with respect, no application
in the matter. The question in the case was whether the indictment did specify
the offence. The point raised in the present appeal is an entirely different
one and one which was not in issue in the Brodie case. While, in the
latter, this Court dealt with sections 852 , 853  and 855 , it clearly did so
exclusively in relation to the matters under consideration in that case,
carefully adding, indeed, at the end of the judgment:—

We do not want to part with
this appeal, however, without saying that our decision is strictly limited to
the points in issue.

And contrary to what is the
situation here, the Court treated the indictment as being invalid on its face,
quashed it as well as the conviction, and added that the Crown was at liberty
to prefer a fresh indictment if so advised.

[Page 496]

The course of conduct at trial.
As already indicated, respondent was admittedly fully aware of the case for the
prosecution and of the position taken by the latter on the indictment. This
knowledge he gained respectively from the depositions at the preliminary
inquiry and from the opening address of the Crown to the jury at the very end
of which the prosecutor said:—

Now, in that regard, I think
I should at this point advise you that the Crown will not attempt to prove that
this accused actually had sexual intercourse with the complainant (name being
now omitted). The Crown, however, will bring evidence to show that he in concert
with another man, held the accused, the girl, while others had sexual
intercourse with her.

THE COURT: You said the
accused.

MR. FRASER: Oh, I beg your
pardon, held the complainant, while others had sexual intercourse with her.

Thus openly and at the very
beginning of the trial the Crown, on the one hand, stated its intention to
treat—as it was entitled to on the facts of the case and on the indictment as
preferred (see The King v. Michaud [9];
Regina v. Giddins and two others. [10])—the
whole conduct of the accused during the event as being, so far as the accused
was concerned, one entire transaction, rather than to deal separately with his
participation in each of the rapes committed in separate counts, a process much
less favourable to the accused than the one adopted. With all this information
and with this statement of the Crown, the accused, on the other hand, was
content to undergo trial on the indictment as laid. No attempts were made by
the defence either before, or at any stage of, the trial to have this
substantially valid indictment quashed for matters of form, particularized,
amended or divided. From this course of conduct in which both the Crown and the
defence joined, the trial Judge was entitled to conclude that the accused had
neither doubts as to what the case was nor embarrassment with respect to his
defence to the charge as laid. In this situation, the defence was precluded,
after the verdict, from complaining as to the indictment and the Crown was
foreclosed from thereafter laying an indictment charging the accused with
respect to any of the rapes actually committed during the events forming the
basis of the charge.

[Page 497]

In brief, the indictment was
valid, the evidence of the complainant was accepted by the jury; and no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred in the case.

The appeal should be maintained
and the conviction restored.

RAND J.:—The question raised in this appeal is that of
the language in which the offence of rape is to be stated against an accused.
S. 69 of the former Code declared that accessories before the fact and
principals in the second degree, as these were known at common law, were
parties to and guilty of an offence as if principals in the first degree. By s.
852(1) a count was sufficient if it contained in substance a statement that the
accused ""has committed some indictable offence therein specified""; s-s.
(2) permitted the statement to be made in popular language, and s-s. (3) that
""it may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or
declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence"". This latter
general provision might, obviously, require to be accommodated to the special
nature of the offence when accessories before the fact or principals in the
second degree were charged. For example, a husband who aids the ravishment of
his wife by a third person is guilty of the crime of rape upon her; but could
the charge follow the description of the offence as given by s. 298 of the Code
which requires a statement that the woman is not his wife? In such a case it is
necessary to include an allegation of the actual ravishment by another and a
further allegation of the participation by way of assistance of the husband.
The same conflict exists in the case of a woman charged with rape: it would be
an absurdity to state the charge in the language of the Code, yet she is
declared to be a party to the offence and may be found guilty of it.

The permitted description in the
language of the statute is not, then, absolute. In the case before us I would,
in the absence of direct authority, have been disposed to agree with the Court
of Appeal that, owing to the nature of the crime and the connotation of the
language by which it is directly described, the charge states only the personal
act of ravishment by the accused and excludes the offence in law attributable
to him through his act of aiding and abetting.

[Page 498]

In Regina v. Crisham
[11]
the count set forth the actual facts of aiding and abetting a rape by another
and it was argued that the accused should have been indicted as principal at
common law, with the count stating that the accused ""as well as
M'Donough"" had ravished the prosecutor, which so far supports the view I
take of the matter.

But I am precluded from following
it by Rex v. Folkes and Ludds [12]. There
the indictment in the first count charged Folkes with having feloniously
ravished the named woman and in the second that Ludds was there and then
present, aiding and abetting him. The third and fourth counts were similar
except that Ludds was charged as principal and Folkes as aider. The fifth and
sixth, and the seventh and eighth counts, in each couplet, charged a person
unknown to have been principal with Folkes and Ludds aiders. Ludds was
acquitted on an alibi and a general verdict of guilty found against Folkes. The
statute, 9 Geo. IV, c. 31 made no provision against aiders and abettors in rape
and the question was whether, upon the indictment, the verdict could be
sustained against Folkes. As the statute dealt with accessories before and
after the fact to felonies and for aiders in cases of misdemeanour, it seems to
have been accepted or it was at least assumed that the fourth, sixth and eighth
counts did not state an offence against Folkes. There was evidence both of the
personal ravishment by him and his aiding and abetting the ravishment by
others. At a meeting of all the judges except four, the conviction was upheld
on the first count. What this means is that on that count there could be a
conviction upon the finding by the jury based either on the evidence going to
the ravishment or that going to his secondary role as abettor. From this it
follows that if there had been no other than the first count the evidence of
assistance only would, after verdict, have been sufficient. That is the case
before us.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and restore the conviction.

KELLOCK J.:—The indictment upon
which the respondent was tried and convicted contained the following charge:

THAT at or near Newton, in
the Municipality of Surrey, in the County and Province aforesaid, on
the twenty-third day of May, in the

[Page 499]

year of Our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and fifty-four, he the said KENNETH HARDER, a man, did
have carnal knowledge of Vera Borushko, a woman who was not his wife, without
her consent, against the form of the Statute in such case made and provided,
and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and Dignity.

This conviction was set aside by
the Court of Appeal, Robertson and Bird JJ.A., dissenting. The appeal comes to
this court under s. 1023  of the Criminal Code  upon the following
dissent:

That the indictment charging
the accused as a principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver
that the accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally.

It is provided by s. 852(1)  of
the Criminal Code  that every count of an indictment shall contain, and
shall be sufficient if it contains in substance, a statement that the accused
has committed ""some indictable offence therein specified"". By s-s.
(2) it is provided that such statement may be made in popular language without
any technical averments or any allegations of matter not essential to be
proved, while s-s. (3) provides that

Such statement may be in the
words of the enactment describing the offence …

The particular offence here in
question is described by s. 298 as follows:

298. Rape is the act of a
man having carnal knowledge of a woman who is not his wife without her consent,
…

By s. 299, it is provided that
""every one"" who commits rape is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to suffer death or to imprisonment for life, and to be whipped.

It is further provided by s. 69 
that

69. Everyone is a party to
and guilty of an offence who

(a) actually commits
it;

(b) does or omits an
act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person
in commission of the offence; or

(d) counsels or
procures any person to commit the offence.

The view which commended itself
to the majority below is sufficiently expressed in the language of Davey J.,
who, after referring to s. 69(1), clauses (b) and (c),
said:

The accessory is guilty of
the offence committed by the principal, in this case carnal knowledge had
unlawfully by Kie Singh. But that was not the crime charged against the
appellant. It was his own unlawful carnal knowledge that was alleged.

[Page 500]

In my respectful view, the error
into which the learned judges constituting the majority have fallen is in
reading the charge as though it had been framed ""in popular language""
as permitted by s-s. (2) of s. 852 , substituting for the words ""did have
carnal knowledge of Vera Borushko"" in the indictment, the words ""did
have sexual intercourse"" with the named woman without her consent. The
indictment was not, however, so framed but employs ""the words of the
enactment describing the offence"" in accordance with s-s. (3) of s. 852 .
Accordingly, the indictment complying, as it does, with the statute, the only
question is as to whether in a case such as the present, where the respondent
did not himself have sexual intercourse with the woman but aided and abetted
Kie Singh to do so, the indictment is a valid indictment.

At the time of the enactment of
the Code in 1892, it had already been provided by R.S.C., 1886, c. 145,
s. 2, that an aider or abettor

may be indicted and
convicted of a substantive felony, whether the principal felon has or has not
been convicted.

and might be punished in the same
manner as an accessory before the fact, who, by s. 1 of the statute, might be indicted,
tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a
principal.

Sir Henri Elzéar Taschereau, in
his work on the Criminal Code , at p. 28, says in relation to s. 61  (now
s. 69 ) that the section was so framed by the Imperial Commissioners as to put
an end to the nice distinctions between accessories before the fact and
principals in the second degree ""already practically superseded by chapter
145 Revised Statutes"". The learned author goes on to state that all are
now principals in any offence, and punishable as the actual perpetrator of the
offence, as it always has been in treason and misdemeanour. He continues:

The prosecutor may, at
his option, prefer an indictment against the accessories before the fact,
and aiders and abettors as principal offenders, whether the party who actually
committed the offence is indicted with them or not; R. v. Tracey,
6 Mod. 30. For instance: A. abetted in the commission of a theft by B. The
indictment may charge A. and B. jointly or A. or B. alone as guilty of
the offence, in the ordinary form, as if they had actually stolen by one
and the same act….

In every case where there
may be a doubt whether a person be a principal or accessory before the fact, it
may be advisable to prefer the

[Page 501]

indictment against him as a
principal, as such an indictment will be sufficient whether it turn out on the
evidence that such person was a principal or accessory before the fact, as well
as where it is clear that he was either the one or the other but it is
uncertain which he was.

In Russell on Crime, Tenth
Edition, p. 811, the learned author says:

The indictment against
aiders and abettors may lay the fact to have been done by all, or may charge it
as having been done by one and abetted by the rest. Thus where, upon an appeal
against several persons for ravishing the appellant's wife, an objection was
taken that only one should have been charged as ravishing and the others as
accessories, or that there should have been several appeals as the ravishing of
one would not be the ravishing of the others, it was answered that if two come
to ravish and one by comport of the other does the act, both are principals,
and the case proceeded; R. v. Vide, Fitz. Corone, pl. 86.

In Archbold's Criminal
Pleading, 33rd Ed., p. 1089, the following appears:

1938. Indictment

Statement of Offence

Rape

Particulars of Offence


 
  
  A B, on the
  
  
  day of
  
  
  ,in the county of
  
 


had carnal knowledge of J.N,
without her consent.

The offence is a felony at
common law, but the punishment is statutory. An indictment is good which
charges that A committed a rape, and that B was present aiding and abetting him
in the commission of the felony; for the party aiding may be charged either
as, as he was in law, a principal in the first degree or, as he was in
fact, a principal in the second degree; R. v. Crisham, C.
& Mar. 187.

In the case cited, the indictment
stated that

one Peter M'Donough upon one
Bridget Lamb did make an assault, and her the said Bridget Lamb violently,
feloniously, and against her will did ravish, etc.; and went on to state that
the prisoner was present, and feloniously aided and assisted the said Peter
M'Donough in the commission of the said felony, contrary to the statute, etc.

After a verdict of guilty on a
motion in arrest of judgment it was argued for the prisoner that there being no
statutory provisions applicable to persons aiding and abetting in cases of this
nature, the indictment was wrongly framed, that he should have been indicted as
at common law and the indictment

should have charged him as a
principal, and stated that he, as well as M'Donough, ravished the prosecutor.

[Page 502]

It was pointed out that the
statute of 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, which declares that every person convicted of the
crime of rape should suffer death, made no specific provision as to aiders and
abettors, to which Maule J., said:

Then your objection is, that
the offence which has been committed is not stated in the indictment.

Payne:

My objection is, that the
person is not charged, as he ought to have been, as a principal.

Maule J.:

There does not appear to me
to be any ground for the objection. It has been already decided that, in a case
of this description, the party may be charged according to the fact, or
indicted as a principal in the first degree.

In my opinion, therefore, the
English authorities are in accord with the construction which appears to me to
be the proper construction of the Code itself.

For present purposes I see no
difference in principle between the crime of rape and the crime of driving
dangerously contrary to s. 285 , s-s. (6)  of the Criminal Code , where the
accused did not personally drive, the actual driving having been done by
another. This was the situation in Rex. v. Halmo [13].

In that case the accused was
charged with aiding and abetting one Mayville to drive contrary to the statute
and it was contended (conversely to the contention in the case at bar) that he

should have been charged directly
with reckless or dangerous driving, even if his part in it was only to aid,
abet, counsel or procure another…

Robertson C.J.O., in refusing to
give effect to the objection, said, at p. 101:

It was unnecessary to allege
in the charge that appellant ""did aid, abet, counsel or procure Wilfrid
Mayville"", for by force of sec. 69  it would have been sufficient, and
perhaps, better pleading, to charge him simply with the offence that Mayville
in fact committed.

In my opinion this is a correct
statement of the law. Whether an indictment framed as in the case at bar would
be appropriate in a case where a husband has assisted another in ravishing the
wife of the former need not, in my opinion, be considered. There is nothing
inappropriate in the indictment in the case at bar. In my opinion also, as

[Page 503]

the present charge was fully
authorized by the Code, the decision of this court in Brodie v. The
King [14], where
it was considered that the indictment there in question was unauthorized, has
no application.

No argument was advanced by the
respondent based in any way upon evidence given as to the latter having
assisted any other or others than Kie Singh in ravishing the woman named in the
indictment. I decline, therefore, to consider whether the conviction was open
to objection on such a ground, without any argument as to the applicability of
such decisions as Reg. v. Giddins [15]
and The King v. Michaud [16], as
well as our jurisdiction under s. 1014 of the Code.

I would allow the appeal and
restore the conviction.

LOCKE J.:—In my opinion, the law
in England and in Canada, as of the time at which the Criminal Code  came
into force on July 1, 1893, is correctly stated in the 31st Edition of Archbold's
Criminal Pleading and Practice at p. 1499, where it is said that in all
felonies in which the punishment of principals in the first degree and of
principals in the second degree is the same, the indictment may charge all who
are present and abet the fact as principals in the first degree, provided the
offence permits of a participation. The decision in Mackalley's Case [17],
the reference in Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 2, p. 316, s. 64 , and
the decision of Blackburn L.J. in Reg. v. Ram [18],
appear to me to support the author's statement.

The question to be determined in
this appeal is whether this was changed by the provisions of s. 611 of the Code
(55-56 Vict., c. 29) which appeared as s. 852 of the Code prior to its
repeal and reenactment in 1955.

It is to be noted that in Brodie's
Case [19],, the
concluding paragraph of the reasons of the Court delivered by Rinfret J. (as he
then was) made it clear that the decision was ""strictly limited to the
point's in issue"" in that matter and that, on the face of it, the
indictment considered was defective in that it charged that the accused were
parties to ""a seditious conspiracy in conspiring together"", without

[Page 504]

saying what they conspired to do.
The head note correctly states the only point decided in these terms:
""Although conspiracy to commit a crime, being in itself an indictable
offence, may be charged alone in an indictment and independently of the crime
conspired to be committed, it is nevertheless necessary that a count charging
conspiracy alone, without the setting out of any overt act, should describe it
in such a way as to contain in substance the fundamental ingredients of the
particular agreement which is charged."" Once it is appreciated that this
was the point for decision, it appears to me to be clear that the reasons
delivered do not touch the present matter.

With great respect, the judgments
of the majority in the Court of Appeal appear to me to overlook the fact that s-ss.
(2) and (3) of s. 852  are to be considered separately since they state
alternative methods in which an indictment may be phrased. It appears to me to
be error to graft on to the provisions of s-s. 3 the concluding words of s-s.
2. Once this is appreciated, I think that the proper conclusion in the present
matter is made clear. The indictment against Harder was in the language of s.
298. The offence there described might, indeed, be committed in more than one
manner, by virtue of the provisions of s. 69 of the Code. Ignorance of
this, if he was indeed ignorant, would not assist the accused. The fact would
be immediately made known to him, in any event, when, as in the present matter,
he retained counsel. In my opinion, when a person has abetted another to commit
the offence of rape, it is a literal compliance with the requirements of s-s. 3
to charge him of the offence as a principal, just as it was prior to the first
enactment of the Criminal Code . If, as I think it must be conceded, the
three Indians and Harder had been charged together in one indictment of the
offence of rape, as was done in the case of Ram, the indictment could not have
been impeached by Harder, I am unable, with respect for differing opinions, to
appreciate why he may do so when he is charged alone.

The question is not whether, in
fact, the form of the indictment misled the accused as to the offence with
which he was charged, since there was a preliminary hearing and a statement
made by Crown counsel at the commencement of the trial in the Assizes as to the
nature of the case of the

[Page 505]

Crown which precluded the
possibility of his being misled. I merely mention the matter to say that it
cannot be suggested that, in this respect, the accused did not have a fair
trial. The question as to whether the indictment was misleading in this sense
is quite aside from the point, which is limited to the question as to whether
the indictment complied in strictness with the requirements of s. 852(3), read
in conjunction with s. 855 (f).

As to the point that the
indictment should be held bad for uncertainty since it did not specify whether
it was the rape committed by Kie Singh or that by Jumbo Singh with which he was
charged, no such objection was raised at the trial nor presumably argued before
the Court of Appeal since no mention is made of it in any of the judgments
delivered. Nor was the matter mentioned in the factum of the respondent or in
the argument in this Court. If the point had been argued in the Court of Appeal
or in this Court, it would have been necessary to consider the application of
s. 1014(2). In the circumstances, I express no opinion upon the point.

I would allow the appeal and
restore the conviction.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting) :—The
respondent was tried before Wilson J. and a jury and, on December 5, 1954,
was convicted on the following charge:—

THAT at or near Newton, in
the Municipality of Surrey, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the twenty-third
day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-four,
he the said KENNETH HARDER, a man, did have carnal knowledge of Vera Borushko,
a woman who was not his wife, without her consent, against the form of the
Statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our Lady the
Queen her Crown and Dignity.

The Court of Appeal for British
Columbia by the judgment of the majority (O'Halloran, Sidney Smith and Davey
JJ.A.) allowed the respondent's appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a
verdict of acquittal to be entered. The Attorney General now appeals to this
Court on the question of law on which Robertson and Bird JJ.A. dissented which
is stated in the following words in the formal judgment of the Court:—

That the indictment charging
the accused as a principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver
that the accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally.

[Page 506]

We were informed by counsel that
the appeal was argued in the Court of Appeal without a transcription of the
evidence, the record before that Court consisting of the formal charge against
the respondent, quoted above, and the charge of the learned trial judge to the
jury. The complete record of the proceedings at the trial was however placed
before us.

In opening the case to the jury
counsel for the Crown said in part:—

His Lordship will direct you
insofar as the law is concerned, but I think his Lordship might forgive me at
this time if I point out to you that it is necessary for the Crown to prove,
firstly, that this offence took place within the Municipality of Surrey, or in
any event within the jurisdiction of this court; secondly, that this man who
stands before you in the prisoner's dock is not the husband of the complainant
Vera Borushko; and, thirdly, that the circumstances under which this offence is
alleged to have taken place constitute in law the offence of rape.

Now, in that regard, I think
I should at this point advise you that the Crown will not attempt to prove that
this accused actually had sexual intercourse with the complainant Vera
Borushko. The Crown, however, will bring evidence to show that he in concert
with another man, held the complainant, the girl, while others had sexual
intercourse with her …In that regard, his Lordship will instruct you on the law
applicable to those particular circumstances.

It is not necessary to refer to
the evidence in any detail. It is sufficient to say that the complainant
deposed that the respondent did not himself have sexual intercourse with her or
make any attempt to do so but that on the day stated in the charge he, Jumbo
Singh and Puga Singh held her by force while Kie Singh had intercourse with her
without her consent and that shortly thereafter the respondent, Kie Singh and
Puga Singh held her by force while Jumbo Singh had intercourse with her without
her consent.

It is obvious that if the facts
were as testified by the complainant each of the four named men could on proper
charges have been found guilty of the rape which was committed personally by
Kie Singh and also of the rape committed personally by Jumbo Singh. The question
before us is whether on this evidence the respondent could lawfully be
convicted on the charge as laid.

I do not find it necessary to
review the numerous authorities cited to us in which ss. 852  and 853  and the
related sections of the Criminal Code  have been discussed as it is my
opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal were 

[Page 507]

right in holding that the charge
in the case at bar did not fulfil the minimum requirements of those sections as
to what a count in an indictment must contain.

In speaking of s. 852  and of the
manner in which an offence must be specified in a count, Rinfret J., as he then
was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court in Brodie v. The King
[20],
said:

The statement must contain
the allegations of matter ""essential to be proved,"" and must be in
""words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he
is charged."" Those are the very words of the section; and they were put
there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its main objects being
that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the indictment
shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or acts with which
he is charged, in order that he may be advised of the particular offence
alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.

In Rex v. Bainbridge
[21],
the judgments stress the necessity that the indictment ""shall in itself
reasonably identify not only the nature of the crime charged, but the act or
transaction forming the basis of the crime named"" and assign as the two
main reasons for this requirement, (i) that the accused may properly prepare
for his trial and (ii) that he shall be able to plead autrefois acquit
or autrefois convict, as the case may be, if he is again charged. The Bainbridge
case was approved by this Court in Brodie v. The King (supra).

In my opinion the wording of the
charge in the case at bar not only failed to inform the accused of the case
which the Crown proposed to prove against him but was actually misleading. As
it was put by Sidney Smith J.A., ""no accused man on reading its language
charging him with having carnal knowledge of a woman could possibly know that
it did not mean that at all—that what it meant to charge against him was
assisting another man so that such other man could have such carnal
knowledge.""

It may be mentioned in passing,
as was pointed out by counsel for the respondent, that if the charge was
intended to be directed to the fact that the accused had assisted another to
rape the complainant the allegation that the accused was a man was irrelevant
(see R. v. Ram and Ram [22]) as
was also the allegation that the complainant was not his wife (see Rex
v. Audley [23]).

[Page 508]

The bare minimum of information
which the charge should have contained to enable the accused to know what he
had to meet was a statement that Kie Singh (or Jumbo Singh) had raped the
complainant and that the accused had done an act for the purpose of aiding him
to do so. The language actually used to describe the offence imports personal
commission by the appellant of the physical act of intercourse and it is
impossible to read it as referring to a rape committed by some other individual
with the assistance of the appellant. Adopting the words of Davey J.A.,
""because it charged an offence consisting of a single, specific and
personal act of intercourse by the appellant on the woman, it excluded by such
specification an act of intercourse had by another person which would also have
constituted the crime of rape by the appellant if he had assisted in it within
the meaning of Sec. 69 .""

The rapes of which the
complainant's evidence, if believed, shewed the respondent to be guilty were (a)
that committed by Kie Singh, and (b) that committed by Jumbo Singh. The
rape with which he was charged was neither of these; it was one committed by
himself personally and there was no evidence of any such rape.

It is suggested that the
reasoning set out above fails to give effect to the provision in s. 852 (3)  of
the Criminal Code  that ""such statement may be in the words of the
enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an
indictable offence""; but the answer to this suggestion is that the offence
of which the evidence of the complainant indicated that the appellant was
guilty is one created not by sections 298  and 299  simpliciter but by the
combined effect of those sections and s. 69 (1)  (b)—""Everyone is a
party to and guilty of an offence who …does an act for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit the offence."" The words of s. 298  used alone, as they
were in the charge in the case at bar, are inapt to describe the offence
disclosed in the evidence.

However it may be in other cases,
I am of opinion that where, as for example in incest or rape, the criminality
of an act depends on the existence or non-existence of a particular
relationship between the individual personally committing the act and another
person it is essential that the charge should specify whether the accused did
the alleged 

[Page 509]

act personally (in which case it
is necessary to prove whether such relationship existed between the accused and
the person with or upon whom the offence was committed) or merely aided another
to commit it (in which case it is necessary to prove whether such relationship
existed between the person aided and the person with or upon whom the offence
was committed).

We were referred to no reported
case and I have found none, in which the charge against an accused who had not
personally ravished a woman but had assisted another to do so did not contain a
statement that one other than the accused had done the act and the accused had
assisted in it

I am unable to regard the case of
R. v. Folkes and Ludds [24],
referred to by my brother Rand as requiring a decision contrary to that of the
majority of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. The report, which is very
brief, shews that in the first count Folkes was charged with having personally
ravished the complainant and that there was ample evidence that he had done so.
The report does not contain any statement of the reasons given by the Judges
but simply states their conclusion that the conviction was good on the first
count. It may well be that the Judges treated the general verdict of guilty
against Folkes as a verdict of guilty against him on each count. As was said by
Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathem [25]:

…a case is only an authority
for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a
proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.

While what I have said above is,
in my opinion, sufficient to dispose of the appeal I wish to deal with another
point which, for the obvious reason that the evidence was not before them, was
not referred to in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. In charging the jury the
learned trial judge put the case to them as if the charge were that the accused
had assisted Kie Singh to rape the complainant. In fact, as is set out above,
the complainant had deposed to the commission of two separate crimes of both of
which, on her evidence, the accused was guilty (i) the rape by Kie Singh and
(ii) the rape by Jumbo Singh. If it was intended to charge him with one only of
these crimes, then it is not

[Page 510]

possible to say with which of the
two he was charged and the charge is bad for uncertainty. If it was intended to
charge him with both of these crimes then the charge is bad, for these two
separate and distinct crimes could not both be charged in one count, although
they might have been charged in separate counts in the same indictment. If it
was intended to charge the accused not with both but only with one or the other
of these two crimes the charge is bad, for it is an elementary principle that
two separate and distinct offences must not be charged in the alternative in
one count as the accused cannot then know with certainty with what he is
charged or of what he is convicted or acquitted, as the case may be, and may be
prevented on a future occasion from pleading autrefois convict or autrefois
acquit.

It is impossible to regard the
two rapes above referred to as other than separate and distinct offences. If
the accused had been charged with the rape committed by Kie Singh in words
making it clear that what was alleged against him was that he had assisted Kie
Singh who personally committed the offence and been convicted on such charge,
it could not be suggested that if he was thereafter charged in proper words
with the rape committed by Jumbo Singh he could successfully plead autrefois
convict.

For the above reasons I am of
opinion that the disposition of the appeal made by the majority in the Court of
Appeal was right and I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed;
conviction restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Theft—Receiving—Retaining—Whether doctrine of recent possession of stolen
goods applies to offence of retaining.

The respondent was
tried on three charges, (1) theft of goods, (2) receiving the goods knowing
them to have been stolen and (3) retaining the same knowing them to have been
stolen. The trial judge acquitted him on the charges of theft and receiving and
convicted him of retaining. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and
ordered an acquittal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The presumption of
recent possession does not apply to the offence of retaining. Guilty knowledge
must be acquired subsequent to the original obtaining of possession. In the
present case, there was no evidence that the respondent had acquired, after the
goods had come into his possession, knowledge that they had been stolen.

APPEAL by the Crown
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], quashing the respondent’s conviction on
a charge of retaining and ordering his acquittal.

C.P. Hope, Q.C. for the appellant.

A. Cooper for the respondent.



THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—A
majority of the Members of the Court which heard this appeal are of the view
that the offence of retaining stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen is
a separate and distinct offence from that of receiving. In Clay v. The
King[2], I adopted as correct the statement of Roach J.A.,
when that matter was before the Court of Appeal, that on a charge of retaining
goods which had been stolen knowing them to have been stolen, the presumption
in the case of recent possession arose if at the time of receiving the accused
knew that the goods had been stolen; that that presumption of knowledge
continued down through the period in relation to which the accused was charged
with retaining. In the Clay case that was also the view of Chief Justice
Rinfret, Taschereau J. and








[Page 426]



Fauteux J. A careful
examination of the reasons of Estey J. leads me to the conclusion that he
considered that guilty knowledge must be acquired subsequent to the original
obtaining of possession.



There was, therefore,
no majority as to the basis for the application of the presumption. In view of
the fact that four of the Members of the Court hearing this appeal held and
hold the view indicated above, it should now be laid down that the presumption
does not apply at all to the offence of retaining.



As to this particular
case, there is a right of appeal as ground number two, upon which leave to
appeal was granted, is a question of law, i.e., as to whether there was any
evidence of subsequently acquired knowledge on the part of the respondent that
the goods in his possession were stolen goods. In my view there was no evidence
upon which the Magistrate could find that Suchard acquired, after the goods had
come into his possession, knowledge that they had been stolen, and the appeal
should be dismissed.



The judgment of
Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—



FAUTEUX J.:—The first
ground upon which leave to appeal was granted is whether:



The Court of
Appeal for Ontario erred in law in failing properly to apply the principle
enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Clay v. The
King.



Holding that receiving
and retaining constitute two distinct criminal offences, Members of this Court
divided in the Clay case[3], as to the feature of the distinction
between the two.



On the view of a
majority, the time at which the knowledge, that the property is stolen
property, is acquired differentiates one offence from the other. If this guilty
knowledge is coincident with the initial possession of the stolen property, the
offence is receiving; if only subsequent thereto, it is retaining.



On the view of a
minority, inception of the possession, in the case of receiving, and retention
of the possession, in the case of retaining, manifest the only distinction
between

[Page 427]










the two offences. It
matters not since when, in retaining, or how long after, in
receiving, the guilty knowledge co-exists with the possession, provided it does
so at the time of reception with respect to the latter offence, or at any time
with respect to the former.



Since and by this
decision, the opinion of the majority has become the judgment of the Court on
the matter.



On the basis of this
now settled definition of retaining, no longer can the presumption of recent
possession be effective to support a conviction of retaining. For, in its very
nature, the presumption, resulting from the mere circumstance of recent possession
of stolen goods, is that the initial possession was gained with the
knowledge that the goods were stolen. The fact thus presumed—i.e. a guilty
knowledge coincidental with initial possession—negatives the existence of an
honest initial possession which is part of the essence of retaining and, hence,
necessarily precludes a conviction for the latter offence. Furthermore, as
under the definition of retaining, an honest initial possession is postulated,
the presumption is also ineffective—as was held, in the Clay case, by
those who expressed the view that the doctrine of recent possession was
applicable to the offence of retaining as they then conceived it—to change it
into a dishonest one.



In brief, and once the
fact of recent possession of stolen goods is established, the fact that they
were gained with the knowledge that they were stolen is immediately presumed;
and while a conviction for theft or receiving may then be supported by this
presumption, a conviction of retaining cannot. In the latter case, other
evidence must be adduced and be, on the whole, more consistent with a guilty
knowledge subsequent to the inception of the possession than, as presumed to
be, in view of the fact of recent possession, coincident thereto.



The first ground of
appeal is then well taken.



The second ground,
upon which leave to appeal was granted, was whether:



The Court of
Appeal for Ontario erred in finding that there was no evidence of subsequent
acquired knowledge on the part of the respondent that the goods in his
possession were stolen goods.

[Page 428]










That question implies,
as it should, that the distinction, between the offence of receiving and the
offence of retaining, made by the majority in the Clay case, is the
proper one.



In the present case,
and as against the respondent, there was evidence of recent possession and,
hence, of dishonest initial possession; there was also evidence of conduct
indicating that, since some time, he had a guilty knowledge that the rings were
stolen property.



The conviction,
however, was for retaining. On a careful consideration, it cannot be said that
the whole of the evidence is more consistent with a guilty knowledge subsequent
to initial possession than, as flowing from the presumption, coincident
thereto.



On this second ground,
I am in respectful agreement with the unanimous view of the Court of Appeal and
would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.



The judgment of Rand,
Kellock and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:—



KELLOCK J.:—The
respondent was charged, together with Joyce Hickey, Arthur Scott and John
Jones, on three counts, (1) theft of certain rings, (2) receiving, and (3)
retaining the same rings. The charges were tried in Magistrate’s Court and were
dismissed against Scott and Hickey, no evidence being offered as against the
latter. The respondent and Jones were convicted of retaining and found hot
guilty of theft and receiving. On appeal by the respondent to the Court of
Appeal[4], the conviction was quashed and a verdict
of acquittal directed to be entered. The appeal to this court is by leave
pursuant to the provisions of s. 1025 (2)  of the Criminal Code .



The rings in question
were proved to have been stolen from a retail store in Hamilton on the
afternoon of Friday, August 6, 1954. On the evening of that day, the
respondent, together with Jones, was in Windsor, where they met Hickey and one
Reid, with whom she was living in Windsor. The four were together at times over
the ensuing week-end.



On Monday, August 9,
the four met by arrangement in a hotel at 2 p.m. Hickey testified that on this
occasion

[Page 429]










Jones asked her if she
had any idea where “they” could sell “some rings they brought up from Toronto”.
On Hickey stating that she might know some people she could introduce them to,
“they” asked Reid if “they” could borrow the car and take her with them. The
three then went to a club where Hickey introduced Jones and the respondent to
some people who weren’t interested. They then met Scott, who was told by Hickey
that the two men were interested in selling rings and he was asked if he knew
anyone who might want them. In the upshot, following a telephone call made by Scott,
the four drove to a parking lot, where Jones handed the rings to Scott for the
purpose of showing them presumably to the person to whom he had spoken.
Ultimately, he returned and said that he was to telephone at six p.m.



The party got back
into the car and started back for the hotel, Scott giving the rings back to
Jones. During this drive, Scott was in the back seat, Jones drove the car with
Hickey beside him, and Suchard was on the right-hand side of the front seat.
During this drive they were intercepted by the police. When this occurred Jones
handed the rings to Hickey, instructing her to hide them. She slipped them
inside her blouse and later produced them to the police. When the car was
stopped the respondent was asked to get out, and upon being searched, two ring
boxes were found in his pocket. The rings themselves were identified by the
Hamilton retailer, who also deposed that the boxes were of the type containing
the rings at the time of the theft but it was not possible to identify them
absolutely as the ribbon bearing the name of the retailer had been torn out in
each case.



On the occasion when
the theft occurred, a man had entered the store and handed the jeweller a
bracelet type watch, asking him to tighten the clips. The jeweller had to go to
his work bench at the back of the store for the necessary tools and he was
followed there by the owner of the watch. Just as the jeweller got into the
workshop, two more men entered the store. The jeweller tightened the clips as
quickly as he could and handed the watch back to the owner, having to push him
out of the way in order to get back into the store to attend to the other two.

[Page 430]










Immediately upon the
three leaving the store, the jeweller noticed that two clocks had been taken
from a shelf. He therefore checked his stock in a safe which had been open.
This took some four or five hours. As a result of this checking, the rings were
found to be missing and the police were notified. At the time of Jones’ arrest,
he was wearing a wrist-watch and bracelet of the type worn by the first man who
had entered the store. On this evidence the magistrate disposed of the charges
as above mentioned. In his view, the evidence established joint possession of
the rings on the part of Jones and the respondent.



The judgment of the
Court of Appeal was founded upon the view that there was no evidence pointing
to guilty knowledge having been acquired by the respondent after he had
received the goods. The court considered that while it has been established by
the judgment of this court in Clay v. The King[5], that where the only evidence of guilty
knowledge, including the inference arising from the fact of recent possession
of stolen goods relates to the inception of the possession, an accused person
cannot be convicted on a charge of retaining but only of receiving, the court
considered that all of the evidence in the case at bar pointed only to
knowledge at the time of receiving. The conviction was accordingly set aside.



In Clay v. The
King, ubi cit, it was held by Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ., that
the offences of receiving and retaining are separate and distinct and mutually
exclusive, the difference between the two being that (p. 190) “in the case of
the offence of retaining, there is an interval of time, however short, between
the actual receipt of the goods and receipt of knowledge of their stolen
character, during which interval the possession is either an honest possession
or the character of this interval is not in question.”



Estey J. was of the
same opinion. At p. 208 he said:



Receiving and
retaining, as already stated,¼ are separate and distinct offences and an
accused, even when the evidence of guilty knowledge can be found only in the
presumption, can only be found guilty of either theft or receiving, but not
both. Upon the same basis an accused cannot be found guilty of receiving and
retaining. If an accused party receives the guilty knowledge coincident with
possession of the stolen property, he is guilty of the offence of receiving and
not of retaining. If, however,

[Page 431]



he receives the
property and subsequently acquires knowledge that the property was stolen, and
thereafter continues to retain same, he is guilty of the offence of retaining.



With regard to the
doctrine of recent possession, it was held by Rand, Kellock, Locke and
Cartwright JJ. that it did not apply to the offence of retaining. The judgment.
of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ., contra, was founded on the view that the
offence of retaining was to be defined as being in possession of goods having
acquired knowledge of their stolen character at any time during the possession,
including the time of the actual receipt of the goods.










While at one point in
his reasons Estey J. said, at p. 208, that “the presumption of recent possession
applies to all three of these offences”, the learned judge, in dealing with the
facts before the court, said, at p. 209:



The explanation
here given related to the initial reception of the stolen property and was
disbelieved by the learned trial judge . . . There was no evidence that
justified the conclusion that he received the goods without knowledge of their
having been stolen and subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter
continued to retain the same.



If the earlier
statement of the learned judge that the presumption of recent possession really
applied to the offence of retaining, then the explanation of possession given
by the accused having related only to the initial reception, the presumption
still applied to the offence of retaining, as to which no explanation had been
given. Estey J. found, however, that there “was no evidence that
justified the conclusion that he received the goods without knowledge of their
having been stolen and subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter
continued to retain same,” a finding which he could not have made if the
presumption applied to the charge of retaining.



That this is the true
view of the ground upon which the learned judge proceeded is confirmed by the
last sentence of his reasons at p. 210:



The evidence does
not support a conviction of retaining, as that offence is constituted under s.
399.



This is in accord with
the actual judgment of the court in the case of Clay as it set aside the
conviction on the charge of retaining.



In the case at bar,
therefore, the appellant, having been acquitted of the offences of theft and
receiving, the only

[Page 432]



question is whether
there was any evidence upon which the magistrate was justified in finding
knowledge subsequently acquired. In the opinion of the court appealed from, all
of the evidence was consistent only with guilty knowledge at the inception of
possession.










Where the evidence
indicating knowledge other than that afforded by the presumption is not
sufficient to show knowledge at all, the Crown is confined to the presumption
which relates only to the charge of receiving. In reaching the conclusion that
there is knowledge where there is evidence apart from the presumption, the
tribunal is not bound to act upon the presumption. The time when such knowledge
came to the accused may be uncertain, and then it is a matter for the first
tribunal to decide the greater probability of its having been acquired when
receiving the property or later. There may be doubt of the former, and in that
case the tribunal may find that it was subsequent, and convict on the count of
retaining. If it is once shown that knowledge has co-existed with possession,
then obviously that coincidence must have arisen either at the moment of
receiving the goods or thereafter; it is necessarily the one or the other; and
its attribution to one period automatically concludes the charge based on the
other.



The presumption is
merely an inference of fact which has become crystallized into a rule of law.
The doctrine arose out of the practical necessities of the enforcement of the
law against theft and the allied offence of receiving and other offences which
are incident or connected. It is a device available to the Crown, and by means
of it, the burden of furnishing an explanation for the possession is cast upon
the accused.



This being the nature
of the presumption, it is obviously not open to the accused in any case to
demand its application formally to one or other count against him; Reg. v.
Langmead[6], per Blackburn J. The prosecution may or may not
rely upon it. All that is open to the accused is to meet it with an explanation
or resist its application, not require it to be applied for his own purposes.



In Clay’s case,
the evidence, apart from the presumption, from which a conclusion of knowledge
could have been drawn was of such facts as necessarily involved knowledge,

[Page 433]



if at all, at the time
of receiving the goods. Accordingly, the acquittal upon the charge of receiving
necessarily entailed a finding that those facts did not give rise to a
conclusion of knowledge. In that event they could not thereafter be made use of
for the purposes of a conviction for retaining.



In the case at bar I
am not prepared to differ from the view of the Court of Appeal as to the import
of the evidence.



I would dismiss the appeal.










LOCKE J.:—I have had
the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment to be delivered in this
matter by my brother Kellock and I agree with his statement as to the matter
decided by the judgment of this Court in Clay v. The King[7].



The learned Chief
Justice of Ontario, in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of
Appeal, has found that there was no evidence adduced at the hearing pointing to
guilty knowledge being acquired by the respondent after the time of receiving.
With this I respectfully agree and would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Rape—Declarations of accused made to police
officers while under arrest—Introduced by Crown in rebuttal—No voir dire—
Whether statements admissible.

The appellant was tried before a jury and convicted upon a
charge of rape. His conviction was unanimously affirmed, without written
reasons, by the Court of Appeal.

The Crown, to rebut the evidence given by the accused that he
had never seen the victim, called a witness who, notwithstanding the objection
of counsel for the accused, was allowed to introduce incriminatory answers and
declarations allegedly made by the accused to police officers while under
arrest. The Crown did not attempt to prove that these answers and declarations
had been made freely and voluntarily.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction
quashed and a new trial directed.

The burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court
that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from the
accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown. The
phases of trial at which the Crown seeks to introduce such statements, whether
it be part of its case in chief, or upon cross-examination of an accused heard
in defence, or in rebuttal of evidence adduced by the defence, is foreign to
and in no way affects the ratio of the principle Confirmed under the
authorities. In the absence of affirmative

[Page 401]

proof of the free and voluntary character of the statements,
the impeached evidence was illegally admitted before the jury, and it could not
be said that the verdict would have been the same without such illegal
evidence.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the appellant's conviction
before a jury on a charge of rape.

A. Chevalier Q.C. for the appellant.

G. W. Hill, Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Fautetjx J.:—By
a unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec 2
maintained, without written reasons, the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of rape.

The grounds upon which leave to appeal to this Court was
granted involved, amongst others, the point whether answers given by the
accused, while under arrest for the offence, to questions put to him by a
detective in authority, were admissible to contradict his testimony at trial,
in the absence of any voir dire as to the free and voluntary character
of these answers.

Examined in chief, on his defence, the accused denied having
ever seen the victim of the offence. In cross-examination, he admitted that the
police had several conversations with him but, when referred to the substance
of the latter, he testified having said nothing indicating any knowledge of the
facts of the charge, declaring rather, in the occurrence, that he thought his
failure to inform the authorities of a change of address, with respect to the
registration of his automobile, was the reason for his arrest.

To contradict this testimony, the Crown, in rebuttal, called
Detective Joyal who, notwithstanding the objection made by counsel for the
defence, was allowed to refer to these conversations and give the following
evidence, unpreceded by any examination on voir-dire:—

Q. Est-ce qu'il a dit
qu'il la connaissait?

R. Non. Il n'a pas dit qu'il la connaissait
non plus.

Q. Est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il avait été en
automobile avec elle?

[Page 402]

R. Non. Je peux rapporter les paroles:
""Je peux pas reconter ce qui s'est passé, vous allez me donner dix ans de
pénitencier"".

Q. Il a dit simplement : ""Je peux pas raconter ce qui s'est
passé, vous allez me donner dix ans de pénitencier""?

R. C'est cela.

Q. Est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il était ailleurs ce
soir-là?

R. Non plus.

In Sankey v. The King 3 and in Thiffault
v. The King 4, this Court made it very clear that the
burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Court that anything in the
nature of a confession or statement procured from the accused while under
arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown ; and that such a burden can
rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement
was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by
the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.

The phases of trial at which the Crown seeks to introduce
such statements, whether it be as part of its case in chief, or upon
cross-examination of an accused heard in defence, or in rebuttal of evidence
adduced by the defence, is foreign to and in no way affects the ratio of the
principle confirmed under these authorities. As stated by Humphreys J.
delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England, in Rex v. Treacy
5,
a statement made by a prisoner under arrest is either admissible or not; if it
is admissible, the proper course for the prosecution is to prove it, and, if it
is not admissible, nothing more ought to be heard of it; and it is wrong to
think that a document can be made admissible in evidence which is otherwise inadmissible
simply because it is put to a person in cross-examination.

In Hebert v. The Queen 6
Cartwright J., at page 141, refers to the Canadian jurisprudence in the matter.
In the latter case, the Crown, upon cross-examination of the accused, made use
of such statements. Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. decided that
such evidence was inadmissible, and Estey J., without determining the matter,
said that ""a cross-examination upon such a statement, by the great weight of
authority in our Provincial Courts as well as in the Court of Criminal Appeal
in England has been condemned"". The other Members of the Court, who

[Page 403]

refrained from expressing their views in the matter, did so
because, being of the opinion that the application of the provisions of section
1014(2) was warranted on the evidence, it was unnecessary to determine the
question.

In the present case, there was no serious attempt, on behalf
of the Crown, at the hearing of this appeal, either to justify the
admissibility of such evidence or an application of section 1014(2). The
answers given to the police by the appellant were incriminatory and, had they
been proved to have been freely and voluntarily given, would undoubtedly have
been proper evidence as part of the case for the Crown ; and while the
propriety of introducing such evidence on rebuttal might be open to question,
this particular aspect of, the case was not raised by the appellant; counsel
for the latter being content to rest the appeal on the major question flowing
from the lack of affirmative proof of the free and voluntary character of these
answers.

Under all the circumstances of this case, the Court being
unanimously of opinion that, in the absence of such affirmative proof, the impeached
evidence was illegally admitted before the jury and that it could not be said
that the verdict would have been the same without such illegal evidence, the
appeal was maintained and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and new trial
ordered.

ON APPEL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—""Knowingly
or Wilfully"" contributing to juvenile delinquency—Mens rea—Whether honest
belief that child was not a juvenile a defence—Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 160.

Under s. 33(1) (b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act
(R.S.C. 1952, c. 160), the fact that an accused does not know that the girl is
a juvenile and honestly and reasonably believes that she is over the age limit,
constitutes a good defence.

The respondent was convicted under s. 33 of ""knowingly or
wilfully"" contributing to juvenile delinquency. He had had sexual
intercourse with a girl under 18 years of age with her consent. The girl had
told him that she was 18 although she was only a few months over 16 and
therefore a juvenile under the law of British Columbia.

[Page 641]

The juvenile court judge, stating that he was bound by the
decision in Regina v. Paris (105 C.C.C. 62), held that, as a
matter of law, the fact that the respondent honestly believed that the girl was
18 could afford no defence to the charge and made no finding as to whether the
respondent did in fact so believe. An appeal to a judge of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia was dismissed. But the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
allowed a further appeal and ordered that the case be remitted to the judge of
the Supreme Court.

This Court granted leave to appeal on two questions of law:
(i) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the respondent could not
be convicted unless he knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that the girl was
under 18; and (ii) whether it erred in law or exceeded its jurisdiction in
remitting the case to the judge of the Supreme Court.

Held (Fauteux J. dissenting): That the appeal should be
dismissed, the order referring the case back struck out, the conviction quashed
and an acquittal directed.

Per Kerwin, C.J.: The words ""knowingly or
wilfully"" in s. 33(1) (b) permitted the respondent to raise the
issue of mens rea. There can be no doubt as to the general rule and that where
it applies it covers every element of an offence. Consequently, it applied not
only to the act which it was alleged contributed to the delinquency, but also
to the accused's state of mind as to the girl's age. It was open to the trial
judge to register a conviction if he concluded on the evidence, either that the
accused knew the girl was under the age fixed by law, or that, notwithstanding
his pro forma question to her, he proceeded without a real belief in her answer
that she was above the age. The trial judge found neither of these facts.

This Court is in a position to make the order that the Court
of Appeal should have made under s. 1014(3) of the old Criminal Code .

Per Taschereau J.: There is no valid reason why the
word ""knowingly"" in s. 33 should be interpreted as relating only to
the quality of the act, and not to the age of the child. Unless the contrary
appears in the statute, that word applies to all the elements of the actus reus.

In view of s. 2 of the Act which defines the word
""child"", and in view of the conclusive evidence heard at the trial,
it is impossible to reasonably hold that the girl was not apparently of the age
of 18, or that the respondent did not have an honest belief that she had
reached that age.

Per Rand and Locke JJ.: The general principle of
criminal law is that accompanying a prohibited act there must be an intent in
respect of every element of the act, and that is ordinarily conveyed in
statutory offences by the word ""knowingly"". As is seen in s. 33(1) (a)
and (b), the offending act embraces the elements of something done of a
certain quality and by or in relation to a ""child"". The principle
would thus extend the word ""knowingly"" to the age as well as to the
conduct. The language of the statute contemplates the application of the
principle of mens rea.

It was not shown that the respondent either knew the age of
the girl to be under 18 or was otherwise chargeable with that knowledge.

Per Cartwright and Nolan JJ.: The words ""knowingly
or wilfully"" govern the whole of s. 33. Therefore honest ignorance on the
part of the accused of the one fact which alone renders his action criminal (in
this instance the age of the girl) affords an answer to the charge.

[Page 642]

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under the Act
being the same as under s. 1014  of the Criminal Code , it had no
jurisdiction to refer the matter back to the judge of the Supreme Court.
Proceeding to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal ought to have given,
the appeal should be dismissed as no tribunal acting reasonably could have
found it to be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent knew,
or was wilfully blind to, the fact that the girl was under age of 18 at the
time.

Per Fauteux J. (dissenting): The words ""knowingly
or wilfully"" in the section do not relate to all the constituent elements
of the offence which are (1) the doing of an act; (2) contributing to the
delinquency; (3) of a child. They relate only to the first. To apply them to
the other two elements would permit the accused to substitute his own opinions
and have them prevail over the opinion of the court as to whether the act
complained of would contribute to delinquency or as to whether the person
involved was ""apparently"" over the age of 18. The accused assumes the
risk that the opinion he forms from appearance as to the age of the girl will
be the same as the court's opinion.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] , allowing the appeal from a conviction under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act.

L. A. Kelley, Q.C. and
J.J. Urie for the appellant.

H. A. D. Oliver for the
respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—It should be
held, in accordance with the settled course of judicial decision, that the
words ""knowingly or wilfully"" in s. 33(1) (b) of The
Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, permitted the respondent to
raise the issue of mens rea. There can be no doubt as to the general
rule and that where it applies it covers every element of an offence. In the
present instance it applies not only to the act which it is alleged contributed
to the delinquency, but also to the accused's state of mind as to the girl's
age. It would be open to the Judge trying the accused to register a conviction
if he concluded on the evidence, either that the accused knew the girl was
under the age fixed by law, or that, notwithstanding his pro forma question
to her, he proceeded without a real belief in her answer that she was above
that age. Here the trial Judge found neither of these facts as he felt himself
bound by Rex v. Paris[3] . On an
appeal by the present respondent to Wood J. the latter followed his

[Page 643]

own judgment in the Paris case. I
agree with the Court of Appeal[4] that
that decision cannot be supported. Rex v. Prince[5]
, does not apply as the statute there in question did not contain the word
""knowingly"". More to the point are Emary v. Nolloth[6]
and Groom v. Grimes[7] .
The Court of Appeal therefore correctly set aside the conviction.

It was suggested that, in view of
the holding of this Court in Welch v. The King[8]
, the judgment before us was a nullity, (and therefore the order of Wood J.
should stand), because it not only allowed the appeal from the judgment of Wood
J. but remitted the case to that learned judge. In the Welch case,
however, the accused had been found guilty on his first trial and, while that
conviction had been set aside by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, we held on an
appeal from that Court's order affirming a subsequent conviction that the Court
of Appeal on the first occasion had not directed an acquittal, or directed a
new trial, or made such other order as justice requires as specified in s.
1014(3) of the old Criminal Code . Here the respondent had not been tried
before and on this appeal we are in a position to make the order that the Court
of Appeal should have made.

The respondent has served his
sentence and this was a test case in which the Attorney General of British
Columbia desired the opinion of this Court on the two points mentioned. Under
these circumstances the Order appealed from should be varied by striking out
the reference back and by quashing the conviction and directing an acquittal.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The facts in the
present case have been fully exposed in the judgments of my colleagues, and it
is therefore useless to deal with them once more.

The respondent was charged under
s. 33(1) (b) of the ""Act respecting Juvenile Delinquents"".
This section reads as follows:—

33. (1) Any person, whether
the parent or guardian of the child or not, who, knowingly or wilfully,

[Page 644]

(b) does any
act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child's being or becoming a
juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, is
liable on summary conviction before a juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine
not exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not
exceeding two years or to both fine and imprisonment.

He was found guilty by a judge of
the Juvenile Court in and for the City of Vancouver, and sentenced to be imprisoned at Oakalla for a
term of six months. The magistrate thought that he was bound by the decision of
Mr. Justice Wood of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Regina v.
Paris[9]
, where it was held:—

In view of the fact that
juvenile court judges in Vancouver have held throughout the past 28 years that,
despite the inclusion of the words ""knowingly or wilfully"" in the
Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929, ch. 46 (Dom.) and in the informations
thereunder, the fact that an accused thereunder did not know that the girl in
question was a juvenile, i.e., under 18 years of age, and honestly and
reasonably believed that she was over 18, does not constitute a good defence,
Wood, J. was of the opinion that the contrary should not be held by a single
judge of the Supreme Count and, therefore, dismissed an appeal based on said
ground, where the girl was in fact 16 years old but told the accused that she
was 19, and looked even older.

Appeal in the present case was
brought again before Mr. Justice Wood, who still held that the section applied,
and that in such circumstances, it was not a valid defence for the accused to
say that he believed honestly and reasonably that the girl was over 18, while
in fact she had not reached yet that age. He therefore followed his previous
decision in Regina v. Paris
(supra).

The Court of Appeal reversed that
decision and held that upon the express language of the statute which uses the
words ""knowingly or wilfully"", it is a valid defence for an
accused to show that he acted upon the honest belief that the girl was 18 years
of age. It was therefore ruled that Regina v. Paris
(supra) had been wrongfully decided,
and could not be considered as a correct exposition of the law.

It has been submitted on behalf
of the appellant that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia conflicts with a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of England,
in the case of Regina v.
Prince[10]
. In that case, the accused was charged with having unlawfully taken

[Page 645]

one Annie Phillips, an unmarried
girl being under the age of sixteen, out of the possession and against the will
of her father.

Section 55 of the Offences
Against the Persons Act provided that:—

Whoever shall unlawfully
take any unmarried girl under the age of sixteen years of age, out of the
possession and against the will of her father or mother, or any other person
having the lawful care or charge of her shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.

The Court of Criminal Appeal held
that it was no defence to an indictment under s. 55 that the defendant bona
fide and reasonably believed that the girl was older than sixteen. Baron
Bramwell who delivered the judgment of the Court which was assented to by Lord
Chief Baron Kelly, Cleasby, B., Grove, J., Pollock, B., Amphlett, B., said at
page 142:—

In addition to these considerations
one may add that the Statute does use the word ""unlawfully""
and does not use the words ""knowingly or not believing to the
contrary"".

And at page 144:—

The question, therefore, is
reduced to this, whether the words in 24 & 25 Vict. c. 100, s. 55, that
whosoever shall unlawfully take ""any unmarried girl being under the age of
sixteen, out of the possession of her father"" are to be read as if they
were ""being under the age of sixteen, and he knowing she was under that
age."" No such words are contained in the statute, nor is the word
""maliciously"", ""knowingly"", or any other word used that can
be said to involve a similar meaning.

It is clear to my mind that the
Court implied that if the word ""knowingly"" had been used
instead of the word ""unlawfully"", the decision of the Court would
have been different.

It is further submitted that the
word ""knowingly"" has reference only to the quality of the act
charged and not to the knowledge that the juvenile was in fact a juvenile. I do
not believe that this contention can be upheld. A meaning must be given to the
word ""knowingly"" in the statute, and it cannot be disregarded.
I see no valid reason why it should be interpreted as relating only to the
quality of the act, and not to the age of the child. The law makes no such
distinction, and I would invade the legislative field if I did attempt to make
any.

Since the Prince case (supra),
this word ""knowingly"" has been considered by the courts, and
it has been rightly held that when it is found in a statute, full effect must
be 

[Page 646]

given to it. Unless the contrary
appears, it applies to all the elements of the actus reus. For instance, the offence of ""knowingly""
selling intoxicants to a person under age is not committed, if the vendor
honestly believes the child to be over the required age. (Groom v.
Grimes[11] ).
In that case, the Court of Appeal of England held:—

A licence-holder cannot be
convicted under sect. 2 of the Intoxicating Liquors (Sale to Children) Act,
1901, for ""knowingly selling"" intoxicating liquor to a person
under the age of fourteen years, when he himself has no knowledge of the sale
and when the barman who sells the liquor has no knowledge that the person to
whom he sells is under the age of fourteen years, but honestly believes that he
has attained that age.

If any additional and more recent
authorities are needed, vide: (Rex v. Cohen[12]
); (Gaumont v. Henry[13]
).

Professor Glanville Williams in
his treatise on ""Criminal Law"" sums up the jurisprudence on the
matter as follows:—

(c) We now see the influence
of the word ""knowingly"", used in a statute, upon the rules relating
to ignorance and mistake. On principle the word ""knowingly"" has no
extra effect where the crime requires intention, for intention itself
presupposes knowledge of the circumstances. The word ""knowingly""
does, however, affect the position where the crime can be committed recklessly.
If the word is not included in the statute, the party will be deemed to act
recklessly unless he mistakes a relevant fact; simple ignorance is not enough.
But if the word is inserted, simple ignorance becomes a defence, and it is only
knowledge (or its equivalent wilful blindness) that convicts.

Where Parliament in similar
offences wishes to eliminate ""knowledge"" as an essential element, it
says so in unmistakable terms. For instance, s. 138(1)  of the Criminal Code 
reads:—

Every male person who has
sexual intercourse with a female person who

(a) is not his wife,
and

(b) is under the age
of fourteen years, whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of
age or more, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for life and to be whipped.

Such language is not used in s.
33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, and such a wide difference in the
phraseology clearly reveals the intention of the legislator. In the first case
""knowledge"" is immaterial, but it is essential in the second.

I have therefore reached the
conclusion that the interpretation of s. 33 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act,
as given by the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia is right.

[Page 647]

Although I would dismiss the
appeal, I do not think that any useful purpose can be served in remitting the
matter to the lower court, as ordered by the Court of Appeal. In view of s. 2
of the Act which defines the word ""child"", and in view of the
conclusive evidence heard at the trial, I am of opinion that it is impossible
to reasonably hold that the girl was not apparently of the age of eighteen, or
that the respondent did not have an honest belief that she had reached that
age.

Subject to the above
modification, I would dismiss the appeal and direct the acquittal of the
respondent.

The judgment of Rand and Locke
JJ. was delivered by

RAND J.:—This appeal involves the
interpretation of certain provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929.
The respondent was convicted of having ""knowingly or wilfully""
committed an act or acts

producing, promoting, or
contributing to Lorraine Brander, a child, being or becoming a juvenile
delinquent or likely to make the said child a delinquent….

The girl had told the respondent
that she was 18 years old although she was in fact under that age. The question
is whether the principle of mens rea applies to the element of the offence as
to her age.

""Child"" is defined by
s. 2(1) (a) as

any boy or girl apparently
or actually under the age of sixteen years, or such other age as may be
directed in any province pursuant to subsection (2);

The age, for the purposes of the
prosecution here, was 18 years.

The culpable act is declared in
s. 33: :—

(1) Any person, whether the
parent or guardian of the child or not, who knowingly or wilfully

(a) aids, causes,
abets or connives at the commission by a child of a delinquency, or

(b) does any act
producing, promoting, or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile
delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, is liable on
summary conviction before a Juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding
two years or to both fine and imprisonment.

In the definition of
""child"", the essential words are ""apparently or actually""
under the age specified. This expression must necessarily mean ""apparently
and 

[Page 648]

actually"" for otherwise an
offence could be committed with a person over 21 years who was
""apparently"" under 18. That is obviously not the intention of the
statute.

So read it might be suggested
that the apparency is a fact to be found by the magistrate. But to what mind
should it be apparent? to the magistrate, to the accused, to the average person
of his age, or of any age? Whatever it may be, other language of the statute
relieves me from exploring the question further and this is found in s. 33.

Mr. Kelley, on behalf of the
Attorney General of British Columbia, argues that the words ""knowingly or
wilfully"" in that section qualify only part of the offence described: the
act which contributes to the delinquency. This seems to omit both the
appreciation of its relation to the delinquency and the age of the child. But
the former is not of materiality here, and it is on the latter that the issue
hinges.

The general principle of criminal
law is that accompanying a prohibited act there must be an intent in respect of
every element of the act, and that is ordinarily conveyed in statutory offences
by the word ""knowingly"". As stated by Professor Glanville Williams in
his Criminal Law at p.131:—

It is a general rule of
construction of the word ""knowingly"" in a statute that it applies to
all the elements of the actus reus.

As is seen in s-s. (1) (a)
and (b) of s. 33, the offending act embraces both the elements of
something done of a certain quality and by or in relation to a
""child"". The principle would thus extend the word
""knowingly"" to the age as well as the conduct. Is there anything in
the statute to exclude its application?

To this the word
""wilfully"" is significant. Whatever it may mean in other contexts, I
think the intention of s. 33 is this that either the offender knows the child
to be under the age fixed or that he is indifferent as to age. In this,
""wilfully"" and as well, ""knowingly"", hark back to
""apparently or actually"" and in the combined conception the mind of
the accused in relation to the child's age is an essential of the offending act.
Where, therefore, there is belief that the child is 18 years or over, the
offence is not committed: Groom v. Grimes[14]
, where it was held that 

[Page 649]

the offence of
""knowingly"" selling intoxicants to a person under 14 is not committed
if the barman is not chargeable with knowledge that the child is under 14.

It is said that this Act,
being intended for the protection of young persons, places the entire risk of
age upon the accused; and that was the argument in Groom (supra). But
whatever the policy of Parliament, its intention must be gathered from the
language it has used; and on that of the provisions of the Act before
us, I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal that so far from excluding the
principle of mens rea, it contemplates it.

The appeal should, therefore, be
dismissed; but as the matter has been fully opened before us, another
circumstance must be considered. The accused has already served the sentence of
six months imposed upon him. I am inclined to gather from the remarks of the
judge of the Juvenile Court that if he had not felt himself bound by the case
of Regina v. Paris[15] ,
he would have dismissed the charge: but in any event it was not shown that the
accused either knew the age of the young woman to be under 18 years or was
otherwise chargeable with that knowledge. In this situation, the judgment of
this Court should be that the order of Wood J. affirming the conviction be
vacated and that judgment be entered setting aside the conviction of the Judge
of the Juvenile Court and dismissing the charge.

The judgment of Cartwright and
Nolan JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[16]
whereby the appeal of the respondent from a judgment of Wood J. was allowed and
it was ordered, in the words of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal,
""that the case be remitted to the Honourable Mr. Justice Wood in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia"".

The respondent was convicted on November 23, 1953
before the Judge of the Juvenile Court on the charge that he:—

at the said City of
Vancouver, between the 24th and 27th days of October, A.D. 1953, knowingly or
wilfully, did unlawfully commit an act or acts producing, promoting or
contributing to Lorraine Brander, a child, being or becoming a juvenile
delinquent or likely to make the said child a

[Page 650]

juvenile delinquent, to wit,
by occupying the same bed and by having sexual intercourse with the said
Lorraine Brander, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and
provided.

The effect of the evidence at the
trial may be briefly stated. The respondent had sexual intercourse with
Lorraine Brander with her consent. The uncontradicted evidence of Lorraine
Brander and of the respondent is that prior to the act of intercourse she had
told him that she was 18 years of age; he deposed that he would have taken her
to be 18 years or older. In fact her age was 16 years and 5 months. In the province of British
  Columbia a boy or girl under the age
of 18 years is a ""child"" within the terms of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act.

The learned Juvenile Court Judge
held that, as a matter of law, the fact that the respondent honestly believed
that the girl was over the age of 18 could afford no defence to the charge and
made no finding as to whether the respondent did in fact so believe.

Pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act the respondent applied to Wood J. for special leave to
appeal; that learned judge granted leave to appeal and having heard the appeal
dismissed it. Special leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted by
that court and it disposed of the appeal as set out above.

On October 5, 1954, this Court
granted leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. This leave
having been granted pursuant to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, the
appeal lies only ""in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction""
(s. 41(3)). Two such questions were argued before us: (i) Whether the Court of
Appeal erred in law in holding that the respondent could not be convicted on
the charge above set out unless he knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that
Lorraine Brander was under the age of 18 years; and (ii) whether the Court of
Appeal erred in law or exceeded its jurisdiction in remitting the case to Wood
J..

As to the first point, I agree
with the reasons and the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of British
Columbia, but wish to add a few observations of a general nature.

Section 7(2)  of the Criminal
Code  provides as follows:—

7 (2) Every rule and
principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or
excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in
respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the
Parliament of Canada, except in so far as they are altered by or are
inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

In the case at bar we are
concerned with the application of the rule of the common law summed up in the
first sentence of the maxim—Ignorantia facti excusat; ignorantia juris non
excusat. The rule has been stated and applied in countless cases. In The
Queen v. Tolson[17]
, Stephen J. says at page 188:—

I think it may be laid down
as a general rule that an alleged offender is deemed to have acted under that
state of facts which he in good faith and on reasonable grounds believed to
exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence. I am unable to suggest any
real exception to this rule, nor has one ever been suggested to me.

and adds at page 189:—

Of course, it would be
competent to the legislature to define a crime in such a way as to make the
existence of any state of mind immaterial. The question is solely whether it
has actually done so in this case.

The first of the statements of
Stephen J. quoted above should now be read in the light of the judgment of Lord
Goddard C.J., concurred in by Lynskey and Devlin JJ. in Wilson
v. Inyang[18],
which, in my opinion, rightly decides that the essential question is whether
the belief entertained by the accused is an honest one and that the existence
or non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant
evidence to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining such essential
question.

The question then is as to the
true construction of the following words of s. 33(1) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, read in the context of the whole Act:—

Any person …who, knowingly
or wilfully …does any act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child's
being or becoming a juvenile delinquent, is liable on summary conviction to a
fine …or imprisonment…

[Page 652]

In approaching this question the
following rules of construction should be borne in mind. In Watts and Gaunt v.


The Queen[19] , Estey J. says:—

While an offence of which mens
rea is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view
of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed
unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed
such an intention.

In his book on Criminal Law
(1953) at pages 131 and 133, Mr. Glanville Williams says:—

It is a general rule of
construction of the word ""knowingly"" in a Statute that it applies to
all the elements of the actus reus …

The sound principle of
construction is to say that the requirement of knowledge, once introduced into
the offence, governs the whole, unless Parliament has expressly provided to the
contrary.

In my opinion these passages are
supported by the authorities collected by the learned author at the pages
mentioned and correctly state the general rule.

In argument counsel for the
appellant stressed the case of R. v. Prince[20]
but I agree with Mr. Oliver's submission that it is implicit in the reasons of
both Blackburn J. and Bramwell B. that they would have decided that case
differently if the section which they were called upon to construe had
contained the word ""knowingly"".

Were the matter doubtful, it
would be of assistance to consider the provisions of the Criminal Code  which is
a statute of the same legislature in pari materia. Subsections (1) and
(2) of s. 138  of the Criminal Code  and their predecessors subsections
(1) and (2) of s. 301 of the former code, illustrate the type of language
employed by Parliament when it is intended to provide that the belief of an
accused as to a matter of fact is irrelevant.

138 (1) Every male person
who has sexual intercourse with a female person who … is under the age of
fourteen years, whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age
or more, is guilty …

138 (2) Every male person
who has sexual intercourse with a female person who… is fourteen years of age
or more and is under the age of sixteen years, whether or not he believes
that she is sixteen years of age or more, is guilty…

The contrast between the wording
of these sub-sections, particularly those portions which I have italicized, and
that of s. 33 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act is too sharp to be
disregarded.

[Page 653]

While I have already expressed my
agreement with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia on
this point, I wish to expressly adopt the following passage:—

In my view of the matter we
must start out with the proposition that sexual intercourse with a woman, not
under the age of 18 years and with her consent, is not a crime, except under
exceptional and irrelevant circumstances. It follows that if the appellant had
sexual intercourse with a girl not under 18 years of age he could not be
convicted of contributing to her becoming a juvenile delinquent for the simple
reason she is not a child within the meaning of the Act.

It is the age factor alone
that, in these circumstances, moves the act from a non-criminal to a criminal
category.

It follows, it seems to me,
that when a man is charged with konwingly and wilfully doing an act that is
unlawful only if some factor exists which makes it unlawful (in this instance
the age of the girl) he cannot be convicted unless he knows of, or is wilfully
blind to, the existence of that factor, and then with that knowledge commits
the act intentionally and without any justifiable excuse.

It would indeed be a startling
result if it should be held that in a case in which Parliament has seen fit to
use the word ""knowingly"" in describing an offence honest ignorance on
the part of the accused of the one fact which alone renders the action criminal
affords no answer to the charge.

Turning now to the question
whether the Court of Appeal erred in remitting the case to Wood J., it will be
observed that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is found in s. 37(1) of
the Juvenile Delinquents Act, reading as follows:—

37 (1) A Supreme Court judge
may, in his discretion, on special grounds, grant special leave to appeal from
any decision of the Juvenile Court or a magistrate; in any case where such
leave is granted the procedure upon appeal shall be such as is provided in the
case of a conviction on indictment, and the provisions of the Criminal Code 
relating to appeals from conviction on indictment mutatis mutandis apply
to such appeal, save that the appeal shall be to a Supreme Court judge instead
of to the Court of Appeal, with a further right of appeal to the Court of
Appeal by special leave of that Court.

Having granted leave to appeal,
the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, would appear to be the same as that
exercised by it in an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence,
which, at the date of the hearing and determination of the appeal, was to be
found in s. 1014  of the Criminal Code , the relevant words being:—

1014 (1) On the hearing of
any such appeal against conviction the court of appeal shall allow the appeal
if it is of opinion

(b) that the judgment
of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any
question of law;

(3) Subject to the special
provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of
appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the
conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new
trial;

and in either case may make
such other order as justice requires.

I have already indicated my view
that the Court of Appeal was right in allowing the appeal on the ground of a
wrong decision of a question of law by Wood J.. The judgment of my brother
Fauteux in Welch v. The King[21]
, concurred in by the majority of the Court, makes it clear that, having
decided to allow the appeal, it became the duty of the Court of Appeal (i) to
quash the conviction, and (ii) either to direct that a judgment of acquittal be
entered, or to direct a new trial. I am unable to find that there was
jurisdiction to refer the matter back to Wood J. in the manner set out in the
opening paragraph of these reasons. The power ""to make such other order as
justice requires"" is, I think, merely supplemental to the provisions of
clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of s. 1014 .

It remains to consider what order
we should make. In my view our duty is to give the judgment which the Court of
Appeal ought to have given. I have examined all the evidence with care and have
reached the conclusion that it is in the last degree improbable that the
learned Juvenile Court Judge would have convicted the respondent if he had
instructed himself correctly on the law. Indeed I do not think that any
tribunal acting reasonably could have found it to be established beyond a
reasonable doubt that the respondent knew, or was wilfully blind to, the fact
that Lorraine Brander was under the age of 18 years at the relevant time.

It follows that, in my opinion,
the Court of Appeal should have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and
directed a judgment of acquittal to be entered and I would direct that the
judgment of the Court of Appeal should be amended to so provide.

[Page 655]

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—The
respondent was charged before a Judge of the Juvenile Court in and for the city
of Vancouver, under s. 33(1) (b) of the Juvenile Delinquents' Act (1929)
c. 46, enacting that:—

Any person, whether a parent
or guardian of a child or not, who knowingly or wilfully

(a) …

(b) does any act
producing, promoting or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile
delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, shall be liable
on summary conviction before a Juvenile Court …

Under the Act, a
""child"" means a boy or a girl under the age of sixteen years or such
other age as may be directed in any province, which, in the province of British
  Columbia, is eighteen. According to
the evidence, the female, in relation to whom the offence was alleged to have
been committed, was, at the time of its commission, sixteen and therefore a
child under and for all the purposes of the Act. The accused testified
that from her appearance as well as from her own declaration to him, he
believed that she was over eighteen. Relying, in fact, on such evidence and
submitting, in law, that mens rea with respect to the age is of the
essence of the offence, counsel for the accused asked for the dismissal of the
charge. The merit of this evidence did not have to be considered by the trial
Judge as he felt bound by Regina v. Paris[22] , where a same contention as to the law was ruled
out. The accused was convicted and his conviction was subsequently maintained
by the Hon. Mr. Justice Wood of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, who had
decided Regina v. Paris.
The Court of Appeal of British Columbia[23] reached the view that knowledge of the age was of
the essence of the offence, allowed the appeal and ordered the case to ""be
remitted to Mr. Justice Wood for re-consideration upon the issue of mens
rea."" The Crown now brings the latter judgment for review.

The ancient maxim that in every
criminal offence there must be a guilty mind cannot now, as illustrated by the
cases of Rex v. Prince[24]
and Rex v. Bishop[25]
, apply generally to all statutes. It is necessary to look at the object and
the provisions of each Act to see whether and how far knowledge is of the
essence of the offence created.

[Page 656]

There can be no doubt as to the
object of the Juvenile Delinquents' Act. Manifested throughout its
provisions, and particularly in those of sub-section 2 of section 3, section 38
and section 33, the object is to care, aid, encourage, help and assist
misdirected or misguided juveniles and, under section 33, protect them from
becoming or being the victims of social or moral degradation in punishing these
actions or omissions, of even their own parents or guardians, which, of their
nature, are ""likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent"".
With respect to the interpretation of the Act, reference must be made to
section 38 thereof reading:—

38. This Act shall be
liberally construed to the end that its purpose may be carried out, namely,
that the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall
approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its parents, and
that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as criminal,
but as a misdirected and misguided child, and one needing aid, encouragement,
help and assistance.

In addition to this specific
provision, one must also refer to section 15 of the Interpretation Act
R.S.C. (1952) c. 158, providing that:—

15. Every Act and every
provision and enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its
immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing that Parliament deems to
be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing that it
deems contrary to the public good; and shall accordingly receive such fair,
large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the
attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment,
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.

Under section 33(1) (b),
the constituent elements of the offence mentioned are (i) the doing of an act;
(ii) which, of its nature, does or is likely to produce, promote or contribute
to the delinquency; (iii) of a child. What amounts to delinquency is defined in
section 2(1) (h) and, under section 3(1), delinquency does constitute an
offence. It is contended that either of the words ""knowingly or
wilfully"", appearing in the opening phrase of section 33(1) (b),
are related to all the constituent elements therein mentioned. Undoubtedly,
they are related to the first; but the question is whether they are related to
all. In my respectful view, it cannot have been the intention of Parliament to
leave it to the arbitrary judgment of those very persons mentioned in the
opening phrase of section 33—against the 

[Page 657]

action or omission of whom it was
intended to protect juveniles from becoming delinquents—to successfully oppose
their views to those of the Court or Judge entrusted with the operation of the Act,
on the point whether, of its nature, a particular act is one ""producing,
promoting or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile delinquent
or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent."" Any person,
whether a parent or a guardian, giving to a child a book containing the crudest
obscenities, would admittedly do an act forbidden under the section; however,
should the evidence of the Crown fail to show that he had knowledge of the
contents of the book, the prosecution would fail. But if knowledge is shown,
his own views as to whether such book might or might not produce, promote or
contribute to a child's delinquency or be likely to make any child a
juvenile delinquent, would afford no defence, since the act done is precisely
the one against which Parliament intended to protect juveniles. If this is so,
it cannot be said therefore that the words ""knowingly or wilfully""
are related to all the constituent elements of the offence. I cannot think
either that the same words are related to the age of the juveniles. Again, a
child, under the definition enacted for all the purposes of the Act, means any
boy or girl ""apparently or actually"" under the age mentioned.
Comprehensively, the word ""actually"" does not include the concepts of
uncertainty or of mistake, but the word ""apparently"" does not exclude
them. The belief which a person, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile
the age of whom could not ""actually"" be determined, might then form
from appearance only cannot, at his trial, prevail over the opinion which the
Judge must, of necessity, form himself to assert his jurisdiction over the
matter, which he only has if a child is involved. Under the Act, a juvenile
cannot be, at the same time, a child for purposes of jurisdiction and not a
child for other purposes; the definition of a child applies to every provision
of the Act where the word is found. Evidence may show that, from appearance,
the accused could have mistakenly, but reasonably, formed and did, in fact,
form an honest belief that the juvenile was not a child. While such evidence
could support a defence based on a mistake of fact in cases where the actual
age must definitely be established, it does not follow that such

[Page 658]

a defence obtains in cases, as in
the present, where appearance, involving the possibility of mistake, is
sufficient. A person contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile assumes the
risk that the opinion he forms from appearance as to the age be not the one
taken by the trial Judge. Under the Act, knowledge of the actual age is not of
the essence of the offence; appearance is sufficient, failing the best evidence
as to the age. In my respectful view, Parliament did not intend that the
operation of the section be dependent upon the views an accused might form from
appearance. What Parliament clearly intended is the protection of children. In
none of the cases to which we were referred by respondent, the statutory
provisions alleged to have been violated included such a definition of
""child"" as under the Act here considered. I would maintain the
appeal and restore the conviction.

Appeal dismissed;
conviction quashed; acquittal directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Conspiracy to commit offence—Method of
proof— Ss. 471 (b)(c)(e) and 573  of the Criminal Code .

The respondent was convicted of having conspired with others
to commit the offences covered by s. 471 (b) (c) and (e) of
the Criminal Code . The conviction was quashed by a majority in the Court
of Appeal on the ground that there was no evidence to support it.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

In law, it is not a valid objection to a conviction for
conspiracy to contend that the accused was obliged to meet the proof of the
substantive offence of which, however, he was not charged. Likewise, it matters
little that in the description of the substantive offence, as is the case for
the offences created by s. 471 , the accused has the burden of justifying
certain acts which, without that justification, are deemed criminal. Those who
conspire to commit these acts and commit them are liable to be prosecuted for
conspiracy, and the theory of the law on conspiracy, as well as on the 'methods
of proof, is the same.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, Province of Quebec 1,
quashing, Rinfret J.A. dissenting, the respondent's conviction on a charge of
conspiracy to commit an offence under s. 471  of the Criminal Code .

P. Miquelon, Q.C. and A. Dumontier, Q.C. for
the appellant.

R. Cannon, Q.C. and L. Corriveau for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Fauteux J.:—A l'issue d'un procès expéditif, l'intimé fut déclaré coupable sur
un acte d'accusation libellé comme suit:—

1° Entre le premier novembre 1952 et 4 mars
1953, à Québec, à St-Gabriel de Valcartier, dans le district de Québec et
ailleurs dans la Province de Québec, GERARD GAGNON, de la cité de Québec, a
comploté avec André de Lachevrotière alias André de Chavigny et Paul de
Lachevrotière alias Paul de Chavigny et autres personnes à être identifiées
ultérieurement pour commettre un acte criminel, à savoir: pour employer

[Page 636]

des plaques ou matière quelconque sur
lesquelles est gravé ou tracé quelque chose qui est supposé la totalité ou
quelque partie d'un billet de banque ou qui paraît destiné à y ressembler dans
le but d'imprimer quelque partie d'un billet de banque, C. Cr. 471(b) (c)—
573; et

2° entre le premier novembre 1952 et le 4 mars
1953, à Québec, à St-Gabriel de Valcartier, dans le district de Québec et
ailleurs dans la Province de Québec, GERARD GAGNON, de la cité de Québec, a
comploté avec André de Lachevrotière alias André de Chavigny et Paul de
Lachevrotière alias Paul de Chavigny et autres personnes à être identifiées
ultérieurement pour commettre un acte criminel, à savoir: utiliser du papier
destiné à imiter le papier à billets d'une corporation poursuivant les
opérations de banque, à savoir: la Banque du Canada, C. Or. 471(e)—573.

Par jugement formel, déclarant ""qu'il n'y
a aucune preuve de nature suffisante pour justifier le jugement de
culpabilité"", la Cour d'Appel, par une majorité, a acquitté l'intimé et
cassé la sentence prononcée contre lui.

De ce jugement, la Couronne se pourvoit devant
cette Cour, ayant préalablement obtenu permission de soumettre que la Cour
d'Appel avait erré sur les points suivants:—

(a) In interpreting the charges as alleging a
conspiracy to issue counterfeit money, and in dealing with the issue from that
point of view;

(b) In disregarding certain evidence of acts of the
accused and the named co-conspirators constituting elements of the offence
alleged to be the objects of the conspiracy, as being in the circumstances
inadmissible to either charge of conspiracy;

(c) In holding that through the admission of evidence
of the acts mentioned in (b), the accused was denied a trial according
to law by being forced in effect to defend himself against both the charges of
conspiracy and of the substantive offence;

(d) In acquitting the accused on the ground that
after excluding the evidence of the acts mentioned in (b) there was then
before the Court no evidence of any agreement between the alleged conspirators
either to effect an illegal object or by means of illegal means to accomplish a
legal object;

(e) In holding or assuming that, the alleged purpose
of printing in whole or part the bank note or notes, i.e. to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the subject-matter of the Serre patent either to the alleged
co-conspirators or to trust or other companies or persons interested in the
issue of securities, was a defence;

(f) In holding, on the assumption stated in (e),
that after excluding the evidence of the acts mentioned in (b), the
proof was equally consistent with the innocence of the accused;

(g) In holding on the evidence, after
excluding that on the whole of the evidence adduced the proof was equally
consistent with the innocence of the accused;

(i) In holding that the trial judge improperly
refused to allow the defence to introduce certain evidence offered to establish
legal justification or excuse for making the plate.

[Page 637]

Pour déterminer cette cause, il n'est pas
nécessaire d'entrer dans le détail de chacun de ces points. Il suffit des
considérations suivantes.

Aux raisons de jugement de la majorité, on
reconnaît que l'intimé a commis l'offense substantive faisant l'objet du
complot dont il a été accusé. C'est ainsi qu'on dit:—

Le juge (au procès), comme l'avocat de la
Couronne d'ailleurs, s'est attardé à exposer, à déduire et à conclure que
l'appelant avait, sans autorisation ni excuse légitime, imprimé le verso d'un
billet de banque. Il n'y a aucun doute que rappelant l'a fait, en partie.

Et plus loin:—

Sans doute qu'elle (la Couronne) a prouvé que
l'appelant, à la connaissance des deux Chavigny, a imprimé le verso d'un billet
de banque de dix dollars.

On reconnaît également l'existence d'une
entente, entre Gagnon et les frères Chavigny, n'ayant d'autre objet que l'acte
ci-dessus imputé à Gagnon, même si, par ailleurs, on prête, en fait, à cette
entente, un motif qui, en droit, soumet-on, la rendrait non criminelle.

Jamais, dit-on, n'ont-ils (les Chavigny) admis
une entente quelconque pour imprimer de la fausse monnaie. Bien au contraire,
ils ont compris que l'appelant tentait de se servir de son brevet comme moyen
de déceler les faux billets de banque et—ajoutent-ils—on espérait pouvoir le
céder contre considération avantageuse, l'un des Chavigny participant au profit
anticipé en donnant à l'appelant une part substantielle d'actions d'une
exploitation minière.

A aucun moment, en aucune occasion, les frères
Chavigny ont-ils admis avoir formé une entente avec l'appelant pour
l'impression de papier monnaie.

* * *

Le brevet que possédait l'appelant avait pour
but de déceler la fausse monnaie. Ce brevet n'est pas fallacieux car il est
exploité dans certains pays européens. C'est sur cette base et avec l'espoir
raisonnable qu'on pouvait en attendre que les frères Chavigny furent convenus
d'échange matériel réciproque avec l'appelant.

* * *

Dans l'espèce, on ne peut hésiter un moment à
conclure que les frères Chavigny n'ont conclu avec l'appelant qu'une entente se
rapportant à l'exploitation de son brevet, lequel avait précisément pour but
d'intégrer dans les billets de banque un dessin particulier et exclusif.

La preuve révèle que pour l'obtention du
matériel requis à l'exécution de leur entente, l'intimé et les Chavigny ont eu
recours à la supercherie, à de fausses représentations et à l'emploi de noms
fictifs. A cette preuve, on ne trouve aux raisons de la majorité, aucune
référence. Pour sa part, le Juge au procès en a déduit que l'intimé et ses
complices

[Page 638]

étaient conscients qu'aucune autorité ou
excuse légitime ne couvrait ni leurs agissements ni l'entente y présidant.
Concluant qu'il y avait eu complot pour mettre en circulation de faux billets
de banque, il a trouvé l'intimé coupable de l'accusation telle que portée, soit
de complot avec d'autres personnes pour faire certains de ces actes qui
conduisent à la mise en circulation de faux billets de banque et que, pour
cette raison, la loi défend spécifiquement, à l'article 471  du Code
Criminel .

La majorité en Cour d'Appel aurait, aux vues
de l'appelante, erronément interprété l'acte d'accusation comme comportant une
accusation de complot pour mettre en circulation de faux billets de banque.
Certes, certains passages des raisons de jugement supportent cette prétention;
mais il n'est pas nécessaire de s'y arrêter. Dans les vues de la majorité,
""l'erreur fondamentale de jugement de première instance"" résiderait
dans les faits suivants:—

Dana l'espèce, dit-on, l'appelant fut cité en
justice pour avoir conspiré avec d'autres personnes dans le but d'imprimer, en
totalité ou en partie, de faux billets de banque sans autorisation légale et
sans excuse légitime. On saisit immédiatement que si la poursuite, loin de se
restreindre à la preuve d'une entente, entre dans le champ de la preuve du
délit même, l'accusé est acculé à se défendre à la fois de deux délits: le
premier, susceptible de s'établir sans qu'il ait a offrir une défense (la
conspiration), et l'autre qui peut être prouvé (le délit même), s'il n'offre
pas une défense pour le repousser, c'est-à-dire s'il ne tente la justification
de son acte.

Comme le signale Kenny, dans Outlines
of Criminal Law, 13e éd. page 294, il est rare que l'on puisse
établir par des preuves directes le fait même du complot ; car, en raison de
leur nature même, ces accords sont généralement conclus d'une manière aussi
sommaire que secrète. Aussi ne peut-on, le plus souvent, les établir, qu'en les
déduisant de la conduite des parties. Parfois un acte manifeste de celles-ci
tend incontestablement à la réalisation du but allégué, au point de faire
supposer que cet acte est la conséquence d'un accord conclu en vue dudit but.
De plus, en contractant l'accord, chaque partie adopte tous ses complices en
qualité d'agents chargés de l'aider à en assurer la réalisation. Aussi en vertu
des principes relatifs au principal et à l'agent, tout acte accompli dans ce
but par l'un des agents peut-il être invoqué comme preuve contre l'auteur
principal. Cette théorie s'applique naturellement, dit l'auteur, à tous les
délits dans lesquels plusieurs personnes sont mises en cause.

[Page 639]

et non aux seuls procès pour complot.
Cette dernière proposition a été particulièrement approuvée par cette Cour dans
Koufis v. His Majesty the King 2.
Aussi bien, en droit, on ne peut reconnaître comme grief valide le fait que
dans un procès pour complot, un accusé soit dans l'obligation de faire face à
la preuve de l'offense substantive dont, cependant, il n'est pas accusé. Il
importe peu également que dans la description de l'offense substantive, comme
c'est le cas pour les offenses créées par l'article 471 , soit imposé à l'accusé
le fardeau de se justifier d'avoir commis des actes qui, sans cette justification,
sont tenus comme criminels. Ceux qui s'entendent pour commettre ces actes et
les commettent sont passibles d'être poursuivis pour complot et la théorie de
la loi sur le complot, aussi bien que sur les méthodes de preuve, demeure la
même. D'ailleurs, en l'espèce, il apparaît clairement du jugement de première
instance, que si le Juge a conclu à la culpabilité de l'accusé, ce n'est pas en
raison d'une simple absence de preuve de justification, mais en raison de la
présence au dossier d'une preuve positive qu'aucune autorité ou excuse légitime
ne couvrait les agissements de l'intimé et de ses complices, ou l'entente y
présidant. ""Il n'y a aucun doute"", dit le Juge en conclusion,
""que le 3 mars 1953, lorsque la police faisait irruption à Valcartier, elle
découvrait un repaire de faussaires.""

En présence de cette preuve de supercherie,
d'emploi de noms fictifs, de fausses représentations, pour voiler leur
participation dans l'obtention des matériaux requis à l'exécution de leur
entente, le Juge de première instance n'a pas ajouté foi aux motifs par eux
invoqués pour tenter de justifier cette entente et les actes en découlant. Le
Juge n'était pas lié, comme on semble vouloir l'impliquer au jugement a quo,
par les affirmations des Chavigny ou de l'intimé sur le point. Qu'un témoin
soit produit par la Couronne ou par l'accusé, peu importe, son témoignage peut
être accepté ou rejeté, en totalité ou en partie; et si, particulièrement,
certaines affirmations sont contredites ou sont suspectes au regard de toute la
preuve, on ne peut reprocher au Juge du procès de les avoir écartées.

[Page 640]

Au jugement de la majorité, on reproche aussi
au Juge de première instance et à la Couronne d'avoir refusé à l'accusé la
faculté de soumettre certains éléments de preuve. On admet, cependant, qu'on
""ne connaît ni l'étendue ni la valeur de ces preuves"". Sur le point,
l'intimé n'a pu nous éclairer et a éventuellement abandonné ce grief. Enfin,
s'il faut dire que c'est à bon droit que la Cour d'Appel a déclaré inadmissible
au dossier une certaine preuve apportée par Suzanne Perrault, il ne fait aucun
doute, aux raisons de jugement du Juge de première instance, que sans cette
preuve, ses conclusions eussent été les mêmes.

Je maintiendrais l'appel.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Sexual offence against
child—Evidence—Corroboration—Impotency and lack of opportunity pleaded but
found not true by trial judge—Whether corroboration of evidence of child.

The appellant was convicted of unlawful
sexual intercourse with his niece, a girl under 14 years of age. In his
defence, he alleged lack of opportunity and the fact that he was impotent. In
rebuttal, the girl’s older sister testified that the appellant had had sexual
intercourse with her a number of times, and the mother of the girls testified
that the appellant had admitted to her acts of intercourse with the older girl.
The trial judge held that the appellant’s statements as to opportunity and
impotence were false. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the conviction.

Held (Cartwright
and Nolan JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 710]

Per curiam: There
was evidence upon which it was open to the trial judge to find that the child
understood the nature and consequences of an oath and could therefore be sworn
in as a witness.

Per Taschereau,
Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: There was evidence from which the trial judge could
infer corroboration in law. Whether a false statement is or is not
corroboration must depend upon all the circumstances in a particular case. In
the present case, both the lack of opportunity and the physical incapacity to
commit the offence were material facts, either of which, if true, afforded a
complete defence to the charge. The nature of the false statements and the
circumstances in which they were made were such as could lead to an inference
in support of the evidence of the child.

Per Cartwright
and Nolan JJ. (dissenting): In all the circumstances of the case
at bar, the false statements could not in law be regarded as corroboration of
the evidence of the child. Evidence in corroboration must at the least be
independent evidence from which it results as a matter of inference that it is
more probable that the offence was committed by the accused than not. The false
statements were not evidence of that nature.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the
conviction of the appellant.

J.M. Reycraft, for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott
JJ. was delivered by:—

ABBOTT J.:—The relevant facts in this appeal are
fully set forth in the reasons of my brother Cartwright, which I have had the
advantage of considering.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
following questions of law:—

(1) Was there evidence on which it was open
to the trial judge to find that the child, Pearl Miller, understood the nature
and consequences of an oath and should be sworn as a witness?

(2) Was there any evidence to corroborate
the evidence of the child, Pearl Miller, in any material particular implicating
the accused?

(3) Did the trial judge admit inadmissible
evidence of the witness, John Miller, as to statements made to him by Helen
Miller in the absence of the appellant?

As to the first of these questions, I am
satisfied that there was evidence upon which it was open to the trial judge to
find as he did and this was the position taken by this Court

[Page 711]

at the hearing when it was indicated to counsel
for the respondent that he need not pursue his argument on this point.

The argument before us was directed principally
to the second question, that is to say, as to whether two false statements made
by the accused at the trial were, in the circumstances of this case, evidence
which in law could be corroborative. These two statements were[2] that the accused had no opportunity to
commit the offence because the complainant’s brother slept with him, and[3] that for several years he had been impotent
and therefore physically incapable of committing the offence. The Court below2
held that these false statements were evidence from which corroboration could
be inferred, relying upon the dictum of Lord Dunedin in Dawson v. McKenzie3,
which has been quoted by my brother Cartwright and which has been discussed and
applied in a number of subsequent cases, the most recent of which is Credland
v. Knowler[4].

Much could be said for the view that upon a
proper construction of the reasons given by the trial judge, he would have been
prepared to convict without corroborative evidence. Be that as it may I share
his view and that of the Court below that there was in law evidence from which
the trial judge could infer corroboration.

Whether a false statement is or is not
corroboration must, of course, depend upon all the circumstances in a
particular case. In the present case both lack of opportunity and physical
incapacity to commit the offence were material facts, either of which, if true,
afforded a complete defence to the charge laid. In my opinion the nature of the
false statements made by the accused and the circumstances in which they were
made were such as could lead to an inference in support of the evidence of the
child. As Taschereau J., speaking for the majority of the Court, said in Macdonald
v. The King[5]:

The behaviour of a witness as well as his
contradictory or untrue statements are questions of fact from which a jury may
properly infer corroboration.

[Page 712]

As to the third ground of appeal, I am satisfied
that the learned trial judge specifically rejected the evidence complained of.

Since in my opinion there is no error in the
judgment of the Court below, I would dismiss the appeal.

The dissenting judgment of Cartwright and Nolan
JJ. was delivered by:—

CARTWRIGHT J.:—On December 9, 1955, the
appellant was convicted before His Honour Judge Legris in the County Court
Judges’ Criminal Court of the County of Essex on the charge:—

That he on or about the 11th day of July,
in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five, at the
Township of Sandwich West, in the said County, did unlawfully have sexual
intercourse with Pearl Miller, a female person not his wife and under the age
of Fourteen years, contrary to the Criminal Code .

His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] was dismissed by a unanimous judgment delivered on February 14,
1956.

The appellant was granted leave to appeal to
this Court on the following questions of law:—

(1) Was there evidence on which it was open
to the trial judge to find that the child, Pearl Miller, understood the nature
and consequences of an oath and should be sworn as a witness?

(2) Was there any evidence to corroborate
the evidence of the child, Pearl Miller, in any material particular implicating
the accused?

(3) Did the trial judge admit inadmissible
evidence of the witness, John Miller, as to statements made to him by Helen
Miller in the absence of the appellant?

As to the first point, while the answers of the
witness Pearl Miller in the course of her examination by the learned trial
judge for the purpose of determining whether she should be sworn seem to me to
leave room for doubt as to whether she did in fact understand the nature and
consequences of an oath, some of her answers appear to indicate that she had
the necessary understanding; and I am unable to say that, as a matter of law,
there was no evidence on which it was open to the learned trial judge to find
as he did on this point.

In dealing with the second point it is first
necessary to refer briefly to the facts. Pearl Miller, with whom the offence
was alleged to have been committed, was born on

[Page 713]

February 2, 1943, and so
was 12 years and 5 months old at the date of the offence charged. She is a
daughter of the appellant’s wife’s sister. Her father died in 1948 and from
then until some time in 1955 the appellant made a home for her and her two
brothers and three sisters. She testified that she slept in one bedroom with
her two younger sisters and the appellant slept in another room, but that he
would from time to time get her to come into his bed. Her evidence, if
accepted, indicates that the offence had been committed; but when the Crown
closed its case there was no corroboration of her testimony.

The appellant gave evidence in defence. He
denied the charge explicitly and also testified (i) that he had for some years
been physically incapable of having sexual intercourse and (ii) that at the
relevant times John Miller, an elder brother of Pearl, had been sleeping in the
same bedroom as the appellant. He was asked in cross-examination if he had had
sexual intercourse with Helen, a sister of Pearl, who was born on April 2,
1938, and said he had never done so.

The defence then called John Miller who
testified that he slept in the appellant’s bedroom except during the summer
when he slept with his brother in the playhouse. In cross‑examination he
said that the appellant had told him that he had had intercourse with Helen
frequently prior to her leaving his house, which she did in February 1955.

In reply the Crown called Helen Miller who
testified that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with her a number of
times, particularly in December 1954 and January 1955. The Crown then recalled
Pearl’s mother, Mrs. Santarossa, who testified that in August 1955, after
the preliminary inquiry, she had had a conversation with the appellant. She was
asked what the conversation was and answered:—

Well, he told me about the Children’s Aid
taking the children and he told me that he did touch Helen and he said he was
sorry, but he said he didn’t touch Pearl.

In delivering judgment the learned trial judge
says in part:—

It is true the accused is not in good
health, but the several statements made by the accused and amongst others that
he was not able to have an erection is certainly not correct. It is not a true
statement. And again the statement that the playroom was only being used
accidentally, so to

[Page 714]

speak, is also not correct; it was used
through the summer months. Those are straight denials and clearly point to the
unreliability of the accused in respect of several statements. The further
admission which the accused made to Mrs. Santarossa at the time of the
police court hearing leaves no doubt that he has undoubtedly lied as to his
potency.

Taken as a whole, I believe that the facts
as they came out this morning are more than sufficient to give substantial corroboration
to the story given by Pearl, and so much so on the weakness of the
contradiction in the evidence of the accused and the impression that the
evidence of Pearl gave me, I would strongly feel justified in finding the
accused guilty without corroboration. In this case I am satisfied that there is
more than sufficient corroboration in the statements made by the witnesses
Helen and Mrs. Santarossa, and the contradiction by the accused himself in
his own evidence. Therefore, the only conclusion to which I can arrive is that
the accused is guilty as charged.

Counsel for the respondent argues that, in the
circumstances of this case, the learned trial judge having held on sufficient
evidence that the statements made by the appellant, (i) that he was impotent,
and (ii) that John Miller was sleeping in his bedroom at the relevant times,
were false, it was open to him to find corroboration in the fact of the
appellant having made such false statements.

Reliance is placed on the statement of Lord
Dunedin in Dawson v. McKenzie[7],
which was quoted by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario:—

Mere opportunity alone does not amount to
corroboration, but two things may be said about it. One is that the opportunity
may be of such a character as to bring in the element of suspicion. That is,
that the circumstances and locality of the opportunity may be such as in
themselves to amount to corroboration. The other is that the opportunity may
have a complexion put upon it by statements made by the defender which are
proved to be false. It is not that the false statement made by the defender
proves that the pursuer’s statements are true, but it may give to a proved
opportunity a different complexion from what it would have borne had no such
false statement been made.

Counsel for the respondent argues that, while
the facts, (i) that the appellant occupied a bedroom alone in the vicinity of
the room occupied by Pearl, and (ii) that the accused was proved to have been
potent six months prior to the date of the offence charged, would not in
themselves have amounted to any corroboration of Pearl’s story, the false
denials by the appellant of both of these facts could be regarded as
corroboration.

[Page 715]

In Credland v. Knowler[8], Lord Goddard L.C.J. discusses the case of Dawson
v. McKenzie, supra, and says in part at pages 54 and 55:—

I should be very sorry to lay down, and I
have no intention of laying down and I do not think any case has gone the
length of laying down, that the mere fact that an accused person has told a lie
can in itself amount to corroboration. It may, but it does not follow that it
must. If a man tells a lie when he is spoken to about an alleged offence, the
fact that he tells a lie at once throws great doubt upon his evidence, if he
afterwards gives evidence, and it may be very good ground for rejecting his
evidence, but the fact that his evidence ought to be rejected does not of
itself amount to there being corroboration.

* *
*

In other words, one has to look at the
whole circumstances of the case. What may afford corroboration in one case may
not in another. It depends on the nature of the rest of the evidence and the
nature of the lie that was told.

The question we have to decide is whether, in
all the circumstances of the case at bar, the two false statements, set out
above, made at the trial by the appellant could in law be regarded as
corroboration of the evidence of Pearl Miller. After an anxious consideration
of all the evidence I have reached the conclusion that they could not. Evidence
in corroboration must at the least be independent evidence from which it
results as a matter of inference that it is more probable that the offence
charged was committed by the accused than not. It is obvious from reading the
record that the accused was a man of little education and limited understanding
who protested his innocence and asserted that a false charge had been concocted
against him. His false statements at the trial could justify the learned judge
in refusing to believe his testimony but they do not, in my view, afford
corroboration. They do not, I think, give a different complexion to the
opportunity which was afforded by the fact of the appellant’s residence in the
same house as Pearl Miller. They are consistent with the panic of a man of
limited mental powers faced with so serious a charge and do not in themselves
warrant an affirmative inference of his guilt. In their nature the false
statements do not appear to me to differ from those in the case, put by my
brother Nolan during the argument, of an accused who sets up an alibi which is
proved to be false, a course which would seem to me to impeach the accused’s
veracity but not to strengthen the case of the prosecution.

[Page 716]

In Macdonald v. The King[9], the false statement of the accused,
referred to in the judgments, was made in connection with a meeting with a
number of other persons proved to be participants in the crime with which he
was charged; the fact of such meeting having taken place was in itself capable
of being regarded as corroborative of the evidence of the accomplices apart
from the making of the false statement.

I do not read the reasons of the learned trial
judge in the case at bar as asserting that he would, although fully conscious
of the danger of so doing, have convicted if he had concluded that there was no
corroboration; it was not necessary for him to direct his mind to that question
since in his opinion there was “more than sufficient corroboration”. In my
respectful view, the learned trial judge erred in law in holding that there was
corroboration in the evidence of Helen Miller and of Mrs. Santarossa and
consequently the conviction cannot be upheld.

This renders it unnecessary for me to deal with
the third point on which leave to appeal was granted.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OP APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law—Murder—Plea of self-defence and
drunkenness—Fist fight— Criminal Code , s. 201 (a) (i) and (ii).

The appellant was convicted of murder. His main defences bad
been self-defence, drunkenness and lack of intention to kill.

The evidence was that the appellant and the victim had, in a
deserted lane at about 2 a.m. on a very cold night, engaged in a drunken fist
fight; that the victim fell to the ground and was kicked by the appellant; that
while the victim was lying bleeding and unconscious, in below zero weather, the
appellant removed the victim’s coat, placed a leather belt around his head,
running it through the mouth and knotting it tightly behind the left ear, and
then abandoned him. The autopsy revealed numerous cuts on the head and a
depressed fracture of the skull. The lungs contained an abnormal amount of
blood.

The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, without
written reasons.

Held (Rand, Cartwright and Nolan JJ. dissenting), the
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: On the
uncontradicted evidence of medical and law enforcement officials and the
admittedly free and voluntary statements made by the appellant, the conclusion
is irresistible that, failing any defence that could arise from the evidence,
the appellant’s conduct throughout the entire transaction could only manifest
an intention either to cause the death of the victim or to cause the victim
bodily injury known to him to be likely to cause or accelerate death and being
reckless whether death ensued

[Page 724]

or not. It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty
to which one of the various injuries death could ultimately be attributed.
Whether the fracture of the skull was caused by the appellant, intentionally or
accidentally, what he did, once his victim had become unconscious, on the
medical evidence, accelerated death and there is no place for any speculation
as to what his intentions then were if they are to be measured by his actions.
Therefore, subject to the consideration of possible defences and assuming
particularly that the appellant was sane and sober, as the law presumes, there
could be no doubt that what he then did is only reasonably consistent with
either an intention to kill or to cause such bodily injury known to him to be
likely, in the circumstances, to cause or accelerate death, being reckless
whether death ensued or not. Subject to the consideration of possible defences,
whether such a killing by acceleration amounts to murder or manslaughter
depends whether, on the evidence, the case is one within s. 201(a) (i)
or (ii) of the Code.

The trial judge charged the jury as to insanity, provocation,
self-defence and drunkenness. These directions are unimpeached by the
appellant. Obviously, the jury reached the view that none of the defences was
made out. Having particularly failed to find that the appellant was drunk to
the extent required to support a defence of drunkenness, which was the main
defence here, there was no other verdict possible but the one rendered. There
was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

Per Locke J.: All the acts of the appellant must be
considered together and the matter cannot be limited to the blows which
presumably felled the victim.

There is no substance to the objection that the trial judge
made a finding in law that the appellant’s participation in the fight was an
unlawful act and a crime when the facts were in dispute. The facts were not in
dispute and assaulting another person is a criminal offence subject to the
exceptions explained in the charge.

Reading the charge as a whole, there was no misdirection for
the trial judge to say that the appellant was presumed to intend all the consequences
which might flow from the fight, even though he may not have known that the
victim received a fractured skull, and that he was thus presumed to be guilty
of murder, subject to possible defences. The necessity for proof of the intent
required by s. 201(a) of the Code was impressed on the jury.

The contention that the trial judge should have instructed the
jury that if the victim fell during the fight and fractured his skull on some
object it could amount to no more than manslaughter, cannot be entertained. If
the appellant struck the victim with his fists intending to kill him or cause
bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and being reckless whether
death ensued or not, it would be murder and not manslaughter.

The reading by the trial judge of s. 196 of the Code, coupled
with the reference to the condition in which the victim was left and the
instructions in the charge as a whole, was sufficient to dispose of the ground
that the trial judge failed to tell the jury under what circumstances it would
have been manslaughter under that section.

[Page 725]

The objection that the trial judge failed to instruct the
jury, that if they found that the appellant accelerated the death, under what
circumstances it would amount to manslaughter, ignores the instructions as to
whether the appellant had caused the death and as to his intent in assaulting
and leaving the victim gagged and unconscious in the snow.

The jury, finding that the appellant was capable of forming
the intent necessary to constitute the offence of murder, has by its verdict
found that he had formed that intent. No other finding was open to them upon
the evidence. No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.

Per Rand J. (dissenting): The brain contusion was the
vital physical fact and therefore the question of actual intent was of the
first importance. The charge confused the question of causing a homicide with
that of attributing to the appellant an intent or state of mind. If the
appellant knew nothing of the skull fracture or existing conditions that
coupled with a knockdown could cause it, it is impossible to see how anything
flowing from it could be considered to be within any legal presumption of
intention related to consequences, natural or unnatural. It was fatal to the
charge to omit the vital link of knowledge actual or imputed that could produce
such a natural consequence, as well as the intent to bring such an injury
about.

As to the supplementary cause of tying the belt and abandoning
the victim, which it was contended accelerated the death, the general verdict
makes it impossible to say whether the jury proceeded upon the one cause or the
other; and any finding by a court of appeal that the jury must have found guilt
on the one or the other might be based on the one that the jury rejected.
Furthermore, it cannot be seriously contested that the jury could have found in
favour of the appellant that this supplementary conduct had not been carried
out with ‘the intent of s. 259 of the old Code and that the passion of the
fight had not cooled. Nothing of this was contained in the charge and no Court
can usurp the function of the jury and make such a finding under s. 1014(2) of
the old Code.

Per Cartwright J. (dissenting): It was misdirection,
fatal to the -conviction, to tell the jury not that they might but that they
must find that the appellant had the intent required by s. 201(a) (i) or
(ii) of the Code unless they found that he was through drunkenness
incapable of forming the intent to cause death or to cause bodily injury that
he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.
It was for the jury, giving due weight to the rebuttable presumption which
imputes to a man an intention to produce those consequences which are the
natural result of his acts, to decide as a fact whether the appellant had the
guilty intent necessary to make him guilty of murder; and, in particular, it
was for them to say whether the fracture of the skull was a natural consequence
of any blow struck by the appellant.

n the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to say that
a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably must necessarily have
convicted the appellant of murder. It was open to them on the evidence to find
a verdict of manslaughter. On the other hand, it is not possible to say that
there was no evidence on which the jury might find a verdict of murder, and,
therefore, there should be a new trial.

[Page 726]

Per Nolan J. (dissenting): It was a fatal defect in the
charge of the trial judge to instruct the jury, as he did, that the appellant
was presumed to have intended the consequences which flowed from the fight,
even though he might not have known that the victim suffered a fractured skull,
and that an intent, as required by s. 201(a) (i) or (ii) of the Code,
must be attributed to him. It was for the jury to say whether the intent of
s. 201  was to be attributed to the appellant so as to justify a verdict of
murder; also to say whether the fracture of the skull was caused by a blow of
the appellant or by the victim falling on a pile of scrap iron nearby.

It was for the jury to determine whether, on the facts,
manslaughter or murder was the appropriate verdict and there is a doubt, which
must be resolved in favour of the appellant, that the verdict would necessarily
have been the same had no irregularity occurred.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba, affirming the conviction of the appellant for murder.

J. L. Crawford for the appellant.

A. S. Dewar for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—This
is an appeal from a unanimous judgment, delivered without written reasons by
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, affirming a verdict of murder rendered
against the appellant. The grounds of law, upon which leave to appeal to this
Court was granted, are all exclusively related to the address of the trial
judge to the jury. These grounds and all the material facts leading to the
conviction of the appellant, are set out in detail by other members of the
Court and need not therefore be recited here.

On a consideration of the uncontradicted evidence of medical
and law enforcement officials, who took charge of the case when the body of the
victim was found lying in a lane on the morning of January 6, 1955, and of the
admittedly free and voluntary statements made by the appellant, one is
irresistibly forced to the conclusion that, failing any defence susceptible to
flow from the evidence, the conduct of the appellant throughout the entire
transaction can only manifest an intention either to cause the death of the
person he killed or to cause to that person bodily injury known to him to be
likely to cause or accelerate death and being reckless whether death ensued or
not.

[Page 727]

In the course of the fight in which both were engaged in the
lane, around two o’clock of the night, the appellant gave a blow with his fist
to the deceased and the latter fell to the ground; the appellant then kicked
him; and knowing that the victim was lying unconscious, in that deserted lane,
at that hour of a very cold night—it being four degrees below zero—the
appellant removed the coat of his victim, placed a leather belt around his
head, running it through his mouth and knotting it tightly behind his left ear;
and he then abandoned his Unconscious victim, who was profusely bleeding, with
part of his body exposed.

No one suggests that without these and all the other
injuries inflicted on him by the appellant, Flatfoot would have died that day
from any other cause; indeed, the case was pleaded throughout on the basis that
the appellant himself caused the death of the victim. It is impossible to say
with any degree of certitude to which one of the various injuries then suffered
by the deceased death could ultimately be attributed. It is clear, however,
that even if the fracture of the skull was, as suggested by counsel for the
appellant, the result of the fall to the frozen ground or on some iron junk and
that this fracture was the primary cause of death, the victim did not die
immediately. He was still alive when the accused proceeded thereafter to tie
the belt around his head and through his mouth, to remove his coat and to
abandon him in this critical condition of unconsciousness and haemorrhage, in the
circumstances above described. In the opinion of Doctor Ross, “death was not
instantaneous but more prolonged” and exposure was a contributing cause. The
large quantity of blood found, in the morning, where the head of the body was
resting and which, while the appellant was kneeling close to the victim,
permeated parts of his clothes, does not suggest that the circulatory system
had immediately ceased to function. Whether the fracture of the skull was
caused by the appellant, intentionally or accidentally, what he actually did,
once his victim had become unconscious, on the medical evidence accelerated
death and there is no place for any speculation as to what his intentions then
were if they are to be measured by his actions. This was not an abandonment
devoid of significance nor the case of a hasty flight from the scene of the
crime. Subject to the consideration of possible defences

[Page 728]

which might arise from the evidence and assuming,
particularly, that the appellant was sane and sober, as he is presumed under
the law to have been unless the contrary is shown, there can be no doubt that
what he then did is only reasonably consistent with either an intention to kill
or to cause to the person he killed such bodily injury known to him to be
likely, in the circumstances, to cause or accelerate death, being reckless
whether death ensued or not. In Archbold’s Criminal Pleading, Evidence &
Practice, 32nd ed., it is stated at page 893 that:—

If a man is suffering from a disease, which in all
likelihood would terminate his life in a short time, and another gives him a
wound or hurt which hastens his death, this is such a killing as constitutes
murder (1 Hale 427), or at the least manslaughter.

In the case of Edmunds 1, the Lord Chief Justice, speaking
for the English Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 258:—

It is clear that if the injuries accelerated the death, the
question whether the deceased was in a weak state of health at the time they
were inflicted is immaterial, and that the appellant would be guilty of murder.

Under s. 199 of the Criminal Code :—

Where a person causes bodily injury to a human being that
results in death, he causes the death of that human being notwithstanding that
the effect of the bodily injury is only to accelerate his death from a disease
or disorder arising from some other cause.

The fact that such other cause would be, as in the
present case, attributable to the same person who accelerates the death does
not, in the eyes of the law, improve the position of the appellant.

Subject to the consideration of possible defences, whether
such a killing by acceleration amounts to murder rather than manslaughter
depends upon whether, on the evidence, the case is one within the provisions of
section 201 (a) (i) or (ii).

With respect to possible defences, the trial judge charged
the jury as to insanity, provocation, self-defence and drunkenness. These
directions are unimpeached by the appellant. It is the defence of drunkenness,
however, which in this case, was the defence of substance and indeed, on the
evidence, drunkenness was the crucial issue. While it may be said that, when
dealing generally with the presumption

[Page 729]

that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of
his act, certain statements of the charge could be objectionable, the same
matter was dealt with again, as it had to be, when the specific instructions
were given as to drunkenness and were then related to the provisions of section
201 (a) (i) or (ii). In this regard, the following instructions may be
quoted:—

If you decide that the accused caused the death of the
deceased, you must next decide, Did he mean to cause him bodily harm that he
knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or
not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused’s capacity to form
an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was
likely to cause death.

* * *

If you come to the conclusion that the accused was not
insane at the time the offence was committed, the question of drunkenness is
still a matter requiring careful consideration, because it affects the capacity
to form an intent and to know the consequences of his act. This involves a
careful consideration of all the evidence relating to drunkenness.

* * *

Then, if you decide he was drunk, you must decide if he was,
firstly, so drunk as to be insane; secondly, drunk to a lesser degree, but so
drunk as to be unable to form an intent about what he did or to appreciate the
consequences of his act; and thirdly, drunk, but not so drank as to be unable
to form such an intent. Upon any of these points if you: have a reasonable
doubt, the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt.

Now if you come to the conclusion that the accused was not
insane or so drunk as to be insane, then you must decide if he was so drunk as
to be unable to form an intent to commit the crime with which he is charged. If
on a full consideration of the evidence you conclude that he was in such a
state of drunkenness as to be unable to form such an intent or if you have a
reasonable doubt on the matter, then subject to the questions of self-defence
and provocation, which counsel for the accused really left me to deal with and
which I will have to deal with, you must find the accused not guilty of murder
but guilty of manslaughter.

The judge then reviewed exhaustively all the evidence
related to drunkenness and said:—

If you come to the conclusion that the accused’s condition
of drunkenness did not render him incapable of forming the intent to do what he
did, the intent to either cause the deceased’s death, or alternatively, the
intent to cause bodily harm and the inability to know the likely consequences,
he being reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of
murder. If you come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that
intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully
in self-defence.

And at the end:—

I want to remind you again when the accused came before this
Court he did so, as every accused does, with the presumption of innocence in ‘his
favour, and the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is upon the Crown
from the beginning to the end of the case. There is never any

[Page 730]

burden on the accused to prove his innocence. It is not
until the evidence is all in that a verdict can possibly be found. If the
evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, he is
entitled to the benefit of that doubt on every point that has to be decided.

From the verdict rendered, it is evident that the jury reached
the view that none of the defences upon which they were instructed was made
out. Having particularly failed to find that the appellant was drunk to the
extent required by law to support a defence of drunkenness, there was, in my
view, no other verdict possible but the one rendered by the jury. Whatever may
be the merits of all the points of law raised, there was, in view of the
evidence before the jury, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. I
agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The
appeal should be dismissed.

Rand J. (dissenting):—The
controlling question in this appeal is whether the charge dealt properly with
the matter of the intent of the accused.

The medical evidence presented by the Crown included that of
Dr. Ross, a pathologist, who had performed the autopsy. Besides two cuts in the
scalp to the bone each 1¼” to 1½” long and one above each ear he found a
star-shaped laceration 1¼” in diameter 1½” behind the left ear which led
to a fracture of the skull 2¼” below. The fracture held four bone fragments
covering an area of 1¼” by ¾”. These were raised or extended ¾” inside
the skull and into the brain which was lacerated and covered with blood. In the
doctor’s opinion the fracture was caused by external violence applied from
above downwards, a much greater force than would be required for the cuts above
the ears. The latter could have been caused by the kick of a boot shown to have
been worn by the accused, who admitted having kicked the deceased “a couple” of
blows. The doctor did not, however, believe that the stellated wound and
fracture had been caused by the toe of a boot. He described the kind of
instrument indicated by the form and character of the wound and fracture as
having a surface moderately sharp with a relatively blunt point like a
small-headed hammer or a very sharp rock. A scarf had been tied about the
deceased’s neck, but no evidence of constriction of the neck or of any
obstruction to the throat was found. A belt had been fastened around the head
covering the mouth or

[Page 731]

lips and its effect in relation to the death was
speculative. The motive behind either the scarf or belt is not clear. An
analysis of the blood showed 396 milligrams of alcohol concentrated in 100
milliliters of blood, indicating severe intoxication.

In his opinion several factors may have contributed to the
death. An exposure to four degrees below zero of a person so intoxicated could
itself have been fatal and that cause could have been accelerated by the brain
injury. Conversely the contusion of the brain was equally sufficient, and
probably aggravated by the alcoholic condition and the exposure:—

… the skull injuries were such ‘that they would render a
person unconscious, and being exposed to cold in this manner would result in
his death. A high blood level of that level would similarly render a person
unconscious and in similar exposure would be expected to cause his death.

He could not say which of the two had rendered the
deceased unconscious but Mr. Dewar agreed that it could be taken as the
fracture. It is not suggested that the other two scalp wounds or the abrasions
on the cheeks played any part in the death.

It can be seen, therefore, that the vital physical fact was
the brain contusion. It follows from the doctor’s description of the instrument
which might have caused it that if the deceased had been struck in the face and
had fallen backwards on a sharp stone or piece of metal, the fracture could
have resulted; and this possibility is strengthened by the direction taken by
the violence, downwards and inwards. There was, near the body, in a lane
leading to the rear of buildings, a pile of miscellaneous pieces of iron. The
accused with the deceased had walked from a restaurant to the lane; two others
who had been with them and were called as witnesses, following after, had
stopped in a vacant lot 40 or 50 yards from where the body was found and after
remaining there ten minutes or so had returned to the cafe. The movements of
the accused from midnight until 3.05 a.m. were fairly well covered by a number
of witnesses and nothing indicates the possession of an instrument that fits
the description given. There was snow on the ground covering the area. The time
taken up by the drinking and

[Page 732]

leading up to the quarrel was not considerable and Mr. Dewar
rather stressed the fact that the period between leaving the restaurant and
reaching the railway where the. accused entered a box car was within 45
minutes.

The charge did not deal with the iron pile as a condition
within the area in which the fight had taken place or whether or not the
accused was aware either of it or other objects scattered around that could
have been the means of such a fracture: and there can be little doubt that he
did not realize that such an injury had been suffered. The deceased was a well
built man, evidently in good health, probably around thirty-five or forty years
of age. The accused is thirty-seven and likewise seems well set up. Both had
been drinking beer and alcohol. From an earlier incident the same night, the
deceased seemed easily provoked although on that occasion easily mollified. What
in fact took place between them was a brutal drunken brawl.

The question, then, of actual intent became of the first
importance. In the course of the charge, the trial judge used the following
language:—

In considering whether an accused is capable of having the
intent to cause death or of having the intent to cause bodily harm, and being
reckless whether death ensues or not, and knowing that the bodily harm done is
likely to cause death, we start with two presumptions of law.… The second
presumption of law you have to consider is that every man is presumed to have
intended the natural consequences of his acts, and therefore, for example,
where one man deliberately shoots a gun at another, an intent to cause death,
or at least to cause bodily harm likely to cause death, will be presumed.

* * *

The injury (the fracture) was sustained in the fighting; the
accused is presumed to intend the consequences of his own act, subject to
drunkenness or provocation, which I have to deal with later, so that if this
deceased sustained that injury in the course of that fight, then the accused
must be considered to have intended all the consequences of his acts on that
occasion, subject to what I will say later about other possible defences.

* * *

If you decide that the accused caused the death of the
deceased, you must next decide, Did he mean to cause him bodily harm that be
knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or
not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused’s capacity to form
an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was
likely to cause death.

Other passages emphasized “capacity” to the same
effect. In none of them is any distinction made between what is meant by the “natural
consequences” as related to the

[Page 733]

direct or indirect cause of death in fact and as
related to the intention made responsible for death. What the language used
embraces is the consequence of death regardless of hidden and unappreciated
causes. So stated it means that the legal presumption would hold the accused,
because of the illegal fighting, to have intended to bring about the death by
the fracture and the injury to the brain, an intention which, assuming him to be
capable of forming it, the jury were told they must attribute to him.

This, with the greatest respect, confuses the question of
causing a homicide with that of attributing to the accused an intent or state
of mind. Under the Code as at common law the person whose act with its
consequences operating directly or indirectly in fact do bring about a death is
looked upon as the cause of it and in the earliest days that itself was
sufficient to attract legal responsibility. In the course of years this was
modified and under the Code the classification of the stages of homicide
leading from the actual cause to the final liability for murder or manslaughter
is clearly set out. Section 250 of the former Code defines “homicide” in
the sense I have indicated. Next is a subdivision into “culpable” or “not
culpable”, with the latter of which we are not concerned. Culpable homicide is “the
killing of any person either by an unlawful act or by an omission”, s. 252(2),
and is either murder or manslaughter. Section 259 proceeds to the definition of
murder and in s. 260 it becomes associated as an incidental consequence with
the commission of certain other crimes. By s. 252, culpable homicide, not,
within those two sections, amounting to murder, is manslaughter, which is
therefore the residual aggregate of acts of culpable homicide. The Code following
the common law, does not expressly distribute mens rea to all cases of
manslaughter; for example, “unlawful acts” still remain a not wholly determined
area, the nearest pronouncement being that of the House of Lords in Andrews v.
Director of Public Prosecutions 2.

Assuming that the death here was a culpable homicide, the
first and essential inquiry is whether it comes within the two sections dealing
with murder. Applicable to the facts, there is, by s. 259(a), the
specific intent to cause the

[Page 734]

death, and (b) that the offender “means to cause to
the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be
likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not”. If, in
this case, the fracture was caused by the fall backwards on a sharp point of
iron, it is not suggested by the Crown that the presence of such a means of
injury was shown to be within the knowledge of the accused, much less that he
intended to cause bodily injury by that means. Then in s. 260 the other crimes
out of which murder may arise are specifically named but they do not include a
mutual battery, to which the language, “means to inflict grievous bodily injury
for the purpose of facilitating the commission of” an offence named or his
flight thereafter, is inapplicable. Finally s. 261 reduces the act that would
otherwise be murder to manslaughter if it is inflicted in the heat of passion
aroused by provocation. But in the absence of knowledge of the iron or other
object there was nothing to/bring the case within the provisions of ss. 259 and
260 unless the intent was connected with the blow of the fist or the kicking
and, apart from the fact that if these had been done in the passion of the
fight an intent to kill would not have converted the offence into murder, that
either could have caused the death, a view rejected by the medical evidence, is
not contended.

The charge then never really put to the jury the substantial
defence. If the accused knew nothing of the skull fracture nor existing
conditions that coupled with a knockdown could cause it, I am quite, unable to
see how anything flowing from it could be considered to be within any legal
presumption of intention related to consequences, natural or unnatural. As put
to the jury, the only question to be considered was the mental capacity of the
accused to appreciate such a sequence of events and such a result, a capacity
which I will assume him to have had; but that omitted the vital link of
knowledge actual or imputed that could produce such a “natural consequence”, as
well as the intent to bring such an injury about. This, in my opinion, was a
fatal omission which vitiated the charge.

These considerations deal with what may be called the
primary acts which brought about the death. A subsidiary or supplementary
cause, distinct and separate from the former, is suggested in the tying of the
belt around the head

[Page 735]

of the deceased, the possible effect of which I have
mentioned, and the flight of the accused, thereby abandoning the victim, drunk
and unconscious, in a remote spot, in early morning and zero weather. These
acts, it is said, “accelerated” the death, as on the evidence they might have
been found to have done so, and are to be held themselves conclusively to
constitute acts of murder.

Assuming that flight, after knocking down in a mutual fight
a person who, through a hidden cause, is rendered unconscious, can be looked
upon as a new and felonious act, and assuming also that the charge sufficiently
differentiated between these two groups of facts as independent causes, it is
obvious that from the general verdict found it is impossible to say whether the
jury proceeded upon the one or the other; and any finding by a court in appeal
that the jury must have found guilt on the one or the other might be on that
which the jury rejected.

But there is still graver objection to such a step. This
supplementary conduct to be brought within s. 259 must have been carried out
with the intent of bringing about death or was such as to be known by the
accused to be likely to cause death and was done recklessly as to its result.
It must further be found that before being done there had been time for the
passion of the fight to have cooled. That these facts could have been found in
favour of the accused cannot, in my opinion, be seriously contested. Nothing of
this was contained in the charge and it would be a usurpation of the function
of the jury for any Court to make, as we are asked by the Crown under s.
1014(2) of the Code to make, such a finding on this part of the issue.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

Locke J.:—This
is an appeal brought pursuant to leave from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba, dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from his
conviction for murder, after a trial before the Chief Justice of Queen’s Bench
and a jury.

The five questions of law upon which leave to appeal was
granted are stated in other reasons to be delivered in this matter and I do not
repeat them.

[Page 736]

It is necessary for a proper consideration of this matter to
consider in detail the facts which were proven in evidence at the trial. So far
as they are relevant they were as follows:—

At about 2.15 of the morning of January 6, 1955, the
appellant left the St. Louis Café, a small restaurant situated on Higgins
Avenue in Winnipeg, a short distance east of Main Street, in company with an
Indian, August Flatfoot, and two other men, by name Jorundson and Bard. The
appellant and the Indian had been drinking intermittently during the previous
evening and earlier that morning. Both had been drinking a mixture of rubbing
alcohol and some soft drink and, to the restaurant keeper who saw them at the
time, Flatfoot appeared drunk. The four men separated shortly after leaving the
place, the appellant and Flatfoot announcing they were going to get some more
alcohol and walked together east on Higgins Avenue. Jorundson and Bard said
they would wait for them and, according to them, after waiting a few minutes,
the other two not returning, they left to go to a place where they might spend
the night.

At about 7 o’clock that morning the body of Flatfoot was
found lying in a lane running east and west, south of and parallel to Higgins
Avenue. Macdonald Avenue lies to the south of Higgins Avenue and runs parallel
to it and the body was found lying face downward in the snow at the rear of 107
Macdonald Avenue, which is approximately opposite to the rear of 154½ Higgins
Avenue. Later that day the appellant was apprehended at St. Malo, a village
south of Winnipeg, and brought by an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police to that city and lodged in the jail.

Early the following morning the appellant, after being
properly warned, made a statement to the police which was admitted in evidence
at the trial. When he was informed by Detective Hinton that he might be charged
with the murder of Flatfoot, he said first that “It was self-defence” and then
dictated a statement which was taken down by the detective and, after having
been read over, signed by the

[Page 737]

appellant. His statement, after reciting his movements up to
the time he had gone to the restaurant and met Flatfoot and the other two,
said:—

Gus and me kidded each other along, and then we tossed up
for the coffees and Gus lost, so he bought for the four of us. Then we went
down Higgins Ave., you know that lot at the back of the terraces there. We
started drinking there, then Gus started swearing at me. I guess I swore at him
too, and then he pushed me. I got mad and we started to fight. The other two
guys walked away. Gus hit me about three or four times. He gave me one right in
‘the mouth. I got a couple of scratches. I hit him with my left. I got in a
few, but I hurt my hand. You can see it’s all swollen. Gus fell down and I
kicked him a couple. I guess it was self-defence. Then I fell down, that’s when
I got the blood on my pants. I put his scarf around his neck because he was
unconscious, and I thought he might get cold. I put the belt around his head
loose. I guess I thought it would do some good.

Some two hours afterwards, Detective Hinton, with
another officer, after again properly warning the appellant, asked him what had
happened to the coat Flatfoot was wearing and he then said:—

After the fight, Gus was lying on the ground, he had his
coat half on, so I guess I took it off him. I put it under my arm. I had it
with me in the gravel car. I was using it to sit on and that and I left it in
the car when I got off the train.

When brought to the police station on the afternoon of the
previous day, the condition of his clothing and of his body had been examined
by Inspector Webster of the city police force. The left leg of his trousers was
stained at the knee and the underwear worn by him was stained in the same
place, and the stains were shown to have been caused by blood. The appellant’s
left hand was badly swollen from the base of his fingers to the wrist and there
were three slight scratches on his face. There was no evidence of any other
physical injury.

The body of Flatfoot was lying with the head to the north,
the feet being 4 feet distant from the back of a shed at the rear of 107
Macdonald Avenue. The conditions existing at the place were observed by police
officers Edwards, Booden and Scott and photographs were taken before the body
was moved. The coroner, Dr. Fryer, was summoned, arriving at 7.40 a.m. and,
after examining the body, pronounced life to be extinct. He gave in evidence
some account of its condition and attempted to estimate the time of death
which, he thought, had been some time

[Page 738]

between 1 and 3 o’clock that morning. The man was not
wearing an overcoat, his trousers had been ripped down from the waist to the
crotch, both back and front, and his buttocks were partly exposed. A leather
belt obviously taken from the body of the victim ran through the man’s mouth
and was tightly knotted behind his left ear. The hands were bare and the arms
and the eyelids were frozen. It was 4° below zero and there was no wind. To
what extent the rest of the body was frozen was not stated by the coroner. He
observed the wounds on the head which were more closely described by Dr. Ross,
a pathologist, who later the same day conducted a post mortem.

A plan prepared by Constable Scott, from measurements made
by him, before the body was moved, showed the width of the lane to be 18 feet.
Its northern limit lay 82 feet to the south of the southerly limit of Higgins
Avenue, the southerly limit being the same distance from Macdonald Avenue.
Billboards erected opposite the place on the south side of Higgins Avenue
obstructed the view from that street. The evidence of the constables and the
photographs taken by the photographer Allison show that, a short distance to
the east of the head and shoulders of the man as he lay on the snow and at a
lesser distance to the east of his buttocks, there were large patches of what
they assumed to be, and was proven to be, blood Flatfoot’s hair, which was long
and thick, was matted with blood which had come from three cuts on his head,
one over each of the ears and one at the back behind the left ear, and there
was blood on the back of his clothing. Between the place where the body was
lying and the rear of the shed above referred to, there was what was described
and which appears from the photographs to have been a quantity of metal and
other junk, including what appears to be an old carriage wheel, part of a metal
bed and some other miscellaneous material. Snow had drifted over the lower part
of this junk.

In the back yard of 154½ Higgins Avenue, a hat which proved
to be that of Flatfoot was found at a distance of 30 feet from his body.

Around the place where the body was lying, the snow had been
trampled. The photographs of the snow drifted against the pile of junk do not
indicate that it had been

[Page 739]

trampled or that there were any bloodstains on it, and there
is no suggestion in the oral evidence that there was any blood found on this
snow, or on the junk itself.

The nature of the injuries to the body of the deceased man
was described by Dr. H. M. Ross, who performed the post mortem. Over the
right ear there was a cut 1½ inches long, the edges of this were sharp and it
had cut through the tissues right to the bone. A somewhat similar cut 1½ inches
in length was found above the left ear, of the same nature as the one first
described. An inch and a half behind the left ear there was what the witness
described as “a similarly-sized laceration except that it was more star-shaped
in that it had a number of other cuts coming from it”. Altogether it was 1½
inches across. The examination disclosed in the immediate neighbourhood of this
last injury a fracture of the back part of the skull, the bone having been
broken inwards. This the doctor described as a depressed fracture of the skull
and the brain in that region was covered with blood and lacerated. Dr. Ross
considered that this injury had been “caused by external violence applied at
this point above—downwards”. In addition to these very serious injuries, there
were various minor abrasions on both cheeks but these were not through the skin
and, some of them at least, he considered had been caused some days prior.

Since the appellant had admitted that he had kicked Flatfoot
after the latter had fallen down, the doctor was asked whether, in his opinion,
the serious injuries could have been caused in this way. As to this, he said,
after being shown the shoes worn at the time by the appellant, that he
considered they could have caused the cuts above the ears but, as to the injury
behind the left ear where the fracture was, he said:—

The toe of a boot I do not believe in one blow could make
all the various branches that this particular wound had.

Later, on cross-examination, he said that he did not
believe the skull fracture had been caused by the shoes. It was suggested to
him that if a man hit in the face by another fell in a junk pile of iron of
various sizes he might receive such an injury, and to this he said it was quite
possible.

[Page 740]

The post mortem was conducted in the afternoon of
January 6. Earlier that day, the belt fastened through the mouth and knotted at
the back of the head had been removed and this had left what the doctor
described as a white mark and a depression on either side of the mouth about
three-quarters of an inch wide which, he considered, could have been caused by
the belt. Further examination disclosed that the lungs were greatly congested
and contained an abnormal amount of blood which suggested to him that death had
not been instantaneous. The examination of the blood disclosed a very high
level of alcohol and Dr. Ross said he would expect that the man had been
suffering from “severe intoxication”.

Whether the way in which the belt was in the man’s mouth
prevented him from breathing through it is not made clear, either by the
evidence or the photographs. Dr. Ross was asked as to the effect it would have
on causing or expediting death and he said:—

I detected only the marks. I had no knowledge, other than a
photograph I was shown, that there was a constriction about the mouth. In a
person dying of asphyxiation, as occurs in a number of unconscious persons when
their tongue and the soft tissues fall backwards and block the airway, it is
entirely possible. … The more unconscious a person is, the more likely it is
that it could be aggravated by pressure over the mouth. Similarly, if a person
were depending on breathing, for some reason or other, by mouth breathing, then
similarly that would obstruct it. The determinations [sic] of the
tissues in this particular area were such and the number of effects were such
that I cannot state that this patient [sic] died only of asphyxiation.

Q. But it might interfere with him if he were in the depths
of a coma?

A. Yes.

And later he said:—

In this precise case I believe that there was some evidence
of asphyxial changes in the tissues, but I will not state as to the degree to
which they influenced the death.

Asked for his conclusion as to the cause of death, Dr.
Ross said:—

I felt that there were a number of factors contributing to
death in this case. The contusion of the brain as the result of the depressed
fracture of the skull would be probably the most important, but I have seen
people with such an injury survive for a considerable period of time. There was
evidence of considerable loss of blood but I was unable to estimate how much or
how severe that was, but the amount of blood in the scalp and the numerous
injuries to the scalp would contribute, would be expected to cause the loss of
considerable blood. There was the level of

[Page 741]

blood alcohol, which is a very serious level of alcohol and
would certainly aggravate other serious conditions. There was evidence that the
breathing would be possibly obstructed to a certain extent and that the
congestion of the lungs and the other observations I made in the internal
organs would suggest that the subject wasn’t getting all the air into his lungs
that he should.

Asked again as to the effect of the belt on obstructing
the passage of air, he said:—

If he depends on air coming through his mouth it would
interfere with it. If the belt so applied pressed the jaw upwards and caused
the soft tissues of the back of the mouth, the palate, to close the airway,
then it would, too, but it is difficult for me to state from a picture what
would happen.

When asked if a person suffering from such a fracture
of the skull and contusion of the brain were exposed to the elements in cold
weather what effect it would have, he said that it would greatly accelerate the
deleterious effect.

The clothing found on the appellant when he was arrested was
examined by Dr. D. W. Penner, and the stains on the trousers and underwear were
found to have been caused by human blood. As stated in the confession, Bradley
had removed Flatfoot’s overcoat and this he took with him on to the freight
train which he boarded immediately afterwards, by which means he reached
Dufrost, a place on the Winnipeg-Emerson line not far from St. Malo. For
obvious reasons, he got rid of this coat en route, throwing it
apparently on the railway right-of-way where it was found by the section
foreman near Grande Pointe, a few stations north of the point where Bradley
left the train. This was a brown tweed overcoat and there were a large number
of reddish brown stains over most of the back and the lower half of the right
arm as well as a number of stains over the front of the shoulder on the right
side, all of which Dr. Penner found to have been caused by human blood.

It appears that Bradley had been arraigned for the offence
at an earlier date and had been then found mentally unfit to stand trial. At
the outset of the present trial the question of whether he was then so unfit
was tried and evidence given by alienists and he was found fit. It was
undoubtedly because of this and of the fact that the appellant had been
drinking heavily that night that the learned Chief Justice felt it necessary to
explain at some length in the charge to the jury the effect of s. 16 of the Code
and

[Page 742]

instruct them that excessive drinking might produce a
condition such as delirium tremens which, if it existed, might be a defence
to the charge.

The argument addressed to us on this appeal has invited us,
in effect, to consider the sufficiency of certain passages in the charge to the
jury as if the affair which resulted in the death of Flatfoot had been limited
to the blows which the appellant struck with his fist and which presumably
felled the victim. The matter cannot be split up in this way but all of the
acts of the appellant above recited must be considered together. A contention
that a charge of homicide might be dealt with in the manner suggested to us was
recently rejected by the Judicial Committee in Meli v. The Queen 3.

The first ground of appeal is a contention that the learned
Chief Justice erred “in making a finding in law that the appellant’s
participation in the fight was an unlawful act and a crime when the facts were
in dispute”. The short answer to this is that the facts were not in dispute and
that assaulting another person is a criminal offence subject to exceptions
which were fully explained in later portions of the charge. I do not know what
is meant by alleging error in treating the unlawful act as a felony. The distinction
between felony and misdemeanour was abolished by s. 14  of the Criminal Code  (R.S.C.
1927, c. 146). I find no substance in this objection.

The second ground is that the learned trial judge had erred
in saying that the appellant was presumed to intend all the consequences which
might flow from the fight, even though he may not have known that Flatfoot had
suffered a fracture of the skull and that he was thus presumed to be guilty of
murder, subject to possible defences. The contention is based upon the
following portion of the charge:—

The accused didn’t have to know whether the injury was
sustained in that way. The injury was sustained in the fighting; the accused is
presumed to intend the consequences of his own act, subject to drunkenness or
provocation, which I have to deal with later so that if this deceased sustained
that injury in the course of that fight, then the accused must be considered’
to have intended all the consequences of his acts on that occasion, subject to
what I will say later about other possible defences.

[Page 743]

The charge is to be considered as a whole: the passage
quoted is not to be divorced from the context. At the outset, after explaining
in a manner to which no exception is or could properly be taken what
constitutes homicide, culpable and non-culpable, and reading to the jury ss.
196, 199 and 201(a) of the Code, the learned judge, referring to
the expressions “means to cause his death” and “means to cause him bodily harm
that he knows is likely to cause his death” in the latter subsection, said:—

By using this expression the Code makes it clear that
the person charged must have intended to do the act complained of; that is, he
must have intended to cause the death of the deceased or he must have intended
to cause the bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death, at the
same time being reckless whether death ensues or not.

And later said:—

When we are considering intention, the intention that we are
considering here is the intention to commit the crime with which the accused is
charged.

In a following passage, which preceded the language
complained of, the jury was informed that there was a presumption of law that
every man is presumed to have intended the natural consequences of his acts
and, by way of example, that when a man deliberately shoots a gun at another,
an intent to cause death, or at least bodily harm likely to cause death, will
be presumed, a statement which was followed by instructions that the
presumption would not apply if on all the evidence there was a reasonable doubt
that the accused was capable of having the intent either to cause death or to
cause some bodily harm known to him to be likely to cause death in reckless
disregard of the consequences.

Following that portion of the charge first above quoted, the
evidence of Dr. Ross as to the factors which, in his opinion, contributed to
the man’s death, and the evidence as to the condition in which Flatfoot had
been left by the appellant was reviewed and the jury were instructed that, if
they decided that he had caused the death, they must then decide if he had
meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was
reckless as to whether death ensued or not. Thus the necessity of proof of the
intent required by s. 201 (a) was again impressed on the jury.

[Page 744]

Thereafter, the circumstances under which a person
unlawfully assaulted may repel force by force, even though he causes
death or grievous bodily harm, dealt with in s. 34 of the Code was
explained and the nature of the provocation that may reduce what would
otherwise be murder to manslaughter under s. 203.

The fight referred to in the passage complained of was not
intended to refer merely to the blows struck while Flatfoot was still on his
feet but everything that occurred up to the time that the appellant left him
unconscious face down in the snow.

While the second ground of objection was based upon the
passage from the charge to which I have referred, a further passage has been
said to be open to a similar objection. The learned Chief Justice dealt at
length with the evidence as to the condition of. both the appellant and of
Flatfoot as a result of their drinking, apparently considering that this raised
the question as to whether the condition of the appellant was such as to render
him unable to form the intent referred to in s. 201 (a). Following this,
the learned judge said:—

If you come to the conclusion that the accused’s condition
of drunkenness did not render him incapable of forming the intent to do what he
did, the intent to either cause the deceased’s death, or alternatively, the
intent to cause bodily harm and the inability to know the likely consequences,
he being reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of
murder. If you come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that
intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully
in self-defence.

This language must be read with the instructions twice
repeated that they must find that in fact he had intended to cause the death or
meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and being
reckless whether death ensued or not. It cannot be assumed, in my opinion, that
the jury would disregard these specific instructions twice theretofore
repeated.

Read in conjunction with other portions of the charge to
which I have referred, there was, in my opinion, no misdirection.

The third question arises from a contention that there was
error in failing to instruct the jury that if the deceased fell during the
course of the fight and fractured his skull on some object “it would be
unintentional and could amount

[Page 745]

to no more than manslaughter”. To so instruct the jury would
clearly be misdirection since, if the appellant struck Flatfoot with his fists
intending to kill him or cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause
death and being reckless whether death ensued or not, it would be murder and
not manslaughter. The point itself illustrates the manner in which this Court
has been asked to deal with the appeal by considering only the offence of
striking the blows which caused Flatfoot to fall and ignoring all the rest of
the evidence. The jury were required to consider all of this evidence in coming
to a conclusion on the question of intent.

As to the fourth question, the learned Chief Justice had, as
stated, after referring to the condition in which Flatfoot had been left by the
appellant, read s. 196 to the jury. With this I think no further instruction
was needed than that given in the charge read as a whole to which I have
already made reference.

The fifth ground asserts that there was error in failing to
instruct the jury that, if they found the appellant accelerated the death of
the deceased, under what circumstances it would amount to manslaughter and not
to murder. The question ignores the instructions to which I have referred,
which put the questions as to whether the appellant had caused the death of the
deceased and as to his intent in assaulting the accused in the manner described
and leaving him gagged and unconscious in the snow. There was no error, in my
opinion.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal was heard by a court
consisting of the Chief Justice of Manitoba, Coyne, Montague and Schultz JJ.A.
and Tritschler J. (ad hoc) and dismissed, no written reasons being
delivered. We are, therefore, not informed as to whether the Court acted on the
ground that no error had been shown in the proceedings or under the powers
vested in it by s. 592(1) (b) (iii) on the ground that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.

If there was error in the charge on any question of law (and
in my opinion there was none), the application of that section should be
considered.

[Page 746]

The evidence before the jury may be summarized as follows:
the accused had admitted striking Flatfoot with his fists, that the latter had
fallen down and that he had then kicked him and “put the belt around his head
loose” while the man was unconscious, and had thereafter removed his overcoat
and taken it away. He said that he had also fallen down and that he had then
got the blood on his pants. The deep cuts inflicted on both sides of the victim’s
head had obviously been caused by blows of some nature when the man was
prostrate on the ground. The three police officers who described the manner in
which the deceased was found lying prostrate, and the places where they
observed the snow to be stained with blood, said nothing about finding any
blood or any evidence of a struggle on any of the junk a few feet distant from
the body or upon the snow with which it was partially covered. In
cross-examination, they were not asked any question as to whether there were
any traces of a struggle or any blood found on or around the pile of junk. The
photographs taken by the photographer Allison, showing the man’s body lying as
it was found and and patches of blood already referred to, disclosed no
bloodstains on the snow which partly banked the pile of junk or any of the
miscellaneous material in the pile. The coroner who also attended before the
body was moved said nothing about seeing any evidence of struggle on or close
to the junk pile and it was not suggested to him in cross-examination that
there was any.

The belt had apparently been forcibly removed from the man’s
body, one of the loops holding it in place on the trousers and some buttons
torn off the buckle of the belt, and the clothing had been ripped in the manner
described leaving his buttocks partially bare. The photographs showed that the
belt, contrary to what the accused said in his statement to the police, was
tightly tied about the head, knotted behind the left ear and passed between the
man’s lips holding them apart: Whether the belt completely stopped the passage
of air through the mouth or only did so partially does not appear to be clear
either in the oral evidence or in the photographs, but it would completely
prevent him from crying out. The man had bled profusely from his head wounds
and his hair was matted with blood. His hat had been thrown over the fence into
the back yard

[Page 747]

of 154½ Higgins Avenue, 30 feet from the place where he lay.
The view from Higgins Avenue was shut off by the billboards to which reference
has been made. It was 4° below zero when the body was found at 7 o’clock. No
evidence was given as to the temperature around 2 o’clock but in
cross-examination by counsel for the defence a question was directed to one of
the medical witnesses which was based on the assumption that the temperature
was the same at the earlier hour, and this appears to be common ground. The man’s
hands were bare and the body was at least partially frozen. Flatfoot had not
apparently died at once after receiving the injuries to his head since, when
his body was moved from the place where it lay face downward, the snow was
glazed with ice to some extent, showing that the heat of his body had caused
some melting.

That the deep cuts on either side of the victim’s head had
been caused by kicks delivered by the appellant was settled by the confession
since there were no injuries to the man’s body elsewhere than in the head. That
a kick delivered by a powerful man to the side of the head, sufficient to cause
the deep cuts, would render a man senseless, if he were not already in that
condition, would be obvious. Whether these kicks were delivered before or after
the wound to the back of the head was known only to the appellant and he
elected not to give evidence. While Dr. Ross had at first said, as above
pointed out, that he did not believe a blow of the toe of a boot could cause
this latter wound and, later, that he did not believe it had been caused by
the, shoes, that was a matter upon which the jury were at complete liberty to
form their own opinion. There was no evidence to suggest that it had been
caused by the man falling backwards on the pile of junk and the only evidence
available would seem to negative any such suggestion. In view of the profuse
bleeding from the wound, it would inevitably have been the case that had
Flatfoot fallen backward on the pile there would have been evidence of that
fact to be found in the snow and on the junk itself. The jury might properly
assume that if there had been any blood or other evidence of struggle on or around
the pile; the police officers, in fulfilment of their duty, would have
disclosed the fact and that the photographer would have

[Page 748]

been directed to take further photographs, and further, that
the three police officers, the photographer and the coroner would have been
cross-examined to establish the fact that there were such traces, if that were
the fact or if that was even suggested on behalf of the accused person.

The photographs showed that the belt was fastened so tightly
through the man’s mouth and around his head that considerable force must have
been exercised in tying the knots behind his ear. The belt could only have been
tied tightly in this position while the man lay face downward in the snow. The
blood which had saturated the appellant’s trousers around his left knee, and
the underwear at that place, was the blood of Flatfoot and it was an inference
which the jury might properly draw that the appellant had knelt on the man’s
back while tying the knots in the belt and that the blood came from the wound
at the back of the skull. The knots so firmly tied, as shown by the
photographs, were only a few inches from the place where the skull was
fractured. While, in my opinion, in view of the other injuries inflicted and
the condition in which the man was left helpless in the snow, it is a matter of
no consequence as to whether the appellant did or did not know the severity of
this particular wound, the jury may well have considered that since in tying
the knots he would be looking directly at the wound (unless, indeed, it was
inflicted after the knots were tied) the severity of it would be obvious to
him.

Had the jury concluded that that particular injury had been
caused in fact in the manner suggested in argument, that would not of itself have
reduced the offence to manslaughter. There was still the question as to the
intent with which the blows with the fists had been struck and the intent with
which thereafter the appellant had inflicted the cuts on either side of the man’s
head, torn his clothing leaving part of his body exposed, knotted the belt
around his head, removed his overcoat and left him unconscious in an
unfrequented place where it was improbable that he would be found until
daylight. The jury, finding that the appellant was capable of forming the
intent necessary to constitute the offence of murder, has by its verdict found
that

[Page 749]

he had formed that intent. In my opinion, no other finding
was open to them upon the evidence. I find no evidence of any wrong or
miscarriage of justice in this case.

I would dismiss this appeal.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):—On November 2, 1955, the appellant was convicted before
Williams C.J.Q.B. and a jury of having, on January 6, 1955, murdered August
Flat-foot. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was heard on February
8, 1956, and was dismissed, at the conclusion of the argument, by a unanimous
judgment for which no written reasons were given.

On February 27, 1956, my brother Kellock made an order
granting the appellant leave to appeal to this Court on the following grounds:—

1. That the learned Trial Judge erred in making a finding in
law that the Appellant’s participation in the fight was an unlawful act and a
crime, when the facts were in dispute, and in treating the unlawful act as a
felony.

2. That the learned Trial Judge erred in charging the jury
to the effect that the Appellant was presumed to intend all the consequences
which might flow from the fight even though he, the Appellant, may not have
known that the deceased suffered a fracture to the skull in a fall during the
course of the fight and was thus presumed to be guilty of murder, subject to
other possible defences.

3. That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to instruct
the Jury that if the deceased fell during the course of the fight and fractured
his skull on some object, it would be unintentional, and could amount to no
more than manslaughter.

4. That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to instruct
the Jury that if they found, under Section 196  of the Criminal Code  of Canada,
that the Appellant caused the death of the deceased, either directly or
indirectly, under what circumstances the Appellant would be guilty of
manslaughter and not of murder.

5. That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to instruct
the Jury that if they found the Appellant accelerated the death of the
deceased, under what circumstances it would amount to manslaughter and not to
murder.

As, in my view, there should be a new trial I will refer to
the evidence only so far as may be necessary to make clear the reasons for the
conclusion at which I have arrived.

The appellant did not give evidence at the trial and no
witnesses were called by the defence.

The body of August Flatfoot, hereinafter called “the
deceased” was found at about 7 a.m. on January 6, 1955, in

[Page 750]

a lane in the City of Winnipeg. A post mortem examination,
performed by Dr. Ross, shewed that in addition to some superficial injuries on
the face the deceased had sustained, before death, (i) a laceration 1½ inches
in length on the head 2 inches above the right ear, (ii) a laceration 1¼ inches
in length on the head 1½ inches above the left ear, (iii) a stellate laceration
1¼ inches in diameter on the head 1½ inches behind the left ear, and (iv) a
depressed fracture of the skull on the left side which, in the opinion of Dr.
Ross, had been caused by the same force which caused the stellate laceration;
this fracture was 1¼ inches by ¾ of an inch in size and four fragments of bone
were depressed inwards ¾ of an inch; it had caused contusion of the brain
tissue and haemorrhage.

The post mortem also shewed that the blood of the
deceased contained 396 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood,
which, according to the evidence of Dr. Penner, indicates a degree of
intoxication which would not infrequently cause a loss of consciousness.

A statement made by the appellant to the police was admitted
in evidence. From this statement and the evidence of other witnesses it appears
that the accused was drinking heavily with the deceased and some other
companions up to about 2 a.m. on January 6 and that during this time a good
deal of rubbing alcohol was consumed. At about 2 a.m. the appellant and the
deceased decided to go to Higgins Avenue to get some more liquor. The statement
of the appellant as to what happened from that point on is as follows:—

Then we went down Higgins Ave., you know that lot at the
back of the terraces there. We started drinking there, then Gus [i.e., the
deceased] started swearing at me. I guess I swore at him too, and then he
pushed me. I got mad and we started to fight. The other two guys walked away.
Gus hit me about three or four times. He gave me one right in the mouth. I got
a couple of scratches. I hit him with my left. I got in a few, but I hurt my
hand. You can see it’s all swollen. Gus fell down and I kicked him a couple. I
guess it was self-defence. Then I fell down, that’s when I got the blood on my
pants. I put his scarf around his neck because he was unconscious, and I
thought he might get cold. I put the belt around his head loose. I guess I
thought it would do some good. Then I walked over to the railroad tracks, and I
climbed into a car and laid down to sleep. It was a half car, open like a
gravel car. Then the train pulled out.

[Page 751]

It should be mentioned that the men referred to as “the
other two guys” were called as witnesses but deposed they had left the
appellant and the deceased before any quarrel ‘ or fight started and, apart
from the appellant’s statement, there was no evidence of any eye-witness as to
how the deceased received his injuries.

The train referred to in the statement pulled out at 3.05
a.m., so that the fight apparently occurred between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. It was a
cold night 4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

Dr. Ross testified that while the injuries described as (i)
and (ii) above could have been caused by kicks delivered by someone wearing the
shoes of the appellant, the depressed fracture of the skull could not have been
so caused; that death was not instantaneous; that a number of factors
contributed to cause death; that the depressed fracture of the skull was the
most important cause and that it was quite possible that it might have been
caused by the deceased falling backwards and striking his head on a metal
object. There was evidence that there was a pile of junk metal in the lane in
which the body of the deceased was found.

It was one of the theories of the defence that if the jury
found that the effective cause of the death of the deceased was the depressed
fracture of the skull and that this injury was sustained as the result of the
deceased being knocked down by a blow from the appellant’s fist during the
fight and striking his head on the junk pile they should find the appellant
guilty of manslaughter and not of murder unless they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant either (a) meant to cause the death of the
deceased, or (b) meant to cause him bodily harm that he knew was likely to
cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not (vide the Criminal
Code , s. 201 ).

Instead of so charging the jury, the learned Chief Justice
told them that the accused was presumed to intend the consequences of his own
act and that if the death occurred in the manner suggested the appellant was
guilty of murder

[Page 752]

subject only to the defences of drunkenness or provocation.
This is made clear by the following extracts from the charge:—

Then we come to the other injury, the depressed fracture of ‘the
skull, the back part, the left-hand side, 1½ by ¾ inches, and the contusion of
the brain beneath. The depressed fracture broken into four bone fragments
raised three-quarters of an inch inside the skull, betokening external
violence, from outside, either a blow from above down or the skull pushed back
against something which it would hit. And it would require a considerable
degree of force; that the instrument which would cause it must be moderately
sharp to cause it, because it was only an inch and a quarter by three-quarters
of an inch, and would have to have a blunted point. A small-headed hammer or a
very sharp rock might do it. That an ordinary wood implement would not likely
make such an injury, but that if the man fell backwards as a result of a blow,
and hit his head against some of the metal shown in the junk pile, that might
have caused it. We don’t know just exactly what did cause it. Counsel for the
accused suggests that in the course of this fight—and I think undoubtedly there
was a fight; and equally undoubtedly, gentlemen of the jury, a fight is an
unlawful act and a crime—and that in the course of this fight, I think the
suggestion was, that the accused might have hit the deceased, that the deceased
might have fallen back on the scrap pile, and that as it was done, if the
deceased sustained his injury in that way, the accused might not have known
that the deceased sustained such an injury. The accused didn’t have to know
whether the injury was sustained in that way. The injury was sustained in the
fighting; the accused is presumed to intend the consequences of his own act,
subject to drunkenness or provocation, which I have to deal with later, so that
if this deceased sustained that injury in the course of that fight, then the
accused must be considered to have intended all the consequences of his acts on
that occasion, subject to what I will say later about other possible defences.

* * *

If you decide that the accused caused the death of the
deceased, you must next decide, did he mean to cause him bodily harm that he knew
was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not?
That is, in either case you must consider the accused’s capacity to form an
intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was likely
to cause death.

I still have one or two matters to deal with. If you come to
the conclusion that the accused’s condition of drunkenness did not render him
incapable of forming the intent to do what he did, the intent to either cause
the deceased’s death, or alternatively, the intent to cause bodily harm and the
inability to know the likely consequences, he being reckless whether death
ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of murder. If you

[Page 753]

come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that
intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully
in self-defence.

The meaning of these passages is not doubtful. The jury
are told not that they may but that they must find that the accused had the
intent required by s. 201 (a) (i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code  unless
they find that he was through drunkenness incapable of forming the intent
mentioned. In my view this was misdirection which is fatal to the validity of
the conviction and there is nothing to be found in the remainder of the charge
to correct this error. It was for the jury, giving due weight to the rebuttable
presumption which imputes to a man an intention to produce those consequences
which are the natural result of his acts, to decide as a fact whether the
appellant had the guilty intent necessary to make him guilty of murder; and, in
particular, it was for the jury to say whether the fracture of the deceased’s
skull was a natural consequence of any blow struck by the appellant.

The point with which I have just dealt is included in
grounds 2, 3 and 4, on which leave to appeal was granted. I do not find it
necessary to deal with any of the other questions argued before us except that
as to the possible application of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal
Code  providing that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal where

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that
on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous authorities
dealing with this subsection. Bearing in mind that it was open to the jury to
find that the injuries from which the death of the deceased resulted were
sustained in the course of a sudden fight between two drunken men in which no
weapon was used and that there was no evidence of any previous ill-will between
them, I find it impossible to affirm that a

[Page 754]

jury properly instructed and acting reasonably must
necessarily have convicted the accused of murder. In my opinion it was open to
the jury on the evidence to find a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty
of manslaughter. On the other hand, I am unable to agree with the submission of
counsel for the appellant that there was no evidence on which a properly
instructed jury could have found a verdict of guilty of murder, and, in my
opinion, there should be a new trial.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a
new trial.

Nolan J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dismissing
the appeal of the appellant from his conviction for murder, after a trial
before the Chief Justice of Queen’s Bench and a jury.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on five questions
of law, which are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother
Cartwright and need not be repeated here.

On January 6, 1955, at about 7 o’clock in the morning, the
body of the deceased, August Flatfoot, was found lying face down in the snow in
a lane in the vicinity of Higgins Avenue in the City of Winnipeg. The
temperature was 4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The body was clothed in long
combination underwear, a shirt, a sweater, trousers, socks, shoes and
overshoes, and a woollen scarf was tied around the neck, the knot being under
the left ear. The trouser belt had been removed and tied tightly around the
head through the lips and knotted at the back of the head. The trousers were
ripped down the back and a portion of the buttocks was exposed. The belt buckle
was lying on the ground near the body, two of the belt loops of the trousers
were torn loose and a third was torn off completely. The deceased’s brown
fedora hat was found in a back yard in the vicinity. His overcoat was missing.

[Page 755]

Dr. H. M. Ross, a certified pathologist with the Winnipeg
General Hospital, made a post mortem examination of the body. He found a
cut laceration, one and one-half inches long, two inches above the right ear,
which went through the tissues to the bone. Dr. Ross was of the opinion that
this cut laceration could not have been caused by a fist, unless there was a
ring or some object in the hand, but could have been caused by a kick from a
shoe. He found another laceration, one and one-quarter inches long, one and
one-half inches above the left ear, which was essentially the same as the first
laceration and could have been caused, in his opinion, in the same way as the
cut above the right ear. He also found a stellate, or star-shaped, laceration,
about one and one-quarter inches in diameter, situate one and one-half inches
behind the left ear. Dr. Ross’s opinion as to the cause of this wound was the
same as for the wounds on both sides of the head, except that he did not
believe the toe of a boot could, in one blow, have made all the various
branches that this wound had and doubted that simply the toe of a boot could
have caused it. There were a number of superficial abrasions on the right cheek
in front of the ear, on the left cheek in approximately the same place and on
the nose. One incisor tooth was missing.

The examination of the head disclosed a depressed fracture
of the skull on the left side at the back, one and one-quarter inches by
three-quarters of an inch, and four fragments of bone were depressed inwards
three-quarters of an inch. The depressed fracture had caused contusion of the
brain and was almost below the star-shaped laceration. Dr. Ross was of the
opinion that a considerable degree of force would be necessary to cause this
fracture and felt that such force might have been applied from above downwards,
or by the skull being pushed backwards against some point above. The skull
fracture and brain contusion were of such a nature as to cause unconsciousness.
An examination of

[Page 756]

the bones and cartilage of the throat disclosed no evidence
of any obstruction or injury, nor was there any constriction mark upon the neck
itself.

Dr. Ross stated that there were a number of factors
contributing to the cause of death, the most important of which was the
contusion of the brain resulting from the depressed fracture of the skull. A
considerable amount of blood had been lost. There was a high blood alcohol
level and evidence of some constriction in the air supply and exposure. He was
of the opinion that the fracture of the skull had been caused by something with
a blunt point, such as a very small-headed hammer or a very sharp rock, and
that death had not been instantaneous. There were several possible causes of
death—alcoholic poisoning, if the deceased were rendered unconscious by
alcohol; unconsciousness caused by alcohol, coupled with exposure to four
degrees below zero weather. In such circumstances death would be inevitable and
would not be accelerated by the skull injury. Death could also have been caused
by the depressed fracture of the skull, coupled with exposure. It was
impossible to tell whether the fracture or the alcohol rendered the deceased
unconscious, or which caused his death. The post mortem examination
disclosed that the deceased, with the blood alcohol level of 396 milligrams per
100 milliliters of blood, would be strongly under the influence of alcohol and
would only be able to move about with difficulty. There was evidence that a few
feet from the body there were two frozen piles of scrap iron, about three feet
high, lying alongside some small, tumble-down sheds, and that, if the deceased
fell backwards into the frozen iron, it would be quite possible that he would
receive the fracture of the skull in the fall.

The evidence discloses that up to about 2 a.m. on January 6
the appellant was drinking heavily with the deceased and some other companions,
during which time rubbing alcohol was consumed. The appellant, the deceased and
two companions left the St. Louis Café shortly after 2 a.m. and proceeded east
on Higgins Avenue. The appellant and the deceased proceeded ahead to obtain
more

[Page 757]

alcohol and the two companions remained behind awaiting
their return. After about fifteen minutes of waiting, when the appellant and
the deceased failed to return, the two companions went back along Higgins
Avenue to the St. Louis Café and, finding it closed, proceeded west upon
Higgins Avenue to Main Street and left the vicinity. Later that day the
appellant was apprehended at St. Malo, a village south of Winnipeg.

The appellant made a statement to the police early the
following morning, which was admitted in evidence at the trial. Apart from that
statement, there was no evidence of any eye-witness as to how the deceased had
received his injuries, as the two companions swore that they had left the
appellant and the deceased before any quarrel or fight started. The statement
of the appellant recited his movements up until the time that he met the
deceased and two other companions at the St. Louis Café sometime after 1 a.m.:—

I met Gus and two other guys there. I don’t know their
names. Gus and me kidded each other along, and then we tossed up for the
coffees and Gus lost, so be bought for the four of us. Then we went down
Higgins Ave., you know that lot at the back of the terraces there. We started
drinking there, then Gus started swearing at me. I guess I swore at him too,
and then he pushed me. I got mad and we started to fight. The other two guys
walked away. Gus hit me about three or four times. He gave me one right in the
mouth. I got a couple of scratches. I hit him with my left. I got in a few, but
I hurt my hand. You can see it’s all swollen. Gus fell down and I kicked him a
couple. I guess it was self-defence. Then I fell down, that’s when I got the
blood on my pants. I put his scarf around his neck because he was unconscious,
and I thought he might get cold. I put the belt around his head loose. I guess
I thought it would do some good. Then I walked over to the railroad tracks, and
I climbed into a car and laid down to sleep. It was a half car, open like a
gravel car. Then the train pulled out.

Some hours later, when asked what had happened to the coat
that the deceased was wearing prior to the fight, the appellant, in a further
statement, said:—

After the fight, Gus was lying on the ground, he had his
coat half on, so I guess I took it off him. I put it under my arm. I had it
with me in the gravel car. I was using it to sit on and that and I left it in
the car when I got off the train.

[Page 758]

The evidence discloses that the overcoat was found a number
of miles away from Winnipeg along the railroad right-of-way and had
considerable blood on the left side in the region of the shoulder and also on
the right sleeve. When he was apprehended the appellant had a large bloodstain
on his left trouser leg near the knee. His left hand was badly swollen from the
base of his fingers to the wrist and there were three slight scratches on his
face. There were no cuts, or lacerations, or marks on the rest of his body.

The following are extracts from the charge to the jury:—

Counsel for the accused suggests that in the course of this
fight—and I think undoubtedly there was a fight; and equally undoubtedly,
gentlemen of the jury, a fight is an. unlawful act and a crime—and that in the
course of this fight, I think the suggestion was, that the accused might have
hit the deceased, that the deceased might have fallen back on the scrap pile, and
that as it was done, if the deceased sustained his injury in that way, the
accused might not have known that the deceased sustained such an injury. The
accused didn’t have to know whether the injury was sustained in that way. The
injury was sustained in the fighting; the accused is presumed to intend the
consequences of his own act, subject to drunkenness or provocation, which I
have to deal with later, so that if this deceased sustained that injury in the
course of that fight, then the accused must be considered to have intended all
the consequences of his acts on that occasion, subject to what I will say later
about other possible defences.

* * *

If you decide that the accused caused the death of the
deceased, you must next decide, Did he mean to cause him bodily harm that he
knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or
not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused’s capacity to form
an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was
likely to cause death.

* * *

I still have one or two matters to deal with. If you come to
the conclusion that the accused’s condition of drunkenness did not render him
incapable of forming the intent to do what he did, the intent to either cause
the deceased’s death, or alternatively, the intent to cause bodily harm and the
inability to know the likely consequences, he being reckless whether death
ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of murder. If you come to the
conclusion that he was incapable of forming that intent, then he is guilty of
manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully in self-defence.

[Page 759]

The jury was instructed that the appellant was presumed to
have intended the consequences which flowed from the fight, even though he may
not have known that the deceased suffered a fracture of the skull, and was
instructed that an intent, as required by s. 201  (a) (i) or (ii) of the Criminal
Code  must be attributed to him. It follows that the only matter left for
the consideration of the jury was whether or not the defences of drunkenness or
provocation could make the crime less than murder.

This was, with great respect, a fatal defect in the charge,
because it was for the jury to say whether the intent, as required by s. 201 , supra,
was to be attributed to the appellant so as to justify a verdict of guilty
of murder; and it was also for the jury to say whether the fracture of the
skull was caused by a blow of the appellant, or was caused by the deceased
falling backward onto a sharp point of iron.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without
written reasons and consequently there is no indication as to whether that
Court decided the matter on the ground that there was no misdirection, or on
the ground that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice (s.
592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code). Nevertheless, it was contended by
counsel for the respondent, in argument, that the appeal should be dismissed,
pursuant to the powers vested in the Court under that section. I am unable to
agree with that contention.

It is well established that the burden of satisfying the
Court that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred is upon
the Crown. In Northey v. The King 4,
where s. 1014 of the old Code (now s. 592) was being considered, it was
held that, where the irregularities at the trial are of such a nature that
there is doubt whether the verdict would necessarily have been the same if they
had not occurred, then the doubt should be resolved in favour of the accused.
In the present case, in my view, such a doubt exists.

[Page 760]

The evidence establishes that the appellant and the deceased
had, for some hours, been drinking rubbing alcohol and beer. There is no
evidence of previous bad feeling between them. Swear-words were exchanged; a
sudden fist fight took place, no weapon was used, and the deceased sustained
injuries which caused his death. Section 203 of the Code provides that
culpable homicide, that otherwise would be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter
if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation and before there was time for his passion to cool. In my view, it
was for the jury to determine whether, on its view of the facts, manslaughter
or murder was the appropriate verdict and there is a doubt, which must be
resolved in favour of the appellant, whether the verdict would necessarily have
been the same had no irregularity occurred.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a
new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Discovery, Examination for—Witness—Privilege
against self-crimination—Validity of s. 5, Evidence Act (B.C.)—Order 31A, r.
370 (c) matter of practice and procedure—Application of common law rule—Evidence
Act (B.C.)—Evidence Act (Can.)—Court Rules of Practice Act (B.C.) ss. 2, 4(3).

[Page 310]

S. 5 of the Evidence Act,
R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 113 provides:

""No witness shall be
excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to the
question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person: Provided that
if with respect to any question the witness objects to answer upon the ground
that his answer may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person,
and if but for this section the witness would therefore have been excused from
answering the question, then, although the witness shall be compelled to
answer, yet the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence
against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him
thereafter taking place other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such
evidence.""

In an action for damages for
fraud and deceit each of the individual appellants and an officer of the United
Distillers of Canada Ltd., the appellant corporation, on their respective
examinations for discovery refused to answer certain questions, or to produce
certain documents, on the ground that such answers might tend to criminate him.
Upon an application for an order directing the individuals to answer the
questions and produce the documents in question the general objections were
upheld by Clynne J. but his order was reversed by the majority of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia.

Held: (Affirming the Court of Appeal):—

1. Examinations for Discovery
under Order 31A, r. 370 (c) of the British
 Columbia Supreme Court Rules are
covered by s. 5 of the Evidence Act.

2.This rule does not go beyond
the power contained in s. 2 of the Court Rules of Practice Act, R.S.B.C.
1948, c. 293, and its predecessors, and s. 4(3) thereof enacts that r. 370 (c)
is a matter of practice and procedure.

3.""Criminal
proceedings"" in s. 5 of the Evidence Act is not confined to what
are known as provincial crimes. Staples v. Isaacs and Harris 55
B.C.R. 189 overruled.

Held: further, on a point taken for the first time in this
court, that s. 5 of the Evidence Act is ultra vires the
Provincial Legislature as the proviso may not be disregarded. The common law
rule that no one was obliged to criminate himself applies as well to an officer
taking the objection on behalf of his company as to an individual litigant. In
both cases, however, the objection must be made on the oath of the person under
examination that to the best of his belief his answers would tend to criminate
him, or the company, as the case may be. He must pledge his oath in his belief
that his answers to particular questions seriatum would so tend. Power
v. Ellis 6 Can. S.C.R. 1, applied. The officer may claim the privilege
on behalf of his company, either as to answers to questions or as to documents,
but the latter cannot hide behind any claim advanced by the officer on his own
behalf in respect of documents. If he is put forward as the proper person on
behalf of a company to make an affidavit on production he is not entitled to
make a claim for personal privilege in respect of documents. 

[Page 311]

APPEAL by special leave from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1],
Sloan C.J.B.C. dissenting, reversing the order of Clynne J. [2]
and holding that the individual defendants and an officer of the appellant
corporation were not entitled to refuse to answer questions, or to produce
documents on examination for discovery, on the ground that such answers might
tend to criminate them.

J. W. deB. Farris, Q.C.
and F. A. Sheppard, Q.C. for the appellants.

D. H. W Henry for the Attorney
General of Canada.

L. A. Kelley, Q.C. for the
Attorney General of British Columbia.

R. H. Barron, for the
respondents.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and
of Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—Reversing the
order of Clyne J. the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia held that the individual
defendants, Klein, McLennan and Norgan, were not entitled to refuse to answer
questions, or to produce documents on examination for discovery, on the ground
that such answers might tend to criminate them. One, Norman Harold Peters, had
also attended for examination for discovery as an officer of the appellant,
United Distillers of Canada, Limited, and he had taken the same objection on
behalf of his company. Peters died before the decision of the Court of Appeal.
The judgment of the latter provides that upon the continuation of their
respective examinations for discovery Klein, McLennan and Norgan shall answer
all questions which they respectively refused to answer and produce all documents
which they respectively refused to produce on their examinations for discovery
held on September 10, 1953, and that upon the examination for discovery of any
officer of United Distillers of Canada, Ltd. in the place of Peters such
officer shall answer all questions which Peters had refused to answer and
produce all documents which he had refused to produce. The defendants now
appeal and ask for the restoration of the order of Clyne J.

[Page 312]

The appellants argued that
examinations for discovery are not included in or covered by s. (5) of the Evidence
Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 113, which is in these terms:

No witness shall be excused
from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to the question may
tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil
proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person: Provided that if with
respect to any question the witness objects to answer upon the ground that his
answer may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for
this section the witness would therefore have been excused from answering the
question, then, although the witness shall be compelled to answer, yet the
answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any
criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place
other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.

Order 31A, Rule 370 (c) of
the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules provides:

A party to an action or
issue, whether plaintiff or defendant, may, without order, be orally examined
before the trial touching the matters in question by any party adverse in
interest, and may be compelled to attend and testify in the same manner, upon
the same terms, and subject to the same rules of examination of a witness
except as hereinafter provided.

(1) In the case of a
corporation, any officer or servant of such corporation may, without any
special order, and any one who has been one of the officers of such corporation
may, by order of a Court or a Judge, be orally examined before the trial
touching the matters in question by any party adverse in interest to the
corporation, and may be compelled to attend and testify in the same manner and
upon the same terms and subject to the same rules of examination as a witness,
save as hereinafter provided. Such examination or any part thereof may be used
as evidence at the trial if the trial Judge so orders.

***

We were not referred to any
exception ""hereinafter provided"" and, in view of the express terms
that a party, officer or servant may be compelled to attend and testify
""in the same manner, upon the same terms, and subject to the same rules of
examination of (or as) a witness"", the person being examined is subject to
the direction contained in s. (5) of the Act and, of course, is entitled to the
privilege. Order 31A is modelled from the Ontario Rules, 1897 and amendments,
and in Chambers v. Jaffray [3], it was
so held, although in the Divisional
 Court the majority apparently did so
because they considered themselves bound by Regina

[Page 313]

v. Fox [4].
Without expressing any opinion as to the latter, the result arrived at in the Chambers
case is, in my view, the correct one.

It was also contended that the
rule went beyond the power contained in s. (2) of the Court Rules of
Practice Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 293, and its predecessors, by which
authority is and was conferred upon the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the
Province to make rules for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court.
Power is given by s-s. (6) of s. (4) of the Act and was contained in an earlier
enactment to add to or vary the rules, (which was done), and Rule 370 (c) now
appears as above set forth. By s-s. (3) of s. (4) of the Act those rules
""shall regulate the procedure and practice in the Supreme Court in the
matters therein provided for"", and, notwithstanding what was done in
connection with the Divorce Rules by s-s. (1) of s. (2) of c. 37 of the British
Columbia Statutes, now incorporated in R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 293, s-s. (3) of s.
(4) of the latter stands by itself and must receive its full effect. This is a
positive enactment that Rule 370 (c) is a matter of practice and procedure.

It is now necessary to deal with
the point taken by the appellants for the first time in this Court that s. (5)
of the Evidence Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 113, is ultra vires the
provincial Legislature. It should be noted that the earliest Evidence Acts of
the Canadian Parliament had no provision such as is found in s. (5) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307. The forerunner of that section first
appeared in c. 31 of the Statutes of 1893 and read as follows:

5. No person shall be
excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such
question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any other person: Provided,
however, that no evidence so given shall be used or receivable in evidence
against such person in any criminal proceeding thereafter instituted against
him other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.

This Act was amended by c. 36 of
the Statutes of 1901 by adding thereto the following as s-s. (2) of s. (5):

2. The proviso to subsection
(1) of this section shall in like manner apply to the answer of a witness to
any question which pursuant to an enactment of the legislature of a province
such witness is compelled to

[Page 314]

answer after having objected
so to do upon any ground mentioned in the said subsection, and which, but for
that enactment, he would upon such ground have been excused from answering.

In the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1906, c. 145, s. (5) of the Canada Evidence Act  appeared as
follows:

5. No witness shall be
excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such
question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.

2. If with respect to any
question a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may tend
to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding
at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the
act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have been
excused from answering such question, then although the witness is by reason of
this Act, or by reason of such provincial act, compelled to answer, the answer
so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any
criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking
place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence.

In 1894 the British Columbia legislature revised its Evidence Act and therein enacted verbatim s.
(5) of the Canadian Act of 1893 set out above. The provincial statutes were
again revised in 1897, when s. (6) of the Evidence Act, c. 71, appeared
in the same form as s. (5) of the Act of 1894. They were consolidated in 1911
when, for the first time, s. (5) of the Evidence Act, c. 78, appeared in
practically the same form as the section now before us, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 113.

It has been pointed out that in
1894 the British Columbia Legislature enacted the same provision as Parliament
had passed in 1893. The enactment in 1911 in British Columbia was an
endeavour to carry out the idea underlying s. (5) of c. 145 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906. I have no doubt that this was done with the object of
taking care of cases where the proper objection to testify was taken in
proceedings over which the legislature had jurisdiction and then providing that
such evidence might not be used later either in civil cases or a criminal
trial. Looking at s. (5) as it appeared in the 1894 provincial enactment and
considering its history since then, I am driven to the conclusion that
""criminal proceeding"" is not confined to what are known as provincial
crimes, particularly when that part of the statute is followed by the words
""other than the prosecution for perjury"". The decision of the British Columbia 

[Page 315]

Court of Appeal on this point in Staples
v. Isaacs and Harris, [5] (which,
in fact, was overruled by the Court of Appeal in the present case) cannot be
supported. Canada, of course, could only provide with reference to all
proceedings over which it had legislative authority and the provincial
legislature with reference to proceedings over which it had such authority, I
am unable to agree with the contention on behalf of the respondent and the
Attorney General of British Columbia that the proviso in the provincial
enactment may be disregarded, because I am unable to hold that even if the
constitutional point had been brought to the attention of the Legislature it
would have enacted the section without some proviso and it is impossible to say
what that proviso would have contained. Reliance was placed by the respondents
and the Attorney General of British Columbia upon s. 36  of the Canada Evidence
Act , which is in these terms:

36. In all proceedings over
which the Parliament of Canada has legislative authority, the laws of evidence
in force in the province in which such proceedings are taken, including the
laws of proof of service of any warrant, summons, subpoena or other document,
subject to this and other Acts of the Parliament of Canada, apply to such
proceedings.

This, however, cannot assist,
because, if s. (5) of the British Columbia Act is of no effect, it is not part
of the provincial law of evidence. S. (5) must, therefore, be declared ultra
vires. This conclusion is to be regretted, but the situation is not beyond
remedy by the legislature.

In the absence of any such
remedial legislation the common law applies as well to an officer taking the
objection on behalf of his company as to an individual litigant. In both cases,
however, the objection must be made on the oath of the person under examination
that, to the best of his belief, his answers would tend to criminate him, or
the company, as the case may be. Such person is not entitled to object to
answer ordinary questions about his residence, place of business, etc., nor is
he entitled to rest on a statement that on the advice of his solicitor, or the
solicitor for the company, he refuses to answer any questions on the ground
that the answers might tend to criminate him, or it. He must pledge his oath in
his belief that his answers to particular

[Page 316]

questions seriatim would so tend:
Power v. Ellis [6]. What
occurred on the examinations for discovery in this case is not sufficient.

As to documents, each of the
appellants, Klein, McLennan and Norgan, made an affidavit on production, but in
each the only claim for privilege with respect to what was identified as
""brief and confidential memoranda prepared by Counsel, or at the request
of Counsel"" was that ""the said documents are privileged on the
grounds of having been prepared confidentially for the purpose of being used in
this litigation"". A similar claim was made by Peters on behalf of United
Distillers of Canada Ltd. We were told that orders had been made for further
and better affidavits on production, which have not yet been complied with, but
we are not aware that there has been any refusal. There are certain documents
which Clyne J. ordered to be produced on the continuation of the examinations
for discovery of Klein, McLennan and Norgan, namely, an agreement of July 22,
1947, and all documents mentioned in ss. 107, 108 and 121 (3) of the Companies
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 53. Clyne J. also ordered that certain questions
should be answered on the continuation of the examinations for discovery of the
three individuals, but reserved for decision the right of the plaintiffs to
further question them in relation to the documents referred to.

No objection is taken to these
terms, as the appellants seek merely the restoration of that order. It should
be so directed, subject to the omission of the reference to Peters and the
inclusion of an officer of United Distillers of Canada, Ltd., who is to take
his place; and subject to amending paragraph (4) of the order by providing that
the refusal is subject to the objection being taken in the proper form as above
indicated. The order should also be subject to an alteration to take care of
the difference in the positions of an officer of a company and an individual
litigant. The officer may claim the privilege on behalf of his company, either
as to answers to questions or as to documents, but the latter cannot hide
behind any claim advanced by the officer on his own behalf in respect of
documents. If he

[Page 317]

is put forward as the proper
person on behalf of a company to make an affidavit on production he is not
entitled to make a claim for personal privilege in respect of documents.

Clyne J. gave no costs of the
application before him and that provision may stand. There should be no costs
in the Court of Appeal, but the appellants are entitled to their costs in this
Court as against the respondents. There should be no costs to or against either
Attorney General.

RAND J.:—This appeal is concerned with the privilege
against crimination on discovery. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was
attacked by Mr. Farris on several grounds. Among them was the scope of the word
""witness"" in s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act . His argument was
that a person examined as a party or agent was not within that word
notwithstanding marginal rule of court, (B.C.) No. 370(c), providing for oral
discovery, which declares a party or an agent to be examinable ""in the
same manner and upon the same terms and subject to the same rules of
examination as a witness"".

S. 5 expressly prohibits the use
of incriminating evidence furnished under the compulsion of provincial
legislation. The purpose of this provision is to liberate the disclosure of
evidentiary matter. It is non-disclosure which the rule guards and the Act
modifies; and the prohibition of use contemplates the entire machinery of the
administration of justice in provincial proceedings. A witness, in a broad
sense, is one who, in the course of juridical processes, attests to matters of
fact; and in the multiplying procedures directed to the elicitation of such
matters, the object of the statute, dealing as it does with a basic right,
would be defeated by limiting its protection to part only of coerced disclosure.
Since, as assumed by all parties, the Province is within its jurisdiction in
that compulsion, I have no difficulty in interpreting the challenged word to
extend to one of the most effective instruments to the function of litigation.
That was the expressed view of Mulock C.J. in Chambers v. Jaffray [7]
and, as I read their reasons, the implied view of the members of the Court of
Appeal who affirmed his judgment.

[Page 318]

Mr. Farris next disputes the
validity of rule 370(c), to the extent that it affects the privilege, as
an encroachment upon a substantive right and consequently beyond the limits of
""practice and procedure"". But by c. 56 of the statutes of 1943,
amending c. 249, R.S.B.C. 1936, it was declared that the present orders and
rules should thereafter ""regulate the practice and procedure"" in the
Supreme Court. This categorical enactment dispenses with any enquiry into
whether rule 370(c) is within ""procedure"": it has been
declared to be so, and in my opinion, that concludes the question.

But the validity of s. 5 of the
Provincial Act also is contested. Its language is:

No witness shall be excused
from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to the question may
tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding
at the instance of the Crown or of any person: Provided that if with respect to
any question the witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may
tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability to a civil
proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this
section the witness would therefore have been excused from answering the
question, then, although the witness shall be compelled to answer, yet the
answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any
criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place
other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.

This, originally passed in 1894,
was given its present form in 1897. In 1893 what is now s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act , in enacting that, in criminal and other proceedings
respecting which Parliament has jurisdiction, no person should be excused from
answering any question on the ground of crimination, provided that no evidence
so given should ""be used or receivable in evidence against such person in
any criminal proceeding thereafter instituted against him other than a
prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence."" This was the law of
Parliament at the time of the enactment of s. 5 of the Provincial Act, and it
will be observed that its immunity does not reach one who has been compelled to
answer by provincial law. It was not until 1901 that the protection of the
Dominion Act was extended to evidence so adduced; and the critical question is,
what was the law regarding compulsion to answer, say, in 1898? This depends
upon the interpretation of s. 5 of the provincial Act and whether or not the
proviso can be severed from the main clause. 

[Page 319]

The language employed does not
vary materially from that of s. 5 of the Dominion Act of 1893. The provincial
Act came before the Court of Appeal in the case of Staples v. Isaacs
and Harris [8]. The
effect of the judgment was that, in both its compulsory and protective
features, the section was limited to matters that relate to what are called
""provincial crimes"", for example, breaches of municipal bylaws or
violations of the provincial government Liquor Act. This is made clear in the
reasons of Sloan J.A. (now C.J.B.C.). The view expressed was that as the party
examined could be afforded no safeguard by the provincial Act in a prosecution
under the Criminal Code , the legislature could not be taken to have
abrogated the privilege generally. At the same time it was held that the word
""witness"" in s. 5 of the Dominion Act did not extend to a person
being examined on discovery.

To attribute such a limited scope
to s. 5 of the provincial Act would, of course, dispose of this appeal without
more; the matters of incrimination here have nothing to do with provincial
offences. But the Court of Appeal has declined to follow Staples v. Isaacs
(supra), and it becomes necessary to examine the statutory language more
closely. The proviso declares that the answer ""shall not be used or
receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place other than a prosecution for
perjury in giving such evidence."" I think it would be distorting the
natural meaning of these words to say that they are restricted to provincial
crimes. The opening clause of the section is equally broad: the witness is not
to be excused from answering any question upon the ground of crimination.

I entertain no doubt that a
province cannot exclude from testimony in a criminal prosecution admissions
made in the course of discovery or of trial in a civil proceeding; to do so
would be to legislate in relation to procedure in criminal matters which is
within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. Can the proviso be taken in
the sense that the compulsory feature is to be effective where and when under
any law the answer is not available for use in criminal proceedings against the
person making it? The amendment

[Page 320]

made in 1901 would in that case
feed the proviso and bring into operation the compulsory clause. But the
language excludes such a construction. The purpose and intention were to create
by force of what was looked upon as effective legislation a protection
complementary to the broadest compulsion.

Is the proviso, then, severable?
Can it be taken not as a condition bound up with the preceding clause, but as
an independent and consequential declaration which may be struck out without
affecting it? The Act, as declared in s. 3, undoubtedly includes proceedings
over which the legislature has jurisdiction, and a residue can be found in the
proviso for purely provincial matters which would leave the general compulsion
intact. But if the question had arisen in 1895, can any one doubt what the
answer would have been? Considering the obvious purpose of the legislation, in
a radical departure from the ancient rule, such an interpretation would be
repugnant to the vital considerations the legislature had in mind. The entire
section consequently was inoperative ab initio.

That being so in 1894, it could
not be revived by the amendment of 1901; nor could the general revisions of the
Act made since that time furnish any efficacy to the section. It seems quite
evident that the significance of the amendment in relation to the provincial
Act was not appreciated. The result is unfortunate, but I see no way of
escaping it.

The relation of the privilege to
the production of documents is also in issue. In the case of the individual
defendants the privilege extends to documents in their personal possession
which contain incriminating matter and which, accordingly, they may object to
produce.

But a distinction must be made in
the case of documents of the corporation. The claim of privilege raised on an
examination by a company's officer in whose custody its documents may, at any
time, be, may be related either to the criminality of the company or to that of
himself. In this I take the privilege to be as open to a body corporate as to
an individual: Triplex Safety Glass Co. v. Lancegaye Safety Glass (1934)
Ltd. [9].
Although a witness may not set up the claim for the benefit of a third person
yet since in 

[Page 321]

an affidavit of documents the
privilege may be taken by a corporation acting through its officer, it would be
little short of absurd that it could be defeated on the examination of the
officer having custody of them. If the custody is that of the corporation for
the purposes of production following an affidavit, the custodian to that extent
represents the corporation, and if documents are privileged in the one case,
they must be also in the other.

But the claim may be that the
document may tend to criminate the officer personally. In such a case I can see
no sound reason for conceding it when the matter is one of authentication only
and he is no more intimately associated with the corporation than as an
officer, custodian or recorder of its proceedings, actions or transactions. He
may be involved in some of the latter, but to admit the privilege would be to
enable the corporation to prevent production on an examination by maintaining
him as custodian. His custody is the possession of the company and no inference
can be drawn against him from either fact: and if he chooses or is chosen to
continue as custodian, he must submit to its incidental consequences. But this
does not touch questions arising out of the documents so produced.

Is the corporation, in the
circumstances here, bound to produce its books generally? I have no doubt that
it is. No allegation or suggestion is made from which it could be reasonably
inferred that the production might expose the corporation to criminal or penal
proceedings. The only possibility offered is that of liability to penalties
under the Income Tax Act. But that Act gives to the Income Tax
Department the widest powers to require the production of any document
belonging to the corporation bearing relation to its income or to a violation
of the Act. Among the things sought here are details of liquor sales, i.e. the
names of purchasers, prices, etc., made by the corporation during the years in
question. The production of such records will effect nothing not already done
or open to be done by the Department. And as a prosecution for penalties under
that Act can be instituted only under the actual or presumed authority of the
Minister, the privilege so far has been effectually abolished.

[Page 322]

The defendants have, by order,
been directed to make a further and better affidavit of documents, and when
that is done inspection may be made of all books containing matter relating to
the issues in the action. Their production by an officer on a further
examination can therefore be required and their authentication by him as
company documents cannot be the subject of a claim of personal privilege.

Several observations are called
for on the mode of procedure followed by the defendants in setting up the
protection. In almost every instance counsel first objected to the question and
then ""instructed"" the witness either not to answer or to claim the
privilege. This misconceives the nature of what is being considered. The
questions were entirely proper since they were relevant to the issues. The
privilege can be invoked only after the question is put, and the function of
counsel on such an examination does not go beyond informing the witness of his
right, if he sees fit, to exercise it; and the examining party may insist that
the claim be made in answer to each question severally.

The witnesses declined to pledge
their oath that they ""believed"" their answers might tend to criminate
them. I must say that if their statement under oath that their answers
""might tend to criminate"" is not taken by them to carry an avowal of
their belief that it may do so, it so far negatives the good faith of the
claim; and a refusal to engage belief should be treated as evidence against
them accordingly. It is the witness himself, not counsel, who is concerned with
resisting disclosure; and the availability of the privilege assumes the honest
belief and genuine apprehension of a possible exposure to prosecution or a
penalty. Less than that would be trifling with the security the rule is
intended to afford.

The appeal must then be allowed
and the judgment of Clyne J., with certain modifications, restored. The
reference to Peters will be struck out and the name of an officer of the United
Distillers of Canada Ltd. substituted: paragraph 4 will be amended by providing
that the claim of privilege shall be made in the form indicated in these
reasons; the order will provide, (a) that the officer of the company may
on the examination claim the privilege on behalf

[Page 323]

of the company either in respect
of questions asked or documents to be produced; (b) that the officer can
claim personal privilege against questions put to him but not as against the
production of company documents; (c) and that no claim for the non-production
of company documents can be made on the ground of personal privilege of the
officer making the affidavit of documents. There will be no costs in the Court
of Appeal but the appellants will be entitled to their costs in this Court
against the respondents. There will be no costs to or against the Attorney
General.

Appeal allowed and
order of trial judge restored subject to a variation.

appellants: Guild, Lane, Sheppard & Locke.

respondents: R. H. Barron.

*Reporter's Note: Following the
handing down of judgment on April 6,
 1955, the respondent moved for a re-hearing
or in the alternative for alterations. Judgment was reserved, but as the
parties agreed that the references in the Order of Clynne J. to s-s. (3) of s.
121 of The Companies Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 53 should have been to s-s.
(1), ordered that its judgment be amended accordingly. It appeared that after
the argument of the appeal, and before delivery of the judgment of this Court,
new Affidavits on Production had been sworn to and therefore in view of the
reference to the Income Tax Act in the reasons of Clynne J. in relation
to the ground of claim of privilege, as to which no pronouncement was made by
this Court, that matter was remitted to the Court of Appeal to have that Court
pass upon the question if necessary, including any right to inspection of
documents that might exist and in order to determine the validity of any claim
of privilege by reason of incrimination not covered by the judgment of this
Court. It was further ordered that the Order of Clynne J. be amended
accordingly but that such amendment was not to affect any documents dealt with
by such Order. Nothing 

[Page 324]

was said as to the point desired
to be argued by the respondents that because United Distillers of Canada Ltd.
was incorporated under the Companies Act of Canada, s. 5 of the Canada Evidence
Act  applies to that company in these proceedings. No costs of the motion were
awarded.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Murder—Defence of accident or
self-defence—No charge to jury as to manslaughter—Whether there was material to
call for charge with respect to manslaughter—Criminal Code , s. 259  (a), (b).

The respondent was convicted of the murder of a woman. He and
the deceased were alone in a house when the occurrence took place. His defence
was accident or self-defence in a struggle over a knife said by the respondent
to have been in the hand of the victim. Apart from his evidence, there was
nothing to show the particulars of what took place. There was evidence that the
respondent and the deceased had agreed upon marriage and that there had been
prior dissension between them over the mode of life led by the deceased.
Shortly before the fatal act, they were heard quarrelling.

The trial judge did not charge the jury as to manslaughter.
The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial and the Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Locke J. dissenting): that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey,
Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The circumstances were sufficient to call
for the trial judge to charge the jury with respect to manslaughter. If the
jury concluded upon the evidence that the homicide was culpable, it was
necessary for them to decide as a fact, with what intent the respondent had
inflicted the fatal wound. If they had a reasonable doubt that he possessed the
intent required by s. 259  (a) or (b) of the Criminal
Code , the prisoner must be given the benefit of that doubt, and the jury
should then consider the offence of manslaughter.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): There was no material before
the jury to justify a direction that they should consider a possible verdict of
manslaughter.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta 1[1],

on a charge of murder and ordering a new trial.

[Page 293]

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Tasehereau, Rand, Kellock,
Estey, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:—

The Chief Justice: The
Attorney General of Alberta appeals from a judgment of the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court 2 directing
a new trial where the accused was charged with and convicted of the murder of a
woman. The substantial point is whether there was evidence sufficient to call
for an instruction to the jury that they might find manslaughter.

The deceased and the accused were alone in a house when the
occurrence took place. The defence was accident or self-defence in a struggle
over a knife said by the accused to have been in the hand of the victim. Apart
from his evidence, there is nothing to show the particulars of what took place.
Two witnesses, the occupant of the house and his wife, then a short distance
away from the house, heard a scream and saw the woman come staggering out. To
the wife she cried ""get me to a hosp …"" and then she collapsed.

There was evidence that the accused and the deceased had
agreed upon marriage and that there had been prior dissension between them over
the mode of life being led by the deceased. That morning, shortly before the
fatal act, they were heard quarrelling. At some stage a knife came into play
which pierced the woman's neck to cut the jugular vein and she died in a few
minutes from loss of blood.

These, and other circumstances unnecessary to mention, were
sufficient to call for the learned trial judge to charge the jury with respect
to manslaughter. In Mancini's case 3, Viscount Simon, after referring to the rule
laid down in Woolmington's case 4,
that the prosecution must prove the charge it makes beyond reasonable doubt,
and consequently that if on the material before the jury, there is a reasonable
doubt, the prisoner should have the benefit of it, pointed out that this is a
rule of general application in all charges under criminal law. His Lordship
continued at p. 279:

Thus, when a prisoner is charged with murder and felonious
homicide is proved against him, if the jury, when considering the evidence as a
whole at the conclusion of the case, are left in reasonable doubt as to whether
the homicide proved is not manslaughter, they should return a verdict of
manslaughter.

[Page 294]

If the jury concluded upon the evidence that the homicide
was culpable, it was necessary for them to decide as a fact, with what intent
the accused had inflicted the fatal wound. If they had a reasonable doubt that
he possessed the intent requisite under 259(a) or (b) of
the Code the prisoner must be given the benefit of that doubt, and the
jury should then consider the offence of manslaughter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Locke J.
(dissenting):—My consideration of the proceedings in this matter leads me to
the same conclusion as that expressed at the trial by the learned Chief Justice
of the Trial Division and in the Appellate Division by the learned Chief
Justice of Alberta 5.

As there is to be a new trial, I make no further reference
to the evidence other than to say that, in my opinion, there was no material
before the jury which would justify a direction that they should consider a
possible verdict of manslaughter.

I would allow this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Defence of provocation—Appeal by Crown—Whether evidence to support
defence of provocation—Element of suddenness
required in provocation—Criminal Code , s. 261 .

The respondent had
emigrated to Canada from Italy. His wife and children had remained behind. In
correspondence received from friends and relatives abroad, he was advised that
his wife had been unfaithful while he was in Canada and had suffered an
abortion. Subsequently, he arranged for his wife and children to come to
Canada, where he strangled his wife a few days after her arrival. The theory of
the Crown was that he had brought his wife to Canada with the intent to kill
her when she got here. This was supported by a letter written by him to his
brothers and by statements, admitted in evidence, given

[Page 439]

by him to the police. The
respondent pleaded that he was provoked by her admission to him that she had
been guilty of infidelities while he was in Canada.

He was convicted of murder
and the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The Crown obtained leave to appeal
to this Court on the ground, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal erred
in holding that there was any evidence to support the defence of provocation.

Held (Kerwin C.J., Estey,
Cartwright and Abbott JJ. dissenting): that the appeal should be allowed and
the conviction restored.

Per Taschereau, Rand and
Fauteux JJ.: What s. 261 of the Criminal Code  provides for is “sudden provocation”, and it must be acted upon
by the accused “on the sudden and before
there has been time for his passion to cool”. “Suddenness” must characterize both the insult and
the act of retaliation. The expression “sudden provocation” means that the wrongful
act or insult must strike upon a mind unprepared for it, that it must make an
unexpected impact that takes the understanding by surprise and sets the passion
aflame. There was nothing of that in the case at bar. What was said between the
accused and the victim could not, in the circumstances, amount to “sudden provocation”. The words furnished not
the provocation but the release of his pent-up determination to carry out what
he had deliberately decided upon, as he put it, to avenge his family honour.








Per Kellock and Locke JJ.: If,
upon becoming aware of his wife’s adultery, a husband
determines to kill her, he may rely upon provocation only if he acts “on the sudden” before there has been time
for his passion to cool. Consequently, the suggestion that if such an
intention, once formed, was given up but was renewed upon subsequent mention of
the previous information may be relied upon as “sudden provocation”, cannot be accepted. There
is then no element of “suddenness” as expressly required by
s. 261 of the Code. In the case at bar, there is no question but that
the accused already knew and had for some time known what was involved in the
statement made by his wife to him immediately before the tragedy.

Per Kerwin C.J., Estey, Cartwright
and Abbott JJ. (dissenting): The jury were not properly instructed with regard
to an alternative defence, disclosed in the evidence, to the effect that even
if the accused had once intended to kill his wife upon her coming to Canada, he
had thereafter forgiven her and that, therefore, at all relevant times he had
no intention of killing her.

The trial judge did not,
also, make it sufficiently clear to the jury that if, in respect of
provocation, they entertained a reasonable doubt, the accused should be given
the benefit of it.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, setting aside the conviction of
the appellant for murder and ordering a new trial.

C.P. Hope, Q.C. for the
appellant.

C.L. Dubin, Q.C. and J.
Agro for the respondent.

[Page 440]



The
judgment of Kerwin C.J., Estey, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. (dissenting) was
delivered by:—



ESTEY
J.:—Upon the respondent’s appeal from his
conviction for murder a new trial was directed. The Crown appeals to this Court
and, as I am in respectful agreement with the learned judges of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1] that a new trial must be
had, only a brief outline of the facts will be given.










The
respondent was married in Italy. In 1952 he came to Canada, leaving his wife
and two infant children in Italy. At St. Catharines he obtained employment
and each month sent back to Italy sums of money varying from $35 to $50. In
correspondence received from certain of his friends and relatives residing in
Italy he was advised that his wife had been unfaithful to him and had, in a
hospital, suffered an abortion. He, however, arranged for his wife and children
to come to Canada and they arrived at Halifax in July, 1954, where he met them.
They at once proceeded to St. Catharines, arriving there in the forenoon
of July 27 and going immediately to the home of his brother with whom he had
been living. After lunch, at the home of his brother, he and his wife went
upstairs. He admits that he asked her to go, and for the purpose of marital
relations, and, while she did not refuse, her attitude was rather cold toward
him and she said “I cannot have any more
children” and in reply to his
question asking the reason she explained that “she was in hospital and had an
abortion.” Because of this admission
on the part of his wife he says he lost his self-control and, as her body
indicates, he seized her by the neck and strangled, her. When he realized she
was dead he went downstairs, intimated to his sister-in-law what he had done,
hired a taxi and proceeded to the police station, where he informed the police
of what he had done and was placed in custody.



There
can be no doubt, upon the evidence, but that the accused had committed culpable
homicide and the real issue turned upon whether he had suffered such provocation
as would reduce his offence from murder to manslaughter.



Counsel
for the Crown contended that the words attributed to the deceased by the
respondent, which he deposed caused him to lose his self-control, did not
amount,

in law,
to provocation for the reason that these words repeated only what he already
had been told and which, upon the evidence, he at least at one time believed.
The Code, in s. 261(2), defines provocation as “any wrongful act or insult,
of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power
of self-control.” It was not contested that
if the words attributed to the deceased conveyed the information for the first
time that they would provide evidence from which a jury might find provocation.
It will be noted that the Code does not provide that the words used must convey
something theretofore unknown to the accused, nor, as a matter of principle,
can it be said that repetition might not constitute provocation. If Parliament
had so intended, it would no doubt have used apt words to that effect. In both Rex v.
Krawchuk[2] and Taylor v. The King[3], the accused had knowledge
of the relationship existing between his wife and another man. It is true that
the words in each of these cases were spoken at the time of a new or fresh
wrongful act. In this case, however, it must be acknowledged that it is one
thing to hear from friends and relatives and quite another matter to have the
admission made by the wife herself. More particularly would that be so with
respect to one in the position of the accused who deposed that, notwithstanding
what he had heard, he continued to forward funds for the support of his wife
and children, had decided to forgive, purchase a house and make a new home. As
he stated: “I was going to forget about
all what happened in Italy, and start a new life here,” and again to his wife on the train: “This is a new country, a
new land, and we are to start a new life.” It, however, cannot be doubted but
that the fact that nothing new was expressed would be taken into consideration
by the jury in determining whether an ordinary person would thereby be deprived
of the power of self‑control and, if so, it would also be material in
considering the further question whether or not the accused was actually “deprived of the power of
self-control by the provocation which he received.”



At the
trial it was the contention of the Crown that the accused had brought his wife
out from Italy with the intention of taking her life and that he had, on July
27, carried out that intention and was consequently guilty of murder.

[Page 442]



The
main contention on behalf of the respondent was that he had never believed that
his wife had been unfaithful; that he at all times loved her and never intended
to kill her and did so entirely because of her admission upon the day in question.
While, therefore, apparently not pressed at the trial, it has been submitted on
behalf of the respondent, both in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, that
there was evidence which supported an alternative defence to the effect that
even if the respondent had, as late as July 18 (when in a letter to his
brothers and sister-in-law he expressed such an intention), intended to murder
his wife upon her coming to Canada, that he had thereafter forgiven her and
decided to buy a house and make a home for his wife and family in this country;
that, therefore, at all relevant times he had no intention of killing his wife.
The record discloses evidence which, if believed, would support such a defence.
I am, therefore, in agreement with the teamed judges of the Court of Appeal
that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to instruct the jury with regard
thereto in a manner that they would appreciate the relevant law and the
evidence in relation thereto. The language of Sir Lyman Duff is appropriate:



The
able and experienced judge who presided at the trial properly directed the
attention of the jury to the defence as it was put before them by counsel for
the prisoner; and, having done this, he did not ask them to apply their minds
to the further issue we have just defined. It was the prisoner’s right, however,
notwithstanding the course of his counsel at the trial, to have the jury
instructed upon this feature of the case. We think, therefore, that there must
be a new trial. MacAskill v. The King[4].










The
learned judges in the Court of Appeal directed a new trial, not only on the
foregoing ground, but also on the ground that the learned trial judge had
failed to charge the jury that they might believe all or any part, or
disbelieve all or any part, of the evidence of a witness, including the
accused. This instruction would appear to be particularly important in this
case where the oral testimony given by the accused was, in material respects,
in conflict with the letter to his brothers and sister-in-law and to his
statement made to the police.



I am
also in respectful agreement with the learned judges in the Court of Appeal in
their conclusion that the learned trial judge, while instructing the jury in
general terms with

[Page 443]



respect
to reasonable doubt, did not make it sufficiently clear that if, in respect to
provocation, they entertained a reasonable doubt, the accused should be given
the benefit thereof. This conclusion is supported by the observations of
Viscount Sankey:



When
evidence of death and malice has been given (this is a question for the jury)
the accused is entitled to show, by evidence or by examination of the
circumstances adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death
was either unintentional or provoked. If the jury are either satisfied with his
explanation or, upon a review of all the evidence, are left in reasonable doubt
whether, even if his explanation be not accepted, the act was unintentional or
provoked, the prisoner is entitled to be acquitted. Woolmington v. The
Director of Public Prosecutions[5].



The
appeal should be dismissed.



The
judgment of Taschereau, Rand and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—



RAND
J.:—I confine myself to a brief
statement of the reasons for which I think the appeal of the Attorney General
should prevail.



The
only ground urged by Mr. Dubin which calls for consideration relates to
provocation. What s. 261 of the Code provides for is “sudden provocation”, and it must be acted upon
by the accused “on the sudden and before
there has been time for his passion to cool”. “Suddenness” must characterize both the insult and
the act of retaliation. The question here is whether there was any evidence on
which the jury, acting judicially, could find the existence of “sudden provocation”.



I take
that expression to mean that the wrongful act or insult must strike upon a mind
unprepared for it, that it must make an unexpected impact that takes the
understanding by surprise and sets the passions aflame. What was there of that
here?










On the
evidence furnished by the accused himself, in his testimony, in letters written
three days before leaving St. Catharines to meet his family arriving at
Halifax, in statements made to the police immediately following the death of
his wife, and from the words spoken to his sister-in-law as he came downstairs,
“What I had to do is done”, it is indisputable that
for months he had been burning within over the news of his wife’s conduct received from
Italy. But

[Page 444]



it is
argued that in the prospect of rejoining his family the past was put behind him
and that he met his wife with open arms and in a happy and reconciled spirit;
and I will assume that that is a true description of his state of mind at the
time.



But he
found his wife cold. To questions put to her on the train, she suggested that
they might separate, and he put no more. Within one hour of her arrival at the
home of his brother-in-law where his family were to have their temporary home,
she was a corpse by noiseless strangling at his hands. What she told him in the
bedroom, and all that can be claimed to be provocative, was that she could not
have more children because of an operation for abortion. What he had so fully
foretold in his letters of July 18 had, nine days later, come to pass.



He had
learned of the operation from the information received months before and it was
one of the thoughts he had lived with during the period of waiting. I have no
hesitation in holding that what was said could not, in the circumstances,
amount to “sudden provocation”. The words furnished not
the provocation but the release of his pent up determination to carry out what
he had deliberately decided upon, as he put it, to avenge his family honour.



It may
be that such a code is recognized in Bagaladi as a mitigation of the law’s severest sanction, but it
has no place in the law of this country. Any abatement of the consequences of
such an act can here come only from the executive. I cannot imagine any
encroachment on the inviolability of the individual more dangerous than that such
a palliation should be countenanced by the courts.



I would
allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial.



The
judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by:—



KELLOCK
J.:—S. 261  of the Criminal
Code  is as follows:










Culpable
homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if
the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation.



2.
Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the
offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his
passion to cool.

[Page 445]



3.
Whether or not any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation,
and whether or not the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of
self-control by the provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact:
Provided that no one shall be held to give provocation to another by doing that
which he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything which the offender
incited him to do in order to provide the offender with an excuse for killing
or doing bodily harm to any person.



It
would seem plain that if what is relied upon as constituting provocation is an
act, the question as to whether or not there is any evidence of a “wrongful” act is one of law for the
court. It is equally a question of law as to whether or not, in any given case,
there is any evidence of “insult”; Taylor v. The King[6].



Provided
the act or insult be wrongful, it must, to constitute provocation, be (a)
such as would cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and (b)
to have produced abrupt reaction on the part of the offender without time for
deliberation; s-s. (2). Whether the particular act or insult amounts to
provocation and whether the offender was, in fact, deprived of self-control by
it are, by s-s. (3), to be considered questions of fact.



Moreover,
the question as to whether the provocation was “sudden”, as provided by s-s. (1), must be
established by evidence, and the question as to whether or not there is any
evidence of sudden provocation is also a question of law.



According
to the Oxford Dictionary, to which I had occasion to refer in Taylor v. The
King, supra, at 475, an insult is defined, inter alia, as



injuriously
contemptuous speech or behaviour; scornful utterance or action intended to
wound self-respect; an affront; indignity.



The
case at bar requires consideration first as to what was the insult, if any,
involved in what the deceased said to the appellant, as related by him,
immediately prior to the killing, and whether there was anything “sudden” about the statement so
made.










It has
long been considered that circumstances more wounding or more calculated to
cause the loss of self-control cannot be imagined than the discovery by a
husband of his wife in the act of adultery. Accordingly, sudden discovery of
the fact constitutes sufficient provocation either at common law or under the Criminal
Code . Once a husband has

[Page 446]



become
aware, however, subsequent mention by a wife to him of the same act, although
it may cause a reassertion of anger on the part of the husband, cannot
constitute legal provocation unless, for example, there be something new in the
nature of a taunt as in Taylor’s case.



Whether
the husband becomes aware of the fact of adultery by his own discovery, by his
wife’s confession or by other
information, can make no difference from this standpoint. The “insult” is received upon discovery
of the fact. It is therefore not possible to regard a confession on the part of
a wife as a new indignity or affront if the husband already knows of the
occurrence which is the subject of the confession.



If,
upon becoming aware of the fact, the husband determines to kill his wife, he
may rely upon provocation in reduction of his crime from murder to manslaughter
only if he acts “on the sudden” before there has been time
for his passion to cool. The suggestion that if such an intention, once formed,
was given up but was renewed upon subsequent mention of the previous
information may be relied upon as “sudden” provocation, is a
contention which, as I view the provisions of s. 261 , I cannot accept. It lacks
the element of “suddenness” which the
section expressly requires. The English cases on the subject are, in my
opinion, applicable under the law as laid down in the section.










In Regina
v. Rothwell[7], Blackburn J., in summing
up to the jury, instructed them as to the law then prevailing in England that
as a general rule no provocation by words only will reduce murder to
manslaughter but that this is not an invariable rule and that if a husband suddenly
hearing from his wife that she had committed adultery and were thereupon to
kill his wife, this might be manslaughter “he having had no idea of such a thing
before”. The decision of the Court
of Criminal Appeal in Palmer’s case[8] illuminates the point
further. In that case, at p. 210, Channell J., stated the reason for the
exception to the rule in England that the nature of such words renders the
confession equivalent “to the discovery of the act”. It is perfectly plain
that there can be no more than one “discovery” of the same act.

[Page 447]



In R.
v. Leonard Holmes[9], the appellant had killed
his wife partly by hitting her with a hammer and eventually by strangling her
immediately after her confession that she had been untrue to him. In a
statement he admitted having previously had suspicions of her. Wrottesley J., in
the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 525:



It
is not therefore surprising to find that one form of provocation which would
reduce what would be murder to manslaughter is the sudden discovery by a
husband of his wife in the act of adultery;



On the
following page the learned judge, after referring to the decisions which
establish that a sudden confession by a wife of adultery constitutes an
exception to the general rule that provocation by words alone is not sufficient
in England, continued at p. 526:



The
appellant in the case before us was not informed of something of which he had
no idea before hand… To hold that a killing in
these circumstances could fall within the exception of the general rule that no
words are sufficient provocation would be to extend the exception in two
directions: first, to a case where the husband, himself unfaithful, had—and for some time had had—an idea that his wife had
been unfaithful; and secondly…



which
is irrelevant for present purposes as are the words I have omitted from the
above quotation relating to the manner by which death was produced.



In the
case at bar there is no question but that the respondent already knew and had
for some time known what was involved in the statement made by his wife to him
immediately before the tragedy.



In the
letter left by the respondent on July 18, 1954, for his brothers and
sister-in-law, he states:



I
am leaving this note; naturally you know by now what happened in Italy and I
know it too… I knew more than you but I
could not show it… I don’t know what to do, that
dishonest mother wanted her children to be orphans. She thought that I did not
know anything and would not have the courage to kill the bad woman.



In a
postscript addressed to one brother he said:










Open
your eyes because I cannot see anything myself, I am going to die to cancel my
dishonour and the dishonour of my family… I got the most dishonest woman on
earth.



Again,
in his statement to the police of July 29, he said:



… I didn’t show any feeling or I
didn’t let people understand
that I knew what was happening over there… and I didn’t want them to

[Page 448]



write
to Bagaladi (where his wife resided) and tell them that I knew everything and
I didn’t write over there
explaining how much I knew thinking that my wife wouldn’t come here.



As the
Court of Appeal has said,



… the remainder or statement
of the wife… in reality would appear to
mean no more than the appellant already knew or believed to be so.



In
these circumstances, there was, in my opinion, no evidence of sudden
provocation within the meaning of s. 261 .



I would
allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

Appeal allowed and
conviction restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT
OF QUEEN’S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Testimony of accomplice—Whether corroborated—Whether admission made by
accused was corroboration—Whether fact that accused has previously changed his
plea from guilty to not guilty could be taken as corroboration.

The appellant was
convicted of having broken and entered a shop with intent to commit a theft.
The Crown’s case was supported by the testimony of a person whom the trial
judge regarded as an accomplice but whose evidence he found was corroborated by
(1) an admission made by the appellant and received in evidence by the trial
judge, and (2) by the fact that the appellant had previously entered a plea of
guilty, which had been withdrawn by leave of the Court. The conviction was
affirmed by the Court of Appeal and leave to appeal to this Court was granted
on the question as to whether there had been error in the acceptance of these
two items as legal corroboration.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

Per Kerwin C.J., Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: At any
time before sentence the Court has power to permit a plea of guilty to be
withdrawn, and that decision rests in the discretion of the judge and will not
be

[Page 647]

lightly interfered with if
exercised judicially. The original plea should then be treated, for all
purposes, as if it had never been made. Consequently, the evidence that an
accused had previously pleaded guilty to the charge but had been allowed to
withdraw such plea, is legally inadmissible.

There was also error in
admitting in evidence the statement made by the accused, as it cannot be safely
affirmed that the trial judge would have decided to admit it if he had not been
influenced, as appears clearly in his judgment, by the evidence of the plea of
guilty.

On the properly admitted
evidence in the record it would have been unreasonable to convict the
appellant.

Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: The decision to allow
the withdrawal of a plea of guilty rests with the discretion of the judge, and
if that discretion is exercised judicially the Appeal Courts will not interfere
unless there exists serious reasons. Like considerations should guide the trial
judge in deciding whether a withdrawn plea of guilty should be used in evidence
to implicate the accused. In the case at bar there was nothing to suggest that
this should have been permitted.

In these circumstances, it
was illegal to use this withdrawn plea of guilty in the consideration of the
question of the admissibility of the confession. Furthermore, that statement
was exculpatory, and if the trial judge had the right to disbelieve all or part
of it, he had no right to supply to it, as he did, what was not in it.

The remaining evidence in
the record would not reasonably justify a verdict of guilty.

APPEAL from the
judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec,
affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge laid under s. 461  of the Criminal
Code .

A. Villeneuve for the appellant.

R. Dugré, Q.C.
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.
was delivered by:—

Cartwright
J. :—This is an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench for the Province of Quebec (Appeal Side)
pronounced on November 22, 1954, affirming, without written reasons, the
judgment of Judge Delaney a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace delivered on
March 29, 1954, whereby the appellant was convicted of having, during the night
of October 16-17, 1952, broken and entered a shop with intent to commit the
theft of a safe, contrary to s. 461  of the Criminal Code , and was
sentenced to two years imprisonment.

[Page 648]

On December 22, 1954, my
brother Abbott granted leave to appeal upon the following question of law:—

Did the trial judge err
(without first giving his opinion on the conflicting evidence) in accepting as
legal corroboration of an alleged accomplice (a) an alleged confession
made by the accused and accepted on voir dire and (b) a previous plea of
guilty subsequently changed to not guilty, by the accused?

The theory of the Crown was that the offence charged in the
indictment had been committed by four persons, namely, Dufour, Aubin,
the appellant’s brother Jean Paul Thibodeau, and the appellant; that the
appellant had driven the other three in his automobile to the shop for the
purpose of committing the offence; that Aubin had broken a
window to effect the entry; that Aubin, Dufour and Jean
Paul Thibodeau had entered the shop and put the safe out through the window;
that the appellant had placed his car close to this window so that the others
could put the safe in the car; that after the safe had been removed from the
building, but before it had been placed in the car, the owner of the shop, who
had been warned by an alarm connected from the shop to his house, approached
the scene with a flash-light and the four persons mentioned above drove away in
the car leaving the safe on the ground. The owner did not recognize any of the
culprits nor did he get the licence number of the car.

The appellant was arrested in June 1953. He was indicted and
tried separately. At the trial evidence was given by the four persons named
above. The evidence of Dufour supported the theory of the Crown as outlined
above. At the time of giving his evidence Dufour had already been convicted and
sentenced for the same offence as that with which the appellant was charged.
There were discrepancies between the evidence Dufour gave at the trial and that
which he had given at a previous hearing. There was evidence, which he denied,
that he had a grudge against the appellant and had threatened to get even with
him. Aubin admitted his own participation in the offence
but stated that the appellant had had nothing to do with it. Both Jean Paul
Thibodeau and the appellant denied having been present at the time of the crime
or having had anything to do with it.

[Page 649]

It is obvious that if
the appellant took part in the commission of the offence charged Dufour was an
accomplice. The learned trial judge so regarded him but was of opinion that
there were two items of evidence corroborating his story. These were (i) a
statement in writing said to have been made by the appellant to a police
officer, and (ii) the fact that the appellant when first arraigned on the
charge before Judge Boisvert had pleaded guilty. It will be convenient to deal
first with the second of these items.

The only indication in
the record that the appellant had at any time entered a plea of guilty is
contained in the appellant’s cross-examination on the voir dire held for the
purpose of determining whether or not the written statement alleged to have
been made to the police officer should be admitted in evidence. I propose,
however, to deal with the matter on the assumption, made by the learned trial
judge in his reasons for judgment, that evidence had been tendered and received
proving the fact of the appellant having pleaded guilty. The appellant was
arrested on June 16, 1953. On the following day he was arraigned before Judge
Boisvert and pleaded guilty. On this occasion the appellant was not represented
by counsel. This plea having been entered the learned Judge adjourned the
matter to June 23, 1953, for sentence. On this last mentioned date, before
sentence was passed, counsel for the appellant asked permission to withdraw the
plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty. Permission to do this was
granted by Judge Boisvert and a plea of not guilty was entered.

On February 1, 1954, the
case came before Judge Delaney. The only plea in the record was one of not
guilty. The charge was read to the appellant and he again pleaded not guilty.
The case was adjourned and finally came on for trial before Judge Delaney on
March 22, 1954. What then occurred is set out as follows in the Proces-Verbal:—

22 mars 1954

L’accusé est trouvé coupable et condamné à
deux (2) ans de pénitencier. (Voir jugement écrit au
dossier). Mandat d’emprisonnement émis.

The record in case 12939 consisted of
the evidence, called by the Crown, of Bourque the owner of the store broken
into, his daughter Lidia Bourque, Dufour, Aubin, Laroche a
police officer, and Poulin from whom the appellant had purchased his
automobile, and the evidence, called by the defence, of the appellant Adrien Thibodeau, and of two ladies who gave evidence in support
of an alibi for both Jean-Paul Thibodeau and the appellant. The record included
the deposition of Dufour at the preliminary inquiry. Nowhere in this record was
there any mention of the appellant having at one time pleaded guilty.

Immediately following the filing of this record, Laroche and the appellant were examined and cross-examined on
the voir dire for the purpose of determining whether the statement, dated June
16, 1953, later filed as Exhibit P-l, should be admitted in evidence. This
statement was written out, in the form of question and answer, by the police
officer and consisted of two separate sheets, the second of which only was
signed by the appellant. The police officer stated that he did not give the
statement to the appellant to read but that he had read it to him before he
signed it. The appellant’s evidence was that he had made a statement in answer
to questions put to him by the police officer but that it was substantially
different from the statement produced. The statement which the appellant said
he had made to the officer would not have afforded any corroboration of
Dufour’s evidence but the statement produced by

[Page 651]

the officer was capable of being regarded as corroboration
as it contained an admission by the appellant that he had been present at the
scene and time of the crime.

The cross-examination of the appellant on the voir dire
concluded as follows:—

Q. Vous avez comparu devant de Juge Boisvert?

R. Oui.

Q. Vous avez
plaidé coupable?

R. Oui.

Q. Ca c’était le
dix-sept (17) de juin; votre sentence a été ajournée au
vingt-trois (23) de juin?

R. Oui.

Q. Là, vous avez pris un avocat?

R. Oui.

Q. Vous avez
obtenu la permission de changer votre plaidoyer de culpabilité?

R. Oui.

Q. C’est le
lendemain que vous êtes venu ici devant le Juge Boisvert?

R. Oui.

Q. Vous avez plaidé coupable quand ils vous
ont lu l’accusation?

R. Monsieur Laroche est venu me chercher pour
m’amener devant le Juge. Il m’a dit: “écoute là, fais un homme de toi,
tiens-toi droit et quand le Juge va te demander coupable ou non coupable, tu
diras coupable”

Q. Vous dites que c’est lui qui vous a dit de dire
ça?

R. Oui monsier je le jure. Je connaissais rien
là-dedans, j’avais jamais été arrêté à nulle part, je connaissais rien
là-dedans.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Vous pensiez
que coupable et non coupable c’était pareil, c’était la même chose pour vous?

R. Oui. Je connaissais pas ça.

Q. Vous pensiez que c’était la même chose ;
coupable ou non coupable c’était la même chose pour vous?.

R. Je pensais que c’était la même chose. Je
lui ai dit: si je dis coupable, ils peuvent-y me garder? Il dit: non, ils te
garderont pas, c’est pas toi qui es là-dedans, c’est Dufour et Aubin et ton
frére, c’est pas toi certain, t’as pas besoin d’avoir peur’; c’est là que j’ai
dit coupable, c’est pour ça que j’ai dit coupable.

Q. Le vingt-trois (23), une
semaine après, vous êtes revenu devant le même Juge avec un avocat, l’avocat
Nadeau?

R. Oui.

Q. Là, vous avez
obtenu la permission de changer votre plaidoyer?

R. Oui.

Q. Vous avez eu
une enquête préliminaire?

R. Oui.

Laroche, although present, was not re-called and the
appellant’s evidence as to why he pleaded guilty is uncontradicted.

[Page 652]

Following this the learned trial judge gave judgment on the
voir dire holding that the statement was made freely and voluntarily and should
be received in evidence. In his reasons he said in part:—

L’accusé nous dit ensuite qu’il a comparu
devant un Juge, qu’il a plaidé coupable, qu’il ne savait pas ce que ça voulait
dire, un homme de vingt-et-un ans, il ne voyait pas de différence entre un
plaidoyer de culpabilité et un plaidoyer de non culpabilité. Il ne me semble
pas que je serais justifiable, par ces simples constations, d’admettre le
témoignage de l’accusé pour jeter un doute sur l’officier de police …

At the conclusion of the trial the learned judge reserved his judgment until
March 29, 1954. On that date he convicted the appellant. In his reasons the
learned judge having stated that Dufour’s evidence incriminated the appellant
and that Dufour was an accomplice instructed himself as follows:—

La doctrine veut que le Juge, en appréciant la
preuve, doit se rappeler qu’il est fort dangereux de condamner sur le
témoignage non corroboré d’un complice, mais il a le pouvoir et il doit le
faire si par ailleurs il accorde une croyance entière et absolue aux complices.

With respect this does not conform to
the law as laid down in this Court in Vigeant v. The King 1, followed in Boulianne
v. The King 2.
In the latter case at page 622 Anglin C.J.C., giving the judgment of the
majority of the Court said:—

… the majority of us are of the opinion that there
was misdirection in a material matter, in that the learned judge, although he
warned the jury properly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice, further instructed them, in effect, that if they
believed his evidence, although not corroborated, it was their duty to convict
…

It is never correct
to say that the jury, or the judge trying a case without a jury, ought to
convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.

The learned judge then
proceeded to deal with the question whether there was corroboration of Dufour’s
evidence and also with the defence of alibi in the following passage:—

Son témoignage est-il corroboré? Il y a
d’abord la confession que j’ai déclarée avoir été faite librement et
volontairement et qui est au dossier. Dans sa confession, il n’admet pas sa participation
directe au crime, mais admet s’être rendu et dans l’après-midi et le soir à
l’endroit où l’effraction a été commise et avoir attendu les autres dans le
char. Son témoignage est également corroboré par son admission de culpabilité
qu’il a faite lors de sa comparution. Il a été arrêté, il a comparu devant
monsieur le Juge

[Page 653]

Boisvert, a plaidé coupable à l’accusation
telle que portée. Le Juge a ajourné sa sentence à quelques jours et lorsque le
jour de la sentence est venu, l’accusé, représenté par un savant procureur, a
demandé de changer son plaidoyer. La Cour lui a permis de changer son
plaidoyer. Je trouve une corroboration du témoignage de
Dufour dans la confession de l’accusé, dans le fait qu’il a plaidé coupable,
surtout lorsque ce fait n’est pas expliqué d’une façon raisonnable. Lorsque la
Cour lui demande pourquoi il avait décidé de plaider coupable, il nous dit
qu’il ne savait pas la différence entre un plaidoyer de culpabilité et un
plaidoyer de non culpabilité. Il me semble qu’une excuse de cette nature là ne
peut pas avoir grand attention et grand mérite auprès de la Cour. Son ami et
complice avait plaidé coupable, il était déjà condamné à la prison, il n’était
pas sans le savoir, et il savait bien la différence entre plaider coupable et
plaider non coupable. L’accusé Thibodeau a témoigné; il a nié sa participation.
Sa négation, en face de sa confession, ne peut valoir. De plus, il a fait
entendre des témoins pour faire une preuve d’alibi, preuve par une dame et sa
fille, amie d’un des accusés. Ils ont témoigné que les deux Thibodeau étaient
chez eux l’après-midi du crime, qu’ils sont restés là pendant trois jours,
qu’ils ne sont pas sortis ni l’un ni l’autre, que c’était la fête de l’un des
deux, que la fête a été célébrée chez elle le samedi.

Ils seraient arrivés chez elle le jeudi et ils
seraient restés là jusqu’au samedi. Cet alibi n’a pas été présenté à l’enquête
préliminaire. Je comprends que l’alibi doit être présenté dans le plus bref
délai possible, mais que ceci veut pas dire que l’alibi présenté au procès ne
peut avoir aucune importance, mais il perd sûrement de sa valeur, et dans ce
cas-ci je ne peux pas apporter foi à l’alibi, en présence de la confession
libre et volontaire, du témoignage de Dufour et également du plaidoyer de
culpabilité de l’accusé.

It will be observed that in reaching his judgment on
the voir dire, that the statement made to Laroche should
be admitted in evidence, the learned trial judge was influenced by the fact
that the accused had pleaded guilty; and that in reaching his judgment at the
conclusion of the trial he was influenced by both the statement to Laroche and the fact of the plea of guilty in (i) accepting the
evidence of Dufour and (ii) rejecting the defence of alibi.

In approaching the question whether the judge presiding at
the trial of an accused who has pleaded not guilty should admit evidence that
the accused previously pleaded guilty to the charge but was permitted to
withdraw such plea it may first be observed that it is clear that at any time
before sentence the Court has power to permit a plea of guilty to be withdrawn.
As to this it is sufficient to refer to the following cases; R. v. Plummer
3, The King v.
Lamothe 4,
R. v. Guay 5,
and R. v. Nelson 6.
These cases make it equally clear that the decision whether or not

[Page 654]

permission to withdraw a plea of guilty
should be given rests in the discretion of the Judge to whom the application
for such permission is made and that this discretion, if exercised judicially,
will not be lightly interfered with.

Counsel informed us that
they had not been able to find any reported case in the courts of this country
or in England in which the question now under consideration has been
considered. This may at first seem surprising as there must have been many
cases in which a plea of guilty was permitted to be withdrawn and the accused
went to trial on a plea of not guilty; but it seems probable that the true
explanation of the lack of authority is that suggested by counsel for the
defence when he says in his factum:—

Il nous semble
qu’il répugne qu’on puisse se servir contre un accusé de son changement de
plaidoyer pour arriver à l’incriminer. Il nous semble que ceci irait contre les
droits primordiaux d’un accusé selon notre organisation de justice pénale.
C’est sans doute pour cette raison que nous avons cherché en vain de la
jurisprudence sur ce point.

It is, I think, an
inference that may fairly be drawn from the dearth of authority that whenever
it has been tendered the courts have refused to admit evidence that an accused
had entered a plea of guilty to the charge upon which he was on trial which had
later been withdrawn by leave of the Court. It is highly improbable that such
evidence should have been admitted and no redress sought in an appellate
tribunal. Be this as it may, I am of opinion that, where a plea of guilty has
been withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted by leave of the Court, the
Judge before whom the case comes for trial following the plea of not guilty
should assume that the Judge who granted leave to change the plea did so on
sufficient grounds and should treat the original plea, for all purposes, as if
it had never been made.

In Wigmore on
Evidence 3rd Edition, Vol. IV, page 66, s. 1067, the learned author says:—

For criminal cases (where a withdrawn plea of guilty
is later offered) the few authorities are divided.

I have examined the authorities referred to and prefer
the reasoning of those judges who have held the evidence in question
inadmissible. In my opinion the dissenting judg-

[Page 655]

ment of Wheeler J. in State v. Carta 7, deals satisfactorily with the question and
reaches the right conclusion. I refer particularly to the following passage at
page 415:—

Considerations of fairness would seem to forbid a court
permitting for cause a plea to be withdrawn, and at the next moment allowing
the fact of the plea having been made, with all its injurious consequences, to
be admitted in evidence as an admission or confession of guilt by the accused.
The withdrawal is permitted because the plea was originally improperly entered.
No untoward judicial effect should result from the judicial rectification of a
judicial wrong.

The majority hold that the fact that the former plea may be
explained will be a sufficient protection to the accused. Such a ruling places
upon him a burden of disproving a fact which does not exist; for the withdrawal
eradicated it. It brings him before the jury under the heavy cloud of suspicion
created by his plea of guilty when he is entitled to come before the jury with
the presumption of innocence shielding him. It makes him prove again that his
plea was wrongly entered when that, fact has already been judicially
ascertained and settled by a court of competent jurisdiction and cannot be
opened unless a higher court finds an abuse of that court’s discretion.

For the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that on
the trial of an accused who has pleaded not guilty evidence that he had
previously pleaded guilty to the charge but had been allowed to withdraw such
plea is legally inadmissible; from which it, of course, follows that evidence
of the former plea can neither be given for the prosecution nor elicited from
the accused in cross-examination.

It should perhaps be mentioned in passing, that, even if the
question of the admissibility of evidence of the withdrawn plea in the case at
bar had fallen to be determined under the rules regarding extra-judicial
confessions, the evidence ought clearly to have been rejected in view of the
uncontradicted evidence quoted above as to the representations made by a person
in authority to the appellant while in custody which influenced him to enter
the plea.

For the above reasons it is my opinion that the learned
trial judge erred in admitting evidence that the appellant had previously
entered a plea of guilty and in treating such evidence as corroboration of the
evidence of Dufour.

It is next necessary to consider whether the learned trial
judge erred in admitting the written statement Exhibit P.l. After an anxious
consideration of the evidence given on the

[Page 656]

voir dire, I entertain grave doubt as to whether the
prosecution can be said to have discharged the onus of shewing that the
statement should be admitted. It appears to me, moreover, that it cannot safely
be affirmed that the learned judge would have decided to admit the statement if
he had not been influenced by the evidence of the plea of guilty which he ought
to have rejected altogether. That he was so influenced appears clearly from the
passage from his reasons for judgment on the voir dire quoted above. In the
result I conclude that the decision of the learned judge on the voir dire can
not be supported. Apart altogether from what I have said in regard to the
admission of the statement P.l. the wrongful admission of evidence as to the
withdrawn plea of guilty and the very considerable weight given to it by the
learned judge in his reasons for convicting the appellant would be fatal to the
validity of the conviction, which must accordingly be quashed.

It remains to consider what further order should be made.
After a careful reading and re-reading of all the evidence, I am of opinion
that on the evidence in the record which was properly admitted it would have
been unreasonable to convict the appellant and that we ought not to direct a
new trial.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a judgment of acquittal to be entered.

The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered
by:—

Fauteux J.:—L’appelant se pourvoit à l’encontre d’une décision de la Cour d’Appel
confirmant un jugement de culpabilité prononcé contre lui par M. le Juge
Delaney, de la Cour des Sessions de la Paix de la province de Québec.

Les membres de la Cour d’Appel n’ont donné
individuellement aucune raison supportant la décision; et le seul considérant
apparaissant au jugement formel est à l’effet qu’il n’y a pas d’erreur dans le
jugement de première instance.

En toute déférence, il m’est impossible de
concourir dans ces vues. Bref, cette déclaration de culpabilité repose sur le
témoignage du complice Dufour, lequel est contredit par celui d’un autre
complice exonérant l’appelant de toute participation coupable dans l’affaire.
Pour donner effet à la version de Dufour, le Juge de première instance a
erronément, à mon avis, accepté comme corroboration du

[Page 657]

témoignage de ce complice (i) le fait d’un
plaidoyer de culpabilité que l’accusé enregistra d’abord et que M. le Juge
Boisvert, un autre Juge de la même Cour, lui permit subséquemment de retirer
pour y substituer un plaidoyer de non culpabilité; (ii) une prétendue
confession de l’accusé à la police.

(i) Le fait du plaidoyer de culpabilité. Comme
le signale mon collègue le Juge Cartwright en ses notes, il est clair que la
jurisprudence relative à la demande de retrait d’un plaidoyer de culpabilité
établit que la décision sur telle demande teste à la discrétion du Juge à qui
elle est faite et que les tribunaux d’appel n’interviendront pas sans raisons
sérieuses sur cette décision, si cette discrétion a été exercée judicieusement.
Dans le dossier actuel, rien ne suggère qu’une telle intervention eut été
justifiée. A mon avis, l’esprit de cette règle guidant les tribunaux d’appel
sur la question doit également guider le Juge au procès, quant à l’utilisation
en preuve du fait de ce changement de plaidoyer pour impliquer l’accusé. Dans
les circonstances, c’est illégalement que le Juge au procès a accepté comme
preuve corroborant le témoignage du complice, que l’accusé avait d’abord plaidé
coupable à l’accusation.

(ii) La confession. Il faut dire d’abord que
pour conclure à l’admissibilité de cette confession, le Juge a encore pris en
considération le plaidoyer de culpabilité en premier lieu enregistré par
l’accusé; ce qui, pour les raisons déjà indiquées, était illégal. De plus, ces
déclarations faites à la police par l’accusé sont exculpatoires ; elles comportent une négation complète de toute participation coupable
en l’affaire. Sans doute, le Juge avait le droit de ne pas croire à la vérité
de toutes ou partie de ces déclarations; mais ce droit n’implique pas celui de
suppléer aux déclarations ce qu’elles ne comportent pas, soit, en particulier,
comme il est mentionné au jugement de culpabilité, le fait que l’appelant
aurait attendu dans son automobile les personnes impliquées dans cette affaire.
C’est donc affirmativement qu’il faut répondre à la question de droit sur
laquelle permission d’appeler a été donnée, savoir:—

Did the trial Judge err (without first
giving his opinion on the conflicting evidence) in accepting as legal
corroboration of an alleged accomplice (a) an alleged confession made by
the accused and accepted on voir-dire and (b) a previous plea of
guilty, subsequently changed to not guilty, by the accused?

[Page 658]

L’appel doit
être maintenu. Quant à l’ordonnance à rendre, je suis d’avis, comme mon
collègue M. le Juge Cart-wright, que, vidée des illégalités qui s’y trouvent,
la preuve au dossier ne saurait raisonnablement justifier; un verdict de
culpabilité.

Je maintiendrais
l’appel, infirmerais le jugement de culpabilité et ordonnerais l’inscription
d’un jugement et d’un verdict d’acquittement.

ON APPEAL FROM THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL

Criminal Law—Conspiracy—Trial
judge having adequately charged jury as to elements requisite to support charge
of conspiracy refused to indicate difference between crime charged and aiding
and abetting—Whether new trial warranted.

The respondent, following a trial by a judge and jury, was
convicted of conspiring with another to commit the indictable offence of
illegally selling a drug. The trial judge adequately charged the jury as to the
law relating to criminal conspiracy and as to its duty to give the accused the
benefit of any reasonable doubt but, on the grounds that to do so might confuse
the issue, refused accused counsel's request

[Page 616]

to instruct the jury as to the difference in law between
aiding and abetting and conspiring. The accused appealed contending that the
trial judge by his refusal had deprived him of one of his grounds of defence.
The Court of Appeal for British Columbia by a majority judgment allowed the
appeal and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): That it clearly
appeared from the evidence and from the trial judge's address that the only
question left to the jury was whether or not the respondent had agreed to co-operate
with his co-accused to bring about the illegal sale, that they could not
convict unless they could so find, and that the jury clearly understood the
issue to be decided by it.

Held: Also, that there was no obligation on the trial
judge to instruct the jury as to the difference between the crime charged and
another crime for which the accused was not indicted and which the jury was not
called upon to consider.

Per Cartwright J. (dissenting): The objection of
counsel was that when the trial judge came to relate the theory of the defence
to the law, which he had correctly stated, he did so in words which may have
misled the jury, and it could not be said that the conclusion of the majority
of the Court of Appeal, that the jury may have been so misled, was wrong in
law.

Decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1955) 14
W.W.R. 112 reversed and verdict of jury restored.

APPEAL by the Crown on
questions of law from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] allowing respondent's appeal, Sidney Smith J.A.
dissenting, from his conviction before Whittaker J. and a jury and ordering a
new trial.

D. McK. Brown and D. K.
Christie for the appellant.

H. J. McGivern for the
accused, respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Locke
and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX J.:—The respondent and
one Tomilin were found guilty, by a jury, of having conspired together to
commit an indictable offence, namely, to sell a drug to one Smith, contrary to
the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act.

Tomilin did not appeal the
verdict; but respondent did so on several grounds, of which only one found
favour with a majority of the Court of Appeal. The grievance was that the trial
Judge, as required by counsel for the defence, should have instructed the jury

that there is a difference
in law between two people aiding and abetting one another in a crime and in
conspiring to commit a crime and that the mere fact that one aided and abetted
in a crime might not be conspiracy to commit a crime;

[Page 617]

the Court of Appeal found that,
in effect, the refusal of the trial Judge to so direct the jury amounted to a
withdrawal of one of the defences of the accused and constituted in the matter
a ground of substance affecting the verdict. The verdict was then quashed and a
new trial ordered. Hence the appeal of the Crown to this Court.

It is admittedly beyond question
that there is, in the record, evidence justifying a jury, acting judicially, to
find a verdict of guilty against both Tomilin and the respondent, as to the
only offence for which they were indicted, i.e., conspiracy. Reference to the
evidence is therefore unnecessary. It is also conceded that the directions
given to the jury as to the gist and constituent elements of the crime of
conspiracy were adequate; indeed, I am in respectful agreement with Smith J.A.,
dissenting, who said in this respect:—

The trial Judge's conduct of
this whole case bespeaks of the care and thought he bestowed upon its every
phase.

Thus the narrow and simple point
upon which this appeal now falls to be determined is whether, in the absence of
the above direction which the trial Judge refused to give for the reason that
it ""would confuse the issue"", the attention of the jury was plainly
alerted, by the instructions actually given, as to the specific view, it was
necessary for them to form on the evidence, before they could legally return a
verdict of guilty against the two prisoners.

With deference for those who are
of a contrary opinion, a consideration of the whole address leaves no doubt in
my mind that any reasonable jury abiding by the instructions of the trial Judge
could not conclude as to the guilt of the two accused unless convinced beyond
doubt that there existed between them an agreement to co-operate in bringing
about a sale of a drug to Smith. This conclusion is, I think, fully supported
by the following extracts of the address of the Judge:—

The accused person is always
considered innocent until the opposite is proven. The burden is upon the Crown
to prove the guilt of the accused, to prove every material fact necessary for
conviction and prove all the material ingredients of the crime and that it was
committed by these accused.

***

That presumption of
innocence continues until there is put before you a body of evidence which
establishes in your mind beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime alleged has
been committed and that it has been committed by these accused.

[Page 618]

***

The accused are not charged
with selling or attempting to sell a drug nor with possession of drugs; they
are charged with conspiracy to sell a drug.

***

A conspiracy is an agreement
of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful
means. We are concerned only with the first part of the definition that is, a
conspiracy is an agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act.

***

Perhaps I could put it more
simply, that the Crown must prove that the two accused combined together in a
plan to sell a drug to constable Smith.

***

The essence of a crime of
conspiracy is the agreement to co-operate in bringing about the sale of a drug.
As soon as that agreement to co-operate has been formed, the crime is complete.

***

In conspiracy cases, it is
the plot or plan to act together in committing the offence which the law
forbids and punishes.

***

It takes at least two people
to form a conspiracy. Of course it follows that if one is innocent, the other
cannot be guilty.

What constitutes the essence of
the crime of conspiracy was again and otherwise made explicit by the trial
Judge when he dealt with the particular rule of evidence applicable in
conspiracy cases and by the illustrations he then gave on the matter. In this
respect, he said:—

For example, in this case,
the Crown is endeavouring to prove a conspiracy between these two accused. If a
witness had come before you and said: ""I was hiding behind a curtain in a
room and I heard these two men talking together, agreeing together to co-operate
in the sale of drugs to Smith"", that would be direct evidence.

***

It would be obviously
impossible in a great majority of cases, conspiracy cases, for the Crown to
prove that two or more people met together and said: ""Let us enter into an
agreement together to sell drugs to so and so"".

***

A conspiracy may, when the
evidence warrants, be inferred from the conduct of the parties, that is, from
what they said and what they did.

***

Ordinarily, in criminal
cases, anything said or done by one accused not in the presence of the other
accused is not evidence against the other but in conspiracy cases, if the acts
done or statements made are proved to be such as to show from their very nature
that they are part of a common scheme and were in execution or furtherance of
the common scheme, then such facts or statements are evidence against the
other.

[Page 619]

Let us assume, for the
moment, that the man to whom constable Smith spoke on the telephone was the
accused Kravenia. If you find as a fact that Kravenia said to Smith over the
phone: ""Give me your number and I will have Bill call you""; and if
you find as a fact that the accused Kravenia then phoned the accused Tomilin;
and if you think that those two phone communications were steps necessarily
taken in furtherance of a conspiracy between the two accused to sell drugs to
Smith, then you could regard those two acts of Kravenia as evidence against
Tomilin. Also if you find that Tomilin, as a result of a communication which he
received from Kravenia in furtherance of the same conspiracy, telephoned to
Smith and later went out to the Shell Service Station with forty caps of drugs,
you could regard that act of Tomilin as evidence against Kravenia.

With these instructions, the
majority of the Court of Appeal, however, expressed the view that:—

The defence not put to the
jury was that even if the jury found as a fact that the appellant knew from the
telephone inquiries that an unknown person wished to speak to Tomilin in order
to arrange to buy illegal drugs from the latter and that the appellant gave
Tomilin's telephone number to that person and that person's number to Tomilin,
then such knowledge and conduct would not be sufficient to convict the
appellant of conspiracy unless the jury could find as an additional fact that
this knowledge and conduct, tested in the light of all surrounding
circumstances, prove him party to an agreement with Tomilin for the sale of
drugs to Stancil Smith.

With deference, I must say that
the directions actually given to the jury made it very plain that they could
not convict either one of the prisoners of conspiracy and that indeed the two
of them were entitled to an acquittal unless and until they could find, as the
very essential fact in the case, that both had agreed to co-operate together in
bringing about a sale of drugs to Smith.

To the foregoing must be added
that, as further indicated to the jury by the trial Judge, the case as actually
submitted to them by the Crown was ""to draw from all the evidence the
inference that these two accused were working together in disposing of
drugs"", and that, as submitted to them by counsel for the accused, the
defence was, as stated to the police officers by Kravenia, that the latter
""was not in the drug business"", that Kravenia ""denied that from
the beginning to the end"" and that the Crown had failed to prove that the
prisoners had conspired together.

It thus appears from the address
and the actual course of trial before the jury, that the true and only question
they were left with for determination was whether or not the two accused were
engaged in the drug traffic, were co-operating in the same and had planned to
sell drugs to Smith.

[Page 620]

Once, as in this case, a jury is
instructed that they must comply with the directions given as to the law, that
the Crown must prove all the elements of the offence charged, which is single
and does not include a lesser one, and that these elements are clearly
explained, several times and in many ways, any reasonable jury ought to be
taken to have understood that, unless they were convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that all these material elements were proved, it would be a violation of
their oath to return a verdict of guilty of the crime charged. It is not
necessary for the trial Judge to go over the matter again and tell them, what
is necessarily and plainly implied in such directions, that it is not
sufficient if only some of the essential facts are proved. Nor in such case is
there an obligation—but it may be very well confusing—to instruct the jury as
to the differences between the crime charged and another crime for which the
accused is not indicted and as to which they are not called upon to give
consideration and a verdict.

In brief, the real defence of
respondent was that the Crown had failed to prove the only offence charged. The
submission that he might be guilty of another offence was only another way to
express the same defence; the trial Judge, anxious to avoid confusing the jury,
refused to entertain the request of the defence; this refusal did not, in the
slightest, affect the fact that the true defence of the accused was put to the
jury and that what they were plainly required to consider and determine was
whether or not the accused had agreed to co-operate in bringing about the sale
of drugs to Smith.

For these reasons, I would allow
the appeal for the Crown, quash the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore
the verdict of the jury.

ESTEY J.:—The respondent was
convicted of conspiring with Tomilin to commit the indictable offence of
selling a drug contrary to The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The
respondent alone appealed and the appellate court directed a new trial, Mr.
Justice Sydney Smith dissenting. The Crown, in this appeal, asks that the
conviction at trial be restored.

The charge contained no other
count than that of conspiracy. The learned trial judge, in instructing the
jury, explained the relevant law in respect to conspiracy and dis-

[Page 621]

cussed the evidence in relation
thereto so completely and accurately that no exception has been taken thereto.
However, at the conclusion of the charge counsel for the respondent asked that
the learned judge instruct the jury as to the law in respect to aiding and
abetting and that, if the jury found respondent did no more than aid and abet,
he was not guilty of conspiracy. The learned judge refused, being of the
opinion that would but tend to confuse the issue.

The offence of conspiracy is
committed only if it be found that two or more persons agreed to commit an
indictable offence. Once the agreement is made the offence is committed. That
it was not carried out or executed is not an issue. Conspiracy is, therefore,
an offence separate and distinct from the offence in respect to the commission
of which the parties conspired. Rex v. Weiss[2]
(1913) 22 C.C.C. 42; Rex v. Brown[3] .
Lawrence J., in a British case, stated: ""A charge of conspiracy is not the
same as one of aiding and abetting."" Rex v. Kupferberg[4]
. The difference important in this case between the offence of conspiracy and
that of aiding and abetting is that an agreement is not an essential element in
the latter offence. However, in the latter those charged may have acted by
mutual consent, or jointly, or even by virtue of an agreement. It may be added
that, while at common law aiding and abetting was a separate and distinct
offence, under the Criminal Code , by virtue of s. 69 , one who aids and
abets is a party to the principal offence.

The agreement essential to a
conspiracy is not of a type that is normally reduced to writing. Almost
invariably it must be found as an inference or conclusion to be drawn from a
consideration of the conduct, including written or spoken words, of the parties.
Whether there was such an agreement, or whether the parties were acting in
concert, jointly or independently, often presents a problem difficult of
solution and in respect of which confusion may arise where a charge contains a
count of conspiracy and of the substantive offence. Because of this possibility
the authorities indicate that a charge which contains a count of conspiracy and
of the substantive offence, while permissible, imposes upon the presiding judge
a duty to define and distinguish the respective issues with great care. As
stated by

[Page 622]

Sankey J. in Rex v.
Luberg[5]
, where the indictment included a charge of conspiracy in obtaining goods by
false pretences:

It is a perfectly admissible
and proper course to pursue, and a course which is often pursued, but we think
that if that course is pursued, great care and great caution is necessary
during the hearing of the evidence to be quite sure that no evidence is given
which is inadmissible, and great care is required in the summing-up to keep all
the several issues perfectly clear.

See also Rex v. Hill
and McDonald[6]
.

While no other count than that of
conspiracy was included in the judgment, the granting of counsel's request to
instruct the jury with respect to aiding and abetting provided a similar
possibility of confusion. That the learned trial judge had this in mind, both
as he instructed the jury and when refusing the request of counsel on behalf of
the respondent, would appear to be evident from his statement made in the
course of his charge:

The accused are not charged
with selling or attempting to sell a drug, nor with possession of drugs. They
are charged with conspiracy to sell a drug.

A conspiracy is an agreement
of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful
means. We are concerned only with the first part of the definition, that is, a
conspiracy is an agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act.

This is not a case where the
accused was charged with an offence which, under the Criminal Code ,
contains one or more lesser offences. In those cases, where the evidence
justifies it, there is a duty upon the trial judge to instruct the jury that if
they do not find the accused guilty of the major offence they should then
consider whether he is guilty of the lesser offence and should instruct them
with regard thereto. The instruction with respect to the lesser offence is not
by way of a defence to the major charge, but is relevant and to be considered
only if the jury find him not guilty of the major offence.

Respondent's defence was that he
had not agreed with Tomilin and, therefore, had not conspired to commit the
offence of conspiracy as charged. Neither respondent nor Tomilin gave evidence
or called witnesses. The learned trial judge, in the course of his instructions
to the jury, stated:

[Page 623]

Now I come to the defence.
The accused have put the Crown to the proof of the charge against them, as they
are entitled to do. Defence counsel have argued that a case of conspiracy has
not been made out. That is for you to say.

The accused Kravenia stated
to police officers that he was not in the drug business, denied that from
beginning to end; and the defence, as far as Kravenia is concerned, is that all
he did was innocently to give Tomilin Smith's telephone number.

On behalf of the respondent it
was contended that his conduct throughout was that if an innocent man, but,
even if not entirely innocent, it could be no more than an aiding and abetting
of Tomilin and, in any event, it could not support a conclusion that he had
agreed with Tomilin to commit the offence of selling the drug and, therefore,
he was innocent of the offence charged.

In all this the respondent's
defence is that he had not agreed with Tomilin and, therefore, was not guilty.
The learned trial judge, in language that was clear and explicit, made it
abundantly plain that if there was no agreement the respondent was not guilty.
That was the entire issue and, having regard to the evidence adduced and the
charge to the jury, there can be no doubt that the jury clearly understood that
issue. It was in order that the jury might not become confused in respect
thereto that the learned trial judge was prompted to refuse the request of
counsel for the respondent that he should embark upon a discussion of aiding
and abetting.

It is suggested the learned trial
judge, by his statement including the words ""that all he did was
innocently to give Tomilin Smith's telephone number,"" may have misled the
jury to conclude that if they were not satisfied that respondent's relations
with Tomilin were innocent they might conclude that he had conspired as
alleged. It is difficult to conclude that a jury, apart from an affirmative
suggestion not here present, would be so misled as to conclude that by
negativing his innocence, without more, they might arrive at an affirmative
conclusion to the effect that he and Tomilin had conspired. Even if an
inference to that effect might be drawn from such a statement in another
context, when read and construed with the charge as a whole, as it must be, it
would appear, with great respect, that the jury would not be misled. The
learned trial judge had already explained the essentials of the agreement and
made it abundantly clear that in order to find the accused guilty 

[Page 624]

they must find that the
respondent and Tomilin had, in fact. agreed, and it was the conduct of both
parties that had to be considered in order to determine whether such an
agreement had been made. This the learned trial judge emphasized in the
following statement:

So what the Crown must prove
in this case to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt is that between the
6th and 9th days of January, 1954, at the City of Vancouver the
two accused entered into an agreement or had a concerted purpose or a common
design to sell diacetylmorphine hydrochloride to Constable Smith.

Moreover, that the jury would not
be misled to draw such a conclusion or inference from the statement already
referred to is strengthened by the caution which the learned trial judge immediately
gave to the jury in the following terms:

In this case as in most
conspiracy cases, the evidence adduced in proof of the alleged conspiracy is
circumstantial evidence. Where you are asked to infer conspiracy from the
circumstances surrounding the case, as in all cases of circumstantial evidence,
you must, before convicting, find not merely that the circumstances are
consistent with guilt but also that they are inconsistent with innocence.

In my view the jury would not be
misled as suggested. The appeal should be allowed and the conviction at trial
restored.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—On
May 31, 1954, the respondent and one William Tomilin were convicted, after
trial before Whittaker J. and a jury, of conspiring to commit an indictable
offence, namely to sell a drug, to wit diacetyl-morphine hydrochloride (heroin)
to one Smith, without a licence or other lawful authority. The Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, by a majority, allowed the respondent's appeal and
directed a new trial. O'Halloran J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, was of
opinion that a defence open to the respondent on the evidence was not only not
put to the jury by the learned trial judge but was in effect withdrawn from
their consideration. Sidney Smith J.A. dissenting would have dismissed the
appeal being of the view that the charge of the learned trial judge was
sufficient. On this point of law the Attorney-General appeals to this Court
pursuant to s. 1023 (3) (now s. 598 (1)) of the Criminal Code .

[Page 625]

His Lordship proceeded to review
the evidence in some detail and continued:—

It was not argued that there was
not sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict and it was conceded that the
learned trial judge instructed the jury fully and accurately as to the law
relating to criminal conspiracy. He then pointed out to the jury that the
evidence was circumstantial and instructed them as to the rule in Hodge's
Case[7]
. He also instructed them fully as to their duty to give the accused the
benefit of any reasonable doubt. His summary of the evidence was fair and
accurate.

When, towards the end of his
charge, the learned trial judge came to deal with the theories of the defence
he did so as follows:—

Now I come to the defence.
The accused have put the Crown to the proof of the charge against them, as they
are entitled to do. Defence counsel have argued that a case of conspiracy has
not been made out. This is for you to say.

The accused Kravenia stated
to police officers that he was not in the drug business, denied that from
beginning to end; and the defence, as far as Kravenia is concerned, is that all
he did was innocently to give Tomilin Smith's telephone number.

He then concluded his charge by
reminding the jury of the rule in Hodge's Case and as to their duty to
acquit if they had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

The view of the majority in the
Court of Appeal as to the defect in the charge is stated as follows in the
reasons of O'Halloran J.A.:—

The defence not put to the
jury was, that even if the jury found as a fact that appellant knew from the
telephone enquiries that an unknown person wished to speak to Tomilin in order
to arrange to buy illegal drugs from the latter, and that appellant gave
Tomilin's telephone number to that person, and that person's number to Tomilin,
then such knowledge and conduct would not be sufficient to convict appellant of
conspiracy, unless the jury could find as an additional fact, that this
knowledge and conduct tested in the light of all surrounding circumstances
proved him party to an agreement with Tomilin for the sale of drugs to Stancil
Smith.

As Mr. Brown points out, this
passage is open to the construction that the learned Justice of Appeal
mistakenly thought that the evidence was that Smith had told the respondent
that he wished to speak to Tomilin in order to arrange to buy drugs, whereas
actually it indicated that Smith had on each occasion asked for
""Harry"" and that it was the respondent who put forward the name of
Tomilin

[Page 626]

as a prospective vendor, but,
assuming this to be so, I do not regard the suggested mistake as of decisive
importance. The fact that the evidence for the prosecution was even stronger
than the learned Justice of Appeal stated it to be would not affect the duty of
the learned trial judge to place before the jury a defence open to the accused
on the evidence.

The alleged defect in the charge
is that the second of the two paragraphs, quoted above, in which the learned
trial judge dealt with the theories of the defence might mislead the jury into
thinking that if they rejected the submission that the respondent had acted
innocently and found that, in his conversations with Smith, he was acting with
guilty knowledge of the fact that Tomilin was selling drugs and with the guilty
intention of facilitating a sale by Tomilin to Smith, that would be fatal to
the defence of the respondent as ""the"" defence (i.e., the only
defence) as far as he was concerned was that he was acting innocently, and so
might prevent them from directing their minds to the question whether the
respondent might not have done all that he did without any agreement or
arrangement with Tomilin, and thus have been in the position not of a
conspirator but merely of one who, (as it was put by Lawrence J. giving the
judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Kupferberg[8]
""appreciated what was going on and did something to further it.""
Counsel for the defence asked for a direction of the sort which the majority of
the Court of Appeal have held to have been necessary, and, while in my view it was
not incumbent upon the learned trial judge to deal with the law as to aiding
and abetting the commission of an offence, I am of opinion that he should have
acceded to the request of counsel to the extent of giving such further
direction as would have removed the possibility of the jury being misled in the
manner suggested above. It would, I think, have been sufficient if the learned
trial judge had told the jury that, even if they rejected the theory of the
defence, which he had put before them, that all that the respondent did was
innocently done and found that he was acting with the guilty knowledge above
referred to, still, in order to convict they must be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt

[Page 627]

that he was acting in concert
with Tomilin and not merely doing, without agreement, something to further the
guilty purpose of which he was aware.

I feel the force of Mr. Brown's
argument that, in view of the full and clear direction given by the learned
trial judge as to agreement between the accused being an essential element in
the crime of conspiracy, it is difficult to suppose that the jury were misled
by the omission complained of. But the objection of counsel was not that the
learned trial judge had failed to state the law fully and clearly but rather
that when he came to relate the theory of the defence to the law which he had
correctly stated he did so in words which may have misled the jury, and I find
myself unable to say that the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal
that the jury may have been so misled was wrong in law.

In the result, I would dismiss
the appeal.

Appeal allowed and
jury's verdict restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal Law—Manslaughter—Blood test—Obtained without a
warning—Whether confession-rule and privilege-rule applicable—Admissibility of
test—Whether s-ss. 4(d) and 4(e) of s. 285  of Criminal Code  applicable.

The respondent was charged under ss. 262  and 268  of the Criminal
Code  and convicted of motor-manslaughter. At the trial, the Crown, to prove
intoxication, tendered evidence of a blood test taken of the accused while he
was in custody. His consent had been obtained but he had not been warned that
it might be used in evidence against him. Considering that this evidence had
been illegally admitted, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The Crown
obtained leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law: (1)
Was the Court of Appeal right in deciding that s-ss. 4(d) and 4(e)
of s. 285  of the Code enacted in 1951 had no application, and (2) in deciding
that a warning was necessary in this case.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
restored. Cartwright J. would have referred the matter back to the Court of
Appeal for disposal of a ground of appeal and of the appeal as to sentence
which that Court had found unnecessary to consider and which were not argued in
this Court.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J.: The evidence of the
blood test was admissible, and would have been even if the accused had not been
asked and had not given his consent. The matters of admissibility of statements
or admissions and self-incrimination are entirely distinct. In taking a blood
test, the accused does not say anything because he is not asked any questions.

S-ss. 4(d) and 4(e) of s. 285 , enacted in 1951,
have no application. The accused was charged with manslaughter under a
different section of the Code. The contention that the mere fact that
Parliament had provided as it did by these two subsections indicated that it
was not prepared to enact the same provisions with reference to charges other
than those dealt with by these subsections, cannot prevail. In 1951, Parliament
was confining itself to the offences described in s-ss. 4 and 4(a).

Per Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: Under the
general law, as it was before the addition of s-s. 4(d) of s. 285  of the
Code, evidence of a blood test taken without a warning is admissible. The
contrary view is based on a misapprehension of the reason and object of the
confession-rule and of the privilege-rule both of which are related to the very
substance of the declarations made respectively by an

[Page 594]

accused or a witness. The taking of a blood test does not give
rise to the application of these rules nor does the fact that while the method
used to obtain a blood test might be illegal and give rise to civil or criminal
recourses, renders, per se, inadmissible the evidence resulting therefrom.
There does not appear to be in the amendment of 1951 any intention to change
the general law on that point.

APPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of
Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, ordering a new trial in a case of
manslaughter arising out of the driving of an automobile.

Lucien Thinel,
Q.C. for the appellant.

Raymond Daoust for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. was delivered by:—

The Chief
Justice:—The respondent was charged that, while driving
an automobile, ""par son incurie et sa négligence
illégalement causé la mort de trois piétons, savoir: Paul Emile Dorion, Zenon
Longpré & John Hudak,
commettant ainsi un acte criminel, savoir: un homicide involontaire 'manslaughter', le tout tel que décrit aux
articles 262  et 268  du Code Criminel "". He was found
guilty by a jury and sentenced to twenty-three months in jail and an Order was
made prohibiting him from driving a motor vehicle anywhere in Canada for seven
years. The Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) 2 set aside the conviction and directed a new
trial. By an Order of a Member of this Court, leave was granted to the Attorney
General of Quebec to appeal from that decision on the following questions of
law:—

1. Was the Court of
Appeal right in deciding that subsections 4(d) and 4(e) of
section 285  of the Criminal Code  as enacted in 1951 had no application in the
circumstances of this case in view of the fact that the accused was not charged
under the said section 285  but was charged with manslaughter?

2. Was the Court of Appeal right in deciding that on a
charge of manslaughter, evidence as to a blood test to which the accused
submitted, is only admissible, if the accused has been warned that it might be
used in evidence against him?

[Page 595]

As appears from the
second question, the accused had consented to a blood test, but he had not been
warned that it might be used in evidence against him. Before considering s-ss.
4(d) and 4(e) of s. 285  of the Criminal Code , as enacted
in 1951, it might be noted that there has been a divergence of opinion in
Canada on the point mentioned in question 2. In Rex v. Ford 3, Boyd McBride J., of the Alberta Supreme Court,
while finding that the accused did consent and that an adequate warning had
been given, considered that the rules governing the admissibility of
statements, or confessions, of an accused person applied, or at least should be
followed. In Ontario in Rex v. McNamara 4, Schroeder J. decided that there was no analogy
between the taking of a blood sample without consent and the taking of a
statement which was not voluntary. The Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously
affirmed that decision which was followed by Egbert J. in Rex v. McIntyre
5. In the meantime, Roy J. of the Court of
Sessions of the Peace of Quebec, in Rex v. Frechette 6, had decided that the same rule did apply,
stating:

A blood test constitutes
an attack upon the human body and it is not within the power of a Judge to
order it if the law does not authorize it.

An appeal to the
Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) 7 was
dismissed without reasons. In 1949 Marquis J. in Rex v. Gagnon 8, refused to admit evidence of the result of a
blood test.

In the present case the
accused consented, but I agree with the judgment in the McNamara case that even
if he had not been asked and therefore had not consented the evidence would be
admissible. To the same effect is the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal
in England in Rex v. Nowell 9. It was not suggested in that case that force
had been used to examine Nowell and there is no suggestion in the present case
that any force had been exercised. As stated by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council in Kuruma v. The Queen10:

… the test to be applied in considering whether
evidence is admissible is whether it is relevant to the matters in issue.

[Page 596]

And at p. 204, it
was pointed out that

… when it is a question of the admission of
evidence strictly it is not whether the method by which it was obtained is
tortious but excusable but, whether what has been obtained is relevant to the
issue being tried.

It was stated in
that case and, I repeat, we ""are not now concerned with whether an action
for assault would le against the police officers and express no opinion on that
point"".

In my view a confusion has arisen between the rules as to
the admissibility of statements, or admissions, and those relating to
self-incrimination. In taking a blood test the accused does not say anything
because he is not asked any question. Nothing in this judgment is to be taken
as weakening the effect of the rules as to the admissibility of statements, or
admissions, because the two matters are entirely distinct.

The amendments in 1951 to the Criminal Code  have no
application. S-s. (4) of s. 285  had already provided for the offence of
driving, etc., while intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic. In
1951 s-s. 4 (a) created a new offence generally known as impaired ability
to drive. S-s. 4  and s-s. 4 (a), so far as relevant, are as follows:—

(4) Every one who, while intoxicated or under the influence
of any narcotic, drives any motor vehicle or automobile, or has the care or
control of a motor vehicle or automobile, whether it is in motion or not, shall
be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable …

(4a) Every one who, while his ability to drive a
motor vehicle or automobile is impaired by alcohol or any drug, drives any
motor vehicle or automobile, or has the care or control of a motor vehicle or
automobile, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an offence and liable
upon summary conviction or upon conviction under indictment.

S-ss. 4(d) and 4(e) (also enacted in
1951) read:—

4(d) In any proceedings under subsection four or four
a the result of a chemical analysis of a sample of the blood, urine,
breath or other bodily substance of a person may be admitted in evidence on the
issue whether that person was intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic
drug or whether his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol or a drug,
notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave the sample, warned that he need
not give the sample or that the results of the analysis of the sample might be
used in evidence.

(4e) No person is required to give a sample of blood,
urine, breath or other bodily substance for chemical analysis for the purposes
of this section and evidence that a person refused to give such a sample or
that such a sample was not taken is not admissible nor shall such a refusal or
the fact that a sample was not taken be the subject of comment by any persor in
the proceedings.

[Page 597]

In the present case the accused was charged with
manslaughter under a different section of the Code. Counsel for the accused
argued that the mere fact that Parliament had provided as it did by s-ss. 4(d)
and 4(e) indicated that it was not prepared to enact the same
provisions with reference to charges other than those dealt with by those
subsections. In my opinion, this contention is not entitled to prevail. In 1951
Parliament was confining itself to the offences described in s-ss. 4 and 4(a).

The appeal should be allowed and the Order of the Court of
Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) set aside. At the argument counsel did not suggest
that, if the Court came to this conclusion, the conviction should not be
restored and it should be so ordered.

Cartwright J.:—For
the reasons given by my brother Fauteux, I agree with his conclusion that the
Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, erred in law in holding that the evidence
of the result of the analysis of a sample of the respondent's blood was
illegally admitted at the trial. It remains to consider what order should be
made.

As is pointed out by my brother Fauteux, the appeal to the
Court of Queen's Bench against the conviction was based on three grounds. That
Court rejected the first ground, gave effect to the second, and so found it
unnecessary to consider the third. The judgment of the majority of this Court
in The Queen v. McKay 11 indicates that, in deciding
what order we should make, we have jurisdiction to consider this third ground;
but in my view it is not desirable that we should do so in this case as, in
regard to it, we have had neither the benefit of the expression of opinion by
the learned Justices of the Court of Queen's Bench nor the assistance of the
argument of counsel.

For these reasons I would direct that the judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench be set aside and that the matter be referred to that
Court to dispose of the third ground of appeal against the conviction and such
appeal as there may be as to sentence.

[Page 598]

The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered
by:—

Fauteux J.:—Accusé et trouvé coupable d'avoir, dans la
nuit du 24 au 25 avril, 1953, dans le district de Terrebonne, province de Québec, illégalement causé la mort de trois piétons, en
conduisant un véhicule moteur, l'intimé en appela du verdict sur des points
libellés comme suit:—

(i) La preuve telle que faite ne justifie pas
la condamnation de l'accusé;

(ii) L'admission en preuve de la prise de sang
faite sur l'accusé n'a été précédée d'aucun avis ni mise-en-garde et constitue
une confession irrégulière et nulle;

(iii) L'Honorable Juge a erré dans la
directive de droit et de fait aux jurés;

La Cour d'Appel 12 a rejeté le premier grief comme mal fondé. Le
troisième, qui ne comporte d'ailleurs aucune précision, n'a fait l'objet
d'aucun prononcé; on n'a pas cherché à le justifier devant nous; et, à
l'examen, les directives données par le savant Juge au procès ne révèlent
aucune illégalité. Sur le second moyen, cependant, la Cour d'Appel 13 en est venue à la conclusion que l'admission de la preuve résultant de
la prise de sang était illégale. D'où le maintien de l'appel et l'ordonnance
d'un nouveau procès.

Le Procureur Général se pourvoit maintenant
contre ce jugement, après avoir obtenu permission de ce faire, sur deux
questions de droit ainsi formulées:—

(i) Was the Court of Appeal right in deciding that
subsections 4(d) and 4(e) of section 285  of the Criminal Code  as
enacted in 1951 had no application in the circumstances of this case in view of
the fact that the accused was not. charged under the said section 285  but was
charged with manslaughter?

(ii) Was the Court of Appeal right in deciding that on a
charge of manslaughter, evidence as to a blood test to which the accused
submitted, is only admissible, if the accused has been warned that it might be
used in evidence against him?

Au jugement formel de la Cour d'Appel
apparaissent les considérants suivants sur lesquels se fonde cette conclusion
sur l'inadmissibilité de la preuve précitée:—

CONSIDERING that the
only provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to the admission of blood tests
in evidence are set out in subsections 4(d) and 4(e) of Section
285  thereof added in 1951 by the Statute 15 George VI, Chapter 47, Section 14;

[Page 599]

CONSIDERING that the
said statutory provisions are only concerned with driving offences under
Section 285  of the Criminal Code ;

CONSIDERING that as the
said sub-sections provide that no warning is required in connection with the
said offences under Section 285 , it must be assumed that a warning is required
where the more serious charge of manslaughter is concerned;

CONSIDERING that
although Appellant's consent to the blood test was obtained in the present
instance he was not warned that it might be used in evidence against him;

CONSIDERING, therefore,
that such evidence was illegally admitted and that a new trial should
accordingly be ordered;

Ces considérants
résument fidèlement les raisons de jugement de M. le Juge Hyde, auxquelles les autres membres de la Cour ont
souscrit, et manifestent clairement, sur la question de droit à déterminer, la ratio
decidendi du jugement a quo. En somme, on se réfère principalement au
paragraphe 4(d) de l'article 285  prescrivant:—

Dans des procédures prévues par le paragraphe
quatre ou quatre-a, le résultat d'une analyse chimique d'un échantillon du
sang, de l'urine, de l'haleine ou autre substance corporelle d'une personne
peut être admis en preuve sur la question de savoir si cette personne était en
état d'ébriété ou sous l'influence d'un narcotique, ou si sa capacité de
conduire était affiaiblie par l'alcool ou une drogue, bien qu'avant de donner
l'échantillon cette personne n'ait pas été avertie qu'elle n'était pas tenue de
le donner ou que les résultats de l'analyse de l'échantillon pourraient servir
en preuve.

On
interprète ensuite cette disposition tout comme si, en raison de ce qui y est
dit relativement à la mise en garde, le Législateur entendait pourvoir, à titre
de principe nouveau, à l'établissement d'une dispense de la donner et non pas
comme s'il entendait simplement indiquer ex abundanti cautela que
l'absence de mise en garde n'affecte pas l'opération du paragraphe de
l'article. Et du fait qu'on interprète la disposition comme n'ayant
d'application que dans le cas d'offenses concernant la conduite d'un véhicule
moteur, sous l'article 285 ,
on conclut qu'il faut
nécessairement inférer que, dans l'éventualité où cette conduite en violation
des dispositions du même article 285 , a comme
conséquence la mort d'une personne, et qu'une accusation d'homicide
involontaire s'ensuit, la mise en garde est de rigueur. En définitive, on
applique la maxime expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

A mon avis et an toute déférence, la légalité
de l'admissibilité en preuve des conclusions de l'expertise, résultant d'une
prise de sang, non précédée de mise en garde, ne fait aucun doute sous la loi
générale, telle qu'elle était avant et

[Page 600]

telle qu'elle
est demeurée après l'addition du paragraphe 4(d) de l'article 285 . Et si ces vues sont fondées, ainsi que je
tenterai de le démontrer, il en résulte qu'il devient inutile pour les fins de
cet appel, de décider la première question de droit sur laquelle permission
d'appeler a été donnée; car si les prescriptions du paragraphe 4(d) de
l'article 285  ne s'appliquent pas dans le cas
d'homicide involontaire, c'est la loi générale qui régit et, dès lors, la
preuve est admissible; et si, au contraire, ces mêmes
prescriptions s'appliquent dans le cas d'homicide involontaire, la mise en
garde n'est pas nécessaire. Dans les deux cas, le résultat est le même et
l'appel doit être maintenu.

La loi avant l'addition au Code Criminel  du
paragraphe 4(d)
de l'article 285 . La jurisprudence canadienne sur le point s'est divisée. D'une part,
invoquant l'inviolabilité de la personne de l'accusé, les règles gouvernant
l'admissibilité de ses aveux extrajudiciaires et le principe nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare, on a
conclu que les règles régissant l'admissibilité des aveux s'appliquaient ou, au
moins, devaient être suivies, faute de quoi le rapport au procès des
conclusions de l'expertise résultant de la prise de sang était inadmissible. (Rex
v. Ford 14; Rex v.
Fréchette 15 ; Rex v. Gagnon 16). D'autre part,
on a jugé qu'il n'y avait aucune analogie entre la prise de sang sans
consentement et la prise d'une déclaration ou d'une confession non volontaire
et que, ni cette théorie de l'inviolabilité de la personne d'un accusé, ni le
principe nemo tenetur seipsum accusare ne pouvaient justifier la conclusion d'inadmissibilité de cette preuve.
(Rex v. McNamara 17,
confirmée par la Cour d'Appel d'Ontario 18, Rex v. McIntyre 19).

La source du
conflit, dans la jurisprudence canadienne, paraît procéder d'une méprise par
les tenants du premier groupe et non du second, sur la raison et l'objet de la
règle excluant les aveux extrajudiciares de l'accusé et la raison et l'objet de
la maxime nemo tenetur seipsum accusare, assurant à une personne contrainte par la
loi de répondre à des questions, le privilège de faire l'objection qui aura
pour effet d'empêcher que la réponse donnée ne soit utilisée contre elle. La
raison et l'objet de ces deux principes, aussi

[Page 601]

bien que la
différence existant entre eux, sont, de façon concise, indiqués comme suit dans
Wigmore, On Evidence, Vol. 3, 3e éd. (1940) à la page 250:—

The sum and substance of the difference
is that the confession-rule aims to exclude self-criminating statements which
are false, while the privilege-rule gives the option of
excluding those which are true.

Dans les deux cas, on ne vise donc que des déclarations, soit celles d'un accusé dans le premier cas
et celles d'un témoin dans le second. Et par application de ces règles, les
aveux extrajudiciares de l'accusé, faits à des personnes en autorité, ne sont
admissibles que lorsqu'ils sont volontaires; l'accusé ne peut être contraint à
rendre témoignage dans son procès, et la personne qui est contrainte par la loi
à répondre peut, en faisant objection, se protéger contre l'usage futur de la
réponse qu'elle donne. Bref, ces règles n'ont d'autre objet que la substance même
des déclarations faites verbalement, par écrit ou par signes, par l'accusé ou
les témoins. Aussi bien, et dans Rex v. Voisin 20, la Cour d'Appel
d'Angleterre déclarait admissible en preuve un écrit fait de la main de
l'accusé et requis d'icelui par la police, uniquement pour fins de comparaison
avec un document trouvé sur les lieux du crime et ce, nonobstant le fait que
l'accusé était détenu et qu'aucune mise en garde ne lui avait été faite. Au
cours de l'argument, à la page 533, l'un des membres de la
Cour signalait:—

There is a difference between the admissibility of a
statement and the admissibility of handwriting. A statement may be made under
such circumstances that the true facts are not brought out, but it cannot make
any difference to the admissibility of handwriting whether it is written
voluntarily or under the compulsion of threats.

Et on jugea que:—

The mere fact that the
words were written at the request of police officers, or that he (the accused)
was being detained at Bow Street, does not make the writing inadmissible
evidence. Those facts do not tend to change the character of handwriting, nor
do they explain the resemblance between his handwriting and that upon the
label, or account for the same misspellings occurring in both.

Dans Rex v. Nowell
21, la même Cour déclarait admissible
en preuve le récit d'un
examen clinique du médecin de la police, bien que cet examen ait été fait sans
le consentement de l'accusé, sans mise en garde et alors qu'en raison de son
ébriété, Nowell ne pouvait validement consentir.

[Page 602]

Dans les deux causes précitées, la Cour
d'Appel d'Angleterre n'a donc pas jugé qu'il y avait lieu, en pareils cas,
d'appliquer la règle relative aux aveux ou la maxime nemo tenetur seipsum accusare. Elle n'a davantage
donné effet à cette théorie de l'inviolabilité de la personne dont il est
question dans Rex v. Fréchette (supra).
Je ne sache pas non plus qu'on ait jamais, pour ces motifs, exclu, comme
inadmissible, de la preuve au procès, le rapport de faits incriminant
définitivement l'accusé et que lui-même supplée involontairement, tel que par
exemple:—sa tenue, sa démarche, son vêtement, sa façon de
parler, son état de sobriété ou d'ébriété; son calme, son énervement ou son
hésitation, ses marques d'identité, son identification lorsqu'à ces fins il est
mis en ligne parmi d'autres personnes; la présence sur lui-même d'objets volés
ou d'objets dont la possession uniquement constitue une infraction à la loi et
donne lieu à des poursuites criminelles, telle la possession de narcotiques, de
spiritueux illégalement manufacturés ou importés, et autres. Sans doute, la
méthode employée pour l'obtention de certaines de ces preuves peut, dans
certains cas, être illégale et même donner lieu à des recours d'ordre civil ou
même criminel, contre ceux qui l'ont utilisée, mais on ne discute plus de la
proposition voulant qu'en ces cas, l'illégalité entachant la méthode
d'obtention de la preuve n'affecte pas, per se, l'admissibilité de cette preuve au procès.

Telle était la situation de la loi, au moment
de l'amendement apporté à l'article 285 , sur
l'admissibilité en preuve des conclusions d'une expertise aux fins de laquelle
un accusé a contribué en fournissant, sans avoir été mis en garde, les éléments
nécessaires à sa tenue.

Depuis lors, il a déjà été jugé que les
dispositions des paragraphes 4(d) et 4(e) de
l'article 285  n'avaient pas affecté cette situation de la
loi. (Rex v. Baker 22).
En l'espèce et comme déjà indiqué, la Cour d'Appel, pour en
arriver à une vue contraire, a appliqué la maxime expressio unius est
exclusio alterius. En tout respect, je dois dire qu'à mon avis, la maxime
est inapplicable à l'espèce. Dans l'amendement, je ne vois aucune intention de
changer la loi générale sur le point. Au surplus, et sur l'application

[Page 603]

de la maxime, la citation suivante extraite de
Maxwell ""On Interpretation of Statutes"", 9e
éd., 318, me paraît pertinente:—

Provisions sometimes found in statutes
enacting inperfectly or for particular cases only that which was already and
more widely the law have occasionally furnished ground for the contention that
an intention to alter the general law was to be inferred from the partial or
limited enactment, resting on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio
alterius. But that maxim is inapplicable in such cases. The only inference
which a Court can draw from such superfluous provisions (which generally find a
place in Acts to meet unfounded objections and idle doubts), is that the Legislature
was either ignorant or unmindful of the real state of the law, or that it acted
under the influence of excessive caution. If the law be different from what the
Legislature supposed it to be, the implication arising from the statute, it has
been said, cannot operate as a negation of its existence, and any legislation
founded on such a 'mistake has not the effect of making that law which the
Legislature erroneously assumed to be so.

En somme, l'intimé, tel que noté par la Cour
d'Appel, a consenti à la prise de sang; ce consentement, il l'a donné quelque
quatre heures après son arrestation, à un moment où, suivant l'expertise même
du docteur Roussel, il n'était affecté que d'une légère ébriété et n'était pas,
pour cette raison, empêché de donner un consentement valide; il avait, de plus, été clairement informé qu'il n'y avait aucune
obligation pour lui de se soumettre à cette expertise. C'est là la cause que
nous avons à juger. En de telles circonstances et pour les raisons ci-dessus,
il m'est impossible de conclure que le savant Juge au procès, M. le Juge
Prévost, a illégalement permis que le résultat de cette expertise soit porté à
la connaissance des jurés.

Je maintiendrais l'appel, annulerais le
jugement de la Cour d'Appel et rétablirais le verdict de culpabilité rendu par
les jurés.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Code —False Pretences—Conditional
Sale—Obtaining goods through medium of written contract—Whether a buyer
""obtains anything capable of being stolen"" on acquiring a property
interest in goods under a conditional sales agreement—The Criminal Code , s. 405
(1) —Conditional Sales Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 64.

An accused was convicted by a jury under s. 405 (1) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, of having obtained certain goods by false
pretences through the medium of a contract in writing. The conviction was
quashed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the ground that as title to
the goods was expressly reserved to the vendor by the terms of the contract, a
conditional sales agreement, until the purchase moneys were fully paid, the
conviction could not be supported.

Held: That the judgment should be set aside and the
conviction at trial restored. The accused by false pretences induced the vendor
not only to part with possession of the goods but also to pass to the accused a
property interest recognized by the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.B.C.
1948, c. 64, and such an interest fell within the words ""obtains anything
capable of being stolen"" as used in s. 405  of the Criminal Code .

Held: Further, by Kerwin C.J. and Estey and Abbott JJ.,
that the word ""obtained"" in s. 405  of the Criminal Code  must
be given a more extended meaning than that attributed to it in the British
Larceny Act.

Rex v. Scheer 39 Can. C.C. 82 at 83, Rex
v. Craingly 55 Can. C.C. 292 and Rex v. Kennedy 91 Can.
C.C. 347, approved.

[Page 713]

APPEAL by the Crown from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1] allowing the respondent's appeal from his conviction
in the Supreme Court of British Columbia before Wilson J. and a jury on a
charge of having obtained goods by false pretences through the medium of a
contract in writing.

H. R. Bray, Q.C. for the
appellant.

E. L. Whiffin for the
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and
of Estey and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:—

ESTEY J.:—The respondent's
conviction of obtaining household goods by false pretences was quashed in the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia and the Crown, in this further appeal, asks that the
conviction at trial be restored.

On October 26, 1953, the
respondent made certain representations which, upon the evidence, were false
and thereby induced the Belmont Furniture Stores to deliver the goods to him
under a conditional sales agreement of that date. Under this agreement he
agreed to pay $2,050.38 on terms of $355 in cash, which he paid, and the
balance in monthly instalments of $70.75. In addition to the cash payment, he
paid two instalments. When the third was demanded he produced a receipt purporting
to acknowledge the balance having been paid in full. The Belmont Furniture
Stores had not given such a receipt and in these proceedings its validity has
not been suggested.

The learned judges in the Court
of Appeal were of the opinion that, because, under the agreement, title
remained in the Belmont Furniture Stores until the purchase price was fully
paid, the respondent had obtained no more than possession and a statutory right
to the title and ownership of the goods upon completion of his payments and,
therefore, it could not be said that in law the crime of false pretences had
been committed.

The delivery of the goods having
been made under a conditional sales agreement, the relationship between the
respondent and the Belmont Furniture Stores is determined

[Page 714]

by the terms of that agreement
read with the provisions of the Conditional Sales Act of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 64). This latter Act contains the following relevant
provisions:

11(2) The buyer shall not,
prior to complete performance of the contract, sell, mortgage, or otherwise
dispose of his interest in the goods, unless he, or the person to whom he is
about to sell, mortgage, charge, or otherwise dispose of same, has notified the
seller in writing, personally or by registered mail, of the name and address of
such person, not less than ten days before such sale, mortgage, charge, or
other disposal.

(3) In case the buyer
removes the goods or disposes of his interest in them contrary to the foregoing
provisions of this section, the seller may retake possession of the goods and
deal with them as in case of default in payment of all or part of the purchase
price.

12(1) Where the seller
retakes possession of the goods pursuant to any condition in the contract, he
shall retain them for twenty days, and the buyer may redeem the same within
that period by paying or tendering to the seller the balance of the contract
price, together with the actual costs and expenses of taking and keeping
possession, or by performance or tender of performance of the condition upon
which the property in the goods is to vest in the buyer and payment of such
costs and expenses; and thereupon the seller shall deliver up to the buyer
possession of the goods so redeemed.

(2) When the goods are not
redeemed within the period of twenty days, and subject to the giving of the
notice of sale prescribed by this section, the seller may sell the goods,
either by private sale or at public auction, at any time after the expiration
of that period.

(7) This section shall apply
notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.

That the Legislature intended a
buyer would, from the outset, have an interest in the goods is clearly
evidenced in the foregoing s. 11(2), under which he may, upon giving the
specified notice, ""dispose of his interest in the goods."" Again, in
s. 11(3), if a buyer ""disposes of his interest"" in the goods without
giving the notice ""the seller may retake possession."" Moreover, if
the seller retakes possession, under s. 12(1) the buyer has certain rights of
redemption. Also, and quite apart from the statute, the buyer would have an
insurable interest. In these circumstances the respondent, as a buyer, acquired
both possession and an interest in the goods, or what may be properly described
as a property interest in the goods. It may be that the Belmont Furniture
Stores had a right to repudiate the contract, in which event the respondent, by
virtue of his payments, may have had some rights. These, however, are civil
rights with which we are here not concerned.

[Page 715]

The respondent was convicted
under s. 405  of the Criminal Code , the material part of which reads as
follows:

405. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence… who, … by any false pretense, either directly or through
the medium of any contract obtained by such false pretense, obtains anything
capable of being stolen, …

The main contention on behalf of
the respondent is that, as the property did not wholly or entirely pass to the
respondent, he cannot be found guilty of false pretences within the meaning of
the foregoing section because the word ""obtains,"" as there used,
means the acquisition by the respondent of the whole or the entire property
interest of the Belmont Furniture Stores.

In support of this contention
counsel for the respondent referred to The Queen v. Kilham[2]
, in which Bovill C.J., in the course of his reasons and speaking for the
Court, stated:

But to constitute an
obtaining by false pretences it is equally essential, as in larceny, that there
shall be an intention to deprive the owner wholly of his property, and this
intention did not exist in the case before us.

The Chief Justice expressed the
basis of the decision in the following words:

…the prisoner never intended
to deprive the prosecutor of the horse or the property in it, or to appropriate
it to himself, but only intended to obtain the use of the horse for a limited
time.

He also stated:

The word ""obtain""
in this section does not mean obtain the loan of, but obtain the property in,
any chattel etc.

Their Lordships were there considering
a case in which no property whatever was intended to pass. However, the general
observation which includes the phrase ""deprive the owner wholly of his
property"", though unnecessary to the decision, appears to have been
accepted as a statement of the law by the learned authors of recognized texts. Russell
on Crime, 10th Ed., p. 1377, states:

…there must, as in larceny,
be an intention to deprive the owner wholly of his property.

See also Kenny, Outlines of
Criminal Law, 1952, 16th Ed., s. 342; Archbold's Cr. Pl. Ev. & Pr., 33rd Ed., pp.
546 and 554.

[Page 716]

In 1951 Lord Goddard stated:

There is no doubt that
""obtains"" means obtains the property and not merely possession, and
the obtaining must not for this purpose be under such circumstances as to amount
to larceny. Rex v. Ball[3]
.

In all of the foregoing it is the
distinction between larceny by trick and false pretences, or between mere
possession and property, that is under discussion. In fact, the precise point
here under consideration does not appear to have been raised in any of the
courts in Great Britain. This may be due to the fact that there chattels are
disposed of, not under conditional sales agreements such as that here in
question, but rather under hire-purchase agreements. The nature of the hire-purchase
contract is described by the learned authors of Dunstan's Law of Hire-Purchase,
4th Ed., at p. 9:

The contract of hire-purchase,
as already defined, is a contract of hire with an option of purchase, in which
the owner of goods lets them out on hire to the hirer for a fixed term, at an
agreed rental to be paid at intervals mutually agreed upon, as instalments, and
the owner, in addition to letting the goods out, further agrees that if the
hirer keeps them for the agreed period and regularly pays the rent they shall
become the hirer's property.

See also 1 Hals., 2nd Ed.,
p. 761, para. 1249.

Hire-purchase contracts, since
1938, are subject to the Hire-Purchase Act (1 & 2 Geo. VI, c. 53).
There are other agreements, which apparently are referred to as hire-purchase
agreements, which come within the provisions of the Factors Act, 1889,
and the Sale of Goods Act, 1893. These enactments are referred to
here only for the purpose of indicating that the exchange of chattels is
effected in Great Britain under agreements subject to statutory provisions
which are substantially different from the conditional sales agreement and the
statutory provisions in respect thereto adopted generally throughout Canada.

It also appears that our relevant
criminal law is quite different from that in Great Britain. Prior to 1892 the
statutory law with respect to larceny and false pretences was contained in The
Larceny Act (R.S.C. 1886, c. 164). Larceny is not, in that statute, defined
and the relevant portion of s. 77, corresponding to the present s. 405 , reads:

77. Every one who, by any
false pretence, obtains from any other person any chattel, money or valuable
security, with intent to defraud, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable to
three years' imprisonment.

[Page 717]

This s. 77 is in part founded
upon s. 88 of the Larceny Act, 1861 of Great Britain (24 & 25
Vict., c. 96), being ""An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Statute Law of
England and Ireland Relating to Larceny and Similar Acts."" In that statute
s. 88 read in part:

Whosoever shall, by any
false pretence, obtain from any other person any chattel, money or valuable
security with intent to defraud shall be guilty of…

In 1880 a British Royal
Commission reported by submitting a draft criminal code which, in their own language,
was ""a reduction of the existing law to an orderly written system freed
from needless technicalities, obscurities and other defects which the
experience of its administration has disclosed. It aims at the reduction to a
system of that kind of substantive law relating to crimes and the law of
procedure both as to indictable offences and as to summary convictions""
(Report Part I, Codification in General).

Apparently impressed by the
advantages of a codification, the Government of Canada asked Mr. Justice
Burbidge of the Exchequer Court, who had for some time been Deputy Minister of
Justice, and Mr. Sedgewick, then Deputy Minister of Justice, later a Justice of
this Court, to draft a code of the criminal law for Canada. The
code which they drafted and submitted was, in a large part, taken from the
British draft code submitted in 1880; in fact, so much so that Mr. Justice
Taschereau, later Chief Justice of this Court, in his 1893 edition of the
Criminal Code  of Canada, referred, under each section taken in whole or in part
therefrom, to the British draft code from which, as he stated, ""the
present code has been in a large measure textually taken."" Taschereau's
Criminal Code, 1893 Ed., p. iii.

Section 305 of the 1892 code, now
s. 347, setting forth what constitutes the offence of theft, is taken verbatim
from the British draft code, except that in subpara. (a) the word
""permanently"" in the British draft code is deleted and the phrase
""temporarily or absolutely"" inserted in lieu thereof. It will,
therefore, be observed that in our code an important addition to the definition
of theft as contained in the draft British code is made, which in itself was
quite different and much wider in its scope than that which had been developed
under the common law and for the first time authoritatively 

[Page 718]

set forth in s. 1 of the 1916 Larceny
Act, or, indeed, as interpreted under the British Larceny Act of
1861, or the Canadian Larceny Act above referred to.

This definition of theft is
important in this discussion because s. 405  contains the words ""obtains
anything capable of being stolen…,"" which replace the words ""any
chattel, money or valuable security,"" as they appear in s. 88 of the 1861
British Larceny Act. Moreover, these words ""any chattel, money or
valuable security,"" as they appeared in s. 88, were construed to include
only that which could be the subject of larceny at common law. Stephen's
History of the Criminal Law of England, p. 162; Kenny's
Outlines of the Criminal Law, 16th Ed., p. 278.

The words in s. 405 
""anything capable of being stolen"" are of wider import and this is
emphasized by the language of ss. 344  and 347  of the Criminal Code ,
where, as already intimated, theft is defined in terms more comprehensive than
at common law or under any of the statutory provisions in Great Britain. In s.
344 it is provided:

Every inanimate thing
whatever which is the property of any person …is capable of being stolen…

and the provisions of s. 347 
read, in part, as follows:

347. Theft or stealing is
the act of fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and
without colour of right converting to the use of any person, anything capable
of being stolen, with intent,

(a) to deprive the
owner, or any person having any special property or interest therein,
temporarily or absolutely of such thing or of such property or interest;

Section 405 , with which we are
mainly concerned, is not in the language of either the Canadian statutes or the
British statutes with respect to larceny and false pretences in force prior to
1892. In fact, both s. 347  (with the change already noted) and s. 405  are taken
from the draft British code which never did become law in Great Britain and
which was itself quite different from the statutory provisions then in force in
that country. It is but a section in a statute largely codifying the criminal
law of Canada. Its provisions effected many changes which
principle and experience dictated and by restatement was intended to remove
technicalities and clarify the criminal law. As such, s. 405 , as well as the
entire statute, is, in the language of their Lordships of the Privy Council,
""an original enactment with no trace of its origin or history to be found
either 

[Page 719]

in its terms or in any
other"" legislation of the Parliament of Canada. Attorney-General for Ontario
v. Perry[4]
. It was there held that a section of the Ontario Succession Duty Act, ""obviously
borrowed,"" but not identical, should be construed as an
""original"" section. It should, therefore, be construed in a manner that
gives effect to the intention of Parliament as expressed in the language there
adopted. Of course, regard must be had to its language in relation to the
statute as a whole, but its history ought not to be examined except in the case
of ambiguity, and then, as stated by their Lordships of the Privy Council, that
""is always a process of construction which is accompanied with much
danger."" Ouellette v. C.P.R.[5]
.

The construction of the word
""obtains"" as expressed by Chief Justice Bovill was pronounced in a day
when the enforcement of the criminal law was subject to refinements and
technicalities which our code was intended to eliminate. A reference to the
standard dictionaries discloses that, as ordinarily used and understood, the
word ""obtains"" does not suggest or import that the entire property
must be acquired. In the Oxford Dictionary the word is defined:

To procure or gain, as the
result of purpose and effort; hence, generally, to acquire, get.

As so defined, the word would
include the acquisition of possession from a party together with whatever
interest that party might have.

Neither do I find anything in the
language of s. 405  to suggest that the word should be so construed. Then, as a
matter of principle, there would appear to be no difference between one who, by
false pretences, obtains the whole or entire property and one who obtains
possession and a property interest in the goods.

Our attention was directed to the
fact that the word ""obtain"" appears in other sections of the Code,
particularly s. 399. A comparison of this section with s. 82 of the Canadian Larceny
Act in the 1886 Statutes and s. 88 of the Larceny Act of Great
Britain in 1861 leads to precisely the same conclusion that s. 399 is a new and
an original section in which the word ""obtain"" is used in a wide and
comprehensive sense and should be construed to the same effect as in s. 405 .

[Page 720]

In Canada there is authority in
support of the view that if, by false pretences and with intent to defraud, the
possession together with a property interest is acquired in anything capable of
being stolen, that is sufficient to support a conviction for false pretences.

Counsel for the respondent
discussed a number of Canadian authorities to which reference may now be made.
In The King v. Nowe[6]
, Rex v. Scheer[7]
, and Rex v. McManus[8]
, there was no intention to pass any property whatsoever and, therefore, it was
held the crime of false pretences was not committed. In Rex v. Scheer
a conviction for false pretences was quashed. Chief Justice Perdue, in the
course of his reasons, at p. 83, stated:

To constitute the offence of
obtaining by false pretences it must appear that the prosecutor had been
induced to part with some property right and not merely the possession of the
goods.

Both Chief Justice Perdue and Mr.
Justice Cameron referred to Tremeear, 1919 Ed., at p. 498, where the
learned author states:

It must appear that the
prosecutor had been induced to part with some property right and not merely
possession of the goods.

In the 5th Ed., 1944, this statement,
at p. 459, is altered to read:

If he intends to part only
with the possession there can be no conviction for obtaining by false
pretences.

In Rex v. Craingly[9]
, Craingly supplied material to Goodman, who manufactured trousers therefrom.
This arrangement continued for some time. In the course of their dealings
Goodman gave to Fisher, a cartage agent, a parcel containing eight pairs of
trousers with instructions to deliver them to Craingly only upon payment of
$63.50. When Craingly refused to pay the $63.50 Fisher refused to deliver to
him the trousers. Later, however, during the same day, Fisher received a
telephone message purporting to be from Goodman and instructing him to deliver
the parcel on receipt of $20. This Fisher did. The learned trial judge found,
and this was accepted in the Court of Appeal, that Craingly had made the
telephone call to Fisher. The accused was found guilty of obtaining the
trousers by false pretences and his conviction was affirmed

[Page 721]

upon appeal. Grant J.A., with whom
Mulock C.J.O. and Hodgins J.A. agreed, found that Fisher was a bailee of the
parcel and, therefore, had a special property or interest therein.

The above was followed in Rex v.
Kinsey[10]
, where the accused purchased from Edmonton Automart a truck for $1,000, plus
repairs thereto in the sum of $50, payable $500 in cash and the balance on
terms. The accused signed a contract under which title remained in the vendor
until payment had been made in full. The cash payment was made in cheques which
proved to be worthless. The accused was charged and found guilty of obtaining
goods by false pretences.

Rex v. Craingly, supra, and Rex v. Kinsey,
supra, appear to have been decided in accord with the intention of
Parliament expressed in s. 405 .

The accused, by false pretences,
acquired possession of the goods and a special property or interest therein in
a manner that brings him within the words ""obtains anything capable of
being stolen,"" as used in s. 405  of the Criminal Code .

The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction restored.

The judgment of Kellock and Locke
JJ. was delivered by:—

KELLOCK J.:—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowing an
appeal by the respondent from his conviction in the Supreme Court of British Columbia
before Wilson J., and a jury, on a charge of having obtained goods by false
pretences through the medium of a contract in writing.

On October 26, 1953, the
respondent, under the name of ""Barry Hamilton"", entered into a
conditional sales contract for the purchase of certain furniture. The premises
at the address he gave were owned by a Mrs. Hamilton and her son, whose name
was Barry Hamilton. He was not the respondent, whose real name is unknown. He
goes under various aliases.

At the time of the transaction
the respondent gave to the vendor for that part of the purchase moneys payable
in cash, a cheque drawn by a third person in favour of ""Barry

[Page 722]

Hamilton"" for $355, which he endorsed in the name of the
payee. This left a balance of purchase moneys of $1,695.38, payable at the rate
of $70.75 per month. Two of these instalments were subsequently paid in
November and January following.

Early in February, the
respondent, on being applied to for payment of the third instalment, then
overdue, took the position that the full balance of the purchase moneys had
been paid and he produced an alleged receipt to that effect. This, however,
proved to be a forgery.

The indictment contained two
counts in addition to that of false pretences, one of which was withdrawn. The
other was of obtaining credit by false pretences. This was, however, not dealt
with by the jury as the learned trial judge instructed them they need not
consider it if they found the accused guilty of obtaining goods.

Ss. 404(1) and 405(1) of the Code
are as follows:

404(1) A false pretense is a
representation, either by words or otherwise, of a matter of fact either
present or past, which representation is known to the person making it to be
false, and which is made with a fraudulent intent to induce the person to whom
it is made to act upon such representation.

405(1) Every one is guilty
of an indictable offence and liable to three years' imprisonment who, with
intent to defraud, by any false pretense, either directly or through the medium
of any contract obtained by such false pretense, obtains anything capable of
being stolen, or procures anything capable of being stolen to be delivered to
any other person than himself.

In the Court of Appeal the
conviction was quashed on the ground that, as title to the goods was expressly
reserved to the vendor by the terms of the contract until the purchase moneys
were fully paid, the conviction could not be supported. In the language of
O'Halloran J.A., with whom Robertson and Bird JJ.A., agreed,

It has long been accepted
that a conviction under Code Sec. 405(1) for ""obtaining"" goods by
false pretences (as distinguished from theft by a trick see The Queen v.
Russett[11]
, cannot be supported unless ownership of the goods as distinct from their
authorized possession has passed to the convicted person;

The learned judge referred to a
number of other authorities, including Rex v. Scheer[12]
. This is the sole point with which we are concerned on this appeal.

[Page 723]

In Russett's case, the
prisoner had agreed at a fair to sell a horse to the prosecutor for ₤23,
of which ₤8 was paid down, the remainder to be paid on delivery. The
horse was never delivered, the prisoner causing it to be removed from the fair
under circumstances from which the jury inferred that he had never intended to
deliver it. It was contended in appeal from his conviction of larceny by a
trick that the only offence disclosed by the evidence was that of obtaining
money by false pretences and that there was no evidence of larceny. In the
course of his judgment affirming the conviction, Lord Coleridge C.J., said, at
p. 314:

…if the possession of the
money or goods said to have been stolen has been parted with, but the owner did
not intend to part with the property in them, so that part of the transaction
is incomplete, and the parting with the possession has been obtained by fraud—that
is larceny.

It was held that the ₤8 was
paid by the prosecutor merely by way of deposit, the prosecutor never intending
to part with the property in the money until he obtained delivery of the horse.

While the principle was
sufficiently stated for the purposes of that case by Lord Coleridge, as above,
it is important to understand the underlying distinction between the two
offences of larceny by a trick and obtaining goods by false pretences. In Queen
v. Kilham[13] ,
Bovill C.J., at p. 263, quoted the language of s. 88 of 24-25 Victoria, c.
96, as follows:

whosoever shall, by any
false pretence, obtain from any other person any chattel, money, or valuable
security, with intent to defraud, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour…

and continued:

The word ""obtain""
in this section does not mean obtain the loan of, but obtain the property in,
any chattel, etc. This is… made more clear by referring to the earlier statute
from which the language of s. 88 is adopted. 7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 29, s. 53,
recites that ""a failure of justice frequently arises from the subtle
distinction between 'larceny and fraud'"", and, for remedy thereof, enacts
that ""if any person shall, by any false pretence, obtain,"" etc. The
subtle distinction which the statute was intended to remedy was this: that if a
person, by fraud, induced another to part with the possession only of
goods and converted them to his own use, this was larceny; while, if he induced
another by fraud to part with the property in the goods as well as the
possession, this was not larceny.

[Page 724]

When emphasis is placed on the
word ""only"", which I have italicized, the point of distinction
between the two offences is clear. The subsequent language of the learned Chief
Justice, namely,

But to constitute an
obtaining by false pretences it is equally essential, as in larceny, that there
shall be an intention to deprive the owner wholly of his property…

is fully satisfied where the
fraud is perpetrated ""through the medium of a contract"", whether part
payment or no payment at all be made. The offence is nonetheless committed
where the intention is to deprive the owner of what is his. In the case at bar
the jury were satisfied of that. As the later authorities make plain, the
contract need not provide for the immediate passing of the property in the
goods.

In the circumstances of such a
case as the present, the respondent could not have been convicted of theft as
the vendor of the goods was consenting not only to the transfer of possession
but to the transfer of the property in the goods upon the terms of the written
contract. Under that contract the respondent obtained an interest in the goods
which is recognized by the Conditional Sales Act. While it is provided
by the contract that ""title to, property in and ownership of said goods
shall remain in Vendor at Purchaser's risk until all amount due hereunder, …
are paid in cash"" the statute provides by s. 11(2) that

The buyer shall not, prior
to complete performance of the contract, sell, mortgage, charge or otherwise
dispose of his interest in the goods, unless…

and s-s. (3) enables the vendor
to retake possession

in case the buyer… disposes
of his interest in them…

If the transaction under which
the defrauder obtains possession of the goods does not provide for the passing
of the property either immediately or in the future, ""part of the
transaction is incomplete"", to use the language of Lord Coleridge above. A
wrongful conversion in such circumstances means only one thing, namely, theft.
If, however, the transaction is ""complete"" in the sense that the
owner consents to the passing of the property in compliance with a term of the
contract to that effect, there can be no theft. In so far, therefore, as the
question in issue in the case at bar 

[Page 725]

depends upon a choice as between
theft and obtaining the goods by false pretences, the only possible offence of
which the respondent could have been convicted was the latter. 

As pointed out in the 10th
Edition of Russell on Crime p. 1413, the ""main distinction""
between larceny and obtaining by false pretences is that in the former the
goods are taken ""without the owner's consent, whereas in the latter the
owner has been induced by the pretences to give his consent."" In
commenting upon the decision in Russett's case, the same author says, at
p. 1110:

the essential point is in
the presence or absence of the owner's consent:

That this is the essential
principle is, in my opinion, borne out by the authorities.

In Whitehorn Brothers v.
Davison[14]
, the facts were that one Bruford, whom the plaintiffs, a firm of manufacturing
jewellers, knew as a jeweller and dealer in pearls, obtained from the
plaintiffs a pearl necklace on the representation that he would like to send it
to one of his customers on approval. The plaintiffs assented and, on obtaining
the necklace, Bruford pledged it with the defendant as security for moneys
owing by him. Subsequently, Bruford represented to the plaintiffs that his
customer had decided to take the necklace but that he was in the habit of
receiving six months' credit. Ultimately, the plaintiffs invoiced the necklace
to Bruford, taking from him two bills, one at five, the other at six months.
These were subsequently dishonoured, Bruford having absconded. The plaintiffs
then sought recovery of the necklace from the defendant. In the course of his
judgment at p. 473, Vaughan Williams L.J., said:

…I should have great
difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that what Bruford did amounted to
larceny by a trick. There was, no doubt, evidence to shew that he did by
fraudulent statements persuade the plaintiffs to enter into a contract with
him, which, taking the view of it most favourable to them, appears to me to
have been a contract under which possession of the necklace was given to him
together with an option, within a reasonable time, I suppose, to accept as sold
to him the necklace so delivered on sale or return for a price to be paid in
cash, or to return the same. That being so, the case is one in which he,
undoubtedly, got possession of the necklace by fraud, but it appears to me that
he got it under a contract between himself and the plaintiffs. He not only got
it under this contract, but, admittedly, the object of that contract was that
he should have an opportunity of seeing whether he could sell the necklace

[Page 726]

to a customer before he made
up his mind whether he would accept it on the terms of the approbation note.
Under these circumstances… I think that would constitute obtaining goods by
fraud, and not larceny.

Buckley L.J., at p. 479, said:

On the other hand, goods are
obtained by false pretences where the owner of the goods, being induced thereto
by a trick, voluntarily parts with the possession of the goods, and does intend
to pass the property. The question which is material under the circumstances of
the present case is this. Suppose the facts are that the owner of the goods,
being induced thereto by a trick, intends, not to pass the property in them,
but to confer on the person to whom he gives possession a power to pass the
property; under which head does that case fall? Prima facie it would look,
inasmuch as he does not intend presently to pass the property, as if that would
be larceny by a trick. I think, however, that is not so. It seems to me that,
where the owner of the goods intends to confer a power to pass the property, it
is a case of obtaining goods by false pretences.

Kennedy L.J., at p. 485,
expressed a similar view.

The principle of these judgments
was subsequently adopted and applied by the Court of Appeal in Folkes v.
King[15]
. In my opinion, the principle so stated is right and fully covers the
circumstances of the case at bar.

It may be observed that in Rex
v. Scheer (supra) to which the Court of Appeal referred, the
Manitoba Court of Appeal adopted the statement in the 1919 edition of Tremeear
to the effect that in the case of the offence here under consideration, it must
appear that the prosecutor has been induced to part with ""some""
property right and not merely possession of the goods.

It was further contended for the
respondent that there never had in fact been any contract entered into between
him and the owners of the furniture for the reason that the latter considered
they were dealing not with the respondent but with another person, namely, the
real Barry Hamilton. In my opinion, the evidence does not support this
contention. It is true that the respondent used that name and that there was
another person of that name, but that other person was not known to the
vendors. They dealt with the respondent himself, although they accepted his
statement that his name was Barry Hamilton, from which they were able to
ascertain that a person of that name did reside at the address given.

This is not a case, therefore, of
a contract with one person in the belief that it was with another. The vendors
dealt and intended to deal with the respondent. The fact that

[Page 727]

he gave a false name is
immaterial in these circumstances; King's Norton Metal Co. v. Eldridge, Herrett & Co. (1). The
distinction between such a case and the circumstances in Cundy v.
Lindsay (2), where the person defrauded was, by reason of the fraud of the
person with whom they dealt, induced to believe they were dealing with another
person, is obvious.

The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction restored.

Appeal allowed and
conviction restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal lato—Conspiracy—Whether a husband
and a wife can conspire together alone to commit the indictable offence of
forgery—Criminal Code , ss. 16 , 21 , 573 .

The appellant, charged under s. 573  of the Criminal
Code , was convicted of having unlawfully conspired with his wife to commit
the indictable offence of forgery. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal for Ontario.

Held (Fauteux J. dissenting), that the appeal
should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

A husband and a wife cannot be found guilty
under s. 573  of the Criminal Code  of conspiring with each other alone to
commit the indictable offence of forgery, because judicially speaking they form
but one person and are presumed to have but one will, and one person alone
cannot conspire.

Per Fauteux J. (dissenting): The common law
rule that a husband and a wife cannot be guilty of conspiring alone together
appears to have stemmed from the doctrine of conjugal unity. But today that
doctrine has disappeared and husbands and wives have each an independent legal
entity, in both the field of civil and criminal matters. Consequently, it must
be concluded that the rule has perished with the disappearance of the reason
which gave it life and support.

Assuming that such a conclusion is not
justified, the provisions of s. 16  of the Criminal Code  cannot apply
since the rule has been altered by and is, at least, inconsistent with the
provisions of the Criminal Code .

[Page 499]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1],
affirming the appellant’s conviction on a charge of conspiracy with his wife to
commit the indictable offence of forgery.

F.L. O’Donnell for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was
delivered by:—

TASCHEREAU J.—The appellant was convicted of
unlawfully conspiring with one Beatrice Kowbel to commit the indictable offence
of forgery, and sentenced to five months in jail. The Court of Appeal[2] dismissed the appeal, Mr. Justice Hogg
dissenting. Beatrice Kowbel is the appellant’s wife, and the only point at
issue before this Court, is whether or not a husband and wife are capable in
law of conspiring together. The Court of Appeal held that they could.

The charge was laid under section 573  of
the Criminal Code . It is to the effect that every one is guilty
of an indictable offence, who in any case not otherwise provided for, conspires
with any person to commit any indictable offence. It is submitted that these
broad terms necessarily include husbands and wives, and that their matrimonial
status does not eliminate the essential element of duality in the crime of
conspiracy. It has also been urged that the old presumption that a married
woman committing an offence, did so under compulsion because she committed it
in the presence of her husband, has now been abolished (Criminal Code  21),
and replaced by a doctrine more in conformity with our modern times.

It is trite law that husbands and wives may
invoke not only the defences afforded to them by the Code, but also all
the other defences known to the common law, which were in force in 1892, unless
they are inconsistent with some dispositions of the Code. (Criminal Code , section 16 ).

I have reached the conclusion that at common
law, a husband and a wife could not be found guilty of conspiracy, because judicially
speaking they form but one person, and

[Page 500]

are presumed to have but one will. Of course,
the theory of unity between husbands and wives and the defence of compulsion
must not be confused. (Lush, “Husband and Wife” 4th Ed. p. 597). Both are
entirely different. And as the defence raised in the present case belongs to
the former category, it follows that it stands unaffected by the abolishment of
the presumption of coercion. For instance, the doctrine of presumption of
coercion was applied when a wife committed a crime in the presence of her
husband, but the fiction that they are but one person in law is the underlying
principle at the root of the law which says that during cohabitation, one
cannot be convicted of stealing the property of the other.

I do not think that the words “every one” found
in section 573  (Cr. C) dealing with conspiracy include husbands and wives
any more than they include children under 7 years of age or insane persons.
These words are defined in section 2(13) (Cr. C.), and they apply only to
persons in relation to such acts and things as they are capable of doing. The
incapacity to conspire is not statutory, but it is one of those old common law
defences, which an accused person is at liberty to raise before the courts of this
country. (16 Cr. C.). And far from being inconsistent, I think that it is in
harmony with all the other dispositions of the Code dealing with incapacities
resulting from marriage.

As far back as 1365, during the reign of Edward
II, we find a reported judgment (Year Books, 38 Edward III, Parts 2-3) written
in Norman, and of which the Court obtained a translation. In that case,
according to the report, it was common ground between the parties that a
husband and a wife could not conspire together, but a further question arose
because a third party was involved in the alleged conspiracy. “The writ was
abated” on the ground that the facts did not reveal any act of conspiracy.
Although there was no judicial pronouncement on the main question of conspiracy
between husband and wife, this case is most useful to show what was the state
of the law at that time, and how it was understood by the lawyers of England
over six hundred years ago. As in many other domains,

[Page 501]

scientific or historical, in the field of law,
tradition is a very accurate medium to convey to other generations what has
been the universal “consensus” of the legal minds.

Since then, it has been generally recognized
that a husband and a wife were legally incapable of conspiracy. Such a capacity
seems to have been considered as repugnant to the common law.

In Hawkin’s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 1, page
448, we find:—

Sect. 8. It plainly appears from the words
of the statute, that one person alone cannot be guilty of conspiracy within the
purport of it; from whence it follows, that if all the defendants who are
prosecuted for such a conspiracy be acquitted but one, the (a) acquittal of the
rest is the acquittal of that one also. Also upon the same ground it hath been
holden, that no such prosecution is maintainable against a (b) husband and
wife only, because they are esteemed but one person in law, and are presumed to
have but one will.

After dealing with the legal consequences of
marriage, and after enumerating certain incapacities that resulted to the
spouses therefrom, Stephen in his “Commentaries on the Laws of England” (Vol.
2, 21st Ed.), indicates those that have been abandoned by the common law, and
also those that have been retained. At the foot of page 491, he deals with the
very problem before this Court and says that:—

A husband and wife cannot, with certain
important exceptions, be guilty of stealing one another’s property, nor can
any agreement to which they alone are parlies amount to a criminal conspiracy, nor
can a wife be an accessory after the fact to her husband’s felony.

The same author (Vol. 4, page 165) reaffirms the
same rule of the common law and writes:—

The collaboration of two or more persons is
essential to the existence of a conspiracy. A man cannot conspire with himself.
If, therefore, two persons are indicted for conspiracy and one is acquitted,
the other cannot be convicted, even though he may have pleaded guilty. Husband
and wife are for this purpose regarded as one person and cannot be indicted
for conspiracy with one another; though both may be charged with conspiracy
with a third person.

Kenny in “Outlines of Criminal Law” (16th Ed.
page 340), says:—

Moreover, the law applies here the old
doctrine that for some certain purposes husband and wife can be counted as one
person, so that an unlawful combination by him and her alone does not amount
to a conspiration.

[Page 502]

Archbold in “Criminal Pleading Evidence and
Practice” (32nd Ed. page 21):—

A husband and wife cannot alone be found
guilty of conspiracy, for they are considered in law as one person, and are
presumed to have but one will.

Phipson “On Evidence” (9th Ed. page 99):—

At common law, husband and wife, being
regarded as one person, cannot be charged with, or convicted of, conspiracy together,
unless charged with conspiring with a third person.

See also Halsbury, “Laws of England”, (Vol. 9,
1st Ed. page 264) where it is said:—

Husband and wife cannot alone commit a
crime of conspiracy, as they are deemed but one
person in law, but they may commit the crime of conspiring with others.

In Roscoe’s Criminal Evidence (16th Ed., at page
749), we find the following statement:—

A married couple cannot be guilty of
conspiracy (only) with each other.

In Warburton & Grundy, “Leading Cases in the
Criminal Law” (5th Ed. at page 167), it is stated:—

It may be mentioned that a man and his wife
cannot be indicted for conspiring together, because they are in law one
person.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Blady[3], Mr. Justice Lush expressed his views
as follows:—

The foundation of the rule which prevented
a wife from giving evidence against her husband was the fact that they were one
person in the eye of the law. No doubt that rule was applied in every case
except where it was necessary either for the safety of the wife or for her
wellbeing to relax it. The rule shewed itself in strange ways both in the
criminal and in the civil law. Husband and wife being one person could not
be indicted or convicted of conspiracy one with the other.

It is true that Mr. Justice Lush was dissenting,
but not on the point of capacity or incapacity to conspire. It has been said
during the argument that this statement was merely an “obiter dictum”. “Obiter
dicta” are not always of equal value. Some are mere casual expressions of
opinion, unnecessary for the determination of the case. Some others are of a
different nature and carry more weight, if they are not obiter to the view
taken of the case by the judge. The part of the judgment that I have cited
forms part of the reasoning of the learned Justice, who had to determine
whether or not a wife in a certain case, was an

[Page 503]

admissible witness for the prosecution against
her husband. (Vide The Law Quarterly Review, 1931, Vol. 47, page 318; Nixon vs.
Attorney General[4].

In a New Zealand case, The King v. McKechie[5], the Court of Appeal of that country
decided as follows:—

A husband and wife cannot conspire
together so as to be guilty of the crime of conspiracy.

In the Peel case, reported in The Times,
March 8th, 1922, page 7, Mr. Justice Darling expressed the following
opinion:—

Of course, it takes at least two persons to
conspire, and the husband and wife being one person in law, the situation is
that they cannot conspire.

There are no judgments in Canada, dealing with
this particular matter, but I think it is well settled that since many
centuries, it has been the law of England that a husband and wife cannot alone
conspire to commit an indictable offence. These views have been expressed
during over six centuries, and I would be slow to believe that the hesitations
of a few modern writers could justify us to brush aside what has always been
considered as the existing law. (Eversley, Domestic Relations, 5th Ed., page
158). It may very well be amended by legislative intervention, but as long as
it is not, it must be applied

Provincial laws which are of a purely local
character, dealing with the emancipation of the wife, cannot have any bearing
on the present case. Otherwise, there would surely be confusion arising out of
a lack of uniformity of provincial enactments, and furthermore, it is only with
the Federal Parliament that the sole power to legislate in such matters lies.

I would allow the appeal and quash the
conviction.

ESTEY J.:—I agree with the reasons and
conclusions of my brother Taschereau.

I would add that in considering the criminal law
in respect to conspiracy it is important to keep in mind the statement of
Mr. Justice Sedgewick, when speaking for this Court:

It has never been contended that the
Criminal Code  of Canada contains the whole of the criminal common law of
England in force in Canada. Parliament never intended to repeal the common law,
except

[Page 504]

in so far as the Code either expressly or
by implication repeals it. So that if the facts stated in the indictment
constitute an indictable offence at common law, and that offence is not dealt
with in the Code, then unquesionably an indictment will lie at common law; even
if the offence has been dealt with in the Code, but merely by way of statement
of what is law, then both are in force. The Union Colliery Company v. The
Queen[6].

See also Brousseau v. The King[7].

That Parliament did not intend to codify under
the Code all of the common law in respect to conspiracy is evident first
because no definition of conspiracy is included therein and second because the
sections dealing therewith are restricted to specific circumstances (see
ss. 78, 79, 218, 266, 444, 496  and 573 ). The position may be illustrated from
the provisions of the last-mentioned section (s. 573 ) which is restricted
to those who conspire “to commit any indictable offence”. The house of Lords,
in O’Connell v. The Queen[8],
stated:

The crime of conspiracy is complete if two,
or more than two, should agree to do an illegal thing; that is, to effect
something in itself unlawful, or to effect, by unlawful means, something which
in itself may be indifferent or even lawful.

This and other definitions have been adopted by
the courts in Canada. While differing in certain respects, these definitions do
not in any way restrict the criminal offence to that of a conspiracy to commit
an indictable offence. It follows that the Code does not cover conspiracies to
commit summary conviction offences, nor, indeed, any unlawful act which does
not constitute an indictable offence. Moreover, the Code does not cover a
conspiracy to do “by unlawful means, something which in itself may be
indifferent or even lawful”. The foregoing, as well as other definitions,
indicates the great variety of circumstances in which the offence of conspiracy
may arise. This feature is emphasized by Harrison in his book entitled “Law of
Conspiracy” where at p. 67 he says:

The quotations just given show how wide is
the scope of the offence of conspiracy, and also how difficult it is to arrive
at an adequate definition.

[Page 505]

It is evident that a portion of the law of
conspiracy in Canada must be found in the common law. This fact would be
present to the Members of Parliament when enacting the provisions of the Code.
In these circumstances, apart from express words which are not here present, it
ought not to be concluded that Parliament intended that with respect to those
conspiracies specifically dealt with in the Code a husband and wife might be
guilty of conspiracy, while with respect to those dealt with at common law the
husband and wife could not be guilty of conspiracy.

Moreover, Hawkins states the basis upon which
the law is founded to be that a husband and wife “are esteemed but one person
in law, and are presumed to have but one will.” The judges and authorities quoted
by my Brother Taschereau accept this basis, which seems to involve the
relationship or status of husband and wife and not merely one of the
consequences arising therefrom; viz., that they cannot contract one with
another. The statutes which have given to a married woman the right to contract
with her husband have been, in the main, directed to her proprietary rights and
have not interfered with her status, nor with that confidential and intimate
relationship that should always obtain between husband and wife and which has
so long been recognized and protected under our law. While, therefore, the gist
of a conspiracy is the concluded agreement, it does not follow that a married
woman’s capacity to contract with her husband constitutes an answer to the common
law that a husband and wife, when they are the only parties involved, cannot be
guilty of a conspiracy.

The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

CARTWRIGHT J.:—I agree with the reasons given by
my brother Taschereau and those given by Hogg J.A., in the Court of Appeal.

I wish however to add a few words in regard to
one of the arguments which found favour with the majority in the Court of
Appeal i.e. that the wording of section 573  of the Criminal Code  is
free from any ambiguity, includes within its ambit everyone whether married or
unmarried, and so destroys the common law doctrine that a husband

[Page 506]

and wife cannot be guilty of conspiring with
each other alone. It will be observed that section 573  deals only with the
crime of conspiring to commit an indictable offence. It leaves untouched
conspiracies to commit criminal offences which are not indictable and
conspiracies in which two or more persons agree to effect something in itself
unlawful (though not necessarily criminal) or to effect by unlawful means
something which in itself may be indifferent, or even lawful. Such conspiracies
are indictable at common law and there are a number of cases, collected in Tremeear’s
Criminal Code 5th Edition, at page 633, in which there have been
convictions for such conspiracies in this country. Had it been the intention of
Parliament to abolish the common law defence with which we are concerned it
would be expected that plain words dealing expressly with such defence would
have been used as was done, for example, when the presumption of compulsion was
done away with by section 21 ; and I can find nothing in the general words
of section 573  to warrant imputing to Parliament the intention of taking
away this ancient common law defence of a husband and wife in a case in which
they are charged with having agreed together to commit an indictable offence
while leaving the defence available to them in the other types of indictable
criminal conspiracies mentioned above. For these reasons as well as for those
given by my brother Taschereau and Hogg J.A., I think that this argument of the
respondent must be rejected.

I would allow the appeal and quash the
conviction.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal from
a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal of
Kowbel against his conviction that he did unlawfully conspire with Beatrice
Kowbel -his wife- to commit the indictable offences of forgery and uttering a
forged document.

The sole defence put forward by the appellant,
before the Court of Appeal and in this Court, rests on two propositions:—(i) At
common law, a husband and wife cannot be guilty of conspiring together; (ii)
This common law principle has been preserved in Canada by the provisions of s.
16  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 507]

The common law rule. The rule is mentioned by
text writers of repute who dealt with the laws of England either generally or
with the relevant branches thereof, i.e., criminal law, law on domestic
relations or the doctrine of legal unity of husband and wife. Whether they
affirm, doubt or deny its application to modern times, they all trace the rule
to Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown, on whose authority it rests.

It is remarkable however that, as mentioned by
Glenville L. Williams, LL.D., in an article on Legal Unity of Husband and Wife,
10 Modern Law Review 16, there seems to be no case in which the rule has been
applied by an English Court. Indeed, and at the hearing before us, no such
precedent has been indicated. More remarkable, again, is the fact that the only
case upon which Hawkins himself relies -and which dates back to the reign of
Edward III, Year Book (1363/4) H., 38 E. 3, 3a- is one where a third party was
charged with the husband and the wife, and where the precise question, i.e.,
whether husband and wife can conspire by themselves alone, does not appear to
have been decided or even considered. A previous case, not alluded to by
Hawkins and reported in Year Book (1345) 19 E. 3 R.S. 346, is also one where a
third party was charged with the husband and the wife; the objection for the
defence was that “If this writ were good, for the same reason one would be good
if it were brought against a husband and wife alone, and it could not be
understood that the wife, who is at the will of her husband, could conspire
with him, because the whole would be accounted the act of the husband.” The
writ in this case was upheld without reasons given.

The rule and its proximate reason are expressed
as follows by Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown, vol. 9, 448:—

Section 8. It plainly appears from the
words of the statute, that one person alone cannot be guilty of conspiracy
within the purport of it; from whence it follows, that if all the defendants
who are prosecuted for such a conspiracy be acquitted but one, the acquittal of
the rest is the acquittal of that one also. Also upon the same ground it
hath been holden, that no such prosecution is maintainable against a husband
and his wife only, because they are esteemed but one person in law and presumed
to have but one will.

Thus it appears that the rule rests ultimately
on an ancient legal conception of the status of husband and wife who, being
then considered as one person were, for that reason, unable to enter an
agreement with one another;

[Page 508]

hence the consequential impossibility for either
to commit with the other a crime, the essence of which was then, in part at
least, the agreement. The rule appears then to have stemmed from the doctrine
of conjugal unity.

Relying on Hawkins’ proposition and the case he
quoted, Staunford, in P.C. 174(a), repeated the same opinion. And from
these writers, the rule that husband and wife cannot be guilty of conspiracy
together passed into modern textbooks, without having received judicial
sanction in the case invoked in support thereof.

The origin and the ensuing and changing legal
import of the doctrine of conjugal unity has been considered by Williams
(supra) whose views, in this respect, may substantially be summarized as
follows: The legal maxim that husband and wife are one person in the eyes of
the law has a biblical origin. It is found in the earliest English law book,
the “Dialogus de Scaccario” and in Bracton. It then passed to Littleton and
Coke. When judges came to state its legal aspect, they did it with caution. Thus
in Wenman v. Ash[9], Maule
J. said:—“In the the eyes of the law, no doubt, man and wife are for many
purposes one; but that is a strong figurative expression, and cannot be so
dealt with as that all the consequences must follow which would result from its
being literally true.” And in Phillips v. Barnett[10], Lush J. declared: “It is a
well-established maxim of the law that husband and wife are one person. For
many purposes, no doubt, this is a mere figure of speech, but for other
purposes it must be understood in its literal sense.” In truth, the maxim is a
misleading one even as applied to the unreformed common law. Blackstone
expressed the equation more soberly in saying: “By marriage, the husband and
wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the
woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and
consolidated into that of the husband.” (1 Commentaries 442). Even so
interpreted, the maxim is an imperfect interpretation of the common law.
Indeed, until the intervention of equity, according to Pollock and Maitland
(2d. ed. E. 485): “The main idea which governs the law of husband and wife

[Page 509]

is not that of an ‘unity of person’, but that of
the guardianship, the mund, the profitable guardianship, which the
husband has over the wife and over her property.” And Williams’ conclusion is
that, with the intervention of equity and later of statute, it became crystal
clear that a woman on marriage retained a legal personality distinct from that
of her husband and that it seems fairly clear that the alleged common law rule
that husband and wife cannot be guilty of conspiracy together, if it exists,
owes its origin to the doctrine of unity, or at any rate to the doctrine of the
wife’s subordination.

Other text-writers, who have specialized in the
study of criminal conspiracy or have dealt with this subject matter in relation
to domestic relations, have doubted the application of Hawkins’ rule to modern
times. Thus, reference may be had to Wright’s Criminal Conspiracies (1887) p.
59:—

The ancient writ of conspiracy appears not
to have lain against husband and wife alone. It is said to have lain against
husband, wife and a third person. (See Yearb. 38 Edw. 3, 3a: 40 Edw. 3, 19: 41
Edw. 3, 29: Fitzh. N.B. 116, 1: Staundf. 174). But the effect of the ancient
authorities is doubtful; and it may be questioned whether a husband and wife
could not be convicted of conspiracy in any of its modern forms. Proof,
however, of coercion by the husband would in such a case have the effect of
negativing the fact of conspiracy, since the force would avoid the agreement.

Harrison: Law of Conspiracy, page 76:—

It is generally stated (for example, by
Hawkins, “Pleas of the Crown”, i., 72, 8) that husband and wife cannot by
themselves be convicted of conspiracy, since in the eyes of the law they
constitute one person, and one alone cannot conspire. This was the case as
regards the old writ of conspiracy (see Y.B. 38 Edw. 3. 3a; 40 Edw. 3. 3, 19;
41 Edw. 3. 3, 29; Fitz. D.N.B. 116, 1), but it has been doubted whether it
would apply to the modern offence, unless coercion could be proved or presumed
(Wright on Conspiracies, p. 75). In R. v. Peel (Times, 8th March, 1922),
however, Darling, J., said that this rule still obtained: “Of course, it takes
at least two people to conspire, and being one person in law the situation is
that they” (that is, husband and wife) “cannot conspire”. Husband and wife can
conspire jointly with another person (see R. v. Whitehouse (1852) 6 Cox C.C.
38.

Eversley on Domestic Relations, 6th ed. page
150:—

It is said that a husband and wife cannot
be indicted for a conspiracy, because they are deemed to be as one person in
law, and have but one will (1 Hawk. P.C. c. 72, s. 8); but it is doubtful now
whether that proposition would be held to be good law if it were shown that the
agency of the wife was as active as that of the husband.

[Page 510]

Whatever, in the past, may have been the legal
import and effects of the doctrine of conjugal unity, and whatever influence
the doctrine, as modified with time, may claim to have exerted on the body of
Canadian law, Hawkins’ proposition that husband and wife “are esteemed but one
person in law, and are presumed to have but one will” is no longer true. No one
disputes that, in both the field of civil and criminal matters, husband and
wife have each an independent legal entity.

In civil matters, the remnants of legal
subordination of the wife to the husband, which, in either of the two jural
systems obtaining in civil matters in this country, the law as to legal
capacity may still manifest, assert of themselves the duality of entity.

As to criminal matters, it must be observed that
legal capacity is a notion foreign to our criminal law. Indeed, Parliament did
not purport to create, define, deal or even be concerned with legal capacity,
but rather imposed generally on all people within Canada—without considering at
all what the legal capacity of the offender might be, according to either
provincial or foreign Legislatures—criminal responsibility and punishment for
such commissions or omissions which, by action of Parliament, are declared to
be offences. In this respect and as manifested by the all-embracing nature of
the opening words of each section, i.e., “Everyone is guilty...” the substantive
provisions of the Code are, with few exceptions in rare cases, uniformly
enforceable throughout Canada against anyone who violates them, general
exception being made, not by reason of lack of legal capacity, of legal
subordination or marital status, or of presumed coercion, but by reason of want
of a discretion essential to mens rea in the cases of children under
seven, children between seven and fourteen, and persons labouring under natural
imbecility, disease of the mind or under specific delusions.

Unless they can be found to come within the
classes of persons so declared to escape the criminal responsibility for the
commission of any offence, husband and wife cannot, on the basis of marital
status, claim a defence, save

[Page 511]

in the case of these few crimes, which do not
include conspiracy, where Parliament, on account of marital status, excluded
them from the general application of these particular sections.

In brief, it is clear from such legislation at
least, and, particularly, from the general provisions of s. 21  enacting that
“no presumption shall be made that a married woman committing an offence does
so under compulsion because she commits it in the presence of her husband” that
the doctrine of conjugal unity has been, by and in criminal law, negatived. And
as to these isolated exceptions, excluding husband and wife from the general
operation of a few sections of the substantive law—which do not include
conspiracy—they, of course, stem from the very nature of domestic relations of
those having marital status, but a marital status which, in so far at least as
our criminal law is concerned, it is sufficient to say, no longer embodies the
legal notion of conjugal unity or subordination as it is said to have had in a
far distant past.

Thus the doctrine of conjugal unity, the
ultimate substratum of Hawkins’ rule, having perished by legal action, the
question is whether the rule itself has not perished.

Accepting that the rule formulated by Hawkins
must be taken as a true expression of the law as it then existed, the
substitution of a different legal concept with respect to marital status calls
for different jural conclusions. The rule itself implies that, had the state of
the law been then what it is today, i.e., had each spouse had a distinct legal
entity, they would have been found to be amendable to justice on a charge of
conspiracy. I have, therefore, formed the view that the rule has perished with
the disappearance of the reason which gave it life and support.

Assuming that such a conclusion on the first
proposition of the appellant is not justified, I adopt respectfully the views
expressed by Mr. Justice Laidlaw of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, who,
speaking for the majority, reached the conclusion that the provisions of s. 16 
of the Criminal Code  cannot apply since the rule invoked by the
appellant has been altered by and is, at least, inconsistent with the
provisions of the Criminal Code . In this respect, I only want to add a
few comments. It cannot be presumed that

[Page 512]

when Parliament enacted the Criminal Code , it
intended that the actual enforcement of such an important and far reaching
section as s. 573 —conspiracy to commit any indictable offence—would not be
uniform throughout Canada but would, in principle or measure, be dependent upon
such legislation with respect to marital status or legal capacity of the wife,
as, from time to time, provincial or foreign Legislatures would, acting within
their exclusive legislative competency, choose to adopt.

Furthermore, it has never been suggested that a
spouse cannot be charged with inciting the other spouse to commit a crime, and
there would seem to be no good reason for distinguishing between incitement and
conspiracy; for, in both of the cases, commission of the crime is inconceivable
unless there are, at least, two persons.

I have not failed to consider the majority
judgment rendered by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in The King v. McKechie
and the obiter dictum of Darling J., as he then was, in the Peel case.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Essential
elements—Accused charged with theft of cheque forged and issued against account
of company controlled by accused—Series of fraudulent transactions culminating
in issue of cheque—Whether cheque property of company—Whether company had
special property or interest in cheque—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s.
269.

The appellants were convicted by a jury on a
charge of stealing money and securities or other property or a valuable
security to the value of $960,000 belonging to B Mines Ltd. By an elaborate
fabrication, including the fabrication of minutes of meetings that never took
place, the

[Page 216]

forgery of a cheque in the name of the
company by the appellants and the sale of shares without the knowledge of the
optionee, the company was fraudulently deprived of $960,000 from its bank
account. All documents purporting to be signed by the company were signed by
two of the appellants representing themselves as president and treasurer and
the corporate seal was used where necessary. The convictions were affirmed by
the Court of Appeal, and the appellants obtained leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
convictions should be quashed.

The real case for the Crown was that the
appellants stole the cheque, but the verdict of the jury indicated that they
were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the cheque was an integral and
necessary part of an elaborate scheme of fraud to which the appellants were
parties and that none of the appellants could have thought that the company had
given its consent.

It was implicit in the findings of the jury
that the cheque was a false document, known to be false by the parties to this
scheme and made with the intent that it was to be used or acted upon as genuine
to the prejudice of the company. On these findings the cheque was a forgery.

The company did not have any ownership or
special property or interest in the cheque. The fact that the name of the company
was fraudulently inscribed on the cheque, and that loss might result to the
company, did not vest in the company any proprietary rights or special property
or interest therein. It would be creating a new and strange mode of acquisition
of property to hold that if A’s signature is forged by B on a document, A for
that sole reason could as owner recover that document from B. Possession of the
cheque was not at any material time that of the company. It was the possession
of those who created it to defraud the company. Therefore the cheque could not
have been stolen.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the
appellants convictions on a charge of theft of a cheque. Appeals allowed.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., for the appellant
Smith.

C.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant
Schonbrun.

G. McLean, for the appellant Stuart.

S.R. Ranch, in person.

Peter White, Q.C., and R. Shibley, for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—Pursuant to leave granted by this
Court, under s. 597(1)  (b) Cr.C ., the appellants appeal from a unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal
from their conviction on the first of several counts contained in the
indictment preferred against

[Page 217]

them. The Crown had elected to proceed on this
count. As amended at the close of the case for the prosecution, by the
insertion of the words here italicized, this count reads as follows:

that Ben Smith, D. Charles Stuart, Stanley
I. Schonbrun, Sol R. Rauch and Harold D. Rauch during the year 1957, at the
City of Toronto in the County of York and elsewhere, did steal money and
securities or other property or a valuable security to the value of
$960,000 more or less, the property of Brilund Mines Limited, contrary to the
Criminal Code .

The case for the Crown is not that these accused
stole money or securities which were the property of Brilund Mines Limited. In
essence, the case is that these appellants, by an elaborate fabrication,
obtained for their own use and benefit the sum of $960,000 from the company’s
bank account. Stuart obtained a blank cheque at the counter of the Bay Street
Branch of the Imperial Bank in Toronto and filled in the body of the cheque, payable to his order, for
$960,000. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch signed the cheque representing themselves
on its face as president and treasurer of the company. On May 1, 1957, this cheque was deposited to the
credit of Stuart’s bank account at the above-mentioned branch of the Imperial
Bank. The real case for the Crown is that the appellants stole this cheque.

These dealings are recited at length in the
address of the learned trial judge to the jury and in the reasons for judgment
delivered by Laidlaw J.A., for the Court of Appeal. As full a recital, however,
is unnecessary for the understanding of the questions of law to be considered
on this appeal. A simple and, I think, a true outline of the case for the
prosecution will sufficiently emerge from the following summary of the
interdependent and interlocked transactions carried out by the appellants and
their ultimate result, all of which happened within the four days from April 29
to May 2, 1957.

Prior to April 29, out of the 2,800,000 shares
of the company issued and outstanding in the hands of some 1,800 shareholders,
the appellant Ben Smith, with his brother Harry, owned or controlled 600,000
shares, of which 300,000 were in escrow. The market price of the company’s
shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange had been steadily declining for some time
and was about 47 cents per share. At that price the total value of 600,000
shares was below $300,000. The company had a credit balance of $577,000 in its
account at the King and York Streets Branch of the Imperial Bank

[Page 218]

in Toronto and a readily marketable block of shares in New Chamberlain
Petroleum Company Limited and Spooner Oils Limited. The company had granted to
Chapco Investments Corporation irrevocable and still exercisable options to
purchase these shares. The exercise of the options would bring in $455,000 and
thus increase the company’s credit balance to over one million dollars.

The appellant Stuart, a resident of North Bay, Ontario,
had for some years dealt in mining claims and was at that time the owner of 21
unpatented mining claims acquired by him within the year at a cost of $5,800
which, on the submission of the Crown, represented the maximum value of these
claims.

Knowing that Ben Smith had considered selling
his interest in the company, Stuart sought and obtained the confirmation that
the “Brilund deal” was still available. With the assistance of two “finders”,
he then invited to Toronto the two appellants Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch and
the brother of the latter, Harold Rauch, who were all three associated in a
company called Capital Funding Corporation, with offices in New York State.
Upon their arrival in Toronto
on April 30, these three were introduced to Smith and within 48 hours the
following interlocked and interdependent transactions were arranged and
completed:

(i) A sale by Smith of the 600,000 share
“control block” in the company to Stuart or his associates or both for a price
of $900,000, which was three times their indicated value on the stock exchange.
For the payment of this price, Stuart, who had a credit balance of $16 in
his account at the Bay Street Branch of the Imperial Bank in Toronto, drew a cheque on that account for
$900,000 payable to the order of Ben Smith. He and Sol R. Rauch arranged with
Udell, the Manager of that Branch, to certify this cheque but not to deliver it
until he had in his possession a cheque for $960,000 expected by Stuart as a
result of the transaction mentioned in the next paragraph (ii) and a cheque for
$1,010,000 which the company was to draw in its favour on the completion of the
transaction set out in paragraph (iii) in order to transfer its bank account
from the King and York Streets Branch to the Bay Street Branch.

(ii) A sale by Stuart to the company of his
21 unpatented mining claims, having a maximum value of $5,800 for the price of
$960,000. In payment for these claims, the cheque

[Page 219]

which is the subject-matter of the amended count
of the indictment was issued. Dated May 1, 1957, it was drawn on the new
account of the company at the Bay Street Branch of the Bank in the amount of
$960,000, made payable to the order of Stuart and signed for the company by
Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch, purporting to act as president and treasurer.

(iii) A sale by the company to Ben Smith of
the Chamberlain and Spooner shares for $460,856. Carried out without the
knowledge of the Chapco Investments Corporation, which had options on these
shares, this sale was made on the condition that, in the event of the exercise
of the options, Smith would surrender the shares to the optionee and be repaid
by the company the amount paid by him for their acquisition. This cheque for
$460,356, issued by Smith in favour of the company, was given by him to Findlay, his bank manager, with
instructions that it was to be used only if the sale of the 600,000 shares was
completed. Subsequently deposited to the King and York Streets Branch account
of the company, this cheque increased the credit balance of the company’s
account to $1,010,000 before that account was transferred to the Bay Street
Branch.

These transactions were all interlocked and mutually
dependent. Stuart’s cheque for $900,000 could only be paid if the company’s
cheque to his order for $960,000 was deposited to his credit. The company’s
cheque to Stuart for $960,000 could only be paid if the credit balance of
$577,000 in the company’s bank account was sufficiently increased. This
increase could only be achieved by the deposit to the company’s account of the
cheque for $460,356 issued by Smith in favour of the company in payment of the
Chamberlain and Spooner shares; and Smith’s cheque could not be used until the
sale by him of his 600,000 shares was completed.

All documents purporting to be signed by the
company were signed by Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch representing themselves as
its president and treasurer. The corporate seal of the company was used
wherever it was found necessary. However, on the submission of the Crown, the
minutes of the meetings purporting to have been held on May 1, 1957 and recording the election of
Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch as directors and as president and treasurer of the
company, the banking or other resolutions purporting to authorize

[Page 220]

them to sign for the company in the capacity
aforesaid, and all documents wherein the veracity of these facts was
represented, were false documents fabricated by the appellants for the
attainment of their dishonest purpose.

The ultimate result of all these transactions,
as related in respondent’s factum, was that Ben Smith received $900,000 from
Stuart for the sale of 600,000 shares of the company, half of which were in
escrow; Stuart received 200,000 shares of the company, half of which were in
escrow and retained about $4,000 cash in his bank account; Schonbrun and Sol R.
Rauch or Capital Funding Corporation received 400,000 shares of the company of
which 200,000 were in escrow, together with $6,000 in United States funds; and
each of the two “finders” received $25,000. All the moneys thus distributed
were derived from the $960,000 obtained from the company in exchange for the 21
unpatented mining claims of Stuart, valued at $5,800.

Such, in the main, are the facts relied on by
the prosecution,—and which, for the purpose of this appeal, are assumed to have
been found by the jury—as justifying in law the verdict of guilty returned
against the appellants on the charge of having stolen the cheque for $960,000,
the property of the company.

Two of the questions raised at the trial and on
appeal were whether this cheque was the property of the company or whether the
company had any special property or interest in it notwithstanding that its
signatories had no authority to issue or deliver the same. With respect to
these questions, the learned trial judge gave the following instructions to the
jury:

Now, I have explained the difference
between the former indictment and the present indictment, and I have explained
that you cannot convict any accused for stealing money or securities. All that
is open to you now is to convict or acquit with respect to stealing other
property or a valuable security, the property of Brilund.

The charge, “a valuable security to the
value of $960,000 more or less, the property of Brilund…” would certainly
include the cheque for $960,000, Exhibit 49. If you have any doubt about that,
it seems to me to be concluded by another provision of the Criminal Code  which
reads in this way, in part:

“In this Act…”

That is, in the Criminal Code ,

“a valuable security includes an

order for the payment of money.”

[Page 221]

Now, the second point is this: did Brilund
have any special property or interest in that cheque? If you find that
Schonbrun and Sol Rauch signed that particular cheque purporting to act for
Brilund, even without the authority of Brilund, then I tell you that Brilund
did have a special property or interest in it before it was delivered to Stuart
for negotiation. If you decide they signed it in furtherance of a dishonest
purpose, they were not acting as officers for Brilund but in their own personal
interests; but even so, Brilund would have a special interest in that cheque,
if for no other purpose, to try to get it back before it was cashed. In any
event, between the time the cheque was signed and when it was handed over to
Udell or Stuart it was in the possession of Brilund, and that possession would
be a special interest within the Code.”

On appeal and with reference to the same matter,
Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court, said:

It was contended first that the signatures
Stanley I. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch on the cheque for $960,000 in favour of
D. Charles Stuart were forgeries and that their acts in signing the cheque did
not constitute a corporate act of the company; in other words there was no
issue or delivery of the cheque in question by the company as a corporate body;
that the paper bearing the forged signatures Stanley I. Schonbrun and Sol R.
Rauch was not a “valuable security” within the meaning of that word as defined
in sec. 2(42)  of the Criminal Code  as follows:

“a…order…for the payment of money.” I do
not accept that argument. In my opinion, Schonbrun and Rauch signed the cheque
as officers of the company with ostensible authority and thereafter the cheque
became a valuable security and the property of the company. Even if it be
assumed that Schonbrun and Rauch had no authority in law or in fact to sign the
cheque, nevertheless, in my opinion and in the opinion of the learned trial
Judge, the company had a special property or interest in it and which could be
the subject of theft.

The questions of law upon which leave to appeal
to this Court was granted are:

1. Did the trial judge err in holding that
Brilund Mines Limited did not consent to the issue and delivery of the cheque
for $960,000, or, alternatively, did he err in holding that the cheque was
nevertheless the property of Brilund Mines Limited?

2. Did the trial judge err in holding that
there was no contract between Brilund Mines Limited and Stuart for the transfer
of the twenty-one mining claims?

3. Did the trial judge err in holding that
Brilund Mines Limited had a special property or interest in the cheque,
notwithstanding that the signatories to the cheque had no authority to issue
and deliver the same?

4. Did the trial judge err in instructing
the jury that the interest of the corporation in seeing the cheque was not
cashed constituted a special property or interest in the cheque?

I find it necessary to deal only with the two
questions whether the learned trial judge erred in holding, and instructing the
jury, that the cheque for $960,000 was the property of the company or that the
company had a special

[Page 222]

property or interest therein. With the greatest
deference to the learned judges of the two Courts below, my opinion is that
there was error in both these instructions to the jury. On the directions given
to the jury as to each of the essential elements of the offence of theft and as
to the various circumstances in which a person may be held to be a party to a
criminal offence, the verdict of the jury against the four appellants indicates
that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the cheque was an
integral and necessary part of an elaborate scheme of fraud to which all
appellants were parties and that none of the appellants could have thought that
the company gave a corporate consent to the purchase of these mining claims for
$960,000 or to the signing and delivery of the cheque purporting in appearance
to be given in payment thereof. These findings, involving each of the
appellants as particeps criminis in this fraudulent and indivisible
scheme, constitute the background against which must be considered the two
questions of law to be determined.

On the definition of theft given in s. 269 
Cr.C ., a thing cannot be said to have been stolen unless it appears that the
thing was taken or converted

…with intent to deprive…the owner of it or
a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his
property or interest in it.

The special property or interest, like the
property itself, must be in the very thing alleged to have been stolen. The
interest a person may have in protecting himself against loss or damage
resulting from the use of a document forged by and in the possession of another
is neither property nor “special property or interest” in the forged document.
It is also clear from the section that the property or the “special
property or interest” must exist at the time at which the theft, either by
taking or conversion, is committed.

It is implicit in the findings of the jury that
this cheque purporting to have been made by the company was a false document
(s. 268 -e Cr.C .), known to be false by the parties to this fraudulent scheme
and made with the intent that it was to be used or acted upon as genuine to the
prejudice of the company. On these findings this cheque was a forgery (s. 309 
Cr.C .).

[Page 223]

The company did not have any ownership or
special property or interest in the blank cheque picked up by Stuart at the
public counter of the bank; nor could it have any immediately prior to the
instant at which, after signing it, Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch delivered it to
Stuart. The company acquired no property and no “special property or interest”
in this cheque while it was under the control of any of the parties to this
fabrication nor upon its delivery by Stuart to Udell. The fact that the name of
the company was fraudulently inscribed on this cheque in the circumstances and
for the purposes aforesaid, and that loss might result to the company, does not
vest in the company any proprietary rights or special property or interest
therein. It would be creating a new and strange mode of acquisition of property
to hold that if A’s signature is forged by B on a document, A, for that sole
reason, could, as owner, recover that document from B. Had the appellants
elected to destroy the cheque before handing it over to Udell or had Udell
destroyed it upon its receipt, nothing whatever could be held to have been lost
to the company or stolen from it. Possession of this cheque was not at any
material time that of the company. It was the possession of those who created
it to defraud the company. Possession of this cheque was never entrusted to
them by the company. And if it was not entrusted to them by the company, they
could not, while having it under their control, steal it by conversion any more
than by taking.

In The King v. Phipoe[2], it was decided that to obtain from a
person his note of hand, by threats, is not a felonious stealing of the note,
for the reason that the note was never of value to or in the peaceable
possession of such person.

Being of the view that the two questions of law
extracted from the points on which leave to appeal was given and set out above
must be answered in the affirmative and that there was no taking or conversion
of this cheque by the appellants, I would allow the appeals, quash the
convictions and direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered on count (1) of the
indictment and the record to be returned to the Clerk of Assize of the Supreme
Court of Ontario at Toronto.

Appeals allowed, convictions quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Conviction for robbery—Substituted on
appeal for unlawful possession of property—Indictment dealt with robbery
alone—Whether unlawful possession an included offence—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 288, 296, 592.

[Page 230]

Appeals—Jurisdiction—Criminal law—Appeal by Attorney
General limited to pure question of law—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 598.

The accused was charged with the offence of robbery under s.
288 (b) of the Criminal Code  and was convicted as charged. The
Court of Queen's Bench reached the conclusion that he was not guilty of
robbery, and, exercising its power under s. 592(3) of the Code, found him
guilty of unlawful possession under s. 296  in the view that this was an
included or lesser offence to that of robbery. The indictment had contained a
count for robbery only. The accused and the Attorney General were both granted
leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The accused's appeal should be allowed and the
conviction under s. 296 set aside; the appeal of the Attorney General should be
quashed for want of jurisdiction.

The authorities do not hold that receiving stolen goods is
included in the offence of robbery or theft, but merely that recent possession
of stolen goods, if unexplained to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact,
may be evidence of robbery or theft. A count in an indictment is divisible and
where the commission of the offence charged includes the commission of another
offence, the accused may be convicted of the offence so
included if proven. Thus, a man charged with robbery may be found guilty of
theft, but a person charged with robbery may not be found guilty of receiving
stolen goods, as was done in this case, where the indictment contains a count
for robbery alone. Receiving stolen goods is a less serious offence, but is not
included in a charge of robbery. R. v. Louie Yee (1929), 1 W.W.R. 882,
applied.

As to the appeal of the Attorney General since the appeal was
based on a mixed question of law and fact and not on a pure question of law,
this Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.

APPEALS by the accused and the Attorney General from a
judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, substituting a conviction of
unlawful possession for that of robbery. Appeal of accused allowed; appeal of
Attorney-General quashed.

R. Daoust, Q.C., for the accused.

Bruno J. Pateras, for the Attorney-General.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—The
appellant Fergusson was charged as follows under s. 288  (b) of the Criminal
Code :

William Fergusson, en la cité d'Outremont,
district de Montréal, le ou vers le 28 juillet 1959, a illégalement volé
Gustave St-Germain de billets de banque, des effets de commerce et 120 coffrets
de sûreté, le tout d'une valeur d'environ $50,000.00, la propriété de la Banque
Provinciale du Canada, et en même temps ou immédiatement avant ou après ledit
William Fergusson de s'être porté à des actes de violence contre ledit Gustave
St-Germain, commettant par là un vol qualifié, un acte criminel, contrairement à
l'article 288  (b) du Code Criminel .

[Page 231]

Section 288  (b) of the Criminal Code  reads as
follows:

288. Every one commits a robbery who

(b) steals from any person
and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter,
wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person,

The case was heard in Montreal before His Honour Judge M. A.
Blain of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, who found the accused guilty,
and sentenced him to be detained in the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary for a
period of eight years.

The Court of Queen's Bench2
reached the conclusion that Fergusson was not guilty of robbery, but found him
guilty under s. 296  of the Criminal Code , which is to the effect that
every one commits an offence who has anything in his possession knowing that it
was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by
indictment. The Court decided that receiving is an included or a lesser offence
to that of robbery, and that under s. 592 , para. 3, of the Criminal Code , it
could substitute the verdict that in its opinion should have been found and
affirm the sentence passed by the trial judge or impose a sentence that is
warranted in law.

It is the contention of the appellant Fergusson that the
offence of which the Court of Queen's Bench found him guilty is not an offence
included in the offence of robbery, and that the Court had no power to
substitute a verdict of that kind for the one that was set aside by the Court
itself. It is therefore submitted that the appellant should be acquitted.

In the Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Casey relied on Duplessis
v. The King3,
to support the view that an offence must be regarded as being included in
another, if the elements of the latter include those of the former. For the
same proposition, Mr. Justice Choquette cited Baker v. Regem4; Rex
v. Loughlin5;
Rex v. Seymour6;
Rex v. Siggins7.

[Page 232]

In Duplessis v. Regem, the
Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec ruled that obtaining money
under false pretence is of the same nature as theft, and that it is an included
offence, the only difference being the means adopted for committing the
offence.

In Baker v. Regem, it was
held that possession by the accused shortly after a burglary of goods, stolen
at the time of the burglary, if unexplained, is sufficient to warrant a
conviction of burglary or theft.

In Rex v. Loughlin, the Court of Criminal Appeal of
England held that where it is proved that premises have been broken into and
property stolen therefrom, and that very soon after the breaking the prisoner
has been found in possession of that property, it was open to the jury to find
the prisoner guilty of breaking and entering, and the jury should be so
directed. The Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Seymour applied
the Loughlin case.

In Rex v. Siggins, the Ontario Court of Appeal
reached the conclusion that the offence of theft, where the person charged is
the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by him of the
articles stolen, and the person found in possession of goods which he himself
has stolen, has also committed the offence of having in his possession goods
knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown of course is entitled to lay both
charges against him. If the jury convict of theft, they should not convict on
the charge of unlawful possession. If, however, they acquit on the charge of
theft, they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the
other charge. It must be kept in mind that in Siggins the accused was
charged on two counts, one of theft and the other of unlawful possession.

These judgments do not hold that receiving stolen goods is
included in the offence of robbery or theft, but merely that recent possession
of stolen goods, if unexplained, to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact,
may be evidence of robbery or theft. In Seymour it was held that there
should be two counts where the evidence is as consistent with larceny as with
receiving, and that the jury should be directed that it is for them to decide
whether the prisoner was the thief or whether he received a property from the
thief, and should be reminded that a man cannot receive property from himself.

[Page 233]

In the present case, there was only one count in the
indictment, and the charge was for robbery in violation of s. 288 (b) of
the Criminal Code . A count in an indictment is divisible and where the
commission of the offence charged includes the commission of another
offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused
may be convicted of an offence so included that is proved, notwithstanding that
the whole offence that is charged is not proved, or of an attempt to commit an
offence so included. (Criminal Code  569). Thus, a man charged with
robbery may be found guilty of theft, but a person charged with robbery may not
be found guilty of receiving stolen goods, as was held by the Court of Queen's
Bench in the present instance. Receiving stolen goods is a less serious
offence, but is not included in a charge of robbery.

The count must therefore include but not necessarily mention
the commission of another offence, but the latter must be a lesser offence than
the offence charged. The expression ""lesser offence"" is a ""part
of an offence"" which is charged, and it must necessarily include some
elements of the ""major offence"", but be lacking in some of the
essentials, without which the major offence would be incomplete. Rex v.
Louie Yee8.

Fergusson's appeal should therefore be allowed and the
conviction against him set aside.

As to the appeal of the Attorney General who submits that
the judgment of the trial judge should be restored and that the accused should
be found guilty of robbery as charged, this Court has no jurisdiction to make
such an order. On June 26, 1961, Fergusson was granted leave to appeal by this
Court, and on the same date, the application of the Attorney General was also
granted. In the latter case, Mr. Justice Fauteux was ""dubitante"" as
to our jurisdiction but, nevertheless, leave was granted. Upon consideration
and a review of the whole case, the appeal of the Attorney General must be
quashed.

This Court has jurisdiction to entertain appeals by the
Attorney General in criminal matters under s. 598 of the Code. But, it is only
where a judgment of a Court of Appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an
appeal taken under para. (a) of s. 583, or dismisses an appeal taken
pursuant

[Page 234]

to para. (a) of s. 584. Paragraph (a) of s.
598 states that it must necessarily be on a pure question of law, and here, I
am of the opinion that the appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec is not
based on a pure question of law, but on a mixed question of law and fact. The
Court of Queen's Bench was not satisfied with the findings of the learned trial
judge, particularly that the proof of identification and some other facts,
while creating an atmosphere of suspicion, did not meet the test to which all
circumstantial evidence must be put. Both Courts had to weigh the evidence. The
trial judge found that there was direct and circumstantial evidence against the
accused, sufficient to find him guilty of the offence as charged. The Court of
Queen's Bench found that there was not.

In view of the decision of this Court in The King v.
Wilmot9,
it may be contended that this Court has no jurisdiction on the further
ground that the accused having been found guilty by the Court of Queen's Bench
of receiving stolen goods, was not acquitted within the meaning of s. 598  of
the Criminal Code . He was of course acquitted of robbery, but found
guilty of a different offence. However, in view of my conclusion that we are
not faced with a pure question of law, it becomes immaterial to discuss this
point any further.

Fergusson's appeal is therefore allowed, and the order of
the Court of Queen's Bench and the conviction are set aside. The appeal of the
Attorney General is quashed for want of jurisdiction.

Appeal of accused allowed;
Appeal of Attorney-General quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Bribery—Bribes offered to Chief Building
Inspector of city— Whether proof that he was a municipal official—Whether
bribery related to official act—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s.
104—City Act, R.S.C. 1955, c. 42, s. 2(q).

The accused was charged under s. 104  of the Criminal Code  with
offering bribes to W, the Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, in
consideration for that official to fail to perform certain official acts. The
trial judge held that the bribes had been offered, but dismissed the charges on
the ground that there was no evidence that W had been appointed as an official
in accordance with s. 104 of the Code. The Court of Appeal set aside the
acquittal and found the accused guilty, as charged.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The finding of fact by the trial judge that the bribes had
been offered having been unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal and being
entirely consistent with the probabilities of the case, could not be disturbed.

The uncontradicted evidence of W that he was both the Chief
Building Inspector and a municipal official, coupled with the description of
his official activities contained in his own evidence and in that of the
appellant, and which were appropriate to those of a person holding office
within the dictionary sense of that term and under The City Act, R.S.C.
1955, c. 42, constituted prima facie evidence that he was a person who
held office under the City of Calgary and was a municipal official within the
meaning of s. 104 of the Code. It has been held on more than one occasion that
evidence of a person acting in an official capacity raises a rebuttal
presumption of his due appointment to that office. In this case there was not
only evidence of W having performed the duties, but there was also direct
evidence from W himself that he held the appointment and it was plain that the
appellant recognized that he represented the city in an official capacity.
There was evidence that the alleged bribes related to an official act.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1,
reversing a judgment of Cairns J. and finding the accused guilty of having
offered bribes. Appeal dismissed.

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and Robert H.
Barron, Q.C., for the appellant.

[Page 255]

H. J. Wilson, Q.C., and
R. P. Adolphe, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court
of Alberta2
allowing the appeal of the Crown from the judgment of Cairns J. whereby the
present appellant had been acquitted of the following two charges:

1. That he, at Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, on the 9th day of November, A.D. 1959, did offer
to Lawrence Walker, Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, a
Municipal Official, the sum of $500 as consideration for the said official to
fail to perform an official act, contrary to Section 104  of the Criminal Code .

2. That he, at Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, on the 22nd day of August, A.D. 1960, did offer
to Lawrence Walker, Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, a
Municipal Official, the sum of $300 as consideration for the said official to
fail to perform an official act, contrary to Section 104  of the Criminal Code .

Mr. Walker, who testified that during the years 1959-60
he held the position of Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary and was
a municipal official, recounted two separate occasions upon which the appellant
offered him money. The first incident took place on November 9, 1959, after
Walker, in his capacity as Chief Building Inspector, had condemned a building
owned by the appellant and one J. Singer; Walker states that at this time the
appellant said to him:

Allow this building to remain in occupancy for another year,
and forget about the condemning order, and if you will so do I will give you
$500.

and that he then took some money out of his pocket and
put it on the table between them. The second incident which took place on
August 22, 1960, concerned an order issued by one of the building inspectors in
Walker's department, notifying a ""builder-owner"" by the name of
Korytko that a building on his property was being over-developed in contravention
of a city by-law; in this regard Walker's best recollection of the relevant
portion of his conversation with the appellant is that ""he asked me if I
would overlook this over-development, and if I would overlook it he would give
me $300.""

[Page 256]

The appellant denied having made these offers, but the
learned trial judge, having heard all of the evidence, expressed himself as
follows:

I have no doubt whatsoever on the facts of this case that
the defendant offered the bribes alleged in the charges. It has been proved to
me to a moral certainty and beyond reasonable doubt. There is no question about
that at all. On that I accept the evidence of Mr. Walker, and I don't think I
need to go any further; it follows that if I accept his evidence I do not
accept other evidence.

It is contended on behalf of the appellant that because the
learned trial judge acquitted him on the ground that there was no evidence that
Mr. Walker had been appointed as an official in accordance with s. 104  of the Criminal
Code , it, must, therefore, follow that the above-quoted finding was obiter
and should be disregarded as having been intended to be ""a mere
gratuitous rebuke to the appellant"". This finding is also attacked on the
ground that no reasons are given for it and one of the grounds stated in the
notice of appeal to this Court is that the Appellate Division erred in law in
not holding that the trial judge had misdirected himself in determining the
credibility of witnesses without considering whether or not the evidence of the
witnesses whom he believed was in accordance with the probabilities of the
case.

In my view the excerpt above-quoted from the decision of the
learned trial judge constitutes a clear finding of fact for which it was
unnecessary to give any other reason than his acceptance of the evidence of
Walker. (See Lemay v. The King3).
As this finding has been unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal and as
it is, in my view, entirely consistent with the probabilities of the case, I do
not think it can be disturbed.

In acquitting the appellant, the learned trial judge said:

However, I feel the Crown has failed to prove that in the
acts which Mr. Walker did, he was acting as an official in accordance with the
terms of Section 104 . An official is one, as Mr. McGillivray points out, who is
appointed either by by-law or resolution of a city. There is no evidence before
me that Mr. Walker has been so appointed, and unless he does these acts as à
person holding office under a municipal government, and the office is proven in
the manner in which he is appointed, I think the charge must fail.

In setting aside the acquittals which were based on
this finding, Macdonald J.A., speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division,
held it to be ""abundantly proved that Walker was Chief Building Inspector
of the City of Calgary"" and that

[Page 257]

as such he ""held an office under a municipal
government, namely, the City of Calgary"". It followed from these
conclusions that the Appellate Division found him to be ""a municipal
official"" within the meaning of s. 104  of the Criminal Code , the
relevant portions of which read as follows:

104. (1) Every one who

(a) gives, offers or
agrees to give or offer to a municipal official, or

(b) being a municipal
official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from any person, a
loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for the
official

* * *

(f) to perform or fail to
perform an official act, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for two years.

* * *

104. (3) In this section ""municipal official""
means a member of a municipal council or a person who holds an office under a
municipal government.

In conformity with the finding of the learned trial judge,
it was urged on behalf of the appellant that there was no evidence that Walker
was ""a municipal official"" within the meaning of this section or that
either of the alleged offers of money related to ""an official act"".
In support of this contention, it was said that the only evidence quoted by the
Appellate Division as a basis for its finding that Walker was a municipal
official was his affirmative answer to the question: ""Mr. Walker, during
the year 1959 and during the year 1960 and up to the present moment, were you a
municipal official?"" and that the finding cannot stand because this was an
improper and leading question, the answer to which involved the very question
of law which the trial court had to decide. I do not agree that this question
and answer formed the basis for the finding of the Appellate Division, but in
any event it is significant to note that no evidence was called to contradict
this answer and that the first question and answer on Walker's
cross-examination by appellant's counsel were:

Q. Mr. Walker, you have been the
Chief Building Inspector for a matter of some four years?

A. That is correct.

This latter statement which is uncontradicted, when
taken together with the extensive evidence illustrative of the manner in which
Walker carried out his duties in the inspection of buildings, appears to me to
fully justify the finding of the

[Page 258]

Court of Appeal that it is ""abundantly proved that
Walker was the Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary"". That this
evidence is of itself sufficient to support such a finding is shown by
reference to R. v. Gordon4,
Berryman v. Wise5
and other cases cited in Roscoe's Criminal Evidence, 16th ed.,
p. 11.

Certainly Walker's own evidence that he had been Chief
Building Inspector for some four years disposes of the argument advanced on
behalf of the appellant to the effect that the fact of Walker having signed
certain letters as ""Building Inspector"" simpliciter raised
some doubts as to whether he held the office of Chief Building Inspector.

It is, however, stated in the appellant's factum and was
strenuously argued on this appeal that the real issue in the present case

… is not whether Walker was the Chief Building Inspector,
but rather whether the Chief Building Inspector is a ""municipal
official"" within the strict narrow meaning of that term as defined in sec.
104(3).

This resolves itself into the question of whether the
Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary has been shown to be ""a
person who holds office under a municipal government"" and this in turn
depends in great degree on the meaning to be given to the word
""office"" as used in s. 104(3). Section 99 (d) of the Criminal Code  provides
that in Part III of the Code the word ""office"" includes:

(i) an office or appointment
under the government;

(ii) a civil or military
commission; and

(iii) a position or employment
in a public department.

I am satisfied, however, that this section does not
apply to an ""office"" under a municipal government, and that Macdonald J.A. was entirely justified in referring to the
definitions of ""office"" contained in the New Century and Shorter
Oxford English Dictionaries. The evidence in the present case is that the
duties of the Chief Building Inspector included the inspection of buildings for
the purpose of enforcing the by-laws of the city, and that as Chief Building
Inspector Walker had authority to supersede decisions made by building
inspectors in the Building Inspection Division. A position which involved such
authority, responsibility and

[Page 259]

public trust can, in my view, properly be described as
an ""office"" within the meaning of s. 104(3)  of the Criminal Code .

The City Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 42, which appellant's
counsel describes as ""the Charter of the City of Calgary"" is advanced
as containing a number of sections which are of considerable help in
determining whether or not a ""Chief Building Inspector"" is an
""official"" of the City of Calgary. Section 2(q) of that Act reads as
follows:

""official"" includes a city commissioner, city
manager, city clerk, city treasurer, assessor, city solicitor, auditor,
comptroller, city engineer and any other official appointed by the council
to any office pursuant to the provisions of Part III, Division B; (The
italics are mine.)

It is provided in Part III, Division B (s. 55(1)) that
""such other officials as are deemed necessary for carrying into effect of
the provisions of the"" City Act are to be appointed by resolution
of the City Council and s. 81(1) requires that before entering upon the duties
of his office such an official shall make and subscribe the official oath,
solemn affirmation or declaration prescribed by the Oaths of Office Act. Although
The City Act does not expressly mention the office of Chief Building
Inspector, the provisions of ss. 385 to 389 deal with ""Control of
Buildings"" and s. 388(e) provides that the

… Council may pass by-laws

* * *

(e) appointing street and building inspectors and
defining their duties.

As the evidence makes it clear that there was a Chief
Building Inspector and as there was no evidence that he was not properly
appointed, it is to be assumed that the City Council of the City of Calgary
deemed it necessary to appoint and did appoint such an official for carrying
into effect the provisions of The City Act.

The substance of the appellant's argument in this regard is
that there was no evidence that Walker had been appointed by resolution or
by-law of the City Council. In my view, Walker's uncontradicted evidence that
he was both the Chief Building Inspector and a ""municipal official"",
coupled with the description of his official activities contained in his own
evidence and in that of the appellant, constitutes prima facie evidence
that he was a person who held office under the City of Calgary and was a
""municipal

[Page 260]

official"" within the meaning of s. 104(3) . It has been
held on more than one occasion that evidence of a person acting in an official
capacity raises a rebuttable presumption of his due appointment to that office.
(See Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 15, p. 347,
para. 628; Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 120; R. v.
Smith6;
R. v. Goodman7;
R. v. Roberts8
and Doe v. Brawn9).
In this case there is not only evidence of Walker having personally
inspected buildings in the City of Calgary and of his having been the superior
officer in control of other building inspectors, but there is also direct
evidence from the official himself that he held the appointment, and it is
plain that the appellant recognized that he represented the City of Calgary in
an ""official capacity"". In the course of his direct examination, the
appellant, referring to Walker's having condemned another building, said that
he did whatever Walker asked him to do, and he was then asked:

Q. Why did you do what he asked
you?

A. Why? I couldn't help it.

Q. Not because he is a nice
fellow?

A. No.

Q. Just because you couldn't help
it?

A. I couldn't help it, it is the
City, you couldn't knock the City.

As to the contention that there was no evidence that
either of the alleged bribes related to an official act, it seems to me to be
sufficient to say that Walker's evidence, as to his refusal of the money
offered in November 1959, is that he told the appellant,

… that in my office as Building Inspector I had, it was my
duty to do what I believed was the proper thing to do in relation to the
building by-law regarding buildings.

and that when the appellant asked him in August 1960 to
overlook the ""over-development"" by the builder-owner Korytko he was,
in effect, asking him to countermand an order made by a building inspector who
was under his authority which order was enforceable by the laying of a charge
under By-law 4682 of the City of Calgary. In my opinion, if he had complied
with either of these requests, Walker would have failed to perform an official
act.

[Page 261]

The last error alleged in the decision of the Appellate
Division was that the findings by that Court that Walker was ""a municipal
official"" and that the bribes related to ""an official act"" were
findings of fact which that Court had no jurisdiction to make on an appeal by
the Crown. There was no conflict of evidence as to the fact that Walker was the
Chief Building Inspector and the alleged findings of fact, in my opinion,
constitute a decision of the Appellate Division that under the true
construction of the language used in s. 104(3)  of the Criminal Code  the
holder of such a position is a ""municipal official"" and the acts
performed in his capacity as such are ""official acts"" within the
meaning of those phrases as used in that section. This was a decision which the
Appellate Division had jurisdiction to make in this case.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Summary
conviction—Plea of guilty—Whether right to appeal—Conditions precedent for
appeal—Whether accused bound by plea on trial de novo—Whether right to appeal
to Court of Appeal—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 708, 719, 720,
722(1)(a), 723, 727, 743(1)(a).

The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of impaired driving and
was summarily convicted by a magistrate. He appealed to the County Court, and,
on preliminary objection taken to the sufficienty of his grounds

[Page 287]

for appeal, the County Court judge dismissed his appeal
without hearing evidence or taking any plea. It was held that the grounds did
not disclose a sufficient degree of particularity to comply with s. 722(1) (a)
of the Code. The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and referred the matter
back to the County Court. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The taking of a plea from the accused forms no part of the
hearing of the trial de novo by way of appeal from a summary conviction
pursuant to s. 727 of the Code. Compliance with s. 722 is all that is required
to found jurisdiction. Consequently, the failure of the County Court judge, in
this case, to take a plea did not deprive him of jurisdiction. Although an
accused, after pleading guilty in the first instance, is bound by such plea in
the trial de novo, nevertheless he is not debarred from changing his
plea upon showing proper grounds for so doing. Thibodeau v. The Queen,
[1955] S.C.R. 646, applied.

The allegation, made in the present case, that ""there was
no legal evidence to support the conviction"" was a proper and sufficient
ground of appeal to comply with s. 722 of the Code on an appeal under that
section from a summary conviction.

The accused had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal when
the County Court judge dismissed his appeal, as he did in this case, on
preliminary objections, without a trial de novo, by virtue of s. 743(1)
(a).

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Remnant Co. Ct. J. and
referring the matter back to the County Court. Appeal dismissed.

J. J. Urie, for the
appellant.

R. R. Maitland, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—In the present case
the respondent, having been convicted and sentenced under Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code  by W. G. Harris, Esq., a Police Magistrate in and for the District of
Powell River, for driving a motor vehicle whilst his ability to do so was
impaired, appealed such conviction to the County Court of Vancouver on the
following grounds:

1. The said conviction was
against the law and the weight of evidence.

2. The said conviction was
contrary to law.

3. There was no legal
evidence to support the said conviction.

[Page 288]

Preliminary objection having been
taken to the sufficiency of these grounds, the learned County Court judge
dismissed the said appeal without hearing evidence or taking any plea, holding
that the said grounds did not disclose a sufficient degree of particularity to
comply with the requirements of s. 722(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code .

From this decision the respondent
gave notice seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia,
and upon such leave having been granted the appeal was duly heard and allowed
and the matter was referred back to the County Court by order of the said Court
of Appeal[2].

From this latter order the
appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court, and by order dated June 25,
1959, such leave was granted upon the following grounds:

1. Did the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia err in holding that the Notice of Appeal under
section 722  of the Criminal Code  of the respondent from his conviction
by the magistrate to the County Court of Vancouver set out the grounds of
appeal in sufficient particularity?

2. Did the failure of the
County Court to take a plea deprive it of jurisdiction?

3. Was there a right of
appeal by the respondent to the Court of Appeal when the County Court had
dismissed the appeal to it on preliminary objections without a trial de
novo?

Although the first of these
grounds was virtually abandoned by the appellant at the argument before this
Court and counsel for the appellant found himself in agreement with the
decision of the Court of Appeal giving a negative answer to the question raised
by the second ground, this Court was nonetheless invited to express its views
concerning the nature of the right of appeal for which provision is made in ss.
720 to 726 inclusive of the Criminal Code  and the type of trial
contemplated by the provisions of s. 727 . It is, therefore, desirable to make
some general observations before dealing specifically with the particular
questions raised in this appeal.

Section 720  of the Criminal
Code  reads in part as follows:

Except where otherwise
provided by law.

(a) the defendant in
proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court

(i) from a conviction or
order made against him, or

(ii) against a sentence
passed upon him; and

[Page 289]

(b) the informant,
the Attorney General or his agent in proceedings under this Part may appeal to
the appeal court

(i) from an order dismissing
an information, or

(ii) against a sentence
passed upon a defendant ….

The Appeal Court
referred to in this section means one of the Courts specified in s. 719. In the
case of the Province of British Columbia this means the ""County Court of the County in which the cause of
the proceedings arose"". In my opinion, the provisions of this section, unless
cut down by some other provisions of the Criminal Code , accord a right
of appeal to any ""defendant in proceedings under this Part [Part
XXIV]"" irrespective of the nature of the plea taken in the Court of first
instance and limited only by the necessity of complying with the following
conditions:

722. (1) Where an appeal is
taken under section 720 , the appellant shall

(a) prepare a notice
of appeal in writing setting forth

(i) with reasonable
certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed
against, and

(ii) the grounds of appeal; ….

As is indicated by Fauteux J.,
speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court in Dennis v. The Queen[3],
compliance with these provisions is not only a condition precedent to the
exercise of the right of appeal under s. 720  but it is the very foundation upon
which the jurisdiction of the Appeal Court must and does rest as can be seen
from the opening words of s. 723 which read as follows:

723. (1) Where an appellant
has complied with section 722 , the appeal court or a judge thereof shall set
down the appeal for hearing at a regular or special sittings thereof and the
clerk of the appeal court shall post, in a conspicuous place in his office, a
notice of every appeal that has been set down for hearing and notice of the
time when it will be heard.

(2) No appeal shall be set
down for hearing at a time that is less than ten days after the time when
service was effected upon the respondent of the notice referred to in paragraph
(b) of subsection (1)  of section 722 , unless the parties or their
counsel or agents otherwise agree in writing.

As is noted by Sheppard J.A., in
the course of the decision rendered by him on behalf of the Court of Appeal, it
is well to appreciate the significance of the last quoted section, requiring as
it does that the Appeal Court or a judge thereof ""shall set down the
appeal for hearing"" upon being satisfied that s. 722  has been complied
with. Such power to ""set down the appeal for hearing"" presupposes
jurisdiction to hear it

[Page 290]

and in my view compliance with s.
722  is all that is required to found jurisdiction in the Appeal Court
and the ""plea"" which, if it were required, would be taken at a later
stage forms no part of the material upon which the jurisdiction of the Court is
based.

The nature of the hearing of an
appeal under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code  is described in s. 727  and
conflict of opinion has been expressed between the Courts of last resort in
some of the provinces of Canada as to the effect of the following provisions of
subs. (1) of that section:

727. (1) Where an appeal has
been lodged in accordance with this Part from a conviction or order made
against a defendant, or from an order dismissing an information, the appeal
court shall hear and determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo,
and for this purpose the provisions of sections 701 to 716, insofar as they are
not inconsistent with sections 720  to 732 , apply, mutatis mutandis.

The difficulty which has given
rise to much of the conflict is centered about the question of whether the
words ""appeal by holding a trial de novo"" are intended to
describe ""an appeal"" in the sense of a review of the proceedings and
decision in the Court of first instance as in the case of an appeal to a
provincial Court of Appeal from conviction for an indictable offence or whether
they are more descriptive of a ""new trial"" such as that which is held
pursuant to order of the Court of Appeal after a conviction has been quashed.

As was said by Hogg J.A. in R.
v. Crawford[4],
the outstanding distinction between the trial de novo contemplated by s.
727 and the new trial which may be ordered by the Court of Appeal is that in
the latter case the conviction has been quashed before the new trial
starts whereas in the former the conviction remains outstanding, subject,
however, to being reversed by the Appeal Court on evidence called afresh or
indeed on entirely new evidence. In the one case, the conviction has gone while
in the other it is under review by fresh eyes in the light of fresh evidence.

On the other hand, the
distinction between ""an appeal by holding a trial de novo"" and
an appeal to the provincial Court of Appeal is that although the object of both
is to determine whether the decision appealed from was right or wrong, in the
latter case the question is whether it was right

[Page 291]

or wrong having regard to the
evidence upon which it was based, whereas in the former the issue is to be
determined without any reference, except for purposes of cross-examination, to
the evidence called in the Court appealed from and upon a fresh determination
based upon evidence called anew and perhaps accompanied by entirely new
evidence. It is to be borne in mind, of course, that under the provisions of s.
727(2) the Appeal Court may, under the circumstances therein specified,
treat the evidence of any witness in the Court below as having the same force
and effect as if the witness had given evidence before the Appeal Court.
This can be done by consent of both the appellant and the respondent or if a witness
cannot be reasonably obtained or if the evidence is purely formal or the Court
is otherwise satisfied that this procedure will not prejudice the opposite
party. When this procedure is followed, the evidence so introduced is to be
treated by the Court of Appeal in all respects as if it were being actually
given for the first time before that Court and all objections are available to
either party in the same way that they would be if the evidence was being given
vivâ voce for the first time.

A further difficulty which has
given rise to some conflict is the question of whether the accused should be
required to plead at a ""trial de novo"". This difficulty has
been occasioned by the fact that s. 708 which in terms requires that the
defendant ""shall be asked"" to plead is included in the group of
sections (701 to 716) which apply to a trial de novo ""insofar as
they are not inconsistent with sections 720  to 732 "" (see s. 722 ).

While this point is not directly
raised in the grounds specified in this appeal, it forms such an integral part
of the whole question that it is as well to consider it here.

There can be no trial in the
strict sense of that word until issue has been joined and as issue is not
joined in a criminal case until the plea is entered the meaning of
""trial"" as used in the phrase ""trial de novo"" in s.
727 would seem both logically and grammatically to indicate the proceedings
after the entry of the plea. This is the meaning which was attributed to its
use in the other sections of Part XXIV which were under consideration in The
Queen v. Larson[5],

[Page 292]

per Abbott J., and it should, therefore, be construed as
connoting ""the hearing alone"" exclusive of the plea and arraignment.
A consideration of proceedings on trial by jury brings to mind the fact that
the trial proper does not start until the accused is given in charge to the
jury which stage is, of course, not reached until after the plea has been taken
and the adoption of this more restricted meaning of the word ""trial""
has been widely accepted in our own Courts for many years. See In re Walsh[6],
approved in Giroux v. The King[7],
per Anglin J., and Clement v. The Queen[8].
This is also the effect of what was said by Hogg J.A. in R. v. Crawford,
supra. That the same connotation of the word ""trial"" applies to
its use in relation to proceedings before a magistrate in England may be seen
from the decision of Lord Goddard in R. v. Craske[9],
and it is also to be noted that the plea is not required when a new trial is
held on appeal from a conviction of an indictable offence. See Welch v. The
King[10],
per Fauteux J.

This interpretation is borne out
by a consideration of the anomaly which would be created if an accused were required
to plead to a charge in respect of which he had already been convicted in the
course of a proceeding taken for the purpose of bringing such conviction into
question and throughout the whole of which the conviction entered upon the
earlier plea remains outstanding. These considerations seem to indicate that
the procedure for taking a plea which is outlined in s. 708 is indeed
inconsistent with the provisions of s. 727 and, therefore, inapplicable to the
hearing for which provision is made in the latter section. This does not mean
that an accused who has pleaded guilty in the Court of first instance is
debarred from changing his plea upon showing proper grounds for so doing. He
stands before the Appeal Court in exactly the same position procedurally as he
stood before the magistrate after having made his plea and he may be allowed to
change that plea. See Thibodeau v. The Queen[11],
per Cartwright J. at 653 and Fauteux J. at 657.

[Page 293]

As to the first ground of appeal
specified in the order granting leave to appeal to this Court, counsel for the
appellant stated during the argument that after more mature consideration he
had concluded, with respect to this ground, that the third ground of the
respondent's original notice of appeal to the County Court was a proper one,
namely, ""There was no legal evidence to support the conviction"". I am
in entire agreement with this conclusion as were the learned judges of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia and no further comment is necessary on this
phase of the matter in this case.

The second ground of appeal to
this Court, ""Did the failure of the County Court to take a plea deprive it
of jurisdiction?"" is in somewhat the same category as the first because in
this regard counsel for the appellant agrees with the conclusion reached by the
learned judges of the Court of Appeal with which conclusions, as can be seen, I
am also in agreement for the reasons above stated which are substantially the
same as those expressed by Sheppard J.A., speaking on behalf of the majority of
that Court.

The third ground of appeal was
fully argued and involves a consideration of the meaning to be attached to the
words used in s. 743(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . These
words are:

743. (1) An appeal to the
court of appeal, as defined in section 581 may, with leave of that court, be
taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone, against

(a) a decision of a
court in respect of an appeal under section 727….

It was argued on behalf of the
appellant that when an Appeal Court, within the meaning of s. 719, has decided
that it has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal under s. 727 because the notice
of appeal required by s. 722  is inadequate, it has not, by so doing, made a
decision ""in respect of an appeal under section 727"" at all, but
rather one in respect of s. 722  from which there is no provision for appeal,
and that the only remedy lies in a writ of mandamus. It seems to me that
the time for making such a decision is the time when the appeal is to be set
down for hearing as required by s. 723, and the nature of the decision to be
made at this time is whether or not all formalities have been complied with so
as to make it necessary to ""set down the appeal for hearing 

[Page 294]

at a regular or special
sittings"" of the Appeal Court. The ""hearing"" there referred to is
obviously a hearing under s. 727, and the decision as to whether or not the
Court will hear an appeal under that section certainly seems to me to be
""a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727"". As
was indicated by Fauteux J. at the hearing of this appeal, this construction is
borne out by the French version of s. 743(1)  (a) which reads as
follows:

743. (1) Un appel à la cour
d'appel, telle qu'elle est définie dans Particle 581, peut, avec la permission
de cette cour, être interjeté, pour tout motif qui comporte une question de
droit seulement,

(a) de toute décision
d'une cour relativement à un appel prévu par l'article 727….

In view of all the above, it will
be seen that I am of opinion that the notice of appeal of the respondent from
his conviction by the magistrate set out the grounds of appeal in sufficient
particularity, that the failure of the County Court to take a plea did not
deprive it of jurisdiction, that the respondent had a right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal when the County Court dismissed his appeal on preliminary
objection and that this appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Common gaming houses—Slot machines—Whether
bowling machine giving amusement and chance of free game depending on skill a
""slot machine"" contrary to the Criminal Code , 1953–54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 170.

The accused's premises contained an automatic machine whereby
a person, on the insertion of a coin, could play a bowling game by aiming a
device which propelled balls toward the pins at the other end of the machine.
The skill used in playing the game was in aiming the mechanical bowler. If the
scoring of points had a sufficient margin the operator became entitled to a
free game. On a charge of keeping a common gaming house for the purpose of
gambling contrary to the Criminal Code , the respondent was acquitted by the
magistrate and this judgment was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court on an equal division. The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: This machine
is not a slot machine within the meaning of the Act. It is used for vending
""services"", and ""services"" include ""amusements"". Laphkas
v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 84, applied.

What the law forbids is a machine that by electronic devices
or other means, defeats the ability of the player to obtain favourable results.
To be within the law, the player must control the game, and not be at the mercy
of a machine where skill is not the only element.

When the Act speaks of a matter of chance or uncertainty to
the operator, it refers obviously to the machine itself which may produce
different results independently of the skill of the player. Laphkas v. R.,
supra; R. v. Isseman, [1956] S.C.R. 798; Regent Vending Machines v.
Alberta Vending Machines, [1954] S.C.R. 98, referred to.

The privilege of a free game is the result of skill in
operating rather than an element of chance or uncertainty due to the machine
and therefore does not make the machine unlawful.

Per Fauteux and Judson JJ., dissenting: It
is an offence if the result of one of any number of operations of the machine
is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. Chance or uncertainty to
the operator must be present unless he can, without possibility of failure,
achieve any result that he wishes or unless the result is automatic.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, affirming, on an equal division, the
acquittal of the accused. Appeal dismissed, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.

S. A. Friedman, for
the appellant.

T. A. Miller, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

Taschereau J.:—The
charge against the respondent is that on the 26th day of February, 1959, at the
City of Edmonton, he did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common
gaming house for the purpose of gambling contrary to the Criminal Code . His
Honour Magistrate Barclay acquitted the respondent, and this judgment was
confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2,
on an equal division, Mr. Justice McBride having died before the rendering of
the judgment.

The provisions of the Criminal Code  which have to be
examined for the purpose of determining this case, are the subsections of section
170 . This section reads as follows:

170. (1) For the purpose of proceedings under this Part, a
place that is found to be equipped with a slot machine shall be conclusively
presumed to be a common gaming house.

(2) In this section ""slot machine"" means any
automatic machine or slot machine

(a) that is used or
intended to be used for any purpose other than vending merchandise or services;
or

(b) that is used or
intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator,

(ii) as a result of a given
number of successive operations by the operator the machine produces different
results, or

(iii) on any operation of the
machine it discharges or emits a slug or token.

It was admitted at the trial that when the machine was
seized, it was in good operating condition, and was on the premises of the
accused. The only question that arises and which has to be decided is whether
or not this ""William Ten Strike"" bowling machine is a ""slot
machine"" contrary to the above section of the Criminal Code .

This alleged slot machine, as found by the learned trial
judge, is operated as follows, and this is not contested by the appellant.
""There is a mechanical man at one end, and when ten cents is inserted in
the slot, a ball comes out and comes before the man's hand. The man can be
turned through an angle and is aimed at the pins which are placed in the form
of a triangle at the other or far end. The base

[Page 900]

of the triangle is at the far end of the rectangle, with the
apex facing the ""man"" and the player. After the man is aimed a
plunger is pushed forward and the arm of the man moves and propels the ball
forward. The direction of the ball is determined by the position of the man as
determined by the player."" The trial judge came to the conclusion that the
skill used in playing the game is in aiming the man or bowler.

If the aim is accurate, the operator will get a
""strike"", and if he gets twelve strikes in a row, his score will be
300, which is the maximum that can be obtained. If the aim is inaccurate, the
score will be lower. A better player will of course be the winner.

I do not think that this machine is a ""slot
machine"" within the meaning of the Act. It is used for vending
""services"" and, ""services"" include ""amusements"". (Laphkas
v. The King3).

This machine, I believe, procures an innocent amusement to
the operator, and this is not within the ban of the Act. It is an automatic
machine used for vending services, and it does not emit a slug or token.
Of course, under s. 170, a machine used for vending services or amusements
will be illegal, if the result produced by the machine is a matter of chance or
uncertainty to the operator, or if different results as a consequence of the
adjustment of the mechanism are obtained. But this has nothing to do with the
skill of the operator and is quite independent of the ability of the player to
hit the target if he aims properly.

What the law forbids is a machine that by electronic devices
or other means, defeats the ability of the player to obtain favourable results.
To be within the law, the player must control the game, and not be at the mercy
of a machine where skill is not the only element, as it is in the present case.

When the Act speaks of a matter of chance or uncertainty
to the operator, it refers obviously to the machine itself which may
produce different results independently of the skill of the player. I think
this is the letter and spirit of the law. (Vide: Laphkas v. R., supra; R. v.
Isseman4; Regent Vending Machines v. Alberta
Vending Machines5).

[Page 901]

Skill might be successful or not, it may produce uncertain
results, as in baseball, football, trap or skeet shooting, golf or hockey, but
the uncertainty then comes from the player, and not from the mechanism of a
machine which nullifies, the ability of the player.

I would hate to think that the law intends to brand as a
criminal a Canadian citizen who, for a dime, procures an innocent amusement to
the public where there is no element of gambling or hazard.

Of course, I have in mind a machine that functions properly
and not a machine which does not operate normally, and where the skill of the
player might be defeated. I finally believe, as did the learned Chief Justice
of Alberta, that if the scoring of points shows that the operator has a
sufficient margin, he is entitled to play another game without further payment
of money for the operation. This feature can be eliminated by an adjustment of
the scoring mechanism. As found by the courts below, the privilege so given is
the result of skill in operating rather than an element of chance or
uncertainty due to the machine, and does not make the machine unlawful.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by

Judson J. (dissenting):—For
the reasons given by Porter J.A. in the Appellate Division, I would allow this
appeal. While there is some element of skill involved in the operation of the
machine, in that one player may obtain a better result than another, it is
still an offence if the result of one of any number of operations of the
machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. Chance or
uncertainty to the operator must be present unless he can, without any
possibility of failure, achieve any result that he wishes or unless the result
is automatic. I do not think that uncertainty to the operator can be given the
restricted meaning set out in the reasons of my brother Taschereau.

Appeal dismissed, Fauteux and
Judson JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Lotteries—Scheme of distributing by chance
questionnaire forms to be completed and returned for value—Whether scheme for
the disposition of property by chance—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
2(32)(a), 179(1).

The respondent corporation distributed over 100,000 packages
of its soap products, each package being marked with a five star seal. The
corporation advertised to the public that it had enclosed a questionnaire form
in 10,000 of these containers. The questionnaire sought certain information
from the recipient which would be valuable to the respondent in the operation
of its business. A recipient who completed the form and mailed it to the
respondent was entitled to a payment of $5 from the respondent.

The corporation was charged with three offences under s.
179(1)  of the Criminal Code , the lotteries section. All three charges
were dismissed in magistrate's court, and this decision was sustained on appeal
to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on equal division. The Crown
appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The contention that what was disposed of by lot or chance
under the respondent's scheme was the sum of $5 failed. It was not the money
that was disposed of by chance, but a form by means of which the recipient
thereof could, on compliance with the required conditions, obtain the payment.

An uncompleted questionnaire form is not an instrument
""giving a right to receive money"" within the definition of property
in s. 2(32)  (a) of the Criminal Code . In itself the questionnaire
created no right to property.

[Page 909]

The services which the recipient of the form was asked to
perform were not a mere formality, serving as a device seeking to avoid the
application of s. 179(1) of the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, affirming, on an equal division, the
acquittal of the accused. Appeal dismissed.

S. A. Friedman, for the appellant.

C. W. Clement, Q.C., and B. M. Osler, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Martland J.:—The
respondent is a corporation which manufactures soap products. On April 11,
1959, it advertised by newspaper, in Edmonton, that it had enclosed a
questionnaire in 10,000 packets of its products, distributed across Canada, and
identified by a five star seal on the container. Over 100,000 packages of soap
products were distributed in Canada in the containers marked with the five star
seal. A person who obtained a questionnaire, by purchase of a package
containing it, could, by completing and mailing it to a specified address,
receive the sum of $5. The scheme was also advertised on television.

The questionnaire sought information from the recipient of
it, among other things, as to the product in the package in which the
questionnaire was found, the type of washing machine used, the laundry product
mostly used, whether bleach was used in laundering, how certain kinds of
garments were washed and concluded with a question as to the ways in which the
respondent's laundry, dish washing, and house cleaning products could be
improved.

The respondent was charged with three offences under s.
179(1)  of the Criminal Code . The first was that it ""did unlawfully
conduct a certain scheme for the purpose of determining who, or the holders of
what lots, tickets, numbers or chances, are the winners of any property so
proposed

[Page 910]

to be advanced, loaned, given, sold or disposed of, to wit:
Questionnaire forms each of which when completed and returned to the said
Company had a value of $5. Contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada."" The
second and third charges were that the respondent unlawfully advertised and that
it unlawfully caused to be advertised this scheme.

Section 179(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides:

179(1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years who

(a) makes, prints,
advertises or publishes, or causes or procures to be made, printed, advertised
or published, any proposal, scheme or plan for advancing, lending, giving,
selling or in any way disposing of any property, by lots, cards, tickets, or
any mode of chance whatsoever;

* * *

(d) conducts or
manages any scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind for the purpose of
determining who, or the holders of what lots, tickets, numbers or chances, are
the winners of any property so proposed to be advanced, loaned, given, sold or
disposed of;

* * *

The relevant definition of ""property"" is contained
in para. (a) of subs. (32) of s. 2  of the Criminal Code , which
reads:

(32) ""property"" includes

(a) real and
personal property of every description and deeds and instruments relating to or
evidencing the title or right to property, or giving a right to recover or
receive money or goods,

All three charges were dismissed by the learned Magistrate
who tried the case. In the written reasons for his decision he makes the
following findings:

Therefore, to sum up, I find that the forms were sent out in
these packages, to various areas throughout the whole of Canada, that there was
a sincere effort on the part of the company to ascertain the desires and
opinions of the housewives who used their property with the intention of improving
the property, the packages of soap in this case. I find that the reward was not
unduly high, and that it didn't vary, and that the price of the packages didn't
vary and that no extra money had to be sent in with the form, that once the
questionnaire form was sent in, duly answered by the person sending it, there
was no lottery or no choice of who would

[Page 911]

win. It was a conscientious effort on the part of the
company to obtain the views of the people using their product. I don't think
there was any sham about the whole proceedings, and I think that the company
have proved this in their evidence by calling the member of the research
department of their firm to show that the answers received were treated
seriously, …

His decision was sustained on appeal to the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 on an equal division.
The appellant has appealed from that judgment.

It is not questioned that the distribution of the
questionnaire forms was determined by chance. The question is whether, because
of that fact, the respondent's scheme was one for the disposition of property
by chance. This involves the question as to what it was that the purchaser of a
five star seal package, which contained a form, had obtained.

The contention of the appellant is that, under the
respondent's scheme, what was disposed of by lot or chance was the sum of $5.
It was contended that the acquisition of the questionnaire form gave to the
recipient a right to receive the sum of $5 from the respondent.

The obtaining of a form in a package did not, however,
immediately entitle the recipient to the payment. Before he could claim the
payment he was required to complete the form and to mail it to the respondent.
That which was disposed of by chance was not, therefore, the money, but a form,
by means of which, on compliance with the required conditions, he could obtain
the payment.

This brings us to the question as to whether an uncompleted
questionnaire form is an instrument ""giving a right to receive money""
within the paragraph defining ""property"" in the Criminal Code .

I do not think that it was. Assuming that the form was an
instrument, the questionnaire uncompleted, or completed but not mailed, did not
confer any right to receive a $5 payment. The form gave to the recipient an
opportunity

[Page 912]

to obtain the payment by performing the stipulated services;
i.e., completion and mailing of the form. The questionnaire constituted nothing
more than an offer, but the right to receive the payment could only arise by
contract, which would result if the offer were accepted in the manner which it
had indicated, which involved the furnishing of information to the respondent.
In itself it created no right to property.

As previously pointed out, the learned Magistrate has found,
and the evidence supports the finding, that the requirement for the completion
and mailing of the questionnaire form was not a sham. The services which the
recipient of the questionnaire form was asked to perform were not a mere
formality, serving as a device seeking to avoid the application of s. 179(1)  of
the Criminal Code . On the contrary, the evidence, accepted by the
learned Magistrate, establishes that the whole plan was a genuine effort on the
part of the respondent to obtain information which would be valuable to it in
the operation of its business. For those services the respondent agreed to make
a standard payment of $5 in each case.

For these reasons it is my opinion that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Robbery with
violence—Acquittal on ground of drunkenness rendering accused incapable of
forming specific intent to commit robbery—Omission of Crown to raise issue of.
included offence of common assault at trial—Drunkenness as a defence to a
charge of common assault—Mens rea—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 288, 569(1) (a).

Respondent was charged under s. 288  of the Criminal Code 
with robbery with violence, and was acquitted by the trial judge on the ground
that he was so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming the specific intent to
commit robbery. In appealing this decision the Crown contended that the trial
judge did not consider the included offence of common assault and, in the
result, failed to direct himself with respect to the divisibility of the charge
laid and to the incidence of drunkenness as a defence to a charge of common
assault, as distinguished from a charge of robbery with violence. The appeal
was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and the Crown then sought and obtained
the leave of this Court to appeal from that judgment.

Held (Locke J. dissenting) : The appeal should
be allowed, the verdict of acquittal with respect to common assault set aside,
and a verdict of guilty of that offence entered.

Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: As provided by s.
569(1) (a) of the Code, when the commission of the offence charged, as
described in the enactment creating it or as charged, includes the commission
of another offence, the charge is divisible, and the accused may be convicted
of the offence so included, if proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence
that is charged is not proved. The King v. Wong On (No. 3), 8 C.C.C.
423; Rex v. Stewart, 71 C.C.C. 206, referred to.

In a like situation, the offence included is part of the case
which the accused has to meet under the law. The mere omission of the Crown to
raise the issue cannot per se and without more relieve the trial judge
from the duty imposed upon him under the section. The words ""may
convict"" give an authority which must be exercised when the
circumstances described in the section are present. Rex v. Bishop of Oxford,
(1879) 4 Q.B.D. 245, applied; Wexler v. His Majesty The King, [1939]
S.C.R. 350, distinguished.

Contrary to what is the case in the crime of robbery, where,
with respect to theft, a specific intent must be proved, there is no specific
intent necessary to constitute the offence of common assault. Here the manner
in which force was applied by the respondent to his victim was not accidental
or unintentional. Re Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, referred to.

[Page 872]

The finding of the trial judge that the accused had not the
capacity to form the specific intent to commit robbery did not justify the
conclusion reached in appeal that he could not then have committed the offence
of common assault.

Per Martland and Ritchie JJ.: Pursuant to s. 569 of the
Code the trial judge was under a duty to consider the included offence of
assault, and the fact that his report to the Court of Appeal contained a
statement ""that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the
trial"" is not sufficient ground for concluding that he did not consider
this offence.

The duty which rests upon the trial judge to consider all
included offences of which there is evidence can, in no way, be affected by the
fact that the Crown has omitted to make reference to such offences, and it
follows that where the trial judge has wrongly applied the law applicable to an
included offence the Crown is not deprived of its statutory right of appeal
because of its omission at trial to address the Court on the matter.

The offence of robbery requires the presence of the kind of
intent and purpose specified in ss. 269 and 288 of the Code, but the use of the
word ""intentionally"" in defining ""common assault"" in s.
230(a) is exclusively referable to the physical act of applying force to
the person of another.

Per Locke J., dissenting: The Crown's contention
that where a trial judge hearing a criminal charge fails not to deal with, but
to consider independently, an offence included in the offence specifically
charged, and this is done with the approval of counsel for the Crown, the
provisions of s. 584 of the Code may be invoked to again place the accused in
jeopardy, should be rejected.

The right of the Crown to appeal, while given in clear terms,
may not be exercised in all circumstances, as was decided in Wexler v. R.,
supra. To construe the section differently would mean that accused persons
could be subjected to a succession of trials for the same offence on grounds
that were not advanced at the first and succeeding previous trials, and which
the accused person had not accordingly attempted to meet. The King v. Miles,
(1890) 24 Q.B.D. 423, referred to.

Although s. 569 imposes a duty upon the judge to consider the
included offence of assault, his failure to do so does not render the
proceeding defective and a new trial necessary. The King v. Wong On, supra,
applied; The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford, supra, referred
to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming a judgment of Morrow C.C.J. Appeal
allowed, Locke J. dissenting.

J. Urie, for the
appellant.

E. P. Newcombe and R.
Cleary, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau and
Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

[Page 873]

FAUTEUX J.:—Respondent was
charged with robbery with violence and tried by Morrow C.C.J., in the County
Court of Cariboo holden at Prince George in the Province of British Columbia. In answer to the charge, the
accused raised, amongst others, the issues of identification and drunkenness.
At the end of a lengthy hearing, the trial Judge acquitted him and, in doing
so, said in part: 

(i) as to identification.

I have reached the
conclusion, therefore, without any doubt, that it was the accused who committed
the offence on the night in question. 

(ii) as to drunkenness.

The law seems to be that in
the case of intoxication an accused person can claim that drunkenness need not
result in absolute incapacity rendering the accused incapable of awareness of
the nature of his physical act, but it is sufficient if there is a degree of
drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent
essential to constitute the crime.

I will be frank and say that
this defence of drunkenness in this instance is one that caused me much
concern. To me it is very much a border line case. That being so it is my duty
to give the accused the benefit of the doubt on the defence of drunkenness that
has been set up in my mind.

Having announced the acquittal,
the trial Judge then addressed these remarks to the accused:

You are being acquitted not
because you didn't do it—there is no doubt in my mind that you did do it—you
are being acquitted because I have found that you were so drunk on the night in
question that you were unable to form an intent to do it. In that respect, you
have been very fortunate, and perhaps fortunate in another respect in that you
were not up on a charge of murder, because anyone that tackles a man as you did
and the man survives after an attack of double pneumonia, you can only put it
down to good luck. Perhaps this will be a warning to you. The next time, you
see, you may not be so fortunate. This defence of drunkenness does not excuse a
crime, it merely is a defence under the circumstances that we have had during
this rather lengthy trial.

In the reasons for judgment,
there is nothing expressed or implied with reference to common assault, an
offence included in the major offence of robbery with violence.

The Crown appealed this decision
to the Court of Appeal for the Province, on grounds stated as follows in the
notice of appeal:

(i) The learned trial Judge
erred in holding that drunkenness was a defence to said charge at all;

(ii) In the alternative, the
learned trial Judge erred in not convicting the respondent of common assault;

(iii) The learned trial
Judge misdirected himself on the defence of drunkenness and its effect on
question of intent.

[Page 874]

In clear reference to the second
ground, the trial Judge, in his report to the Court of Appeal, stated that
common assault had not been raised by Crown counsel at the trial. From this
statement, the Crown contended in the Court below, one must infer that common
assault was not considered by the trial Judge who, in the result, failed to
direct himself with respect to the divisibility of the charge laid and to the
incidence of drunkenness as a defence to a charge of common assault, as
distinguished from a charge of robbery with violence.

In dismissing the appeal[2]
O'Halloran J.A., with the concurrence of Bird J.A., rejected as ill-founded the
inference drawn by the Crown from the report of the trial Judge and further
expressed the view that ""if the respondent could not, through the effect
of liquor, have the intent to rob, then he could not, because of liquor's
effect upon him, have the intent to assault and steal, where as here these two
essential ingredients of robbery occurred concurrently and integrated in the
robbery as charged.""

Sheppard J.A. declared that if,
as suggested, the trial Judge omitted to consider the included offence of
common assault, such an omission was entirely due to the failure of Crown
counsel to raise that issue as part of the case to be met by the accused.
Assimilating such a situation to the one considered in Wexler v. His Majesty
the King[3],
he concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.

The Crown then sought and
obtained leave of this Court to appeal from this judgment. As stated in
appellant's factum, the questions submitted for determination are:

1. Whether or not evidence
of drunkenness falling short of insanity can be used as a defence not only to
negative the capacity of the accused to form a specific or special intent, but
also to negative the ordinary mens rea which is a constituent of all crime.

2. Whether or not the Court
of Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common
assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the
trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to
commit the included offence of common assault.

That the trial Judge did not
consider the included offence of common assault is, in my view, the reasonable
inference flowing from his statement in the report to the Court of Appeal. This
is specially so when this statement, made in

[Page 875]

reference to the second ground
raised by the Crown in its notice of appeal, is considered in the light of the
reasons given by the trial Judge in support of the acquittal.

In the circumstances of this
case, it was the duty of the trial Judge to consider common assault. For when,
as in the present case, the commission of the offence charged, as described in
the enactment creating it or as charged, includes the commission of another
offence, the charge is divisible, and the accused may be convicted of the
offence so included, if proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is
charged is not proved. The law and the jurisprudence in this respect are clear.
Section 569(1) (a) Cr. C. reads as follows:

569. (1) A count in an
indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as
described in the enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the
commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary
conviction, the accused may be convicted

(a) of an offence so
included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged
is not proved, or

See The King v. Wong On (No.
3)[4];
Rex v. Stewart[5].

In a like situation, the offence
included is part of the case which the accused has to meet under the law. The
mere omission of counsel for the Crown to have raised the issue cannot per
se and without more relieve the trial Judge from the cardinal duty imposed
upon him under the section. This is not a civil but a criminal case. The words ""may
convict"", appearing in the opening phrase thereof, give an authority
which must be exercised when, as in this case, the circumstances described in
the section are present. In Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[6]
it was held that

so long ago as the year 1693
it was decided in the case of R. v. Barlow, that when a statute
authorizes the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the public good, the
word ""may"" means ""shall"" and that rule has been acted upon
to the present time ….

This proposition was relied on in
Welch v. The King[7]
where, at page 426, this Court said:

For new and extraordinary
would be a rule of construction stating that, being empowered to make an order
required by justice, a Court of justice would be free to refrain from making it
when the occasion to do so arises.

[Page 876]

With deference, the decision of
this Court in Wexler v. His Majesty the King, supra, has no application
in the matter. The question of divisibility did not arise in that case. What
the Court decided was simply that subsection 4  of section 1013  Cr.C . was not
intended to confer jurisdiction upon an appellate court to set aside a verdict
of acquittal and so entitle the Crown to an order for a new trial for the
purpose of presenting an entirely new case against the accused. Furthermore,
the circumstances which gave rise to that decision are entirely different from
those present in this case. As stated by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., at pp. 351 and
352:

The case presented by the
Crown was that the appellant had intentionally shot the deceased Germaine
Rochon with the intention of killing her. The defence relied upon the testimony
given by the appellant himself. It was agreed by both counsel for the Crown and
for the defence, and the learned trial Judge so instructed the jury, that if
they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted.
I quote the words of the learned judge in which he summed up the whole matter
at the request of counsel for the defence after the jury had retired and had been
recalled:

The COURT: Gentlemen, I have
been asked by the defence attorneys, to give a further explanation on a certain
point. I have told you that, if you are satisfied with the explanation given by
the accused, that the shooting was an accident, that he was entitled to an
acquittal, but I must add—and I think I did—I must add, even on that evidence,
he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt; that is, if you are not reasonably
sure that his explanations are not true, that you must give him the benefit of
the doubt and acquit him.

That is, the accused is
entitled to the benefit of the doubt on the entire evidence. You must be
reasonably sure that he has committed the offence before finding him guilty.

We are left in no doubt that
this instruction by the learned trial judge was accepted as satisfactory by
counsel both for the Crown and for the accused and that it correctly formulated
the single issue of fact which both counsel put before the jury as the sole
issue upon which it was their duty to pass.

In the present case, the record
does not indicate any agreement between counsel, or any suggestion that robbery
was the only issue or that common assault which, under the law, was part of the
case that the accused had to meet, was excluded. Nor was there any occasion for
counsel to approve or disapprove the manner in which the trial Judge directed
himself. The Wexler case, supra, is no authority for the
proposition that the mere omission of the Crown to raise the issue of common
assault amounted to an approval of 

[Page 877]

the trial Judge's failure to
direct himself in the matter or to a circumstance relieving him of the duty he
had under s. 569(1) (a).

It must then be held that the
failure of the trial Judge to consider common assault amounted to non-direction.

It follows that the appeal of the
Crown should have been allowed, unless it be shown by respondent that, but for
this error, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.

This indeed is the view which
appears to have been reached by O'Halloran and Bird JJ.A., who, as above
indicated, said in substance that if, as found by the trial Judge, the accused
did not, owing to drunkenness, have the capacity to form the specific intent
required as a constituent element of the crime of robbery, he could no more,
for the same reason, have had the intent to assault and steal.

With deference, I do not think
that this conclusion legally follows from the premises upon which it rests.

In considering the question of mens
rea, a distinction is to be made between (i) intention as applied to acts
considered in relation to their purposes and (ii) intention as applied to acts
considered apart from their purposes. A general intent attending the commission
of an act is, in some cases, the only intent required to constitute the crime
while, in others, there must be, in addition to that general intent, a specific
intent attending the purpose for the commission of the act.

Contrary to what is the case in
the crime of robbery, where, with respect to theft, a specific intent must be
proved by the Crown as one of the constituent elements of the offence, there is
no specific intent necessary to constitute the offence of common assault, which
is defined as follows in s. 230  Cr.C .:

A person commits an assault
when, without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is
obtained by fraud,

(a) he applies force
intentionally to the person of the other, directly or indirectly, or 

(b) he attempts or
threatens, by an act or gesture, to apply force to the person of the other, if
he has or causes the other to believe upon reasonable grounds that he has
present ability to effect his purpose.

[Page 878]

The word
""intentionally"" appearing in s. 230 (a) is exclusively related
to the application of force or to the manner in which force is applied. This,
indeed, is also made clear in the French version, reading:

230. Commet des voies de
fait, ou se livre à une attaque, quiconque, sans le consentement d'autrui, ou
avec son consentement, s'il est obtenu par fraude,

a)d'une manière
intentionnelle, applique,
directement ou indirectement, la force ou la violence contre la personne
d'autrui, ou

b)tente ou menace, par un acte ou un geste, d'appliquer
la force ou la violence contre la personne d'autrui, s'il est en mesure
actuelle, ou s'il porte cette personne à croire, pour des motifs raisonnables,
qu'il est en mesure actuelle d'accomplir son dessein.

(The italics are mine).

There can be no pretence, in this
case, that the manner in which force was applied by respondent to his victim
was accidental or—excluding at the moment, from the consideration, the defence
of drunkenness—unintentional.

On this finding of fact, the
accused was guilty of common assault unless there was evidence indicating a
degree of drunkenness affording, under the law, a valid defence.

The rules for determining the
validity of a defence of drunkenness have been stated by the House of Lords in
the well known case of Beard[8]:

(i) Insanity, whether
produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged.

(ii) Evidence of drunkenness
which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to
constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts
proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.

(iii) Evidence of drunkenness
falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent
necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was
affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion,
does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of
his acts.

The first rule has no relevancy
here for there is no pretence that, owing to drunkenness, respondent was
insane, even temporarily, at the time of the assault.

The second rule was relevant and
indeed properly applied by the trial Judge who entertained a doubt on the
question whether the Crown had proved, as part of its case, that the

[Page 879]

accused had, owing to
drunkenness, the capacity to form the specific intent required in the
offence of robbery, i.e., the intent to steal.

However, and consequential to the
applicability of the rule of divisibility, the included offence of common
assault is to be considered independently of the major offence of robbery, and
the law as to the validity of a defence of drunkenness has to be related to
that particular included offence.

Hence, the question is whether,
owing to drunkenness, respondent's condition was such that he was incapable of
applying force intentionally. I do not know that, short of a degree of
drunkenness creating a condition tantamount to insanity, such a situation could
be metaphysically conceived in an assault of the kind here involved. It is
certain that, on the facts found by the trial Judge, this situation did not
exist in this case.

The accused was acquitted of the
offence of robbery, not on the ground that he could not have applied force
intentionally, but because of the doubt entertained by the trial Judge on the
question whether he had the capacity to form the specific intent required as a
constituent element for the offence of theft.

In these views, the finding of
the trial Judge that the accused had not the capacity to form the specific
intent to commit robbery did not justify the conclusion reached in appeal that
he could not then have committed the offence of common assault; nor is it shown
that, had the trial Judge considered common assault, the verdict would
necessarily have been the same.

In these circumstances, the Court
of Appeal should have allowed the appeal from the acquittal and should have
proceeded to make an order pursuant to its authority under s. 592(4) (b),
to wit, either enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which,
in its opinion, formed in the light of the law applicable in the matter, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a
sentence warranted in law, or order a new trial.

Under section 600 Cr. C., this
Court is given the authority to make any order that the Court of Appeal might
have made. At the hearing before this Court, it was intimated 

[Page 880]

that should the appeal of the
Crown be maintained, this case should be finally disposed of, if possible, and
that in such event, respondent could appropriately be given a suspended
sentence.

Being of opinion that the accused
should have been found guilty of common assault, had that offence been
considered in the light of the law applicable to the facts of this case, I
would maintain the appeal, set aside the verdict of acquittal with respect to
common assault and enter a verdict of guilty of that offence. Prior to his
acquittal in the Court below, respondent has been incarcerated during a number
of weeks. It would appear more consonant with the representations made with
respect to sentence, to sentence respondent to the time already spent by him in
jail; and this is the sentence that I would pass.

LOCKE J. (dissenting) :—This
is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to leave granted by this Court from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which dismissed an appeal
from the acquittal of the respondent by His Honour Judge Morrow, Judge of the
County Court Judges' Criminal Court for the County of Cariboo, on a charge
that:

He did on the 8th day of
February, 1959, at the City of Prince
 George, in the County of Cariboo, Province of British Columbia, unlawfully and by violence
steal from the person of Nicholas Avgeris the sum of Twenty-two dollars,
contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.

The charge appears to have been
laid under the provisions of s. 288  of the Criminal Code . The evidence
disclosed that the respondent, an Indian, had gone on the afternoon of the day
in question to the home of Avgeris, a man 84 years of age who apparently
purchased furs, and was informed that the latter would not purchase a fisher
skin which the respondent offered for sale. Later that night, or early the next
morning, the respondent returned to the home of Avgeris demanding money,
beating him severely with his fists, breaking his nose and causing other grievous
bodily injuries and obtaining a sum of $22. According to Avgeris, the
respondent, in addition to beating him, threatened to kill him unless he gave
him money and wrenched the telephone in the house from the wall.

[Page 881]

The defence advanced on behalf of
the respondent was that he had been drinking heavily during the day, apparently
following the first occasion that he went to the house of Avgeris, and that
this reduced him to such a state that he was unable to form the intent of
committing the offence charged against him. At the conclusion of the hearing
the learned trial judge acquitted the accused, saying that while he was
satisfied that he had committed the offence he was being acquitted because:

I have found that you were
so drunk on the night in question that you were unable to form an intent to do
it.

While two questions of law were
raised in the factum filed on behalf of the Crown, only the second of these was
argued before us. This was expressed in the following terms:

Whether or not the Court of
Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common
assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the
trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to
commit the included offence of common assault.

While the question, therefore, as
to whether the learned County Court judge was right in acquitting the
respondent of the offence charged on the ground above stated is not questioned,
some reference should be made to the evidence. The only account of what had
occurred was that given by Avgeris who described the severe beating he had
received before he gave his attacker the sum of $22. He was, however, unable to
identify the respondent. The latter, however, after his arrest gave two statements
to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In the first of these, which appears to
have been expressed in the language employed by the respondent, he said that he
had been drinking heavily and did not remember where he had gone but that he
had gone to a house and remembered hitting a man. In the second statement he
described in more detail his movements on the day in question, saying that he
had brought a fisher fur from Summitt Lake and had
gone to a fur buyer and tried to sell the fur to an old man who came to the
door and who said he did not want to buy it. After describing the drinking he
had done after this, he then said:

Then I blacked out and the
next thing I remember I was in a house. It was the house I was at in the
afternoon where the fur buyer lived. I remember hitting a man in this house. I
was hitting him with my fists.

I had mitts on. The person I
was hitting was old and I think he was wearing a kimona. I think it was the fur
buyer I had talked to in the afternoon. I remember seeing the same furniture in
the house then as I had seen in the afternoon. Then I don't remember anything.

The constables by whom these
statements were taken swore that they were made voluntarily, that the
respondent had been duly warned and that no promises or threats had been made
to induce him to make the statements, and the learned County Court judge
admitted both of them in evidence. They had both been signed by the respondent.

While the first statement had
been couched in the language of the respondent, the second was in the language
of the police officer who took the statement, being his interpretation of what
the respondent had said. The respondent did not deny having signed the
statements but denied having said that he remembered hitting the man and said
that the police had told him to sign the statement. The learned judge
apparently did not believe this but, while holding the second statement
admissible in evidence, said that he considered that, as it was not in the
language of the prisoner but of that of the police officer, he should not
attach any weight to it.

Section 569  of the Criminal
Code  reads in part:

A count in an indictment is
divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as described in the
enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of
another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the
accused may be convicted

(a) of an offence so
included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged
is not proved.

Section 288  of the Criminal
Code , so far as relevant, reads:

Every one commits robbery
who

(a) steals, and for
the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome
resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or
property,

(b) steals from any
person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately
thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that
person.

That violence was used for the
purpose of extorting and stealing money from Avgeris was proved and this upon
the evidence involved an assault within the meaning of that term in s. 230  of
the Criminal Code , and an assault occasioning bodily harm within s. 231
(2) .

[Page 883]

In the reasons for judgment
delivered by O'Halloran J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, that learned judge
said that it followed rationally in the circumstances that the judge must also
be deemed to have found that the respondent was equally incapable, for the same
reason, of having an intent to commit an assault and that if he could not have
the intent to commit robbery he could not have the intent either to assault or
to steal, and did not say that he disagreed with this conclusion.

The offences described in subss.
(a) and (b) of s. 288 of the Code include the offence of assault
described in s. 230  and it was, in my opinion, the duty of the learned trial
judge to consider this offence upon the hearing of the charge of robbery with
violence. In view of the severity of the injuries inflicted upon Avgeris by the
brutal beating to which he was subjected, it is clear that George might
properly have been charged with assault occasioning bodily harm under s. 231.
That had not been done and that offence is not an included offence within the
meaning of s. 569 . In respect of the offence charged and the offence of
assault, it was necessary to prove that force was applied intentionally and in
the case of the charge under s. 288  that it was done with intent to steal, and
the case of the Crown has been argued on the footing that it is only the latter
question that was considered by the learned judge in arriving at the conclusion
that the prisoner should be acquitted.

It is not made clear in the
reasons for judgment delivered at the trial that the learned judge had not
considered the included offence and O'Halloran and Bird JJ.A. were of the
opinion that it was to be assumed that he had done so. They do not, however,
mention the judge's report referred to by Sheppard J.A. This is required by s.
588(1) of the Code. The report is not in the case and the only information we
have relating to it is in the reasons of Sheppard J.A. who says that it
""states that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the
trial."" In my opinion, the proper inference to be drawn from this is that
the trial judge did not consider the question of common assault and we should
deal with the appeal on that footing.

[Page 884]

The effect of the acquittal
extended to both offences and the basis of the appeal taken by the Attorney-General
to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia under the provisions of s. 584 of
the Code, in so far as the included offence of common assault was concerned,
was that the learned judge had not considered whether or not the accused was
intoxicated to such an extent that he was incapable of forming the intent to
assault Avgeris. The appeal proceeded, of necessity, on the footing that the
accused had been acquitted of the charge.

The decision to be made in these
circumstances is of general importance in dealing with the Crown's right of
appeal under s. 584 of the Code. That right was first given by the amendment of
s. 1013  of the Criminal Code  effected by s. 28  of c. 11 of the Statutes
of 1930. The long-standing principle of the common law that was affected by
this enactment was stated by Hawkins J. in The King v. Miles[9]
in the following terms:

Where a criminal charge has
been adjudicated upon by a Court having jurisdiction to hear and determine it,
that adjudication, whether it takes the form of an acquittal or conviction, is
final as to the matter so adjudicated upon, and may be pleaded in bar to any
subsequent prosecution for the same offence.

In Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown,
vol. 2, p. 515, it is stated:

The plea of autrefoits
acquit is grounded on this maxim that a man should not be brought into danger
of his life for one and the same offence more than once.

The right of appeal thus given to
the Attorney-General is a departure from this long-established principle of the
common law. The appeal is on a question of law alone. The question of whether
George was at the time of the commission of the offence capable of forming the
intent to assault Avgeris was a question of fact and not of law. The trial
judge did not consider it and this was obviously due to the fact that he was
not asked to do so by counsel for the Crown and, apparently, overlooked the
fact that the offence of common assault was included in the charge laid under
s. 288 .

[Page 885]

Had the matter been tried before
a jury, it would clearly have been the judge's duty to have instructed them
that they were to consider not merely the offence of robbery with violence, but
also that of common assault. The question, and indeed the only question, that
arises on this appeal is whether in these circumstances the Crown may ask that
the accused be again placed in jeopardy.

Sheppard J.A. considered that the
question as to whether a new trial should be ordered was affected by the
decision of this Court in Wexler v. R.[10].
In Wexler's case the charge was murder. The defence was that the shooting
was the result of an accident. The evidence of the accused was that at the time
in question he had intended to commit suicide and informed Rochon, the woman
who was killed, of his intention to do so: that she had seized hold of the
revolver to prevent this and that while they were struggling it had
accidentally discharged, killing her. The case for the Crown was that the
killing of the woman had been intentional and the jury were not charged by the
trial judge on manslaughter or upon an issue suggested on appeal that, as upon
his own admission the accused was in the course of committing the unlawful act
of suicide, the killing of the woman was murder. The jury acquitted the accused
but this verdict was set aside on appeal to the Court of King's Bench and a new
trial ordered. On the appeal to this Court the judgment at the trial was
restored.

In that case the trial judge had,
with the consent of both counsel, charged the jury that if they accepted
Wexler's account of what had occurred, they should acquit him. As a matter of
law, the jury should also have been charged upon both of the issues suggested
in this Court. These were not, of course, included offences within the meaning
of that expression in the present section 569 , but were offences of which the
accused might have been found guilty if the jury reached certain conclusions on
the evidence. As all of the judgments delivered show, it was by reason of the
course of the trial that the order for a new trial was held to be error.

In the present case, the learned
judge dealt only with the charge of robbery with violence with the apparent
consent and approval of counsel for the Crown, overlooking

[Page 886]

the fact that it was his duty to
deal with the included offence. In this respect, Wexler's case touches
the matter and must be considered.

Stated bluntly, the contention of
the Crown is that where a trial judge hearing a criminal charge fails not to
deal with, but to consider independently, an offence included in the offence
specifically charged, and this is done with the approval of counsel for the
Crown, the provisions of s. 584 may be invoked to again place the accused in
jeopardy. I do not think that it was ever contemplated when the legislation was
enacted that it might be exercised in circumstances such as these.

The principle of law referred to
by Hawkins J. in Miles' case was, prior to 1930, as firmly imbedded in
the criminal law of this country as the principle that a man is to be presumed
innocent until the contrary is proven in a court of competent jurisdiction. The
right to appeal, while given in clear terms, may not be exercised in all
circumstances, as was decided by this Court in Wexler's case. To
construe the section differently would mean that accused persons could be
subjected to a succession of trials for the same offence on grounds that were
not advanced at the first trial and succeeding previous trials, and which the
accused person had not accordingly attempted to meet. The section should not be
construed as permitting in criminal prosecutions a course so contrary to this
long-established principle and, in my opinion, to the public interest.

In my opinion, the decision in The
Queen v. Bishop of Oxford[11],
does not affect the question. In that case a section of the Church
Discipline Act (3 & 4 Vict. (Imp.), c. 86) reading that ""it shall
be lawful"" in defined circumstances for the Bishop of a diocese to issue a
commission of enquiry, was held to be imperative rather than permissive. The
proceedings were instituted by a parishioner for a mandamus to the
Bishop to compel the issue of a commission to enquire into a charge made
against the rector. From this it may be suggested that the word ""may""
in s. 569  should be construed as meaning ""shall"" and that,
accordingly, the failure of the judge to consider the included offence renders
the proceedings defective and a new trial necessary. I agree that the section
imposes such a duty

[Page 887]

upon the judge but I do not agree
that his failure to do so has the suggested consequences. It was also the duty
of the judge who presided at the trial in Wexler's case to charge the
jury that upon the evidence they might return a verdict of manslaughter or a
verdict of murder if they were of the opinion that it was while endeavouring to
commit suicide that Wexler had fired the shot that killed Rochon. The law is as
stated by Hunter C.J. in The King v. Wong On[12],
in these terms:

The cardinal duty of the
judge in his address to the jury is to define the crime charged and to explain
the difference between it and any other offence of which it is open to the jury
to convict the accused.

a statement concurred in by Drake
and Duff JJ. The trial judge was not relieved of that duty by the views
asserted by the counsel at the trial. The duty was not discharged but it was
held by this Court that, in the circumstances, an appeal did not lie.

As to the question of fact as to
whether the respondent was at the time capable of forming the intent necessary
to constitute the crime of assault, I express no opinion in view of my
conclusion upon the point of law.

I would dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by 

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia[13] affirming the acquittal of the respondent by Morrow
C.C.J. of the charge that he did ""unlawfully and by violence steal from
the person of Nicholas Avgeris the sum of Twenty-two Dollars"".

The learned trial judge has found
that:

…a man of 84, was violently
manhandled by an Indian on the date noted in the Indictment …as a result of
which he was in hospital for a month. During this scuffle he was badly injured,
dumped into a bathtub and pulled out again when he agreed to give the Indian
what money he had, $22.

and he has also

…reached the conclusion …
without any doubt that it was the accused who committed the offence on the
night in question.

[Page 888]

The learned trial judge
continued:

The first statement perhaps
should be considered. It was obviously written in the words of someone who has
not had too much education. In his second paragraph after recalling the
drinking period, he said: ""Then I came to and I was in house and I
remember hitting man and I don't remember where I went after.""

Notwithstanding these findings,
the learned trial judge acquitted the respondent, saying:

To me it is very much a
border line case. That being so it is my duty to give the accused the benefit
of the doubt on the defence of drunkenness that has been set up in my mind.

After acquitting him, the learned
trial judge addressed the accused in part as follows:

You are being acquitted not
because you didn't do it—there is no doubt in my mind that you did do it—you
are being acquitted because I have found that you were so drunk on the night in
question that you were unable to form an intent to do it.

From this acquittal the Crown
appealed to the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia, and in rendering the decision
of the majority of that Court Mr. Justice O'Halloran said[14]:

I am unable with respect to
accept Crown counsel's submission that in failing to convict respondent of
assault upon this charge of robbery, the learned trial Judge omitted to
instruct himself regarding any difference between the intent to commit the
robbery and a specific intent to commit assault as one of the essential
ingredients of the robbery with which he was charged.

In my judgment, with
respect, a sufficient answer thereto is; that having found the respondent so
incapacitated by liquor that he could not form an intent to commit the robbery,
it follows rationally in the circumstances here, that he must also be deemed to
have found that respondent was equally incapable for the same reason of having
an intent to commit the assault. If he could not have the intent to commit the
robbery, viz. to assault and steal as charged, then he could not have the
intent either to assault or to steal when both occurred together as charged;
the charge reads ""by violence steal"".

Mr. Justice Sheppard dismissed
the appeal on another ground, namely, that the Crown's case at the trial was
confined to the charge of robbery with violence, and that in any event a
conviction of assault should not be entered in the Court of Appeal without the
accused having been given an opportunity to meet that included offence as the
failure to do so in the circumstances of this case may have

[Page 889]

been due to his having been
misled by Crown counsel presenting the case as solely that of robbery with
violence.

In the course of his decision Mr.
Justice Sheppard said[15]:

The learned trial Judge in
his report states that common assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the
trial. It, therefore, appears that the case presented by the Crown at the trial
was that of robbery with violence; that is the sole offence which the accused
was here called upon to meet.

It is to be noted that the report
of the learned trial judge was not part of the record before this Court and
this observation by Mr. Justice Sheppard is the sole reference made to it in
the course of the proceedings.

Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted pursuant to an application made on behalf of the Attorney-General of British Columbia. No appeal was taken from the acquittal of the respondent on the charge
of robbery and the first five grounds of appeal are, in large measure, devoted
to the question of whether a distinction should be drawn ""between the
degree of drunkenness required to negative the existence of"" that intent
which is, under the Criminal Code , an essential ingredient of the crime
of robbery and the degree of drunkenness which is necessary to negative such
intent as is an ingredient of common assault.

The sixth ground of appeal was
directed to the decision of Mr. Justice Sheppard and the appellant put the
question thereby raised in the following terms:

Whether or not the Court of
Appeal should substitute a conviction for the included offence of common
assault, or order a new trial with respect thereto, when Crown counsel at the
trial of the accused did not raise the issue of the accused's capacity to
commit the included offence of common assault.

Pursuant to s. 569  of the Criminal
Code , the learned trial judge was under a duty to direct his mind to the
""included offence"" of assault, and in the absence of any evidence to
the contrary, I do not think that it should be assumed that he did not do so.
Whether or not he properly directed himself as to the effect of drunkenness in
negativing the intent to commit this offence is another question.

The report of the learned trial
judge is not before us, and, with the greatest respect for those who may take a
contrary view, I do not consider that the fact that it contains

[Page 890]

a statement ""that common
assault was not raised by Crown counsel at the trial"" is sufficient ground
for concluding that the learned trial judge did not consider this offence.

In my opinion, the duty which
rests upon the trial judge to direct himself with respect to all included
offences of which there is evidence can, in no way, be affected by the fact
that the Crown Prosecutor has omitted to make reference to such offences. It
follows, in my view, that in a case where the trial judge has wrongly applied
the law applicable to such an offence the Crown is not deprived of its
statutory right of appeal because of the omission of its agent at the trial to
address the Court on the matter.

The fact that the learned trial
judge found, as I think he did, that the respondent had ""violently
manhandled"" an old man but was not guilty of assault because he was drunk
at the time raises the question of law posed by the appellant as to whether, under
the circumstances as found by the trial judge, drunkenness is a valid defence
to common assault.

In considering the question of mens
rea, a distinction is to be drawn between ""intention"" as applied
to acts done to achieve an immediate end on the one hand and acts done with the
specific and ulterior motive and intention of furthering or achieving an
illegal object on the other hand. Illegal acts of the former kind are done
""intentionally"" in the sense that they are not done by accident or
through honest mistake, but acts of the latter kind are the product of
preconception and are deliberate steps taken towards an illegal goal. The
former acts may be the purely physical products of momentary passion, whereas
the latter involve the mental process of formulating a specific intent. A man,
far advanced in drink, may intentionally strike his fellow in the former sense
at a time when his mind is so befogged with liquor as to be unable to formulate
a specific intent in the latter sense. The offence of robbery, as defined by
the Criminal Code , requires the presence of the kind of intent and
purpose specified in ss. 269  and 288 , but the use of the word
""intentionally"" in defining ""common assault"" in s. 230 (a)
of the Criminal Code  is exclusively referable to the physical act of
applying force to the person of another.

[Page 891]

I would adopt the following
passage from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 58, para. 42, as an
authoritative statement on this subject. He there says:

…in Director of Public
Prosecution v. Beard, (1920) A.C. 479 …it was laid down that evidence of
such drunkenness as ""renders the accused incapable of forming the specific
intent, essential to constitute the crime, should be taken into consideration,
with the other facts proved, in order to determine whether or not he had this
intent"". In such a case the drunkenness, if it negatives the existence of
the indispensable mental element of the crime ""negatives the commission of
that crime"". Thus a drunken man's inability to form an intention to kill, or
to do grievous bodily harm involving the risk of killing, at the time of
committing a homicide, may reduce his offence from murder to manslaughter
(which latter crime requires no more than a realization that some bodily harm
may be caused). Drunkenness may likewise show that a supposed burglar had no
intention of stealing, or that wounds were inflicted without any ""intent
to do grievous bodily harm"", or that a false pretence was made with no
""intent to defraud"". But it must be remembered that a man may be so
drunk as not to form an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm while yet
in sufficient control of his senses to be able to contemplate some harm and so
to be guilty of manslaughter or of an unlawful wounding.

The decision of the learned trial
judge, in my opinion, constitutes a finding that the respondent violently
manhandled a man and knew that he was hitting him. Under these circumstances,
evidence that the accused was in a state of voluntary drunkenness cannot be
treated as a defence to a charge of common assault because there is no
suggestion that the drink which had been consumed had produced permanent or
temporary insanity and the respondent's own statement indicates that he knew
that he was applying force to the person of another.

In view of the above, I would
allow the appeal, and, having regard to the circumstances mentioned by him, I
would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Fauteux.

Appeal allowed, Locke
J. dissenting. Accused found guilty of common assault and sentenced to time
already spent in gaol.

Present: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright,

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Perjury—Divorce action—Evidence of innocent
bystander with no interest in outcome of trial—No evidence of intent to
mislead, or knowledge of falsity of the evidence given—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 113(1).

The appellant was charged with perjury in that, as a witness
in a divorce case in the outcome of which he had no interest, he had given
evidence well knowing same to be false and with intent to mislead. The
appellant asserted that his evidence, given more than a year after the events
to which it related, was an honest statement of what he could remember. An
appeal from his conviction by a judge sitting without a jury was dismissed by
the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a judgment of acquittal entered.

Per Curiam: There was no evidence of any intent to
mislead, or knowledge of the falsity of the evidence given. The evidence may
have been in error, although that was doubtful, but error alone affords no
basis for the inference of the intent and knowledge necessary to support a
charge of perjury.

Per Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.:
It was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt (i) that
the appellant's evidence, specified in the indictment, was false in fact, (ii)
that the appellant when he gave it knew that it was false, and (iii) that he
gave it with intent to mislead the Court. Although there was some evidence on
which it was open to the tribunal of fact to find that the first of these
matters was proved, there was no evidence on which it could find that either of
the other matters was proved. In such circumstances, had the trial been before
a jury it would have been the duty of the trial judge to direct them to find a
verdict of not guilty and it was equally his duty to so direct himself.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division, affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal allowed.

W. G. Morrow, Q.C., for the appellant.

W. Shortreed, Q.C., for the respondent.

[Page 893]

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Locke,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

Judson J.:—John
Gordon Calder appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, which dismissed his appeal from his conviction on a
charge of perjury after a trial before a judge sitting without a jury. The only
reasons before us from the Appellate Division are those of the Chief Justice,
who dissented and would have allowed the appeal.

The precise charge of perjury against the appellant was
that, as a witness in a divorce case heard in September 1958, he had given
evidence to the effect

that shortly after the 1st day of July, A.D. 1957, Mr.
Douglas Dunn and Mrs. Geraldine Holland and her two children moved to his
trailer located about 30 feet west of his office facing south on 8th Street and
Railway Avenue, Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and lived in the said trailer
from three weeks to a month, well knowing same to be false and with intent to
mislead.

In 1957 the appellant was living in Dawson Creek and
carrying on a transport business. In his yard there was a trailer which he used
for the accommodation of his drivers when they came in late at night and needed
sleeping quarters. In June 1957 he permitted one Douglas Dunn, who also owned a
small trucking business, to occupy this trailer. In the latter half of June
1957, Dunn was joined by a woman, whom he introduced as Mrs. Dunn. This woman
was at that time married to William Holland. The two lived in this trailer for
a period of about two weeks in the month of June 1957, and for part of this
time there was another couple living there with them. At the end of June Mrs.
Holland returned to Edmonton with Dunn to pick up her two children at the end
of the school term. The two returned with the children to Dawson Creek early in
the morning of July 2. Her story is that for the remainder of the first night
she slept in the car with the two children and then immediately moved into a
house with Dunn.

In the divorce action between Holland, as plaintiff, and his
wife, as defendant, the appellant was subpoenaed as a witness. This is the
evidence that he gave:

Q. Was anybody else living in this trailer at the time you
met Mrs. Dunn, as you were introduced to her?

A. Mr. Dunn.

[Page 894]

Q. He was living there?

A. Yes.

Q. How long did Mr. Dunn and the woman you were introduced
to as Mrs. Dunn live in this trailer?

A. I would say approximately three weeks to a month.

Q. Had Mr. Dunn slept in the trailer prior to the time that
this lady appeared on the scene?

A. That is right, yes.

Q. And do you recall what period of time it would be that
Mr. Dunn and this lady, who you now know to be Mrs. Holland, occupied the
trailer?

A. Sometime shortly after the 1st of July. It was right
within a week of that First of July.

Q. Were there any children?

A. Yes.

Q. The Court: Do you
mean that she started to occupy the trailer about the 1st of July or the latter
part of June?

A. No, after the 1st of July, sometime right in there.

Q. The Court: Sometime
after the 1st of July, that was the first time she occupied it?

A. Yes.

Q. The Court: Now you
said something about the children, they were there too?

A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Stanton: How
many children?

A. Two I believe sir.

Q. When did they appear on the scene?

A. Sometime just a few days after the 1st of July.

Mr. Miller cross-examines:

Q. Another thing now, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you
that Mrs. Holland's children never stayed in that trailer, that when they came
to Dawson Creek they immediately went to this house that we are speaking about
that belonged to Henderson?

A. No sir.

Q. I want you to consider, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to
you that the children never stayed in that trailer.

A. Well, it is, they were there, that is all I know.

Q. I know they were in Dawson Creek.

A. They were there in that trailer. I have mentioned that
twice or three times now sir.

Q. All right now, Mr. Calder, I am suggesting to you that
Mr. and Mrs. Hine stayed in that trailer at the time that Mrs. Holland or/and
Mr. Dunn were there?

A. I don't know anything about that.

The Court: Were
you ever in the trailer when Mrs. Holland and Mr. Dunn were in there?

A. No, not that I recall sir.

The Court: When
did you see Mrs. Holland in there with Mr. Dunn?

[Page 895]

A. Every day, right there 30 feet from my office, I couldn't
help but see.

The Court: She
was inside?

A. Yes, she was outside and inside and in and out all the
time.

The Court: And
the children too?

A. Yes.

At the trial of the appellant on the charge of perjury, Mrs.
Holland, who by that time had become Mrs. Dunn, denied that she had ever
occupied the trailer at any time in the month of July 1957 with Dunn and the
children. The appellant gave evidence in his own defence and stated that Dunn
and the woman had stayed in the trailer in June for some time and that the next
time he saw them was July 2. On the following day they moved into the trailer
again and he saw them in and around the trailer for a few days, after which
they moved into a house. He asserted that his evidence, given at the trial, was
an honest statement of what he could remember and that he thought that the
couple had stayed in the trailer for a few days with the children. He admitted
that he had never walked around and looked in the trailer to see who was in it.
His observations were made from his office which was about 30 feet away. His
understanding from Dunn was that they would be there for a few days. He
explained that his evidence of the occupation of the trailer for a period of
three weeks to a month, given at the trial, related to the month of June. He
also said that he had seen Mrs. Holland's children around the trailer after
Dunn had spoken to him about arrangements for the use of the trailer.

The unquestionable facts are that Mrs. Holland was living in
the trailer with Dunn in the second half of June 1957, with Dunn and the
children in a small house nearby from some time early in July until the end of
September 1957 and that the children did not arrive in Dawson Creek until July
2.

The appellant gave his evidence at the divorce trial on
September 16, 1958, more than a year after the events to which he testified. He
became involved, as an innocent bystander, in events which were of no
particular significance to him at the time. He had no interest in the outcome
of the divorce trial and he was in court under subpoena. On this record, there
is, to me, a preponderance of evidence, coming

[Page 896]

from other witnesses as well as the appellant, that this
couple, along with the children, were in occupation of the trailer for some
period early in July 1957. This, however, is no ground for reversal in this
Court. But I agree with the learned Chief Justice that this appellant should
not have been convicted of perjury on the ground that there was no evidence of
any intent to mislead, or knowledge of the falsity of the evidence given. The
evidence may have been in error, although I doubt that, but error alone, and
that is the most that can be found against the appellant, affords no basis for
the inference of the intent and knowledge necessary to support this charge.

I would quash the conviction and direct that a judgment of
acquittal be entered.

The judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—I
agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and have little to
add.

While the learned Chief Justice of Alberta dissented from
the judgment of the majority of the Appellate Division on two questions of law
I find it necessary to consider only the first of these which is expressed in
the formal order in the following words:

There was no evidence on which it could properly be found
that the accused intended to swear as to the facts as was charged.

The test to be applied in determining whether or not there
was any evidence, as distinguished from sufficient evidence, to
support a conviction is to be found in the unanimous judgment of this Court
delivered by Duff C.J.C. in The King v. Décary1. The
question to be answered is whether ""there was no evidence in support of
the accusation before the jury in the sense that it was within the power of the
trial judge, and therefore, of course, his duty, to direct a verdict of not
guilty to be entered""; it has long been settled that the question so
stated is one of law in the strict sense, while the question on which the Court
of Appeal is empowered to pass by s. 592(1)  (a) (i) of the Criminal
Code  —whether the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence—is a mixed question of fact
and law.

[Page 897]

This Court has jurisdiction to review a decision of the
Court of Appeal on the first but not on the second of these questions. The two
questions have however a common feature; to answer either the Court must,
speaking generally, review the whole of the evidence.

In the case at bar it was incumbent upon the prosecution to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt three matters, (i) that the evidence, specified
in the indictment, given by the appellant on September 16, 1958, before
Greschuk J. was false in fact, (ii) that the appellant when he gave it knew
that it was false, and (iii) that he gave it with intent to mislead the Court.
It may well be that if there were evidence to support findings that the
appellant had given evidence false in fact knowing it to be false the tribunal
of fact, in the absence of other evidence as to his intention, could properly
draw the inference that in so doing he intended to mislead the Court.

After reading all the evidence with care it appears to me
that there was some evidence on which it was open to the tribunal of fact to
find that the first of the matters mentioned above was proved but, in my
opinion, there was no evidence on which it could find that either the second or
third of such matters was proved. In such circumstances, had the trial been
before a jury it would have been the duty of the learned trial judge to direct
them to find a verdict of not guilty and it was equally his duty to so direct
himself.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
judgment of acquittal to be entered.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and judgment
of acquittal directed to be entered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Aliens—Deportation—Chinese mother—Non-immigrant—Child born in
Canada during visit—Right to deport mother—The Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
325—The Canadian Citizens Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 33—The Canadian Bill of Rights,
1960 (Can.), c. 44.

The applicant, a citizen of China, came to Canada on a
non-immigrant visa issued to her in Hong Kong. Her husband and two other
children remained in Hong Kong. During her stay in Canada, a son, issue of her
marriage, was born to her. A deportation order was made against her by a
special enquiry officer under the Immigration Act. This order was
quashed by the trial judge, but restored by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The applicant fell within the terms of s. 5(t) of the
Act and of ss. 18 and 20 of the Regulations, and has not been deprived of her
liberty except by due process of law. The fact that she was the mother of a
legitimate child born in Canada had no bearing on the matter.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1],
reversing a judgment of King J. Appeal dismissed.

G.A. MacKay, for the applicant, appellant.

D.S. Maxwell and N. Chalmer, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an appeal by Mrs. Louie Yuet Sun
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 reversing a
decision of King J. which had quashed a deportation order made against the
appellant under the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325. As set out in
the factum of the appellant, it appears that she is a citizen of China who came
to Canada as a visitor in December 1957 by way of Hong Kong. She was in
possession of a passport in which was entered a Canadian non-immigrant visa
issued to her in Hong Kong. She had been allowed entry into Canada for a period
of six months and later her permit was extended another six months to December
1958. She had come to Canada to visit her father and brother, who live

[Page 71]

in Ottawa. Her husband, a farmer, and her two children, remained
in Hong Kong. She, who is now twenty-nine years of age, and her husband, who is
thirty-one years of age, were married in China in 1948. On August 18, 1958, while she was in Ottawa, the appellant gave birth to a son, a child of that
marriage.

Since the permission she had received to enter Canada had
expired, the appellant reported to an immigration officer as required by the
Act. She was examined by the officer who made a report under s. 23 of the Act
that it would be contrary to the provisions of the Act to grant admission to or
otherwise let the appellant come into Canada by reason of her coming under the
prohibited classes of s. 5, para, (t) thereof, in that she could not or
did not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of ss. 18 and 20
of the Regulations promulgated under the Act. Subsequently an enquiry was held
by a special enquiry officer, who decided that the appellant might not come
into or remain in Canada as of right and that (1) she was not a Canadian
citizen; (2) she was not a person having Canadian domicile; (3) she was a
member of a prohibited class described in s. 5(t) of the Act in that she
could not and did not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of
the Act or the Regulations because: (a) she did not have an immigrant
visa as required under subs. 3 of s. 18 of the Regulations; (b) she did
not come within the provisions of subs, (d) of s. 20 of the Regulations.
He accordingly ordered her to be detained and to be deported.

King J. held that the appellant was not a person within the
meaning and intent of s. 5(t) of the Act because she had recently given
birth to a child in Canada; the child being a natural born Canadian citizen had
a right to live in Canada and was entitled to the love, care and attention of
its mother. The mother desired to remain in Canada because she thought it would
be better for the child. No reasons were given by the Court of Appeal but upon
consideration I can see no basis for the judgment of the judge of first
instance. If the appellant chooses to take the child with her, the material
indicates that the Hong Kong authorities are willing to receive her and the
child. If, on the other hand, she chooses to leave the child here, he is
entitled to remain in Canada. It is not denied that the

[Page 72]

applicant falls within the terms of the relevant sections of
the Act and Regulations, and, unless the fact that she is the mother of a
legitimate child born in Canada affects the matter, she has not been deprived
of her liberty except by due process of law. In my view that fact has no
bearing on the matter.

Any other points raised in the Courts below were abandoned before
us. The appeal should be dismissed without costs.

Appeal dismissed without costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Murder—Conviction quashed by Court of
Appeal on ground inter alia it could not be supported by the evidence—Whether
question of law raised—Jurisdiction of Supreme Court to hear appeal —Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 201, 202, 592 (1) (a) (i).

[Page 145]

The respondent was found guilty of murder. He appealed and, by
a unanimous decision, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court quashed the
conviction of murder, and substituted therefor one of manslaughter.

It was not disputed that the victim was killed by the
respondent. According to the latter's evidence, the deceased while sitting in
his car with the respondent, made an indecent proposal to the respondent who
was drunk. The respondent seized the deceased by the neck and choked him. When
the respondent came to his senses he found the victim limp and he attempted
unsuccessfully to revive him. Thinking that the man was dead, he drove the car
a short distance and then dragged the body to a ditch. He placed the man's belt
around his neck, took his wallet and the car and left the place.

The pathologist who performed the autopsy concluded that death
was caused by strangulation due to the tightening of the belt.

Held (Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Abbott JJ.: There
was no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. The Chief Justice of
Alberta, speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, considered that the
evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction, which was a question of
fact. This first reason was not obiter dictum merely because he also
gave another reason. Gravestock v. Parkin, [1944] S.C.R. 150; Jacobs
v. London County Council, [1950] A.C. 361, referred to.

Per Taschereau, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The
Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground inter alia that
it could not be supported by the evidence. This was a distinct ground on which
its judgment was based, and was a ground raising no question of law in the
strict sense. It was nihil ad rem that the judgment was based also on
other grounds raising such points of law.

Per Ritchie J.: In finding that a reasonable doubt existed
as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be already dead at
the time when he in fact caused his death, the Appellate Division made a
finding of fact which excluded the application of s. 201 of the Code from the
circumstances of this case, and which was not subject to review in this Court.

If the Appellate Division erred in finding that such a doubt
existed, then this was an error of fact from which other errors necessarily
flowed, including that s. 202 was the only one under which the jury could have
found the accused guilty of murder. The error, if error it was, raised a mixed
question of fact and law, and as such was not a competent ground of appeal to
this Court. R. v. Décary, [1942] S.C.R. 80, referred to.

As the Appellate Division quashed the conviction on the ground
inter alia that it could not be supported by the evidence, no question
of law in the strict sense was raised by this appeal.

Per Locke J., dissenting: The language of the
Chief Justice of the Appellate Division did not indicate that the decision of
that Court rested upon the insufficiency of the evidence. If, however, it
should be so construed, what was said as to the insufficiency of the evidence
referred only to a charge of murder under s. 202 of the Code and not to such a
charge under s. 201. This was misdirection. It

[Page 146]

was further made manifest that one of the grounds for this
conclusion was the opinion that, as it could not be said with assurance that
the accused did not believe the victim to have been dead when he tightened the
belt around his neck, there could be no conviction for murder under s. 202.
These were errors in law, which this Court was vested with jurisdiction to
correct. Thabo Meli v. R., [1954] 1 W.L.R. 228; Bradley v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 723,
referred to.

Per Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ., dissenting:
Although the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division was strongly of the
opinion that the verdict of murder could not be supported by the evidence, he
was not satisfied that this opinion had that degree of finality required to
assert it as a distinct ground for the decision of the appeal.

If, however, it could be said that the decision of the
Appellate Division was that the verdict could not be supported on the evidence,
it appeared that this conclusion rested on the proposition stated when the
Chief Justice, after dealing with s. 202, said: ""this is the only section
under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder."" This
was tantamount to saying that there was no evidence on which the jury could
have convicted under s. 201, which was a question of law.

Where it appears that a decision of a court of appeal that a
verdict cannot be supported by the evidence has been founded on a wrong
conclusion of law, this Court is not without jurisdiction to hear an appeal
from it. It was an error in law to say that there was no evidence upon which
the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder under s. 201, which was
the conclusion, in a relation to that section, which was ultimately reached by
the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division.

The jury having rejected the defence of drunkenness, the
suggestion of the Appellate Division that the trial judge should have put to
the jury ""a suggestion"" that the accused put the belt around the
victim's neck to assist in dragging him from the car to the ditch, was
untenable. In directing a jury, the trial judge has not the duty to speculate
and instruct them as to all the views which one might possibly take of the
evidence.

As to the errors found in the Court below, and as to the
grievances alleged for respondent in the notices of appeal to that Court, there
was nothing of real substance.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1, quashing a conviction of murder and
substituting one of manslaughter. Appeal dismissed, Locke, Fauteux, Martland
and Judson JJ. dissenting.

W. Shortreed, Q.C., for the appellant.

Bruce D. Patterson, for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau and Abbott JJ.
was delivered by

[Page 147]

The Chief Justice:—In
my opinion there is no jurisdiction in the Court to hear this appeal. The first
two sentences of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta,
speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, are as follows:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

I read the first sentence as meaning that the Chief
Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a
conviction,—which is a question of fact. As to the second sentence and the
remainder of the reasons, the decisions, referred to on the argument, of Gravestock
v. Parkin2 and Jacobs v. London County
Council3 show authoritatively that the
first reason given by the Chief Justice of Alberta was not obiter dictum merely
because he also gave another reason.

While it was announced that we had jurisdiction, further
consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court that such is not the
case.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by

Cartwright J.:—This
is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta4 pronounced on March 31, 1960, allowing
an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on January 22, 1960, before
Greschuk J. and a jury on the charge that at Edmonton on or about August 23,
1959, he did murder Stanley Valpeters. The Appellate Division quashed the
conviction of murder, substituted a conviction of manslaughter and subsequently
sentenced the appellant to ten years imprisonment.

The appeal is brought pursuant to an order made by this
Court on May 12, 1960, granting the appellant leave to appeal on the following
questions:

(a) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding
that there was nondirection amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in
respect to the offence of murder under section 202  of the Criminal Code , and
that

[Page 148]

the grounds on which the jury could find the accused guilty
of murder while committing robbery were not placed before the jury as facts to
be found by them;

(b) Did the Appellate Division err in law in finding
that the trial judge should have put to the jury ""a suggestion"" that
the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from
the car to the ditch, in the absence of evidence to support any such
suggestion;

(c) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding
that the judge's charge was inadequate in failing to explain the theory
advanced by the Crown that strangulation was used to facilitate the commission
of robbery, and, hence, whether it was intended to cause death or not the act
constituted murder;

(d) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding
that only under section 202  of the Criminal Code  could the jury have found the
accused guilty of murder.

The order granting leave was made by a court consisting of
five members, two of whom, dissenting, would have dismissed the application.

It is not disputed that Valpeters was killed by the
appellant. There were no eye-witnesses of the killing other than the appellant
himself who made a voluntary statement to the police after his arrest on the
charge of murder and also gave evidence at the trial. The effect of the
evidence is sufficiently summarized in the following passage in the reasons of
Ford C.J.A. who delivered the reasons of the Appellate Division:

The facts of what happened when the deceased, Valpeters, met
his death must be ascertained from the story told by the accused himself with
the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, the location and condition of
the body when found, and the opinion evidence of the two doctors called by the
Crown.

The story of the accused is that he is a drink addict and
had been drinking throughout part of the afternoon of Saturday, August 22nd,
1959 and all of the evening, during which time he visited at least two hotels,
the Hotel Regis, and the King Edward. He said that he met a constable on the
street and asked to be taken into custody for being drunk as he wanted to go to
Belmont for treatment because of his drink habits. Being unsuccessful in this,
he went to police headquarters and suggested that there was a charge of false
pretences that could or should be laid against him on which he could be taken
into custody. In this, too, he was unsuccessful. There is no doubt that he
tried to have this done as it is confirmed by the evidence of the police
constables.

After this he roamed the streets of Edmonton until about two
o'clock Sunday morning. During this period he was put out two or three times
from the Rose cafe. This is also confirmed by independent evidence. About the
hour just mentioned, when still in search of liquor, he met a stranger somewhere
near the same restaurant. This stranger, who has turned out to be Valpeters,
invited him to go in his car out of the City of Edmonton into the country to
consume a bottle of whiskey. Valpeters

[Page 149]

drove out past the oil refineries until the car was brought
to a stop somewhere in the entrance to a farmhouse in the country. Valpeters
invited the accused into the back seat in order to drink the whiskey. After
both got into this seat he invited the accused to perform an act of gross
indecency, whereupon a struggle began in which some blows, apparently
ineffective, were struck, and Valpeters got the accused down and the accused
seized Valpeters by the neck and choked him. The accused said that when he came
to his senses Valpeters was all limp and that he attempted to revive him. The
accused said that he had had some training with the St. Johns Ambulance. The
attempt to revive was unsuccessful and, after feeling his heart and pulses, he
thought the man was dead.

He said that he was in fear because of what he had done and
backed the car out of the entrance way to the farmhouse and drove it a short
distance along the road to a ditch where he got out and pulled the body from
the back seat and dragged it by the armpits to the ditch. He said that he tried
again to revive the man but could not do so. He said also what is the most
serious evidence against himself that he put the man's belt around his neck
when he was in the ditch and took his wallet and the car and left the place.
That is where the body was found the following Monday afternoon.

The accused, on taking the car, drove to where he was living
in Edmonton and took with him the woman with whom he was living and their son,
that same morning, and drove back to the home of her parents in Ontario where
he was later arrested.

I do not find it necessary to consider the several errors of
law alleged by the appellant to have been made by the Appellate Division as I
think it is clear that the Appellate Division allowed the appeal on two main
grounds:

(1) that, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, the
verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground that it could not
be supported by the evidence, and

(2) that there had been errors in law in the charge of the
learned trial judge.

So far as the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on
the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to interfere with it. The
question whether the Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this ground
is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a question of fact or, at
the best from the point of view of the appellant, a mixed question of fact and
law.

The reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta open
with the following paragraph:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

[Page 150]

Later in his reasons, the learned Chief Justice says:

No one can say with assurance that the accused did not
believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the
struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.

This is a finding of fact made by the Appellate Division as
a result of its examination of the evidence. It is irrelevant to inquire whether
we would make the same finding if we had the power, which the Appellate
Division has but which we have not, to proceed upon grounds of fact.

The jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to allow the
appeal is found in s. 592(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  which
reads:

592(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the
court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal
where it is of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence,

(ii) the judgment of the trial
court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of
law, or

(iii) on any ground there was a
miscarriage of justice;

On reading the reasons as a whole, I am satisfied that the
Appellate Division was exercising its jurisdiction under s. 592(1)  (a)
(i) and was setting the verdict aside on the ground that, in its opinion, it
could not be supported by the evidence.

It was suggested during the argument that what the Appellate
Division really did was to rule that there was no evidence on which the jury
could have convicted the respondent of murder and that the question whether
there is any evidence, as distinguished from the question whether there is
enough evidence, is a question of law.

I cannot agree with this suggestion for several reasons.
First, it appears that there was, as indeed both counsel concede, some evidence
on which it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to find a
verdict of murder and I am not prepared to assume that the Appellate Division
overlooked or misunderstood this evidence. Secondly, if the Appellate Division
had intended to hold that there was no evidence they would have said so; it is
significant that they followed the very words of s. 592(1)  (a) (i). This
clause gives jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to proceed on grounds of fact,
while clause (ii) which follows immediately gives it jurisdiction to proceed on
the ground that there has been

[Page 151]

a wrong decision on a question of law. Thirdly, while a
large number of grounds of appeal were put forward in the notice of appeal to
the Appellate Division these did not include the ground that there was no
evidence to support the conviction, while the following grounds were all
appropriate to found the submission that the verdict should be set aside under
s. 592(1)  (a) (i) as being one that could not be supported by the
evidence:

(1) That the said conviction is against the law, evidence
and weight of the evidence.

* * *

(3) That the jury failed to give proper, fair, reasonable
and adequate consideration to the evidence and came to a hasty conclusion.

(4) That the verdict of the jury was perverse and contrary
to the evidence at the trial.

* * *

(19) The verdict of the jury was perverse and contrary to
the evidence in that it generally failed to give the appellant the benefit of
reasonable doubt and more particularly with respect to the following:

(a) That the medical
evidence indicated that a person rendered unconscious by pressure on the
carotid nerve would become dead in a matter of minutes if certain steps such as
lowering of the head between the knees and relieving of the pressure did not
take place and there being no evidence that the deceased was so relieved prior
to the placing of the belt.

(b) That the medical evidence
indicated death by strangulation and the evidence of the appellant indicated
the deceased was limp and appeared to be dead in the car, which evidence was
consistent with appellant's theory and defence as to cause and time of death or
at least raised reasonable doubt that death occurred from the placing of the
belt on the deceased's neck in the ditch and not by reason of the appellant's
actions as stated in the car.

However, I may have dealt with this suggestion at undue
length for the grounds on which leave to appeal to this Court was granted do
not include a ground that the Appellate Division erred in holding that there
was no evidence on which the jury could have convicted the respondent of
murder.

If I am right in my view that the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on distinct grounds, with one of which we cannot interfere
because it raises no question of law in the strict sense, it is of no
consequence that the other grounds on which they proceeded did raise such
questions of law. If authority be needed for this proposition it is to be

[Page 152]

found in the cases referred to by the Chief Justice during
the argument of the appeal, Gravestock v. Parkin5 and
Jacobs v. London County Council6: in the last mentioned case Lord
Simonds, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, said at page 369:

But, however this may be, there is in my opinion no
justification for regarding as obiter dictum a reason given by a judge for his
decision, because he has given another reason also. If it were a proper test to
ask whether the decision would have been the same apart from the proposition
alleged to be obiter, then a case which ex facie decided two things would
decide nothing.

At the risk of appearing repetitious, I venture to suggest
that if the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, as he might have done, had simply
said:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence … I would allow the appeal and quash the
conviction of murder … we order that the conviction for murder be quashed, and
a conviction of manslaughter be substituted.

no one would have suggested that this Court had power
to review the judgment of the Appellate Division. I am unable to see how we
acquire such power because the learned Chief Justice felt that he ""must go
further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction""; his
use of the word ""other"" makes it plain that he had already given one
reason. The meaning of the word ""other"" as here used is that given
first in the Concise Oxford Dictionary ""not the same as one or more or
some already mentioned or implied, separate in identity, distinct in kind,
alternative or further or additional"". Once a distinct reason has been
given its character is not altered by the giving of additional reasons.

I conclude that the Appellate Division quashed the
conviction on the ground inter alia that it cannot be supported by the
evidence, that this was a distinct ground on which its judgment was based, that
it is a ground raising no question of law in the strict sense and that it is nihil
ad rem that the judgment was based also on other grounds raising such
points of law.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Locke J. (dissenting):—The
passage from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta which is
relied upon to support the argument that this Court is without jurisdiction to
entertain this appeal must be read together with

[Page 153]

other passages of the reasons which discuss the grounds upon
which that portion of the opinion is based. After saying:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

the learned Chief Justice said in part:

I would hold that there was non-direction amounting to misdirection,
if not misdirection, in respect of the offence of murder under Section 202 of
the Code. This is the only section under which the jury could have found the
accused guilty of murder.

and again, after referring to the fact that the belt of
the deceased was drawn tightly about his neck, this admittedly having been done
by the respondent, and that the medical evidence was to the effect that the man
had died of strangulation, it was said:

No one can say with assurance that the accused did not
believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the
struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.

With great respect, I am of the opinion that upon the
evidence the accused might properly have been found guilty of murder under s.
201  of the Criminal Code  and I consider the learned trial judge properly
charged the jury upon that section.

I am further of the opinion that the fact that the accused
may have believed that Valpeters was dead when he put the belt around his neck
and drew it tight does not affect the question as to whether the offence was
murder under either sections 201  or 202 .

Upon the respondent's own statement, in the struggle with
Valpeters in the car he struck him several times with his fists and attempted
to throttle him and, after moving the car to another location, dragged the man
to the ditch and there placed and tightened the belt around his neck. These
were all facts which formed part of the offence of either murder or
manslaughter and were properly all considered together. The argument that the
various unlawful acts causing the death of a person may be split up and the
intention of the accused considered in respect of each of them separately was
made and rejected by the Judicial Committee in Thabo Meli
v. R7. In that case the accused

[Page 154]

persons had planned to kill the victim and had beaten him so
severely that they thought he was dead. They then threw his body over a cliff
for the purpose of indicating that the man had accidentally fallen over and
been killed. It was shown at the trial that the injured man died not from the
beating to which he had been subjected but from the exposure when lying out at
the foot of the cliff. The contention that as the accused persons thought the
man was dead when they threw him over the cliff and did this accordingly
without the intent of killing him was rejected, for reasons which are
applicable in the present case. I would add that a similar contention was
advanced in this Court and rejected in Bradley v. The Queen8.

I agree with my brother Fauteux, whose reasons I have had
the advantage of reading, that the language of the learned Chief Justice above
quoted does not indicate that the decision was rested upon the insufficiency of
the evidence. If, however, it should be so construed, it is my opinion that
there is jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. Clearly, what is said
as to the insufficiency of the evidence refers only to a charge of murder under
s. 202  and not to such a charge under s. 201  and this, with respect, was
misdirection. It is further made manifest that one of the grounds for this
conclusion was the opinion that, as it could not be said with assurance that
the accused did not believe Valpeters to have been dead when he tightened the
belt around his neck, there could be no conviction for murder under s. 202 .
These were errors in law, in my opinion, which this Court is vested with
jurisdiction to correct.

I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the
trial.

The judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

Fauteux J. (dissenting):—In
the early afternoon of August 24, 1959, two hunters discovered a body, in a
ditch beside a municipal road, outside the city limits of Edmonton, in the
Province of Alberta. The body, later identified

[Page 155]

as that of one Stanley Valpeters, was partly hidden by
growing grass and was lying face down with a belt around the neck.

The pathologist who subsequently performed the autopsy
observed, amongst other marks of violence, that there were, all around the
neck, a straplike constriction and a furrow to which blades of grass were
stuck. When the belt was exhibited to him and when told of its finding around
the neck of the body, he expressed the opinion that the furrow could have
resulted from a tension sustained for some time on the free end of the belt. He
estimated it would take a minimum of about five minutes for constriction to
stop the breath so as to cause
death. His findings indicated to him that Valpeters was alive prior to the
exertion of the pressure that caused the furrow. He concluded that death was
caused by strangulation.

Investigation by the police led to the arrest of respondent
a few days later, in the city of Toronto. Warner was then found in possession
of Valpeters' wallet and automobile, the wallet containing identification
papers of the latter and the license plates, issued for his automobile, having
been substituted.

Respondent made an admittedly voluntary statement to the
police. In the first part thereof, he relates at length and with details
various occasions during which, the week before the date of the fatal
occurrence and on the very day itself, he consumed alcoholic liquors. Then
follows a narration of events contemporaneous and immediately subsequent to the
killing of Valpeters, including his hurried departure from Edmonton, with all
the members of his family, in the automobile of the latter. Respondent says
that, in the early hours of the 23rd of August, 1959, the day before the
discovery of the body, he and the deceased, who were strangers to one another,
met casually on a street within the city limits of Edmonton. He accepted an
invitation of Valpeters to drive to a suitable place to consume a bottle of
liquor which the latter said he had in his automobile. They eventually stopped
on a gravel road ""or a kind of track or cattle-path in some bushes"",
where, on respondent's story, the following events took place:

He (Valpeters) says ""Let's get in the back seat because
the whiskey is there"". Both of us got in the back seat with him behind the
driver's seat and I was on his right. Instead of producing a bottle of whiskey

[Page 156]

he put his hand over and started to undo my pants. The next
thing I knew I got mad and proceeded to struggle with him. I started to choke
him. I don't remember too much how long I was choking him or what but when I
came to my sense again he was all limp.

I tried to feel a heart beat but couldn't and I got scared.
This was in the back seat with my door open and I tried artificial respiration
with him laying on the back seat. Nothing happened so I closed the back door
and climbed into the driver's seat. I backed the car out of there on to the
road and I drove a short distance from there. It wasn't very far. I got out and
pulled him out of the car into the ditch.

I don't know whether I was still mad or crazy but I took his
belt from his pants and wrapped it around his neck. I left him there.

I took his wallet from him but I don't know just what pocket
it was in. I put it in my own pocket. Then I drove out of there and went home.
It was just breaking daylight when I got home. I went into the house and got my
wife out of bed and told her we were leaving right away as we were going to
Drayton Valley and to pack everything that she could get in the car and we would
send for the rest of the stuff later.

Respondent was then charged with the murder of Valpeters. At
trial, he testified in his own defence repeating, with some additions, what he
had already stated to the police. Thus, he suggested that while wrestling in
the car, he was overpowered by his victim and then started to choke him. He
said he had some knowledge of first aid and that, to practise artificial
respiration, he thought it better, being in fear that attention of people in
the neighbourhood might have been attracted by the scuffle, to drive some
distance away. Having done so, he dragged Valpeters by the arm-pits in the
ditch where, he said, he attempted to revive him and then he put the belt
around his neck—an act for which, he testified, he was unable to account.

On this direct and other incriminating evidence of a
circumstantial nature, the jury, having been directed particularly on the
various issues raised in defence, to wit, drunkenness, provocation and
self-defence, found the accused guilty of murder.

Respondent appealed and, by a unanimous decision, the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court quashed the verdict of murder,
substituting thereto one of manslaughter.

The reasons for judgment were delivered by Ford C.J.A., and
concurred in by the other members of the Court. In the opening paragraph of his
reasons for judgment, the learned Chief Justice said:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

[Page 157]

He then proceeded to review the evidence, relating it
to the offence of murder under s. 202  Cr.C ., i.e., murder associated with
robbery, and, having found fault with the address of the trial Judge in that
respect, he disposed of the appeal in the manner just indicated.

The Crown then applied to this Court for leave to appeal. On
this application, counsel for respondent, relying on the first sentence of the
opening paragraph of the reasons for judgment, contended that this Court had no
jurisdiction in the matter.

Subject to the right of respondent to raise the question of
jurisdiction at the hearing of the appeal on the merit, leave to appeal was
granted on questions of law here mentioned in the order in which they will
hereafter be considered:

(i) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that
only under section 202  of the Criminal Code  could the jury have found the
accused guilty of murder.

(ii) Did the Appellate Division err in law in finding that
the trial judge should have put to the jury ""a suggestion"" that the
accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to assist in dragging him from the
car to the ditch, in the absence of evidence to support any such suggestion;

(iii) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that
there was nondirection amounting to misdirection, if not misdirection, in
respect to the offence of murder under section 202  of the Criminal Code , and
that the grounds on which the jury could find the accused guilty of murder
while committing robbery were not placed before the jury as facts to be found
by them;

(iv) Did the Appellate Division err in law in holding that
the judge's charge was inadequate in failing to explain the theory advanced by
the Crown that strangulation was used to facilitate the commission of robbery,
and, hence, whether it was intended to cause death or not the act constituted
murder;

Dealing with the objection to the jurisdiction of this
Court.

It may well be impossible to affirm our jurisdiction in a
case where a Court of Appeal states, clearly and without more, that a verdict
is set aside on the ground that it cannot be supported by the evidence. This is
not the situation in the present case. Here, the Chief Justice said:

I am strongly of the opinion that the verdict of murder
cannot be supported by the evidence.

This sentence, he immediately and substantially
qualified in adding:

But I feel I must go further, and set out other reasons for
setting aside the conviction.

[Page 158]

Read together, these two sentences indicate, I think,
that while entertaining, even to a strong degree, the opinion expressed, the
Chief Justice was not ready to rest a decision upon it, but felt compelled to
""go further"" and give, not the other reasons, but ""other
reasons"", meaning reasons other than the opinion expressed, to justify
the setting aside of the verdict of murder. In other words, strong as was this
opinion, the Chief Justice was not satisfied that it had that degree of
finality required to assert it as a distinct ground for the decision of the
appeal which he ultimately rested on grounds stated as follows at the end of
his reasons for judgment:

I would hold that there was non direction amounting to
misdirection, if not misdirection, in respect of the offence of murder under s.
202 of the Code. This is the only section under which the jury could have found
the accused guilty of murder.

On this interpretation, the decisions in Gravestock
v. Parkin9 and Jacobs v. London County
Council10 have no application in this
case.

If, however, it can be said that the decision of the
Appellate Division was that the verdict of murder could not be supported on the
evidence, we must, in that event, read the remainder of the reasons for
judgment as being explanatory of the decision which had been reached. When that
is done, it appears to me to be clear that the conclusion rested upon the
proposition stated when the learned Chief Justice, after dealing with s. 202 ,
said: ""This is the only section under which the jury could have found the
accused guilty of murder."" This is tantamount to saying that there was no
evidence on which the jury could have convicted under s. 201 , and that is a
question of law.

Has this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal under such
circumstances? In my opinion it has. The situation is somewhat analogous to
that which arose in Lizotte v. The King11. In that case
the Court of King's Bench had affirmed a conviction of murder, one of the
grounds being that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice,
notwithstanding certain errors of law at the trial. The Court12 had
declared ""que la preuve justifie amplement le verdict"". Before this
Court it was contended, on behalf of the Crown,

[Page 159]

that, as this was a decision of fact, or mixed law and fact,
it was not subject to review in this Court. That argument was rejected in the
following terms at p. 134:

I do not think that this argument is entitled to prevail. In
the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by pointing out that in my
opinion there were serious errors in matters of law at the trial which the
Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but even had the Court
of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which in my view did
occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to section 1014(2), I do
not think that this court would be without jurisdiction.

Similarly, in my view, where it appears that a decision of a
court of appeal, that a verdict cannot be supported by the evidence, has been
founded on a wrong conclusion on a question of law, this Court is not without
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from it. That this occurred in the present
case is shown in the consideration of the first ground of appeal.

Dealing with the merits of the appeal. The question whether
the Appellate Division erred in law in holding that only under section 202 
could the jury have found the accused guilty of murder, must be answered
affirmatively. As presented to the jury, the case was not and could not have
been legally confined to the issue of murder under section 202 , i.e., murder
associated with robbery, but included the issue of murder under section 201 . On
the latter issue, it was open to the jury to accept the opinion of the
pathologist that the straplike constriction and the furrow around the neck resulted
from a tension sustained for about five minutes on the free end of the belt and
that prior to the exertion of the tension, Valpeters was alive. From these
facts and subject to the consideration of the various defences raised,—which
were rejected,—the jury could validly infer an intention to kill and reach a
verdict of guilty of murder under section 201 .

In his reasons for judgment, the Chief Justice said:

No one can say with assurance that the accused did not
believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious during the course of the
struggle and after the efforts to revive him had failed.

It has been suggested that this constitutes a finding of
fact which excludes the application of s. 201  of the Criminal Code , because, it
is contended, if the respondent believed Valpeters to be dead he could not
thereafter have conceived

[Page 160]

the intent to cause his death. It is then contended that,
being a finding of fact, this Court has no jurisdiction to disturb it.

It should be noted, however, that the learned Chief Justice
did not himself, in his reasons for judgment, relate the statement above quoted
to the conclusion which he ultimately reached that the respondent could not
have been convicted under s. 201 . It occurs in the course of his consideration
of the adequacy of the charge to the jury by the learned trial Judge in respect
of the application of s. 202  of the Criminal Code , for, after discussing what
was said in the charge in relation to that matter, he said:

Taken by itself, this is not objectionable. But the real
question for the jury was whether or not what the accused did was done in the
course of a robbery and, basic to this, is the question of whether or not this
was a robbery; and that, in turn, depends upon the intent in the mind of the accused
up to the time that he thought the man was dead. No one can say with assurance
that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming unconscious
during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive him had
failed.

The question of the belief of the respondent as to the
condition of Valpeters after the struggle is thus related by the learned Chief
Justice solely to the question as to whether, prior to Valpeters becoming
unconscious during the course of the struggle, the respondent had formulated
the intent to rob him.

In any event, even if it could be said that the respondent
did believe Valpeters to be dead, it does not follow that, because of this
belief, he could not conceive the idea and form the intent to make definitely
certain that any possible spark of life be conclusively destroyed. It was
clearly open to the jury to infer that such an intent accompanied the
commission of the very acts of violence by which the respondent did actually
kill his victim; and this is murder under s. 201 .

It was, therefore, an error in law to say that there was no
evidence upon which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder
under the latter section, which is the conclusion, in a relation to that
section, which was ultimately reached by the learned Chief Justice.

With respect to the second question, there is nothing in the
evidence suggesting that the accused put the belt around Valpeters' neck to
assist in dragging him from the car to the

[Page 161]

ditch. On the contrary, in both his statements to the police
and in his testimony, the accused said that the placing of the belt took place
once the victim was in the ditch. The presence of blades of grass stuck to the
furrow found around the neck is significant. Moreover, on his own story given
at the trial, the accused specified that he dragged his victim by the armpits
in the ditch, in order to revive him by practising artificial respiration. The
jury having rejected his defence of drunkenness, the suggestion of the
Appellate Division is, with all deference, untenable. In directing a jury, the
trial judge has not the duty to speculate and instruct them as to all the views
which one might possibly take of the evidence.

As to the errors found in the Court below and referred to in
the third and fourth grounds of the appeal for the Crown, and as to the
numerous grievances alleged for respondent in the original and supplemental
notices of appeal to the Court below, I must say that, after having considered
the address of the trial Judge and the evidence, I can find nothing of real
substance. The jury were directed with exceptional care and clarity on all the
issues upon which it was the duty of the trial Judge to do so, and more
particularly on the defence of drunkenness, provocation and self-defence raised
by the accused and ultimately rejected by the jury. While failure of counsel
for an accused to object to the address of the trial Judge at the stage of
trial is not fatal, it may be added that though invited to submit objections,
none were offered by counsel.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
Appellate Division, and restore the verdict of the jury.

Ritchie J.:—The
circumstances giving rise to this appeal are outlined in the reasons for
judgment of Mr. Justice Cartwright and Mr. Justice Fauteux which I have had the
benefit of reading.

In my view the opening words of the decision rendered by
Ford C.J. on behalf of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
are the controlling factor in the determination of the difficult question as to
whether or not a question of law in the strict sense is raised by this appeal.
The learned Chief Justice said:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict of murder cannot
be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further, and set out other
reasons for setting aside the conviction.

[Page 162]

In the course of his decision, the learned Chief Justice
also held that s. 202  of the Criminal Code  ""is the only-section
under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder"" and it
was contended on behalf of the appellant that this finding constituted an error
in law and formed the basis of the opinion of the Appellate Division that the
verdict of murder could not be supported by the evidence. It, therefore,
becomes necessary to examine the grounds upon which the Appellate Division
based its conclusion with respect to s. 202 of the Code.

Dominant amongst the reasons set out by the learned Chief
Justice for allowing this appeal is the finding that ""no one can say with
assurance that the accused did not believe Valpeters was dead on his becoming
unconscious during the course of the struggle and after the efforts to revive
him had failed"".

In my view this finding must be interpreted as meaning that
on the evidence before them, all the members of the Appellate Division
concluded that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the respondent
believed his victim to be dead before the belt was placed around his neck. The
medical evidence was that the deceased came to his death by being strangled
with his belt and must, therefore, have been alive when the belt was first
applied, and it is implicit in the decision of the Appellate Division that this
evidence was accepted.

If the respondent had believed his living victim to be dead
after his efforts to revive him had failed, it follows that he could not
thereafter have conceived the intent to cause his death which is a necessary
ingredient of the offence of murder as described in s. 201  of the Criminal
Code  for no man can intend to kill a person whom he thinks to be already
dead. It, therefore, seems to me that in finding that a reasonable doubt
existed as to whether or not the respondent believed his victim to be already
dead at the time when he in fact caused his death, the Appellate Division made
a finding of fact which excluded the application of s. 201  from the
circumstances of this case and which is not subject to review in this Court.

If the Appellate Division erred in finding that such a doubt
existed, then this was an error of fact from which other errors necessarily
flowed, including the finding that

[Page 163]

s. 202  was the only one under which the jury could have
found the accused guilty of murder. The latter conclusion follows directly from
the former, and, accordingly, in my view the error, if error it was, raises a
mixed question of fact and law, and as such is not a competent ground of appeal
to this Court (see The King v. Décary13).

I agree with Mr. Justice Cartwright that, as the Appellate
Division quashed the conviction on the ground, inter alia, that it could
not be supported by the evidence, no question of law in the strict sense is
raised by this appeal.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Trading stamps—Criminal liability—Whether
Criminal Code definition of ""trading stamps"" exhaustive—Criminal
Code , 1953–64 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 322(b), 369(2).

The respondents in both appeals, the circumstances of which
were the same or similar, were charged with unlawfully giving trading stamps to
a customer, contrary to s. 369(2)  of the Criminal Code . In each case the
magistrate dismissed the charge, and an appeal by way of a stated case was
dismissed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to this
Court.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Curiam: The only object in deleting the words
""besides trading stamps commonly so called"" from the definition of
trading stamps section in the 1953 revision of the Code (s. 322(b)) was to make
the present definition exhaustive. The word ""include"" had an
exhaustive definition in the present case.

There was no general accepted definition of ""trading
stamps"". Here the stamp was not token currency, nor was it used in the
obtaining of goods; it was not usable instead of money in procuring articles
from the issuer of the stamps. The stamp could be redeemed only from the
respondent from whom the article had been purchased and at the premises where
it was sold; and the stamp showed upon its face the place where it was
delivered and where it was redeemable upon demand, and in fact where it was so
redeemed.

[Page 139]

Per Fauteux J.: The word ""includes"" in s.
322(b) of the Code was, in the context, exclusively related to the words
""any form""; it was not referable to what the documents or other
devices must be as to substance in order to come within the prohibition. While
all-embracing or all-inclusive as to the forms which may possibly be adopted
for such documents or devices, the definition was exhaustive as to the
particular features required as constituent elements of the prohibited trading
stamps. The precise specifications as to substance, contained in (b) (i), (ii)
and (iii) of the section as well as in the saving clause did not justify the
inference that Parliament intended, from the use of the word
""includes"", to extend the definition in order to cover any other
documents or devices as to which it said nothing with respect to features
attending issuance, nature of benefit and redemption.

APPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, affirming orders of acquittal of a
Police Magistrate.

J. A. Scollin, for the appellant in both
appeals.

Edward A. Pitblado, Q.C., and David
Procter, for the respondent, Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Manitoba) Ltd.

J. J. Robinette, Q.C., H. Solway,
Q.C., and J. F. R. Taylor, for the respondent, David Thomson
(Niagara I.G.A. Grocery).

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Locke, Abbott and
Martland JJ. was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—These
two appeals were argued together. I deal first with that in connection with
Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Man.) Limited, which is an appeal against a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 on an appeal to it by way of stated
case against an order or judgment of acquittal of a Police Magistrate. By
answering the three questions submitted to it in the affirmative the Court of
Appeal held that on the facts found by the Magistrate, as to which there is no
dispute, he had correctly dismissed the charge against that respondent company
that it did on November 17, 1959, at Winnipeg, unlawfully, being a merchant or
dealer in goods, by its employee or agent, directly, or indirectly, give
trading stamps to William Hrycyk, a person who purchased goods from it.

[Page 140]

The charge was laid under subs. 2 of s. 369  of the Criminal
Code , 1953–54, c. 51:

(2) Every one who, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by
himself or his employee or agent, directly or indirectly gives or in any way
disposes of, or offers to give or in any way dispose of, trading stamps to a
person who purchases goods from him is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

Section 369  appears in Part VIII and the first section
in that Part reads as follows:

322. In this Part,

(a) ""goods"" means anything that is the
subject of trade or commerce; and

(b) ""trading stamps"" includes any form of
cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or
intended to be given to the purchaser of goods by the vendor thereof or on his
behalf, and to represent a discount on the price of the goods or a premium to
the purchaser thereof 

(i) that may be redeemed

(A) by any person other than the
vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the
manufacturer of the goods,

(B) by the vendor, the person
from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods in
cash or in goods that are not his property in whole or in part, or

(C) by the vendor elsewhere than
in the premises where the goods are purchased; or

(ii) that does not show upon its
face the place where it is delivered and the merchantable value thereof; or

(iii) that may not be redeemed
upon demand at any time,

but an offer, endorsed by the manufacturer upon a wrapper or
container in which goods are sold, of a premium or reward for the return of
that wrapper or container to the manufacturer is not a trading stamp.

The respondent is a merchant or dealer in goods doing
business at 1445 Main St. North, Winnipeg. On November 17, 1959, a member of
the Winnipeg City police force, William Hrycyk, purchased from the respondent
at that address, one tin of sardines for which he paid ten cents; at the time
of the purchase Hrycyk was given by an employee of the respondent, one
""Lucky Green stamp"" and a book, called a stamp saver book, in which
could be pasted that stamp and any others secured by the purchaser from time to
time. On the face of the stamp appear the words:

Redeemable at any time

Merchantable Value 2 Mills

1445-Main St. N.

Winnipeg

B.C. Premium Company

[Page 141]

and the stamp saver book states that the stamps are
redeemable at any time and only at the store from which original purchases were
made, and, further that the gifts illustrated in the premium catalogue are the
property of the retailer. There were filed before the Magistrate as one exhibit
a premium catalogue and supplements thereto and it was agreed that the lucky
green stamp scheme was as detailed in that exhibit. Hrycyk presented the stamp
and book to the manager of the respondent's store at the above address for
redemption and he was handed by the manager two cake cups.

The answer given by the majority of the Court of Appeal to
each of the following questions submitted by the Magistrate was:
""Yes"".

1. Was I right in law in holding that the word
""includes"" in Section 322 (b) of the Criminal Code  is to be construed
as ""means and includes""?

2. Was I right in law in holding that the stamp given to the
said William Hrycyk by the said Loblaw Groceterias Co. Manitoba Limited is not
a trading stamp within the meaning of the term ""Trading stamps"" in
Section 322 (b) of the Criminal Code ?

3. Was I right in law in holding that the stamp given to the
said William Hrycyk by the said Loblaw Groceterias Co. Manitoba Limited is not
a trading stamp within the meaning of the term ""trading stamps"" in
Section 369(2)  of the Criminal Code ?

Tritschler J.A. and Miller J.A. would have answered
""No"" to the questions.

The problem to be decided is whether the lucky green stamp
is a ""trading stamp"" within the meaning of the Code and more
particularly whether the definition of ""trading stamps"" in s. 322 (b)
is exhaustive. The history of the Criminal Code  dealing with trading
stamps shows that the first legislation by Parliament was enacted by c. 9 of
the Statutes of 1905, amending the 1892 Code by the introduction of ss. 526 (a)
and 526 (b). Until the amendments made to the Code, when it was revised
in 1953 (Statutes of Canada 1953–54, c. 51), the definition section read in
part:

""trading stamps"" includes, besides trading stamps
commonly so called, any form of cash receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket
or other device, designed or intended to be given to the purchaser of the goods
by the vendor…

[Page 142]

The definition section 322  inserted in the revision of
1953 deleted the underlined words. I can conceive of no object in deleting
these words except to make the present definition of trading stamps exhaustive.
Counsel for the appellant relies upon the statement of Lord Watson delivering
the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Dilworth v. New Zealand
Commissioner of Stamps3. He was there referring to ss. 2
and 3 of the Charitable Gifts Duties Exemption Act, 1883, as to which he
said:

Sect. 2 is, beyond all question, an interpretation clause,
and must have been intended by the Legislature to be taken into account in
construing the expression ""charitable devise or bequest"", as it
occurs in s. 3. It is not said in terms that ""charitable bequest""
shall mean one or other of the things which are enumerated, but that it shall
""include"" them. The word ""include"" is very generally used
in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases
occurring in the body of the statute; and when it is so used these words or
phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such things as they
signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the
interpretation clause declares that they shall include.

However, Lord Watson continues:

But the word ""include"" is susceptible of another
construction, which may become imperative, if the context of the Act is
sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to
the natural significance of the words or expressions defined. It may be
equivalent to ""mean and include"", and in that case it may afford an
exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must
invariably be attached to these words or expressions.

If authority were needed, the last part of Lord Watson's
statement shows that ""include"" may be an exhaustive definition and
for the reasons above stated that is the case in the present appeal.

Furthermore, a reference to the dictionaries mentioned by
counsel for the respondent and for the appellant shows that there is no general
accepted definition of ""trading stamps"". Certainly the stamp here in
question is not token currency; it is not used in the obtaining of goods; it is
not usable instead of money in procuring articles from the issuer of the
stamps, B.C. Premium Company. The stamp delivered to Hrycyk could be redeemed
only from the respondent from whom the tin of sardines had been purchased and
at the premises where it was sold; and the stamp shows upon its

[Page 143]

face the place where it was delivered and where it was
redeemable upon demand, and, in fact, where it was so redeemed.

In the Thomson case, the purchaser, Hrycyk, purchased a tin
of sardines from David Thomson, trading under the name and style of Niagara IGA
Grocery, and upon demand received one safety pin. Hrycyk had received a stamp
and a stamp saver book similar to the articles described in considering the
Loblaw appeal and the same or similar circumstances existed.

The appeals should be dismissed.

Fauteux
J.:—Respondents were charged under sub-section (2) of s. 369  Cr. C., 1953–1954,
c. 51:

(2) Every one who, being a merchant or dealer in goods, by
himself or his employee or agent, directly or indirectly gives or in any way
disposes of, or offers to give or in any way dispose of, trading stamps to a
person who purchases goods from him is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The expression ""trading stamps"" is defined as
follows in s. 322 (b):

322 (b) ""trading stamps"" includes any form of cash
receipt, receipt, coupon, premium ticket or other device, designed or intended
to be given to the purchaser of goods by the vendor thereof or on his behalf,
and to represent a discount on the price of the goods or a premium to the
purchaser thereof

(i) that may be redeemed

(A) by any person other than the
vendor, the person from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the
manufacturer of the goods,

(B) by the vendor, the person
from whom the vendor purchased the goods, or the manufacturer of the goods in
cash or in goods that are not his property in whole or in part, or

(C) by the vendor elsewhere than
in the premises where the goods are purchased; or

(ii) that does not show upon its
face the place where it is delivered and the merchantable value thereof; or

(iii) that may not be redeemed upon
demand at any time,

but an offer, endorsed by the manufacturer upon a wrapper or
container in which goods are sold, of a premium or reward for the return of
that wrapper or container to the manufacturer is not a trading stamp.

In essence, the question is whether this definition of
trading stamps is exhaustive, or whether, as contended for by both appellants,
it contemplates a class of trading stamps other than the one as to which
specifications are given.

[Page 144]

The word ""includes"", appearing in the first line
of the definition is, in the context, exclusively related to the words
""any form""; it is not referable to what the documents mentioned or
other devices must be as to substance in order to come within the prohibition.
While all-embracing or all-inclusive as to the forms which may possibly be
adopted for such documents or devices, the definition is exhaustive as to the
particular features required as constituent elements of the prohibited trading
stamps. The precise specifications as to substance, contained in (b)(i),.(ii)
and (iii) of the section as well as in the saving clause appearing at the very
end of it, do not justify the inference that Parliament intended, from the use
of the word ""includes"", to extend the definition in order to cover
any other documents or devices as to which it said nothing with respect to
features attending issuance, nature of benefit and redemption.

For the reasons given by the Chief Justice and the reasons
above, I would dismiss the appeals.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal law—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Conspiracy to traffic in drugs—Sentence of 12 years—New Criminal Code
coming into force during period of offence—Leave to appeal from sentence
sought—Whether jurisdiction to entertain appeal—Criminal Code ,

[Page 61]

Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, ss. 573, 1023—The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
259, s. 41.

The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in drugs
and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the
new Criminal Code , which came into force during the period of time
within which the offence was committed. His appeal against the conviction was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal and leave to appeal to this Court from that
judgment was refused. His subsequent appeal against the sentence was also
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and from that judgment he applied to this
Court for leave to appeal against the sentence on the question of law as to
whether s. 408(1) (d) was applicable, since, if it was not, the maximum
sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in the former Code, as found
in s. 573 , was 7 years. The Crown submitted that this Court was without
jurisdiction to grant leave. The appellant alleged an alteration of the prior
state of the law.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): This Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission
of an indictable offence.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The
question whether this Court had any jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal
has always been negatively answered prior to the coming into force of the new
Code. Goldhamer v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 290 and Parthenais v. The
King (1945) (unreported). An intent of Parliament to depart from this state
of the law could not be found either under the provisions of the new Code or
under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

As to the new Code. It is clear that no change has been made
as to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in
indictable offences. The distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure and lead to two distinct judgments. As to
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, the true meaning of the expression
""whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" in s. 597(1)(b)
must be ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an
appeal to the Court of Appeal. On these provisions, the ""conviction""
which the latter Court may affirm is a conviction within the narrow meaning of Goldhamer
v. The King. ""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in s.
597(1)(b), is the judgment against which an appeal is given under
s. 597(1); and, as nowhere but in the opening words of the section is an appeal
given, that judgment must be a judgment capable of coming within the language
of the opening words. Although the words ""in affirmance of the
conviction"", which were in s. 1024 of the former Code, do not appear in s.
597(1), they are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. No significance
could be attached to the fact that s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large
while under s. 597 the appeal is restricted to pure questions of law. Because
it may be said in certain cases that an applicant comes within the description
of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words of s. 597,
it does not follow that his application does so or in other words, that the
right given is a right to appeal against a conviction in the wider sense.

[Page 62]

As to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The
inconsistencies flowing from the interpretations put by the appellant on s. 41,
clearly indicate that it was never intended by Parliament that the right of
appeal given under this section would extend to indictable offences, as
distinguished from non indictable offences. This is supported by the fact that,
under the Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences
are dealt with in the appellate provisions related to appeal to this Court
under the Code. It is further supported by the clear contradiction which would
exist between the special appellate provisions under the Code and the general
appellate provisions under s. 41.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The
application falls within the literal meaning of the words in s. 597; and the
terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do not appear to require the Court to construe s.
597 in the limited sense contended for by the respondent. The case of Goldhamer
v. The King was distinguishable. One of the primary purposes of Parliament
in enacting s. 597 in its present form would be pro tanto thwarted if it
were held that this Court was without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of
law as to whether a sentence imposed was or was not authorized by statute. No
sufficient reason has been advanced for interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a
jurisdiction which appears to be conferred by the words of that section
construed in their ordinary and literal meaning.

Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.
Reading s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act together
and as explanatory of each other, as should be done since they are in pari
materia, the word ""conviction"" in both sections should be read
""with a signification including the sentence"", giving thereby effect
to the apparent intention of Parliament that the jurisdiction of this Court in
criminal matters should be strictly limited to points of law and yet wide
enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation of the criminal law
throughout the country.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a sentence. Application refused,
Cartwright J. dissenting.

M. Robb, Q.C., for the appellant.

J. D. Hilton, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—This
is a motion for leave to appeal to this Court against a sentence, imposed by
the trial judge and subsequently confirmed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, on a conviction for an indictable offence.

Goldhar was indicted for having, in the city of Toronto and
elsewhere in the province of Ontario, between the 15th of March and the 6th of
August, 1955, conspired with

[Page 63]

others to commit the indictable offence of having in their
possession a drug for the purposes of trafficking. On this charge, he was found
guilty by a jury, on the 4th of May, 1956, and thereupon sentenced to twelve
years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code , 2-3 Elizabeth II, hereafter referred to as the new Code.

During the period of time, within which the offence charged
was committed, i.e. on the first day of April 1955, the new Code came into
force; and this fact gives rise to the question of law on which leave to appeal
is now sought. As formulated, on behalf of the applicant, the question is
whether s. 408(1)(d) of the new Code is applicable to the
conspiracy committed, since, if it is not, the maximum sentence for a
conspiracy not specifically named in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c.
36, is found under s. 573 of the said Statute, namely seven (7) years.

The point of law raised is undoubtedly one of substance and
may possibly, depending particularly of the evidence in the record, affect the
judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal, if leave is granted. However, the
primary and major question to be considered and determined is whether this
Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed
for the commission of an indictable offence.

That such a question has always been negatively answered,
prior to the coming into force of the new Code, is not open to question.

In Goldhamer v. His Majesty the King1, the appellant, having
been found guilty of a criminal offence, was sentenced to pay a fine of four
hundred dollars or to be imprisoned during three months in default of payment.
After the fine had been paid, the Attorney-General appealed against the
sentence, under s. 1013 Cr. C; and by a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal,
in addition to the fine, condemned the appellant to be imprisoned for a period
of six months. On a further appeal to this Court, it was decided that there was
no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal in the
matter of

[Page 64]

sentence, the right of appeal being restricted to an appeal
against the affirmance of a conviction. At the time of the decision of this
Court, the relevant part of s. 1024, under which the appeal purported to be
based, read as follows:

1024.—Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of
Appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in
writing has been served on the Attorney-General within fifteen days after such
affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of
Canada or a judge thereof.

It is pointed out, in the reasons for judgment of this
Court, that the word ""conviction"" in s. 1024 cannot perhaps be said
to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning, but can be capable of
being employed with the signification including the sentence. The majority,
however, felt compelled to ascribe to the word the less technical sense which
excludes the sentence as distinguished from the conviction. The sole reason for
this interpretation and the decision consequential thereto is exclusively
founded on the clear distinction made in s. 1013, for the purposes of appeal in
indictable matters, between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal
against a sentence. The appellant in that case did not question the
appropriateness of the measure of the sentence but challenged, as a matter of
law, the right of the provincial Court of Appeal to interfere with a sentence
which had already been satisfied when the appeal to that Court was taken by the
Attorney-General. The nature of the ground, however, is entirely foreign to the
ratio decidendi. It is the right of appeal itself which was found not to
have been given by Parliament, in the matter of sentence.

Some twenty years after this decision, again the question
arose in the case of Parthenais v. The King2. Parthenais had entered an
appeal in this Court against a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal which
had increased the sentence imposed upon him on a plea of guilty to the charge

[Page 65]

of an indictable offence. At that time, the matter was
governed by what was then s. 1023 Cr. C., the relevant part of which read as
follows:

1023. Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the
Court of Appeal.

The point of law, upon which there was a dissent, was
whether the Attorney-General,—who took a more serious view of the facts of the
case than did the Crown prosecutor, in first instance,—could appeal to the
Court of Appeal against a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty which had been
entered by the accused on the condition that the sentence, pre-agreed between
his counsel and counsel for the Crown, would be passed by the trial judge. The
distinction between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal against a
sentence, which had brought about the decision of this Court in Goldhamer,
supra, was still present in the appellate provisions related to appeals to
the provincial Courts. This Court followed the same course and, on the 2nd of
October, 1945, quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal against a sentence.

Such was the state of the law when the new Code was enacted
in 1954. The question is therefore whether an intent of Parliament to make such
a substantial departure from this state of the law, as would represent the
creation of a new right of appeal to this Court, can be found, as is suggested,
either under the relevant provisions of the new Code or under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act. In approaching the question, one must be mindful that a
legislature is not presumed to make any substantial alteration in the law
beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear
implication. This presumption against the implicit alteration of the law is
not, I think, of lesser moment where the new law, under which the alteration is
claimed, is of a nature such as that of the one here considered, to wit, a
revision of a Code.

The new Code. With respect to the appellate provisions
related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in indictable offences, it is clear
that no change has been made, in that,

[Page 66]

the distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure, and lead to two distinct judgments. With
respect to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada, the section of the new Code, relied on by counsel for the applicant as
a basis for his application and under which the alteration of the prior state
of the law is claimed, is s. 597(1)(b), which reads as follows:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

(a)..............................................................................................................................
………………………………………………………………………………………………

(b) on any question
of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within
twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for
special reasons, allow.

The opening words of that section make it equally clear that
the right of appeal to this Court is given to one who is (i) a person who is
convicted of an indictable offence and (ii) whose conviction is affirmed by the
Court of Appeal. The true meaning of the expression, in (ii), ""whose
conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" must, of necessity, be
ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an appeal to
the Court of Appeal. And again, on these provisions, the
""conviction"", which the latter Court may affirm, is a conviction
within the narrow meaning ascribed by this Court in Goldhamer, supra. If,
contrary to that decision, the word was here given the wider sense which
includes the sentence, it would follow that one ""whose sentence is affirmed
by the Court of Appeal"" would have a right of appeal to this Court,
while one, whose sentence is not affirmed but increased by the Court of Appeal,
would not.

Adverting now to the provisions of (a) and (b)
of s. 597(1). These provisions are related to the right of appeal given under
the opening words. In (a), they restrict the right of appeal to
questions of law. And, in (b), they condition the exercise of the
right to the obtention of a leave and prescribe the delay within which, after
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced"", such leave must be
granted.

[Page 67]

""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in (b),
is the judgment against which an appeal is given under s. 597(1); and, as
nowhere, but in the opening words thereof, is an appeal given, ""the
judgment appealed from"" must be a judgment capable of coming within the
language of the opening words. On this language and for the reasons just
mentioned, such a judgment can only be a judgment in affirmance of a conviction
and not related to the matter of sentence.

Having considered the following points advanced in support
of the application, I must say, with deference, that I am unable to find that
they are valid.

Reference is made and significance is attached to two points
of difference emerging from a comparison of s. 1024, under which Goldhamer was
decided, with s. 597(1) of the new Code. The first is that the words ""in
affirmance of the conviction"", which were in the former section, do not
appear in the latter. In my view and for the reasons just mentioned, these
words are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. The second point is that
s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large while under s. 597, the appeal is
restricted to pure questions of law. The range or nature of the questions
raised in support of an appeal is foreign to the ratio decidendi in Goldhamer.
Furthermore, when the decision in that case was, twenty years later,
followed in Parthenais, the appeal to this Court was then, under the
relevant section, s. 1023, as it is to-day under s. 597(1), restricted to
questions of law.

It is then sought to ascribe to the word
""judgment"" in the phrase ""the judgment appealed from is
pronounced"", the usual meaning given to the word in a law dictionary.
This, I think, one is precluded to do for, in the context of s. 597, and in the
light of the other sections of the Code to which this particular section is
inextricably related, a judgment as to conviction and a judgment as to sentence
are, for the purposes of appeal, two separate judgments, each having a distinct
technical meaning under the Code.

It is also suggested that the applicant having been
convicted of an indictable offence and his conviction having been affirmed by
the Court of Appeal,—as, in fact, it was finally, prior to the launching of his
appeal to that Court, against the sentence,—his application falls within the
literal

[Page 68]

meaning of s. 597(1) (b). While, because of these
circumstances, it may be said that the applicant comes within the
description of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words
of the section, it does not follow that the application he makes does
so, or that, in other words, the right given to such a person is a right of
appeal against a conviction in the wider sense, as distinguished from a
conviction in the narrow technical sense given in Goldhamer. The premise
upon which this suggestion is predicated has no relevancy to the nature of the
right of appeal which is given under the section. It may also be added that, if
the interpretation contended for were accepted, in the result, Parliament would
have given a right of appeal against sentence to a person coming within the
language of the opening words of the section but would have refused a similar
right to a person who, having appealed to the Court of Appeal only against his
sentence, and not against his conviction, could never possibly come within that
language; for the Court of Appeal cannot affirm an unappealed conviction.

Finally, it is said that in enacting s. 597, in its present
form, one must find an apparent intention of Parliament to ensure uniformity in
the interpretation of criminal law throughout Canada and that such a purpose
would be, pro tanto, thwarted, if we were to hold that we are without
jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law as to whether a sentence imposed
is or is not authorized by a statute. With respect to sentence, as
distinguished from conviction, I am quite unable, for the reasons above
indicated, to find such an intention of Parliament in s. 597. It also appears
that such an intent is negatived by the other appellate provisions related to
appeals to this Court. Under these appellate provisions, the right of appeal,
given to the Attorney-General, namely in s. 598, does not include the right to
appeal in the matter of sentence. For the implementation of this alleged intent
and purpose of Parliament, it is no less essential that a right, similar to the
one contended for on behalf of the applicant, be given to the Attorney-General;
but it has not been given.

[Page 69]

For these reasons, I am clearly of the view that nowhere in
the relevant provisions of the new Code, did Parliament indicate, either in
express terms or by clear implication, any intent to alter the prior state of
the law, under which there is no appeal to this Court in the matter of
sentence.

Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The relevant
parts of that section read as follows:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

(2) Leave to appeal under this section may be granted during
the period fixed by section 64 or within thirty days thereafter or within such
further extended time as the Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after
the expiry of the said thirty days fix or allow.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

To support applicant's contention that s. 41 confers
jurisdiction to this Court to entertain appeals in matters of sentence, imposed
in respect of indictable offences, the provisions of subsection (3) are assumed
to be subordinated to those of subsection (1)—in that, the latter states the
principle and the former, the exception—; and, on that assumption, the
following interpretation is given.

If matters of sentence are held to come within the language
of subsection (3), then, by force of the latter, they are excepted from the
operation of subsection (1); and, for this reason alone, this Court has no
jurisdiction.

If, on the contrary, matters of sentence are held not to
come within the language of subsection (3), then, not being excepted from the
operation of subsection (1), there is jurisdiction in this Court.

In both alternatives, however, this interpretation leads to
inconsistencies.

In the first alternative, while a judgment affirming a
sentence would be excepted from the operation of subsection (1) by force of
subsection (3), there are no words in the latter capable of excepting a
judgment increasing the

[Page 70]

sentence. And, in the result, this Court would have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal when the sentence has been increased, but
would be without jurisdiction when it has been affirmed; and this, even if in
either case the question raised in support of the appeal be whether the
sentence is authorized or not by statute.

In the second alternative where, on the interpretation of
subsection (3), this Court would have jurisdiction in the matter of sentence,
the following inconsistencies would ensue. Contrary to what is the situation
with respect to every authorized appeal to this Court in criminal matters, the
appeal against sentence under s. 41 would not be restricted to pure questions
of law but would extend to questions of mixed law and facts and to pure
questions of fact. In addition, the delay within which leave to appeal must be
granted, being determined by subsection (2), would be, in the matter, far in
excess of the delay prescribed for the proper administration of justice in
criminal matters, for the obtention of leave to appeal to this Court against a
conviction or an acquittal.

I cannot think that Parliament ever intended or even
contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of these
interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never
intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend
to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable offences.

This view is supported by the fact that, under the Criminal
Code , the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences are,
contrary to what is the case with respect to non indictable offences, dealt
with in the appellate provisions related to appeals to this Court under the
Code.

It is further supported by the clear contradiction which
would exist, on the view that Parliament intended to include indictable
offences in s. 41, between the special appellate provisions under the Code and
the general appellate provisions under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

Parliament is presumed to be consistent with itself and the
language of every Act must be construed as far as possible in accordance with
the terms of every other statute

[Page 71]

which it does not in express terms modify in a way avoiding
contradictions. It has been indicated above that, if s. 597 was interpreted as
giving a right of appeal as to sentences, inconsistencies would result and
that, on the contrary interpretation, there would not be any, the state of the
law remaining what it was prior to the enactment of the new Code. And it has
also been pointed out that inconsistencies would flow from the suggested
interpretation of s. 41. In these views, one cannot find, either under the Code
or under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, the explicit language required
to indicate an intent of Parliament to alter the prior state of the law as to
appeals to this Court in the matter of sentence imposed in respect of
indictable offences.

With great deference, I find it impossible to reconcile the
two Acts by interpreting the word ""conviction"" in both subsections
41(3) and 597(1) (b) as including sentence in indictable offences, for
each one of the subsections cannot be so interpreted without leading to
inconsistencies.

Under the former Code, appeals against sentence have always
been left to the final determination of the provincial Courts and there is
nothing, under the new Code or s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, indicating
a change of policy in the matter, with respect to indictable offences.

This Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the present
application which I would dismiss.

This being a matter of jurisdiction, all the Members of the
Court have been consulted and I am requested by the Court to say that all,
excepting our brother Cartwright, are in agreement with these reasons.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):—This is an application for leave to appeal to this Court
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced on May 29, 1959,
dismissing the applicant's appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by His
Honour Judge Macdonell on May 4, 1956. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was
brought pursuant to an order of that Court made on April 29, 1959, extending
the time for applying for leave to appeal and granting leave to appeal against
the sentence mentioned.

[Page 72]

On April 27, 1956, the accused was convicted before His
Honour Judge Macdonell at the sittings of the Court of General Sessions of the
Peace for the County of York on the charge that:

Jacob Rosenblat, Jack Goldhar (the applicant), Leonuell
Joseph Craig and Hannelore Rosenblum, at the City of Toronto, in the County of
York, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, between the 15th day of March
and the 6th day of August, in the year 1955, unlawfully did conspire together,
the one with the other or others of them and persons unknown, to commit the
indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit,
diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the Criminal Code .

On May 4, 1956, His Honour Judge Macdonell sentenced the
applicant to twelve years' imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary.

An appeal against this conviction (but not against the
sentence imposed) was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario3 and was dismissed on February 13,
1957; leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment was refused4 on May 1, 1957.

The sentence of twelve years was imposed pursuant to s.
408(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , as enacted by 2-3
Elizabeth II, c. 51, which came into force on April 1, 1955, and is referred to
in these reasons as ""the new code"". Section 408  reads in part as
follows:

408(1) Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the
following provisions apply in respect of conspiracy, namely,

* * *

(d) every one who conspires with any one to
commit an indictable offence not provided for in paragraph (a), (b)
or (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to the same
punishment as that to which an accused who is guilty of that offence would,
upon conviction, be liable.

The maximum term of imprisonment for the indictable offence
of having possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking is fourteen
years, as provided by s. 4(3) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act which
section came into force on June 10, 1954.

Under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36,
hereinafter referred to as ""the old code"", the maximum term of
imprisonment which could have been imposed upon the

[Page 73]

applicant for the offence of which he was convicted would
have been seven years, as provided by s. 573 of the old Code which reads as
follows:

573. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for,
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence.

The question of law on which leave to appeal to this Court
is sought is stated in the notice of motion as follows:

Whether Section 408(1)(d) of The Criminal Code 
1953-1954, Ch. 51 is applicable to the conspiracy committed, since if it is not
the maximum sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in The Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, Ch. 36, is found under Section 573 of the said Statute,
namely seven (7) years.

On the merits, it is sufficient, for purposes of this
motion, to say that the ground of appeal sought to be raised is, in my opinion,
one of substance and difficulty; its importance is obvious; if the applicant's
contention is upheld he will have been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in
excess of the maximum term permitted by law.

Counsel for the respondent submits that we are without
jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
dismissing an appeal against the sentence passed by the trial Court.

Counsel for the applicant bases his application on s.
597(1)(b) of the new Code which reads:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

* * *

(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal
is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the
judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the
Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

It will be observed that this application falls within the
literal meaning of the words quoted. The applicant is a person who has been
convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed by the
Court of Appeal and he seeks leave to appeal to this Court on a question of
law. It is important to observe that the present section does not say ""may
appeal against the affirmance of such conviction"" as did its
predecessor. It is contended for the

[Page 74]

respondent, however, that other provisions of the Code, the
history of the legislation and the jurisprudence dealing with it require us to
construe s. 597 as giving a convicted person a conditional right of appeal
against his conviction only and not against his sentence. It is pointed out
that s. 583 which confers upon a person convicted of an indictable offence the
right of appeal to the Court of Appeal distinguishes between (a) an appeal
against conviction and (b) an appeal against sentence, and that this
distinction is maintained in sections 592 and 593 the former of which sets out
the powers of the Court of Appeal on an appeal against conviction and the
latter the powers on an appeal against sentence.

The respondent also relies on the decision of this Court in Goldhamer
v. The King5.
In that case the appellant had been found guilty of an indictable offence
and sentenced by the trial court to pay a fine of $400 and in default of
payment thereof to be imprisoned for six months; he immediately paid the fine;
the Attorney-General of Quebec appealed to the Court of King's Bench under s.
1013  of the Criminal Code  and that Court increased the sentence by
adding thereto a term of imprisonment for six months; Bernier J. dissented but
gave no reasons for his dissent. The appellant thereupon appealed to this
Court. The question of jurisdiction was raised by the Court in the course of
the argument. Judgment was reserved and the appeal was in due course dismissed.
Duff J., as he then was, Mignault J. and Malouin J. were all of opinion that
there was no right of appeal and dismissed the appeal on that ground. Idington
J. was doubtful as to the Court's jurisdiction but thought that, in any event,
the appeal should be dismissed on the merits. He said in part at p. 292:

I cannot therefore confidently assert and hold that there is
no appeal possible under such circumstances as involved herein.

Maclean J. simply concurred in the dismissal of the
appeal. The ratio of the majority is found in the reasons of Duff J. at p. 293:

As my brother Idington points out, the word ""conviction""
cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive
meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification including

[Page 75]

the sentence. Section 1013  does, however, I think,
distinguish very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for the
purposes of appeal, and the Act of 13–14 Geo. V., by which the present section
was brought into force, made no change in section 1024. Accordingly, I think
the word ""conviction' in the last mentioned section should be read in its
less technical sense, and consequently that there is no right of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an
appeal under subsection (2) of section 1013 .

and in the reasons of Mignault J. (with whom Malouin J.
agreed) at pages 293 and 294:

Our jurisdiction is governed by article 1024  of the Criminal
Code , which states, with a proviso which need not be mentioned here, that any
person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed
on an appeal taken under article 1013 , may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada against the affirmance of such conviction.

As now amended, article 1013  gives a right of appeal against
a conviction, and against a sentence pronounced by the trial court against a
person convicted on indictment. Article 1024  was not amended by the 1923
statute and under it the right of appeal is restricted to an appeal against the
affirmance of the conviction. Reading it with article 1013 , as amended, the
appeal from the sentence under paragraph 2 of article 1013  cannot be brought
before this Court.

When Goldhamer was decided the sections referred to
in the passages quoted, so far as relevant, read as follows:

1013 (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal to the
court of appeal against his conviction—

(a) on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone; and

(b) with leave of the
court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that it is a fit
case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact
alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and

(c) with leave of the
court of appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal.

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney
General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave of a judge
of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the
trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

* * *

1024. Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the court of
appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless

[Page 76]

notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney
General within fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may
be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

(2) The Supreme Court of Canada shall make such rule or
order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new
trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the
justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary rules and
orders for carrying such rule or order into effect.

The section now in force which corresponds with s. 1013 
quoted above is s. 583 of the new Code reading as follows:

583. A person who is convicted by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction

(i) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of law alone,

(ii) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact, with
leave of the court of appeal or upon the certificate of the trial judge that
the case is a proper case for appeal, or

(iii) on any ground of appeal not
mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) that appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal, with leave of the court of appeal; or

(b) against the sentence passed by the trial
court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that
sentence is one fixed by law.

For the purposes of the problem before us the differences in
wording between this section and s. 1013  are not significant.

When, however, s. 597 of the new Code is compared with s.
1024  under which Goldhamer was decided it will be observed that there
are the following points of difference; (i) as pointed out above, the words in
s. 1024  ""against the affirmance of such conviction"" have disappeared;
(ii) while under s. 1024  the appeal to this Court was at large, provided there
was a dissent in the Court below, the rights of appeal given by s. 597 are
restricted to questions of law; (iii) under s. 1024  the time for appealing ran
from ""such affirmance"" but under s. 597 it runs from the day when
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced""; the usual meaning of the
word ""judgment"" in criminal matters is, in my opinion, correctly
stated in the Dictionary of English Law by Earl Jowitt (1959) at p. 1025:

In criminal proceedings, the judgment is the sentence of the
court on the verdict of the jury, or on the prisoner pleading guilty to the
indictment. Where the jury acquits the prisoner, the judgment is that

[Page 77]

he be discharged; if he pleads guilty or is convicted, the
judgment declares the punishment which he has to suffer, e.g., death,
imprisonment, fine, etc.

These three differences appear to me to be sufficiently
substantial to prevent the decision in Goldhamer being regarded as
decisive of the question before us.

I have already indicated my view that this application falls
within the literal wording of s. 597; and the terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do
not appear to me to require us to construe s. 597 in the limited sense
contended for on behalf of the respondent.

If the meaning of the words used were ambiguous it would be
proper to consider the apparent intention of Parliament in enacting s. 597 in
its present form, as appearing from the history of the legislation. One of the
primary purposes appears to me to have been to confer upon this Court a
jurisdiction, to determine points of law arising in cases of indictable
offences, wide enough to ensure uniformity in the interpretation of the
criminal law throughout Canada. That purpose would be pro tanto thwarted
if we were to hold we are without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law
as to whether a sentence imposed is or is not authorized by statute.

In my opinion no sufficient reason has been advanced for
interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a jurisdiction which appears to me to be
conferred upon the Court by the words of that section construed in their
ordinary and literal meaning.

There is another line of reasoning which leads me to the
same conclusion. Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act is in pari
materia with s. 597 of the new Code. Both sections deal with the
jurisdiction of this Court to grant leave to appeal from decisions of
provincial Courts.

In Rex v. Loxdale6,
Lord Mansfield said:

Where there are different statutes in pari materia though
made at different times, or even expired, and not referring to each other, they
shall be taken and construed together, as one system, and as explanatory
of each other.

[Page 78]

Section 597 of the Code has already been quoted.
Subsections (1) and (3) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act read as
follows:

41 (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

* * *

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

The words of subs. (1) unless they are cut down by the
opening phrase, ""Subject to subsection (3)"", are obviously wide
enough to confer jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal affirming the sentence of 12 years' imprisonment passed upon
the applicant; it is a judgment, and indeed a final judgment, of the highest
court of final resort in the province in which judgment can be had in the
particular case, for ""judgment"" is defined in s. 2(d) as
follows:

(d) ""judgment"", when used with reference to
the court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree,
decretal order or sentence thereof;

If the words in subs. (3) ""the judgment of any court …
affirming a conviction … of an indictable offence"" are to be interpreted
as having the limited meaning ""affirming a verdict or finding of guilt
excluding the sentence imposed"" and not, to use the words of Duff J.,
quoted above, ""with a signification including the sentence"", it would
follow that the jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from sentence is not
excluded by the words of subs. (3) from the wide power given by subs. (1). From
this in turn it would follow that under subs. (1) this Court would have
jurisdiction to give leave to appeal from a sentence and such an appeal would
not be restricted to questions of law. It appears to me extremely unlikely that
Parliament intended this result; it

[Page 79]

can be avoided by construing the words ""the judgment of
any court … affirming a conviction … of an indictable offence"" so as to
include the affirmation of the sentence.

When s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act are read together it is my opinion that the word ""conviction""
in both sections should be read ""with a signification including the
sentence"" which construction gives effect to the apparent intention of
Parliament that our jurisdiction in criminal matters should be strictly limited
to points of law and yet wide enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation
of the criminal law throughout Canada.

It may be observed in passing that cases in which a sentence
can be questioned on a pure point of law are likely to be few and far between.

Having concluded that we have jurisdiction, I would, for the
reasons mentioned earlier, grant leave to appeal on the ground set out in the
notice of motion.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Narcotic drugs—Charge of
trafficking—Evidence of association with convicted drug addict—Alleged
conspiracy by police against accused—Whether acquittal on same facts of charge
of conspiracy to traffic raises question of res judicata—The Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, s. 4, as re-enacted by 1953-54, c. 38.

The accused, who had previously been
acquitted on the same facts on a charge of conspiracy to commit the same
indictable offence, was convicted on the substantive charge of being in
possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking. This conviction came at a
new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal. The conviction was affirmed by the
Court of Appeal, and the accused was granted leave by this Court to appeal on
six grounds.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As held by the Court of
Appeal, there was no violation at the trial of the principle that the
prosecution cannot attack initially the character of the accused and that he is
to be tried upon the evidence pertaining to the crime with which he is charged.

[Page 187]

2. The evidence which the accused sought to
introduce for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witnesses, was
not properly admissible. The accused wanted to show a conspiracy on the part of
the narcotic squad to prepare false reports and give false evidence against
him. It was proposed to lead evidence that two other persons, at other
hearings, had given inaccurate evidence, on the basis that such evidence would
be admissible because they were members of the same police squad as the
witnesses in this case and were “acting in concert” together. This was proposed
to be done by putting in evidence of a transcript of their testimony at the
other hearings.

3. The crown was under no duty to call these
two officers as they were not witnesses to the important incidents related to
this case. Consequently, there was no necessity for the trial judge, in
instructing the jury, to comment upon the fact that they had not been called.

4. There was no substance to the contention
that the trial judge had failed adequately to present to the jury the theory of
the defence.

5. The submission that it was wrong to permit
the Crown to adduce evidence as to the movements of F (who had been seen
talking to the accused on the day of the offence) in the absence of the
accused, and as to F’s addiction to drugs and his previous convictions for
narcotic offences, could not be maintained. That evidence was relevant to the
charge of trafficking which was laid under s. 4(3) (b) of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. The clear purpose of s. 4(4) of the Act is that once
there has been a finding of possession the onus then rests upon the accused to
prove that he was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. This cannot
preclude the Crown from bringing evidence in its case in chief to establish the
purpose of trafficking, nor can defence counsel preclude the leading of such
evidence merely by stating, as was done in this case, that the defence will be
that the accused was not in possession of the drug.

6. The accused contended that the acquittal
on the conspiracy charge must mean that the verdict resulted from a finding
that he was not in possession of the drug, that there was res judicata in
respect of the substantive charge and that he should have been permitted to
adduce evidence of the acquittal. That contention could not be entertained. The
essence of the charge of conspiracy is the agreement for that purpose. The
verdict of innocence only established his innocence in respect of the
conspiracy, and not that he was found not to be in possession. The principle of
res judicata enunciated in Sambasivam v. The Public Prosecutor,
Federation of Malaya, [1950] A.C. 458 at 479, only estops the Crown in the
later proceedings from questioning that which was in substance the ratio of and
fundamental to the decision of the earlier proceedings. The acquittal in the
earlier trial was not relevant to the charge which was the subject-matter of
this case and was not admissible in evidence.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: It was the duty of the trial judge to admit the evidence
related to the acquittal of the accused on the charge of conspiracy and to give
to the jury an unequivocal direction that in approaching the question of his
guilt or innocence they must give due weight to the facts thus conclusively
established. These facts were that during the period which included the date of
the offence of which the accused was convicted he was not engaged in a
conspiracy with

[Page 188]

one J or others to have possession of a drug
for the purpose of trafficking; their relevance could not be doubted as the
Crown had elicited evidence tending to show that the appellant was working in a
conspiracy with J to have a drug for the purpose mentioned. The matter fell
within the reasoning of the Sambasivam case. If an acquittal necessarily
involves a finding of fact, which fact would be an item of circumstantial
evidence relevant to the question of guilt or innocence on the subsequent trial
on another charge of the person acquitted, that fact may be proved in the
last-mentioned trial, and is conclusively established by proof of the
acquittal. It was of no significance that in cross-examination, the accused
volunteered the information that he had been acquitted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming the
conviction of the accused. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

M. Robb, Q.C., and C. Thomson, for the
appellant.

J.D. Hilton, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[2] affirming the conviction
of the appellant on a charge of being in possession of heroin for the purpose
of trafficking. The conviction was made following a trial by jury on November
18, 1958.

The date of the offence alleged was September 18, 1955. The appellant was tried in April,
1957, on a charge of conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of having
possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking, and was acquitted. He was
tried before a jury on the substantive charge in October, 1957, and was
convicted, but, on appeal, the Court of Appeal[3]
ordered a new trial, following which the trial in question in these proceedings
was held.

The evidence on behalf of the Crown was mainly
that of two RCMP officers, Corporal Macauley and Constable Yurkiw. Briefly
summarizedy, this was that at about 6.55 p.m. on September 18, 1955, the appellant was
observed to make a throwing motion near a hydro pole on Dupont Street in Toronto and then to depart. The two officers then discovered a cigarette
package near the pole, which contained

[Page 189]

fifty capsules of heroin. Some of these were
removed and then, after the package had been initialled, it was replaced near
the pole. As Yurkiw was about to replace the package they saw one Fillmore, a
convicted drug addict, walk past the pole.

Later, at about 8.40 p.m., the appellant was
seen to cross Dupont Street to
the pole and make a motion as though picking something up. The base of the pole
was subsequently searched and it was found that the package was gone. The
police officers then saw the appellant and Fillmore together about 240 feet
away.

Later they saw the appellant’s ear stalled in
the middle of the street on Lansdowne Avenue, about one block south of Dupont Street, and being pushed by one Cook into a parking lot. The appellant
then got into Cook’s car and drove away, following which Macauley and Yurkiw
found the appellant’s car on the parking lot.

Subsequently, at about 9.30 p.m., the cigarette package, containing no
narcotics, was found on the lawn of a house about six to eight feet from the
place where the appellant and Fillmore had been seen earlier standing together.

Evidence was given by Constable Webster of the
RCMP that at about 11.30 p.m. he, in company with Corporal LaBrash, saw the
appellant and one Fred Walsh leave 180 Lansdowne Avenue, go to a parking lot and put something into the gas tank of the
appellant’s car. The appellant then drove off.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on six
grounds of appeal, each of which was fully argued.

The first ground alleged was that the Crown led
evidence and cross-examined the appellant and other witnesses for the defence
to show the appellant’s association with known criminals, including persons
with previous convictions for narcotic offences, and to show that the appellant
had committed other criminal acts of which he had not been convicted. It was
contended that the Crown had generally attacked the appellant’s character, both
before and while he was in the witness box, and had sought to have it inferred
that, by reason of his alleged associations with persons of bad character, he
was likely to have committed the offence charged.

[Page 190]

With respect to this point, I agree with what
has been said concerning it in the judgment of the Court of Appeal and am of
the opinion that it fails.

The second point argued was that counsel for the
appellant had been prevented from adducing the most substantial supporting
aspects of his defence; namely, that a small group of officers, acting in
concert, were engaged in submitting false reports and preparing false evidence
to implicate the appellant in the traffic of drugs during the period
surrounding September 18, 1955.

The evidence which counsel for the appellant
sought to adduce was taken on the voir dire, but was not given before the jury.
In brief, it was that Constable Tomalty of the RCMP, at the preliminary
hearing, and Corporal LaBrash of the RCMP, at the conspiracy trial, had
testified to having seen the appellant in the company of one Fred Walsh in the
early hours of October 19, 1955, whereas, in fact, the evidence was that
Walsh was in custody at the No. 8 Police Station in Toronto, sometimes referred
to as the Pape Avenue Station, at the time in question.

The contention of the appellant was that the
Narcotic Squad of the RCMP in Toronto, consisting of LaBrash, Macauley,
Tomalty, Yurkiw and Webster, were “acting in concert” to prepare false reports
and give false evidence concerning the appellant and that the evidence above
referred to should have been admitted as being relevant to the establishment of
a conspiracy among them for that purpose.

It is true that on a charge of conspiracy the
acts and declarations of each conspirator in furtherance of the common object
are admissible in evidence as against the rest. The same rule has been applied in
civil cases. The rule is, however, one which determines the admissibility of
evidence as against a person who is a party to legal proceedings.

In the present case what is sought to be done is
to introduce evidence of this kind, not as against a person charged with
conspiracy or sued in relation to a conspiracy, but in respect of a witness
who, it is alleged, was a party to a conspiracy not the subject of these
proceedings. In the one case the conspiracy is in issue as a part of the case
and the rule determines the kind of evidence which may be adduced

[Page 191]

in relation to that issue. In the present case
it is proposed to lead such evidence for the collateral purpose of attacking
the credibility of a witness.

Facts to establish bias on the part of a witness
may be elicited on cross-examination and, if denied, may be independently
proved. It was open to the defence to cross-examine Macauley and Yurkiw as to
whether they were parties to a conspiracy which sought wrongfully to obtain a
conviction against the appellant. If denied, evidence which directly implicated
either of them as being parties to a conspiracy for that purpose would be
relevant because this would relate directly to the establishing of bias. But
the evidence sought to be introduced here is not evidence of that kind. It was
proposed to lead evidence that two other persons, at other hearings, had given
inaccurate evidence, on the basis that such evidence would be admissible
because they were members of the same RCMP squad as the witnesses who gave
evidence in this case and were “acting in concert” together. This was proposed
to be done, not by calling these two persons themselves, but by putting in
evidence of a transcript of their testimony at the other hearings. In my
opinion this is not evidence which is properly admissible for the purpose of
attacking the credibility of the witnesses in this case.

The third ground of appeal was that the Crown
did not call as a witness either LaBrash or Tomalty and that the learned trial
judge did not instruct the jury as to the inferences which they might draw from
this fact.

That counsel for the Crown was under no duty to
call either Tomalty or LaBrash is, I think, sufficiently established by the
decision of this Court in LeMay v. The King[4]. Neither LaBrash nor Tomalty was a witness to the important
incidents on Dupont Street on
the evening of September 18, 1955. Any evidence they could give related only to
collateral matters. This being so, I do not see why there was any necessity for
the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, to make any comment upon the
fact that they had not been called to give evidence.

[Page 192]

The fourth point submitted was that the learned
trial judge failed adequately to present to the jury the theory of the defence.
I agree with the Court of Appeal, that there is no substance to this
contention.

The fifth ground of appeal is that the Crown was
permitted to adduce evidence as to the movements of Fillmore in the absence of
the appellant and as to Fillmore’s addiction to drugs and his previous
convictions for narcotic offences.

The charge in this case was laid under s. 4(3) (b)
of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act of being in possession of heroin for
the purpose of trafficking. The evidence relating to Fillmore was relevant to
the question of trafficking. The appellant contended, however, that, because of
the provisions of subs. (4) of s. 4 of that Act and because it had been stated
by counsel for the defence, at the outset of the trial, that the defence would
be that the appellant was not in possession of the drug at the time and place
alleged, the Crown was, therefore, not entitled to lead the evidence regarding
Fillmore.

Subsection (4) of s. 4 provides as follows:

In any prosecution for an offence under
paragraph (b) of subsection (3), the court shall, unless the
accused pleads guilty to the charge, first make a finding as to whether or not
the accused was in possession of the drug; if the court finds that he was not
in possession of the drug, the court shall acquit him; if the court finds that
the accused was in possession of the drug, the court shall give the accused an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the drug for the
purpose of trafficking, and if the accused establishes that he was not in
possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be acquitted of
the offence as charged but shall, if the court finds that the accused was
guilty of an offence under subsection (1), be convicted under that
subsection and sentenced accordingly; and if the accused fails to
establish that he was not in possession of the drug for the purpose of
trafficking he shall be convicted of the offence as charged and sentenced
accordingly.

The clear purpose of this provision is that, in
the case of a charge of being in possession of a drug for the purpose of
trafficking, once there has been a finding of possession the onus then rests
upon the accused to prove that he was not in possession for the purpose of
trafficking. I do not see how this can preclude the Crown from bringing
evidence in its case in chief to establish the purpose of trafficking, or how
defence counsel can preclude the leading of such evidence

[Page 193]

merely by stating that his defence will be that
the accused was not in possession of the drugs. The Crown must establish its
case in respect of the charge laid. Subsection (4) of s. 4 assists the
Crown in proving its case once possession has been established, but I cannot
see how that subsection can serve to prevent the adducing of evidence
which is obviously relevant to the charge as laid.

The sixth point is that the appellant was not
permitted to adduce evidence of his previous acquittal on the charge of
conspiracy, although the circumstances and evidence upon which the conviction
was sought in the conspiracy trial included the incident upon which the
substantive charge was based. It was contended by the appellant that the
learned trial judge refused to allow the defence to rely on the findings of
fact encompassed by the acquittal in the conspiracy charge in so far as such
findings might be relevant in relation to the substantive charge of possession.

In fact, on cross-examination the appellant did
testify as to his acquittal on the conspiracy charge, but counsel for the
appellant was not permitted to lead evidence otherwise to prove that acquittal.
The learned trial judge was obviously following the decision of the Court of
Appeal made on the appeal which had been taken in the first trial and which
dealt with this specific matter[5].

Counsel for the appellant, on this phase of his
argument, relied upon the statement of the law regarding res judicata made
by Lord MacDermott, who delivered the reasons for the decision of the Privy
Council in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya[6], as follows:

The effect of a verdict of acquittal
pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is
not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again
for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and
conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the
adjudication. The maxim “Res judicata pro veritate accipitur” is no less
applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having
been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his
possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict
and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And
the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it
might be relevant in his defence. That it was not conclusive of his innocence
on the firearm charge is plain, but it undoubtedly reduced in some degree the
weight of

[Page 194]

the case against him, for at the first trial
the facts proved in support of one charge were clearly relevant to the other
having regard to the circumstances in which the ammunition and revolver were
found and the fact that they fitted each other.

In that case the accused had been tried on two
charges, under the Emergency Regulations, 1948, of carrying a firearm
and of being in possession of ammunition respectively. He was acquitted of the
second charge, but a new trial was ordered on the first one.

At the second trial a statement of the accused was
introduced which had not been in evidence at the first trial. If accepted as
the truth, it went to prove his guilt on the second charge, of which he had
been acquitted, as clearly as it would establish his guilt on the first charge.
The statement was admitted and no intimation was given to the assessors of the
fact that the accused had been acquitted on the second charge and was,
therefore, to be taken as innocent of that offence.

In view of these circumstances it was felt that
the acquittal of the appellant on the charge of being in possession of
ammunition was relevant to the consideration by the assessors in the second
trial of the effect of this statement. It might have been a ground for
excluding the statement in its entirety, because it could not have been severed
satisfactorily. The result of the omission to refer to the acquittal on the
second charge was that the Crown was enabled to rely upon the existence of
facts in respect of which there had already been a contrary finding in favour
of the accused.

The appellant does not contend that in every
case an acquittal on a charge of conspiracy must result in an acquittal on the
substantive charge in respect of the crime to which the alleged conspiracy
related. His argument is that in a case of the kind before us an accused could
only become in wrongful possession of narcotics as a result of a conspiracy
with somebody. Therefore, he contends that an acquittal on the conspiracy
charge must mean that the verdict of acquittal resulted from a finding that the
accused was not in possession of the drug. Consequently that finding is a bar
to a conviction in respect of the substantive offence.

[Page 195]

I do not accept the validity of this reasoning.
The conspiracy charge was in relation to an alleged conspiracy to be in
possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The essence of that charge
is the agreement for that purpose. The verdict of acquittal establishes, but
only establishes, innocence in respect of the conspiring. It does not establish
that the appellant was found not to be in possession of drugs. He could have
been in possession of them without being party to a conspiracy to have that
possession for the purpose of trafficking.

As I see it, the principle of res judicata enunciated
in the Sambasivam case only estops the Crown in the later legal
proceedings from questioning that which was in substance the ratio of and
fundamental to the decision in the earlier proceedings. The use of the
statement of the accused in that case involved an allegation against the
accused of guilt, in relation to the possession of ammunition, which had
already been decided in his favour. The acquittal of the appellant, on the
charge of having conspired with others to be in possession of drugs for the
purpose of trafficking, did not decide in his favour that he had not been in
possession of drugs on September 18, 1955. This being so, the acquittal in the
earlier trial was not relevant to the charge which was the subject-matter of
the present proceedings and was not admissible in evidence in those
proceedings.

For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion
that this appeal should be dismissed, but the time during which the appellant
has been confined in prison pending the determination of this appeal should
count as part of the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to his conviction.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The nature of
this appeal and the facts out of which it arises are stated in the reasons of
my brother Martland.

The notice of motion for leave to appeal to this
Court sought to raise six questions of law and leave was granted as to all of
them. I find it necessary, however, to deal with only the following two of
those questions:

2. Whether the learned trial judge erred in
law in preventing counsel for the applicant from adducing the most substantial
supporting aspects of his defence, namely that a small group of officers acting
in concert were

[Page 196]

engaged in submitting false reports and
preparing false evidence to implicate the accused in the traffic of drugs
during the period surrounding September 18th 1955, and whether the learned
trial judge erred in law in not adequately setting out to the jury the above
theory of the defence?

* * *

6. Whether the learned trial judge erred in
law in refusing to allow counsel for the applicant to adduce evidence of a
previous acquittal of the applicant on a charge of conspiring to possess
narcotic drugs for the purpose of trafficking, especially as evidence was led
by the Crown of the applicant’s association with Victor Jowett and certain
other persons named and persons unknown during the period under review, and
erred in law in not charging the jury that such verdict of acquittal was
binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the
adjudication with respect to all facts which must necessarily have been decided
in favour of the applicant in order that the first verdict could have been
reached?

I propose to deal first with the last-mentioned
point.

In September 1956 an indictment was preferred at
the sittings of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County of
York, count 1 of which read as follows:

EDWIN MCDONALD (the appellant) VICTOR
JOWETT, JOSEPH NICOLUCCI, NORMAN LABRASSEUR, SADIE MCINTOSH and FREDERICK
WALSH, in the year 1955, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, and
elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did conspire together, the one
with the other or others of them, and with Harry Ross and persons unknown, to
commit the indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit,
diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the Criminal Code .

Counts 2 to 5 inclusive charged Jowett,
Nicolucci, Walsh, McIntosh and LaBrasseur with having possession of the drug
mentioned for the purpose of trafficking on or about specified dates in the
year 1955.

Count 6 read as follows:

6. AND THE SAID JURORS FURTHER PRESENT that
the said Edwin McDonald, on or about the 18th day of September, in the year 1955,
at the said City of Toronto, unlawfully did have in his possession a drug, to
wit, diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to
Section 4(3) (b) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1952, Chapter 201, and amendments thereto.

In December 1956, Jowett, Nicolucci, LaBrasseur,
McIntosh and Walsh, were tried together on count number 1, before His Honour
Judge Forsyth and a jury and on December 12, 1956, Jowett and Nicolucci were
convicted and the other three were acquitted.

[Page 197]

In April, 1957, the appellant was tried on count
number 1, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury and, on April 17, 1957,
was acquitted.

In October 1957, the appellant was tried on
count number 6 before His Honour Judge Factor and a jury and, on October 24,
1957, was convicted of having possession of the drug mentioned for the purpose
of trafficking; on the following day he was sentenced to seven years’
imprisonment.

On March 3, 1958, the Court of Appeal[7] gave judgment quashing this conviction and
directing a new trial.

The new trial was held before His Honour Judge
Shea and a jury and resulted in a conviction on November 18, 1958. On the
following day the appellant was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. An appeal
was dismissed by the Court, of Appeal[8] on
April 29, 1959, and it is from that judgment that this appeal is brought.

In order to deal adequately with question 6, it
is necessary to say something as to the course of the trial. It should first be
mentioned that the indictment was not placed before the jury; they were given
only a copy of count 6.

In his opening address to the jury Crown counsel
said in part:

Now the evidence began and it involves, as
you heard from the charge, an incident on the 18th of September 1955, that is
quite a while ago, and that particular day, pursuant to their instructions, two
officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Corporal Macauley and Police
Constable Yurkiw, were proceeding, in the course of an investigation, on
Bloor St. in an easterly direction some time shortly after supper, I think
around 6.55. As they were proceeding easterly, at the corner of Dundas and
Bloor they were stopped for a stoplight and they saw an automobile which they
knew or believed was the automobile of the accused Edwin McDonald, which was a
red and black sedan, proceed in a northerly direction on Dundas and make a
sharp right hand turn to go east on Bloor. Now in relation to their
investigation they were interested in this automobile, so when the light
changed they took off after it.

After outlining the incidents on Dupont
St. in regard to the cigarette package containing capsules of heroin
described in the reasons of my brother Martland, Crown counsel continued:

The officers then went and got their car
and started to go up and down the area to see where they had gone, and a short
time later working down through these side streets got down to Bloor Street and
as they

[Page 198]

were coming in a westerly direction saw a
car of one Cook, who was known to them, go up Margueretta Street, made a
left hand turn in front of them and they went on past and went up Emerson
Avenue, up the laneway, came across the stop of Emerson Avenue ahead of the
Cook car and paused at the top and allowed the Cook car to pass them. I think
they stopped about at the corner of Dufferin and I forget the name of the
street, Wallace I believe, and allowed the car to pass them and they then
followed this car and it came up and stopped back of the McDonald car where it
had been left on the north side of Dupont. McDonald got out of Cook’s car, got
into his own car and drove it in a westerly direction on Dupont to Lansdowne.

* * *

McDonald got again into the Cook car and
proceeded into a house farther down Lansdowne Avenue. Later that night, others
observed, and the evidence will be how they came back with other persons
known to the Police and picked up the McDonald car later on.

Counsel for the appellant submits that the
effect of these passages and particularly the words I have italicized would be
to convey to the jury that prior to the date of the alleged offence the
activities of the appellant and “others known to the police’’ were the subject
of a continuing investigation by the police, with the natural inference that
the appellant and these others were working in association.

The first witness called by the Crown was
Sergeant Gove who gave evidence as to the taking of certain photographs and as
to the examination he had made of the cigarette package. In cross-examination,
in the absence of the jury, counsel for the appellant put the following
questions to Sergeant Gove:

Q. Now, Sergeant Gove, were you present at
the trial of this same Edwin McDonald at this same court room, in the Court of
General Sessions of the Peace in the County of York, held at Toronto, on the
8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th and 17th days of April 1957 and did you
give evidence at that trial on that date?

* * *

Q. And the next question, Sergeant Gove,
is: was he, Edwin McDonald, there acquitted of a charge of conspiracy with Victor
Jowett, Joseph Nicolucci, Harry Ross and persons unknown that at the City of
Toronto, in the County of York, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, in
the year 1955 he did commit the indictable offence of having in their
possession a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an
indictable offence under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.

* * *

Q. And finally, Sergeant Gove, during that
trial did you give substantially the same evidence as you have given here with
reference to the taking of photographs at the general vicinity of Dupont and
Emerson Avenues, Toronto, on September the 19th and with respect to the
handling of a cigarette package with respect to fingerprints at some other
time?

[Page 199]

All these questions were objected to by Crown
counsel and were disallowed by the learned trial judge, who regarded himself as
bound to follow this course by the judgment of the Court of Appeal[9] on the appeal from the conviction before
His Honour Judge Factor.

In the examination-in-chief of Corporal Macauley
Crown counsel, referring to September 1955, brought out the following:

Q. And who was living at 58 South Kingsway,
Swansea, Ontario, at that time, to your knowledge?

A. The accused man Edwin McDonald and
another man known to me as Victor Jowett.

In the examination-in-chief of Constable Webster
Crown counsel brought out that the appellant had been seen at 58 South Kingsway
with Frederick Walsh.

The defence called a number of witnesses. Among
these was Mrs. Near, a sister of the appellant, who testified in chief
that Corporal Macauley had made a threat to the appellant some years prior to
the date of the alleged offence at a time when the appellant and his brother
Alex were living with her, the alleged threat being “I’ll get you yet”. In her
cross‑examination by Crown counsel the following appears:

Q. And where is Alex now?

A. Alex is living in Vancouver.

Q. Is that all you know about Alex, do you
not know—

A. I beg your pardon?

Q. Do you not know that he is in jail on
the West Coast at the moment?

A. No, I did not know that.

Q. You didn’t? On a narcotics charge?

A. No, I didn’t. He was here in July.

The defence called Mary Olive Lehman who was
living with the accused as his wife at the time of the alleged offence to prove
two things, (i) that he never went out without her on Sundays during a period
which included September, 1955, and (ii) that he never went out without wearing
a hat as he was sensitive about premature baldness. In her cross‑examination,
Crown counsel brought out the fact that at the date of the alleged offence she
and the appellant were

[Page 200]

living in the same house with Jowett and his
wife and that Jowett and the appellant were working together in taking bets on
horse-races. The cross-examination continued:

Q. Did you have, any knowledge at that time
of any other source of income of this man Jowett?

A. I did not—I heard that he had sold the
odd car, that he was a car dealer or something like that.

Q. But then you found out something else
about him. What was that?

A. Well I never found out anything until
his court case came out, that I heard anything about him.

Q. What did you find out?

A. Well that’s just what they said.

Q. What was that?

A. That he had something to do with
narcotics, I don’t know. I still don’t know actually what it was about.

Q. That came as quite a surprise to you?

A. Yes it did, because he seemed like a
very nice man to me.

This was the Jowett named in count 1 of the
indictment.

The effect of certain evidence given by police
officers called by the Crown was summarized as follows in the closing address
of Crown counsel to the jury:

And so much for all that my friend said in
an, hour and a half this morning in criticism of these officers. Why was the
arrest not made for four months? Staff-Sergeant Carson told you, the officers
told you. This was one facet in a larger investigation being carried on with
great difficulty by these officers in the interest of the public to stem the
flow of illicit heroin into our city. And it wasn’t important to pick up an individual
person who had a few “caps” but it was important, as you all know from your
general knowledge of Police activities and investigations to find out what was
the source, to get if they could the “top man”. And so they were instructed to
find out, not to arrest on that night but to find out where it was that
McDonald was getting his source of supply.

Following the cross-examination of the witness
Lehman and while she was still in the witness box defence counsel again, in the
absence of the jury, sought permission to prove the fact that the appellant had
been tried and acquitted on count 1. Crown counsel again objected and again the
learned trial judge refused to allow this proof.

In my opinion the evidence tendered should have
been received. It was legally admissible and was logically relevant to the
question of the guilt or innocence of the accused on count 6, the charge on
which he was being tried, for as between the Crown and the appellant his
acquittal on count 1 conclusively established the facts that foe was not on

[Page 201]

or about September 18, 1955, or at any time in
that year in conspiracy with Jowett or any of the other persons described in
count 1 to have in his possession a drug for the purpose of trafficking. In my
opinion it was the duty of the learned trial judge to admit the evidence and
having done so to give to the jury an unequivocal direction that in approaching
the question of the guilt or innocence of the appellant they must give due
weight to the facts thus conclusively established.

I agree with Mr. Robb’s submission that as
a matter of common sense it appears improbable, although not impossible, that
the appellant could have had the fifty capsules of heroin and dealt with them
as the officers testified he did unless he was engaged in a conspiracy such as
that of which he had been acquitted, and that therefore the fact that he was
not so engaged was relevant to the question which the jury were trying; but the
matter does not rest there; Crown counsel, as appears from what is set out
above as to the course of the trial, had elicited evidence having a tendency to
show or at least to suggest that the appellant was working in conspiracy with
Jowett and others, and the passage quoted from his closing address to the jury
pointed unmistakably in that direction.

In my opinion the question falls within the
reasoning contained in the passage from the Sambasivam case quoted by my
brother Martland and in the following further passage at p. 480 of the
report of that case:

The fact appears to be—and the Board must
judge of this from the record and the submissions of counsel who argued the
appeal—that the second trial ended without anything having been said or done to
inform the assessors that the appellant had been found not guilty of being in
possession of the ammunition and was to be taken as entirely innocent of that
offence. In fairness to the appellant that should have been made clear when the
statement had been put in evidence, if not before.

Applying this reasoning to the facts of the case
at bar it is my opinion that in fairness to the appellant the fact and the
effect of his acquittal should have been made clear to the jury when the Crown
had adduced evidence of his association with Jowett and of the latter’s
conviction on a narcotic charge, if not before.

[Page 202]

The governing principle is that it an acquittal
necessarily involves a finding of fact, which fact would be an item of
circumstantial evidence relevant to the question of guilt or innocence on the
subsequent trial on another charge of the person acquitted, that fact may be
proved in the last-mentioned trial, and is conclusively established by proof of
the acquittal.

It follows that, in my view, question no. 6,
quoted above, should be answered in the affirmative, and this is fatal to the
validity of the conviction.

I have not overlooked the circumstance mentioned
in the reasons of the Court of Appeal that the appellant, in the course of his
cross-examination, although not asked about it, volunteered the information
that he had been acquitted. In my opinion this is of no significance. The
appellant was entitled not only to have the fact of the acquittal properly
proved but also to have its effect clearly explained to the jury by the learned
trial judge in the manner I have indicated above. Counsel agree that, in
obedience to the ruling which the learned trial judge had made, defence counsel
made no reference to the acquittal in his address to the jury.

Having reached this conclusion it is not
strictly necessary for me to deal with question no. 2 but I wish to state
briefly the principles on which, in my view, it would fall to be decided if it
were necessary to express a final opinion upon it. It is clear that facts
showing a witness to be biased may be elicited on cross-examination or, if
denied, independently proved; see R. v. Shaw[10] and Attorney-General v. Hitch-cock[11]. Evidence showing that a witness was a
member of a conspiracy the object of which was to fabricate evidence against a
party would be admissible as it would be cogent evidence of bias. I see no
reason why in considering the admissibility of evidence tendered to prove a
witness to be a member of such a conspiracy the Court should not follow the
ordinary rule which is accurately stated in Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p.
98, as follows:

On charges of conspiracy, the acts and
declarations of each conspirator in furtherance of the common object are
admissible against the rest; and it is immaterial whether the existence of
the conspiracy, or the participation of the defendants be proved first,
though either element is nugatory without the other.

[Page 203]

Of course the witness is not on trial, but once
it is conceded that the question whether or not he is a participant in such an
alleged conspiracy may be inquired into I see no reason why the rules of
evidence which are applicable to both civil and criminal combinations would not
govern the admission of any evidence tendered.

The circumstance that where such evidence is
offered much time might be expended at a trial in inquiring into a collateral
issue would not afford a sufficient ground for refusing to receive it. To
decide whether in the case at bar the evidence tendered for the purpose of
showing bias and rejected by the learned trial judge was properly rejected
would require a critical examination of the record and as I have concluded that
the appeal succeeds on another ground I do not pursue this question further.

I would allow the appeal and quash the
conviction.

As the view of the majority of the Court is that
the appeal fails, nothing would be gained by my expressing an opinion as to
what further order should have been made had the conviction been quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION..

Criminal law—Bribery—Reward given to government employee
in connection with dealings with Government—Disposition of bribe money—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 102(1)(b), 581(d), 584(1)(b), 595, 630(1),
(2).

The accused was acquitted at a non-jury trial of the
indictable offence of bribery under s. 102(1)  (b) of the Criminal
Code . Subsequently, the trial judge issued an order directing the return to
the accused of the $400 bribe money, filed as exhibit in support of the charge.
On appeal by. the Crown, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of
acquittal, directed that a verdict of guilty be entered and that the bribe
money remain in Court until further order. The accused appealed to this Court
against the conviction and the order.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Curiam: The appeal against the conviction
failed. The accused had dealings of some kind with the Government and the fact
that a trap was set had no bearing on the commission of the offence.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Abbott and Martland JJ.: Section
630(2) of the Code, under which the order of the trial judge for the return of
the money was made, had no application. The trial judge had acquitted the
accused and had not found that an indictable offence had been committed by
someone else. Nor was his jurisdiction assisted by

[Page 111]

Rule 909(2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Alberta
respecting criminal appeals, since he did not make a special order as to the
custody or conditional release of any exhibit.

The submission that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction
because no question of law was involved as required by s. 584 of the Code, must
fail. The trial judge purported to act under s. 630(2), and in view. of ss.
581(1) (d) and 595, the Crown could, by virtue of the extended meaning
of ""sentence"", appeal under s. 584(1) (b) with leave. It
should be taken that such leave was granted, as the Court of Appeal proceeded
to deal with the matter.

Even if there were jurisdiction in this Court to hear an
appeal from an order carrying those reasons—that the money should remain in
Court until further order—into effect, and whether it be a separate order or
part of one setting aside the acquittal and finding the accused guilty, there
was no substance in the appeal.

Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: This Court was without
jurisdiction to deal with the order in relation to the bribe money. The question
involved was not one coming within the ambit of any of the Criminal Code  appellate
provisions related to appeals to this Court in indictable offences. Goldhar
v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate
Division1,
reversing a judgment of Primrose J. acquitting the accused. Appeal dismissed.

N. D. Maclean, Q.C., for the appellant.

H. J, Wilson, Q.C., and J. W.
Anderson, for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott and Martland JJ.
was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—This
is an appeal against a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Province of
Alberta2
setting aside the acquittal of the present appellant on a charge that on
or about April 16th, A.D. 1958 at Edmonton he gave to an employee of the
Government of Alberta a reward as consideration for an act in connection with
dealings with the said Government of Alberta, contrary to the provisions of the
Criminal Code  of Canada. The applicable provision of the Code is s.
102(1)  (b) reading as follows:

102. (1) Every one commits an offence who

…………………………………………………………………………………...............…….

(b) having dealings of any kind with the government,
pays a commission or reward to or confers an advantage or benefit of any kind
upon an employee or official of the government with which he deals, or to any
member of his family, or to any one for the benefit

[Page 112]

of the employee or official, with respect to those dealings,
unless he has the consent in writing of the head of the branch of government
with which he deals, the proof of which lies upon him;

I agree with the reasons of Hugh J. MacDonald J.A., speaking
on behalf of the Appellate Division, that the appellant did have dealings of
some kind with the Government and that the fact that a trap was set has no
bearing on the commission of the offence and I have nothing to add. So far,
therefore, as the Appellate Division allowed the appeal from the trial judge
and directed a verdict of guilty to be entered, the appeal fails. We have not
been furnished with a copy of any formal order made by the Appellate Division
but we were advised that on or about May 6, 1959, in pursuance of its direction
the accused appeared before it and was fined $500 and that this amount has been
paid.

The Crown had also appealed to the Appellate Division from
an order of the judge of first instance made subsequent to the acquittal
directing that there be paid out to the appellant the sum of $400 which the
latter had given to two employees of the Government of the Province of Alberta.
The four bills comprising that sum had been made exhibits at the trial. The
argument of the present appellant that subs. (2) of s. 630 of the Code applied
found favour with the trial judge. That subsection reads as follows:

630. (2) Where an accused is tried for an indictable offence
but is not convicted, and the court finds that an indictable offence has been
committed, the court may order that any property obtained by the commission of
the offence shall be restored to the person entitled to it, if at the time of
the trial the property is before the court or has been detained, so that it can
be immediately restored to that person under the order.

The Appellate Division considered that this subsection
had no application and with that I agree. The trial judge had acquitted the
accused and had not found that an indictable offence had, been committed by
someone else. Counsel for the accused at the trial had suggested to the judge
that the two witnesses who had been paid had committed a fraud, but when
counsel for the Crown was arguing the trial judge asked him:

Do you mean to say that if the police improperly take money
from a person as I in fact found in this case, following the acquittal of that person
charged he is not entitled to get his money back?

[Page 113]

And later, this occurred:

THE COURT: It is an exhibit in court. This money was taken
by the police and. put in court as an exhibit. Now, do I lose my power to deal
with it?

MR. SHORTREED: You don't lose your power to deal with it,
you never had any when you found that no crime had been committed.

THE COURT: Oh, I think I have. I will order return of the
money following the expiry of the time for appeal.

In view of this it cannot be maintained that the Court
had found an indictable offence had been committed and the trial judge
therefore had no jurisdiction under s. 630(2) of the Code to make the order he
did. Nor is his jurisdiction assisted by one of the Rules of the Supreme Court
of Alberta respecting criminal appeals to which counsel for the appellant
referred. In his factum he sets out subs. (2) of Rule 910, Order LVI, but by an
amendment made some time ago the Rule is really subs. (2) of 909 although in
the same terms. It is as follows:

909. (2) The judge or magistrate who presided at the trial
of any person, or any judge of the Court in which he was tried, may at any time
after the trial make a special order as to the custody or conditional release of
any such documents, exhibits, or other things as the special circumstances or
special nature thereof may make desirable and proper, and upon such terms as he
may impose.

The trial judge did not make a special order as to the
custody or conditional release of any exhibit.

The appellant takes the position that s. 584 of the Code
giving the Attorney General the right to appeal against a judgment, or verdict
of acquittal on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,
applies both to the judgment of acquittal and the order of payment out, whether
the order be considered part of the judgment, or supplementary to it; that in
neither case was a question of law involved, and that, therefore, the Appellate
Division had no jurisdiction. However s. 581(d) and s. 595 of the Code
provide:

581. In this Part,

…………………………………………………………………………………………………..

(d) ""sentence"" includes an order made under
section 628, 629 or 630 and a direction made under section 638; and;

[Page 114]

595. (1) Where an order for compensation or for the
restitution of property is made by the trial court under section 628, 629 or
630, the operation of the order is suspended

(a) until the expiration
of the period prescribed by rules of court for the giving of notice of appeal
or of notice of application for leave to appeal, unless the accused waives an
appeal, and

(b) until the appeal or
application for leave to appeal has been determined, where an appeal is taken
or application for leave to appeal is made.

(2) The court of appeal may order annul or vary an order
made by the trial court with respect to compensation or the restitution of
property within the limits prescribed by the provision under which the order
was made by the trial court, whether or not the conviction is quashed.

While I have already stated that I agree with the
Appellate Division that s. 630(2) is not applicable, the trial judge purported
to act under it. Therefore, by virtue of the extended meaning of
""sentence"", the Attorney General could appeal to the Court of Appeal
under s. 584(1)(b), with leave of the Appellate Division or a judge
thereof. It should be taken that such permission was granted, as the Appellate
Division proceeded to deal with the matter. Their reasons stated that the money
should remain in Court until further order.

Even if there were jurisdiction in this Court to hear an
appeal from an order carrying those reasons into effect, and whether it be a
separate order or part of one setting aside the acquittal and finding the appellant
guilty, there is no substance in the appeal and it should be dismissed.

Taschereau J.:—I
agree with the Chief Justice that the Appellate Division of the Province of
Alberta was right in allowing the appeal from the trial judge and directing a
verdict of guilty to be entered.

On the second branch of the case concerning the order of the
trial judge directing that there be paid out to the appellant the sum of $400,
which order was reversed by the Appellate Division, I agree with Mr. Justice
Fauteux that this Court has no jurisdiction on this matter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 115]

Fauteux J.:—Charged
with an indictable offence under s. 102(1)  (b), the appellant was, on
September 24, 1958, acquitted by Primrose J., sitting without a jury, in the
Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The charge being:

That he, on or about the 16th day of April A.D. 1958,
at Edmonton, in said judicial district, did give to an employee of the
Government of Alberta, a reward as consideration for an act in connection with
dealings with the said Government of Alberta, contrary to the provisions of the
Criminal Code  of Canada.

On October 3, 1958, he applied before the trial Judge
for an order directing the return to him of a sum of $400, filed as exhibit in support
of the charge, as being the reward given by him to an employee of the
Government. This application was granted and the order was issued.

Both the acquittal and the order were appealed by the Crown
to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. This appeal was
allowed and the Court directed that a verdict of guilty of the offence charged
be entered, and directed the bribe money to remain in Court until further
order.

The appellant now appeals to this Court against this
judgment which set aside his acquittal, as well as the order of the trial
Judge.

For the reasons given by the Chief Justice, I agree that the
appeal against the conviction fails.

With respect to the order made by the Court of Appeal in
relation to the bribe money, I am of opinion that this Court is without
jurisdiction; for the question involved is not one coming within the ambit of
any of the Criminal Code  appellate provisions related to appeals to this
Court in indictable offences. Goldhar v. Her Majesty the Queen3.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.

False imprisonment—Special statutory definitions and
limitations—The Mental Hygiene Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 309, ss. 15, 61, 64.

Mental diseases—Apprehension without
warrant—Justification for acts of police officers—Whether person
""apparently"" mentally ill and behaving in disorderly manner—Bona fide
belief—The Mental Hygiene Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 309, ss. 2(8), (11), (14), 15,
61, 61.

The plaintiff was apprehended by two police officers in
purported compliance with s. 15 of The Mental Hygiene Act. She was kept in
custody and subsequently sent to a mental hospital, from which she was
discharged after 44 days. She brought an action claiming, inter alia, damages
for false imprisonment, from the deputy chief constable who had directed her
apprehension, and a police matron who took part in the arrest. The defendants
pleaded the provisions of the statute, and particularly ss. 15, 61 and 64.

Held (Rand J. dissenting) : Both defendants were liable
in damages.

Per Kerwin C.J.: To justify the apprehension of a
person without warrant under s. 15 of the Act, two conditions must be
satisfied: (1) the person must be ""apparently"" mentally ill or
mentally defective, as

[Page 178]

defined in the statute, and (2) he must be conducting himself
in a manner which, in a normal person, would be disorderly. Whether or not it
could be said that it was apparent to the appellants that the plaintiff was
mentally ill, it was clear on the evidence that she was not acting in a
disorderly manner at the time of her apprehension, since she was at her own
office going about her business. It was true that s. 61 of the Act barred an
action against a person acting under the authority of s. 15, but only if that
person had acted in good faith and with reasonable care. It might be said, in
this case, that the defendants had acted in good faith but it could not be
said, on the evidence, that they had acted with reasonable care. Section 61
was, therefore, inapplicable.

Per Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The apprehension
of the plaintiff without a warrant was not authorized under s. 15, which
envisaged, as a condition of its application, something in the nature of an
emergency. This being the case, it could not be said that the acts of the
defendants were ""done under the authority of"" or ""done in
pursuance of"" s. 15, even if those words were interpreted as equivalent to
""intended to be done under the authority of"" and ""done in
intended pursuance of"". Lightwood, The Time Limit on Actions, p. 393,
quoted with approval. It was obvious that neither of the defendants had a bona
fide belief in facts which, if they had existed, would have afforded a
justification under s. 15, nor was there anything on which they could
reasonably found the belief that in fact the conditions prescribed by that
section existed. Therefore neither s. 61 nor s. 64 of the Act afforded any
defence to the defendants.

Per Rand J., dissenting: Section 61 of the Act
was of the widest scope in the justification it furnished and expressly mentioned
acts done under s. 15; its application should not be limited to acts that were
justified under that section. Considering the object of the statute, the extent
to which lay persons might become involved, and the safeguards mentioned, the
restricted interpretation given by the Courts below to s. 64 failed to take
into account the basic principle underlying the special conditions of bringing
action. Section 64 accordingly applied to bar the action because of the lapse
of time before its institution.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, reversing a judgment of Doiron
J.2 Appeal dismissed, Rand J.
dissenting.

J. E. MacDermid, Q.C., for the
defendants, appellants.

Walter Tucker, Q.C., and (Miss) Shirley J.
Tucker, for the respondent.

The Chief Justice:—The
appellant Mackie was deputy-chief constable of Saskatoon and the appellant Mrs.
Beatty was a police matron. On June 16, 1953, two Saskatoon

[Page 179]

police officers, whose names the
respondent was unable to obtain, accompanied by Mrs. Beatty, took the
respondent from her office in Saskatoon to the psychiatric ward of the Saskatoon
 Hospital where she was examined by two doctors on June 17 and 18 and then
transferred to the Provincial Mental Hospital in North Battleford. There she
was examined by two experts in mental illness and received treatment, but at
the end of 44 days she was discharged. Two actions brought by the respondent
were tried together by Doiron J. and dismissed3.
We are not concerned with the other action, but only with the present one and
that as against the two appellants for damages for false arrest.

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan4 allowed the plaintiff's appeal
and directed judgment to be entered against Mackie for $1,000 and against Mrs.
Beatty for $100. The five members of that Court were in agreement as to Mackie,
but McNiven J.A. would have dismissed the action against Mrs. Beatty. There can
be no question as to the liability of Mackie, as admittedly he directed the
arrest of the respondent, unless he is saved by the provisions of The Mental
Hygiene Act, 1950 (Sask.), c. 74 (now R.S.S. 1953, c. 309). While Mrs.
Beatty was attached as matron to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, she
admitted in her examination for discovery, put in at the trial, that from time
to time and on June 16, 1953, she was employed by the Saskatoon police. She
knew that the respondent was to be ""picked up""; she accompanied the
officers who identified themselves as such to the respondent, and I agree with
the majority of the Court of Appeal that what she did was sufficient to make
her a party to the arrest and therefore liable in damages unless she also is
protected under the statute.

Section 2 of that Act contains the following definitions:

8. ""institution"" includes a mental hospital and a
school for mental defectives;

11. ""mental defective"" or ""mentally defective
person"" means a person in whom there is a condition of arrested or
incomplete development of mind whether arising from inherent causes or induced
by disease or injury, and who requires care, supervision and control for his
own protection or welfare or for the protection of others;

[Page 180]

14. ""mentally ill person"" means a person other
than a mental defective who is suffering from such a disorder of mind that he
requires care, supervision and control for his own protection or welfare or for
the protection of others;

Section 11 provides for admission to an institution in
various ways, such as by the certificates of two physicians or on the warrant
of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Section 15 then provides an alternative
method of apprehension:

15. Any person, apparently mentally ill or mentally
defective and conducting himself in a manner which in a normal person would be
disorderly, may be apprehended without warrant by any constable or peace
officer and detained until the question of his mental condition is determined
under section 12.

Sections 61 and 64 enact:

61 [as amended by 1951, c. 74, s. 5]. No person who lays an
information under this Act, or who signs a certificate or does any act to cause
a certificate to be signed under the provisions of section 12 or 44, or who
otherwise acts under the authority of section 12, 15 or 44 or who commits any
person to safe custody upon the ground that such person is mentally ill or
mentally defective or who signs or carries out or does any act with a view to
signing or carrying out an order purporting to be an order for the removal of
any person to an institution, shall be liable to civil proceedings whether on
the ground of want of jurisdiction or on any other ground if the person so
acting has acted in good faith and with reasonable care.

64. All actions, prosecutions and other proceedings against
any person for anything done or omitted to be done in pursuance of this Act
shall be commenced within six months after the act or omission complained of
has been committed, and not afterwards.

Under s. 15 two things are required before a person may
be apprehended without warrant:

(1) Such person must be apparently mentally ill or
mentally defective; and

(2) He must be conducting himself in a manner which in
a normal person would be disorderly.

Whether or not it could be said that it was apparent to
the appellants that the respondent was mentally ill, the evidence is clear that
she was not acting in a disorderly manner as she was at her own office going
about her business.

It is quite true that s. 61, when applicable, performs its
function so as to bar an action against a person who acts under the authority
of s. 15, whether on the ground of want of jurisdiction or on any other ground;
but only if such person has acted (1) in good faith and (2) with reasonable
care. It is difficult to envisage how ""want of jurisdiction""

[Page 181]

could apply to the appellants in the circumstances of this
case, but, however that may be, I find it impossible to say that, even if they
acted in good faith, they also acted with reasonable care.

The evidence is detailed elsewhere. There is no doubt that
Mackie had received complaints from time to time from the respondent's sister,
Mrs. McWilliams, and the latter's husband, to the effect that the respondent
was annoying them and others and undoubtedly these two told Mackie that they
considered her mentally ill. It is beyond question that she had been drinking,
but it is also clear that during the eight or nine days preceding June 16, 1953, there was no evidence that she had acted in a disorderly manner. The
evidence that Mrs. McWilliams went to see the police magistrate, who took her
to see Mackie and pointed out to him s. 15 and told Mackie that he did not need
a warrant, does not justify the stringent action of attempting to proceed under
the provisions of that section when the respondent was not disorderly in any
sense on June 16, 1953, and had not been for some time. Nor does the fact that
Mr. McWilliams furnished Mackie on June 13, 1953, with his own affidavit that
in his opinion the respondent was mentally ill and was conducting herself in a
manner which in a normal person would be disorderly bring the appellants within
the protection of s. 61. The appellants did not act with reasonable care.

Section 64 may be compared with s. 2 of The Public
Officers' Protection Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 17, the relevant part of which
reads as follows :

2. (1) No action, prosecution, or other proceeding shall lie
or be instituted against any person for an act done in pursuance or execution
or intended execution of any statute, or of any public duty or authority, or in
respect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of any such statute,
duty or authority, unless it is commenced …

This wording follows s. 1 of The Public Authorities
Protection Act, 1893 (Imp.), c. 61, and is the same as corresponding
provisions in some of the other Provinces of Canada. For the reasons stated at
p. 392 of Lightwood's The Time Limit on Actions (1909), I agree that the fuller
form on which the words of the 1893 Act are based is no more efficacious than
the original short form ""in pursuance of the Act"", as that was
interpreted by the Courts. Many of the cases cited by counsel for the
appellants and which, we

[Page 182]

were advised, were not brought to the attention of the
Courts below, are referred to in the text-book and, after a consideration of
all of them, I agree with the author's conclusion, at p. 393, that:

The necessary check upon the defendant's assumption of
statutory power was finally found in the requirement that he should have a bona
fide belief in facts which, if they had existed, would have afforded a
justification under the statute.

In the present case I find it impossible to say that
the appellants thought for a moment that the respondent was acting in a manner
which in a normal person would be disorderly. On the contrary, they knew that
at least that prerequisite for the application of s. 15 did not exist and
therefore there was not any belief in facts which, if they had existed, would
have afforded a justification.

Although possibly it might have been argued that the $100
awarded against Mrs. Beatty was part of the $1,000 awarded against Mackie, no such
question was raised and therefore nothing is said about it. The appeal should
be dismissed with costs, including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal.

Rand J. (dissenting)
:—This appeal hinges on the application to the facts of s. 64 of The Mental
Hygiene Act of Saskatchewan, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 309:

All actions, prosecutions and other proceedings against any
person for anything done or omitted to be done in pursuance of this Act shall
be commenced within six months after the act or omission complained of has been
committed, and not afterwards.

The action was brought for false imprisonment arising out of
the following circumstances: The respondent was apprehended and taken to a
hospital for examination by the appellants, members of the police force of Saskatoon,
purporting to act under the provisions of s. 15 of the Act:

Any person, apparently mentally ill or mentally defective
and conducting himself in a manner which in a normal person would be disorderly,
may be apprehended without warrant by any constable or peace officer and
detained until the question of his mental condition is determined under section
12.

They were acting in good faith and believed on
reasonable grounds that the respondent was a person mentally ill who had been
leading a life of recurrent disorderliness. The information on which they acted
was furnished by the respondent's sister who had made a complaint to a
magistrate and with the magistrate had gone to police headquarters. On the

[Page 183]

discussion there the magistrate
gave his opinion that on the facts s. 15 authorized the officers to proceed to
apprehend her. After a delay of three or four days, awaiting an available room
in the hospital, she was taken and kept there for about 40 days and then
discharged. In the opinion of the superintendent, on admittance she was
suffering from mental illness aggravated by alcoholic indulgence, and on
discharge she was a border-line case in which the risks of giving her liberty
were about in balance with the considerations in favour of freedom, a situation
which called for her release. The evidence clearly established a pattern of
behaviour extending over a period of eight or nine months exhibiting itself in
bouts of excessive drinking, disorderly conduct seriously disturbing neighbours
in nearby apartments, making annoying use of the telephone, and threats of
injury to herself and her brother-in-law. The officers believed that they were
authorized to take her into custody by s. 15, that in acting as they did they
were exercising power vested in them by that section.

At the trial Doiron J. held that the section did authorize
what was done. On appeal the language was interpreted as applying only to
occasions on which a peace officer should come upon a person apparently
mentally ill and then and there acting in a disorderly manner. On that view it
was held that the apprehension was not made ""in pursuance of this
Act""; and that s. 61, which provides justification for acts done ""under
the authority of section … 15"", did not apply. The action was maintained
for damages of $1,000 against Mackie and $100 against Beatty, and the question
is whether the Court was right in holding that s. 64 could not be invoked.

The scope of the expressions ""in pursuance of"",
""pursuant to"", ""in the execution of"", and others of like
import, in each case with the qualification of the word
""intended""—all of which are now to be treated as having the same
signification —has been the subject of a great deal of judicial effort to reach
a rule that would fit all cases; but as is virtually inevitable in such
pursuits, that object has proved to be illusory. In a series of decisions in
the early years of the 19th century the interpretation tended to put the good
faith of the public authority in acting in his official capacity as the test;
then the ""reasonableness"" of that faith became

[Page 184]

a question; and this was followed by modifications based
upon mistake in matters of fact as well as in those of law. A reference to a
number of them seems desirable.

In Morgan v. Palmer5,
a fee was exacted by a mayor from a publican upon renewing his licence. In an
action to recover the amount back it was held that as no fee was legally
collectable the taking could not be said to have been done under colour of
authority, and the defendant was not entitled to notice of action. Three years
later Cook v. Leonard et al.6 applied
the same test. Bayley J. used this language :

[The words] extend to all acts done bona fide which may
reasonably be supposed to be done in pursuance of the Act. But where there is
no colour for supposing that the act done is authorized, then notice of action is
not necessary.

Wright v. Wales7
followed. There it was held that a person spreading beach and shingle by order
of the magistrates but not doing malicious injury, was not liable to arrest;
but as he had exhibited no warrant for what he was doing, the defendant as a
reeve of the parish and in charge of the land could not be said to have had no
colour for supposing he ought to arrest him. In the language of Park J.,
""if he made a mistake when he had reason to suppose he was acting in
pursuance of the statute, he was entitled to the protection given"". In Hopkins
v. Crowe8,
where a son of the owner of a horse that had been ill-used gave the party in
charge, whereas the statute enabled only the owner to do that, clearly
excluding the son, the latter was held not entitled to notice. In Rudd v.
Scott9,
an owner of a house had given in charge the plaintiff, employed by a tenant to
execute repairs, for pulling down and stealing part of the materials of the
house; and in the language of Tindal C.J. the Court could not say that the
course pursued by the owner was so wide of the mark that he could not have been
acting bona fide in the belief that the statute justified it. These were
followed by Read v. Coker10, in
which the

[Page 185]

defendant, being entitled to give into custody a person
found committing the offence, was held entitled to notice if ""he bona fide
believed that he was acting in pursuance of the statute"", though, as in
the present case, the plaintiff was taken, not in the act of
""committing"" but some hours afterwards. Maule J. used this language :

The case of Booth v. Clive [(1851), 10 C.B. 827] decides that a party is entitled to
notice of action provided he has acted bona fide in the belief that he is
pursuing the statute even though there may be no reasonable foundation for such
belief. Where the question is whether a man has acted bona fide, the
reasonableness of the ground of belief may be fit to be considered …

But as Williams J. in Cann v. Clipperton11 said:

It would be wild work if a party might give himself
protection by merely saying that he believed himself acting in pursuance of a
statute. … The case to which they [protecting clauses] refer must lie between a
mere foolish imagination and a perfect observance of the statute.

Hermann v. Seneschal12,
lays down the test of a bona fide belief in the existence of a state of
fact which, had it existed, would have justified the action taken. This, in Roberts
v. Orchard13, was
extended to a belief by the defendant that the plaintiff was ""found
committing"", as in Read v. Coker, supra, the pertinency of which to
the case before us is obvious. In Heath v. Brewer14, a. cab proprietor, instead of
summoning one of his drivers under the statute, defaced the latter's licence by
writing on it that he had been dismissed for damaging the cab and bringing home
no money. Erle C.J. remarked: ""The defendant could not honestly believe
that he was a magistrate, or that he could be justified in acting as judge in
his own case.""

The test of Hermann v. Seneschal will meet many if
not most of the cases arising, but, as the history of the rule shows, we cannot
rule out all mistakes in interpreting the statute, and sooner or later special
circumstances will be met which, if injustice is to be avoided, will call for a
modification. That was exemplified in Burns v. Nowell15, which held that it was sufficient if
the person acting believed that facts existed which in his honest and
reasonable belief would in law justify what he had done. There

[Page 186]

a naval officer seized a vessel, believing that an offence
had been committed under the Kidnapping Act of 1872, 35 & 36 Vict.,
c. 19. The statute authorized the detention of any vessel ""suspected upon
reasonable grounds"" of an offence. The circumstances which the officer
believed to exist did not, assuming them to exist, amount to an offence,
although it was his belief that they would. In the language of Baggallay L.J.,
at p. 451:

… an officer should be considered to have had reasonable
grounds for suspicion, if at the time of the seizure, he reasonably believed in
the existence of a state of circumstances which, in his honestly formed
opinion, amounted to the commission of an offence under the Act.

This harks back to the earlier requirement of some
colour of belief that the act was authorized by the statute, as in Hazeldine
v. Grove16.
There the defendant, as police magistrate, in a matter brought before him over
which he had no jurisdiction, had disbelieved the evidence given by the
plaintiff as a witness and had detained him until after the case was disposed
of, as beyond his jurisdiction, when, without a charge having been made, he
informed the plaintiff that he would be committed unless he found bail to
appear on a stated day. The bail was immediately furnished and the plaintiff
discharged. The statute under which the defendant acted gave him authority to
take preliminary proceedings ""on charges of misdemeanour"" and, with
no charge before him, the proceedings were illegal. At p. 795 (E.R.) Lord
Denman C.J., giving the judgment of the Court, said:

That principle seems to be this: that, where the magistrate,
with some colour of reason, and bona fide, believes that he is acting in
pursuance of his lawful authority, he is entitled to protection, although he .
may proceed illegally, or exceed his jurisdiction. Whether he acts with such
colour of reason, and bonâ fide, are questions for the jury . . . .

It is true that no direct charge or information had been
laid before the defendant when he first caused the plaintiff to be removed into
another room; and he may have exceeded his authority in so doing; but there is
ample ground for believing that he thought he might himself institute the
proceeding when the offence had been committed in his presence; and all his
subsequent conduct flowed from this. …

There was a fault in the commencement, which made the whole
proceedings illegal: but these statutory protections suppose an illegality, so
that there is no defence on the merits.

[Page 187]

The importance of Burns v. Nowell lies in the
recognition that no hard and fast rule is sufficient, and that the
circumstances must issue in a result that will reasonably execute the policy
underlying the protective provision. In G. Scammell and Nephew, Limited v.
Hurley et al.17, Scrutton
L.J. says:

When defendants are found purporting to execute a statute,
the burden of proof in my opinion is on the plaintiffs to prove the existence
of the dishonest motives above described and the absence of any honest desire
to execute the statute, and such existence and absence should only be found on
strong and cogent evidence.

Here is an Act dealing with situations that not infrequently
arise and in which the action to be taken calls essentially and primarily for
good faith and reasonable grounds. Section 61 is of the widest scope in the
justification it furnishes when those conditions have been satisfied. In it
acts done under s. 15 are expressly mentioned but the Court of Appeal has
apparently limited its application to those that are justified, for which the
inclusion would seem to be quite unnecessary. Considering the objects of the
statute, the extent to which lay persons may become involved, and the
safeguards mentioned, the restricted interpretation given s. 64 fails to take
into account the basic principle underlying these special conditions of
bringing action; and we were told by Mr. MacDermid that none of the authorities
mentioned was brought to the Court's attention.

The special circumstance here is that s. 15, on its face, is
certainly not obvious in meaning. It was read by a magistrate to extend to
apparent mental illness accompanied by a record of past persistent disorderly
conduct, and not to be confined to those conditions as they appear to a peace
officer when about to take into custody. The same view was taken by Doiron J.,
who thought the limitation urged too narrow. When a statutory provision to be
acted upon by a peace officer lends itself to such an erroneous interpretation,
to require him to act at the risk of being found to be wrong only after the
question has been deliberated on by a superior appeal tribunal would frustrate
the intended administration of the statute and would be contrary to the
principle of the rulings from the beginning.

[Page 188]

In Norris v. Smith18, Williams J, says :

The question is, not whether the defendant and the trustees
were strictly justified by the provisions of the statute, but whether there was
a semblance of acting under it.

In Selmes v. Judge et al.19, surveyors of highways illegally demanding a highway
rate under a repealed statute were held to be entitled to notice. Blackburn J.
said :

… it is clear that the defendants intended to act according
to the duties of their office as surveyors … it was the duty of the defendants
to collect highway rates, and they intended to act in pursuance of the statute…

There was not a semblance of statutory authority for
what was done and, whether or not the ruling would be followed to-day, it bears
the authority of a great judge. It is significant that in the Act before us s.
61 provides its justification even when the ground of liability is a want of
jurisdiction.

The circumstances here are in sharp distinction from those
in Chaput v. Romain et al.20 The reasons of Kellock J. were relied upon by Mr. Tucker.
But the offending act of Chaput was presumably some common law offence for a
belief in the existence of which there was not a particle of foundation; and
the act of the officers in breaking up the religious service with no
justification or excuse was itself an offence. There was no statute and no
colour of acting under their common law duty; every fact was known and any
other result would have left it to them to believe and act upon any set of
facts which they might imagine to constitute an offence.

It should be emphasized that s. 64 assumes that the persons
entitled to its benefit have been guilty of an illegal act for which they must
answer, and the requirement is only that proceedings against them be taken
within a certain period; and it is necessary to guard oneself against
unconsciously allowing this to become associated with the idea of a
justification for the act done, which it is not.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the
judgment at trial. Following the terms on which leave to appeal was granted,
the appellants must pay the party-and-party costs of the application for leave
and of the appeal in this Court. For the reason that the responsible officials
of the

[Page 189]

City refused to disclose to the respondent the names of
those who were concerned in the apprehension there should be no costs in either
the Court of Appeal or the trial Court.

The judgment of Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by

Cartwright J.:—This
is an appeal, brought pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan21, allowing an appeal from a judgment
of Doiron J.22 and
directing that judgment be entered in favour of the respondent against the
appellant Mackie for $1,000 damages and against the appellant Beatty for $100.

While at the trial other parties and matters were before the
Court, we are now concerned only with the claim of the respondent against the
appellants for damages for false imprisonment.

The relevant facts are set out in the reasons for judgment
in the Courts below and it is not necessary to repeat them in detail.

The appellant Mackie was at all relevant times deputy chief
constable of the City of Saskatoon. On the morning of June 16, 1953, two police
officers, whose names are unknown to the respondent but who were admittedly
acting on the instructions of the appellant Mackie, arrested the respondent.
They were accompanied by the appellant Mrs. Beatty, who is also a police
officer, and a question arises as to whether she took part in the arrest. At
the time of the arrest the respondent was in her office in the city of Saskatoon
and behaving in a normal manner.

The appellant Mackie had from time to time received
complaints from the respondent's sister and brother-in-law to the effect that
the respondent was drinking excessively, was acting in a disorderly manner, was
annoying them and others by repeated telephone-calls and appeared to be
mentally ill. It is clear from the evidence, and is indeed admitted, that the
respondent had not acted in a disorderly manner during the nine days preceding
her arrest and was not showing any signs of mental illness or defect at the
time she was apprehended.

[Page 190]

The defence of the appellants was based on the provisions of
The Mental Hygiene Act, 1950 (Sask.), c. 74, as amended, and
particularly ss. 15, 61 and 64 which read as follows:

15. Any person, apparently mentally ill or mentally defective
and conducting himself in a manner which in a normal person would be
disorderly, may be apprehended without warrant by any constable or peace
officer and detained until the question of his mental condition is determined
under section 12.

61 [as amended by 1951, c. 74, s. 5]. No person who lays an
information under this Act, or who signs a certificate or does any act to cause
a certificate to be signed under the provision of section 12 or 44, or who
otherwise acts under the authority of section 12, 16 or 44 or who commits any
person to safe custody upon the ground that such person is mentally ill or
mentally defective or who signs or carries out or does any act with a view to
signing or carrying out an order purporting to foe an order for the removal of
any person to an institution, shall be liable to civil proceedings whether on
the ground of want of jurisdiction or on any other ground if the person so
acting has acted in good faith and with reasonable care.

64. All actions, prosecutions and other proceedings against
any person for anything done or omitted to be done in pursuance of this Act
shall be commenced within six months after the act or omission complained of
has been committed, and not afterwards.

It was argued, (i) that the arrest of the respondent was
authorized by s. 15, (ii) that if it was not authorized the appellants were
none the less acting under the authority of s. 15 in good faith and with
reasonable care, and so were relieved from liability by s. 61, and (iii) that
what they did was done in pursuance of s. 15 and that the action was barred by
s. 64 as admittedly it was not commenced until more than six months after the
act complained of had been committed.

As to the first of these arguments, for the reasons given by
Gordon J.A., concurred in on this point by all the other members of the Court
of Appeal, I agree with his construction of s. 15 and with his conclusion that
its terms did not authorize the apprehension of the respondent without a
warrant. I wish to add only a few brief observations as to the meaning and
apparent purpose of that section. Read, as it must be, in the context of the
whole Act, it appears to me to envisage as the condition of its application
something in the nature of an emergency. The Act contains ample provision for
the apprehension and admission to an institution by due process of law of
persons who are, or are suspected of being, mentally ill or mentally defective;
see, for example, ss. 11, 12 and 17. Section 15, on the other

[Page 191]

hand, gives to any constable or peace officer the power to
apprehend and detain a person without warrant if two conditions coexist. These
are (i) that the person is apparently ""mentally ill"" or
""mentally defective"", each of which terms by reason of cls. 11 and 14
of s. 2 denotes such a condition that the person requires care, supervision and
control for his own protection or welfare or for the protection of others, and
(ii) that the person is conducting himself in a manner which in a normal person
would be disorderly. The coexistence of these conditions might well bring about
a situation in which any delay in placing the person concerned under restraint
would be fraught with danger. To hold that a statutory provision which
authorizes an interference with the liberty of the subject, provided two
conditions exist, could extend to a case in which neither exists would be
contrary to the well-established rule of construction referred to by Gordon
J.A.

The second and third of the arguments mentioned above may
conveniently be dealt with together, as neither can avail the appellants unless
the arrest of the respondent can be said to have been an act ""done under
the authority of"" or ""in pursuance of"" s. 15. For the purposes
of this branch of the matter I am prepared to accept Mr. MacDermid's submission
that the words quoted are equivalent to ""intended to be done under the
authority of"" and ""done in intended pursuance of"". English
statutory provisions couched in similar terms have been dealt with in many
decisions. After examining a number of these and tracing the development of the
jurisprudence on the subject, the learned author of Lightwood's The Time Limit
on Actions (1909) says at p. 393:

The necessary check upon the defendant's assumption of
statutory power was finally found in the requirement that he should have a bona
fide belief in facts which, if they had existed, would have afforded a
justification under the statute. This test, first formulated in Hermann v.
Seneschal (1862), 13 C.B.N.S.392, was repeated in Roberts v. Orchard
(1863), 2 H. & C. 769, and was adopted as a practical solution of the
difficulty: see Heath v. Brewer (1864), 15 C.B.N.S.803; Chambers v.
Reid (1866), 13 L.T.703; Downing v. Capel (1867), L.R.2 C.P.461.
After an apparent reversion to the requirement of reasonable belief in Leete
v. Hart (1868), L.R. 3 C.P.322, the new test was re-affirmed by Willes, J.,
in Chamberlain v. King (1871), L.R. 6 O.P. 474; see also Griffith v.
Taylor (1876), 2 C.P.D.194,C.A.; and it has not since been doubted.

[Page 192]

It is true that in Selmes v. Judge et al.23, Blackburn J. said at p. 728:

Neither in Hermann v. Seneschal nor in Roberts v.
Orchard was it decided that a defendant would not be entitled to notice of
action, because he had been mistaken in the law …

but in that case the defendants were public officers
carrying out a purpose authorized by statute and their error was a failure to
act strictly in accordance with the statute. The statute did empower them to
levy and collect a rate, and the judgment of Blackburn J. proceeds on the view
stated by him, at pp. 727-8, as follows:

The only illegal act done by the defendants was to make an
informal rate; they proceeded to collect it, and received from the plaintiff
the amount assessed upon him; in these transactions it is clear that the
defendants intended to act acording to the duties of their office as surveyors,
although they mistook the legal mode of carrying out their intention.

In my opinion the passage from Lightwood quoted above is a
correct statement of the general rule and sets out the test to be applied in
the case at bar. Cases may arise in which special circumstances complicate the
application of the rule and in which the statutory protection may extend to a
defendant who has proceeded partly on a bona fide mistake as to the
facts and partly on an erroneous view of the law; see, e.g., Cann v.
Clipperton, infra; but I find it difficult to suppose a case in which a
defendant who was perfectly acquainted with all the facts would be protected
merely because he entertained a mistaken opinion as to the law, and I am
satisfied that there is nothing in the facts of the case at bar to remove it
from the operation of the general rule.

In Cann v. Clipperton24, a case to which my brother Kellock
referred with approval in Chaput v. Romain et al.25, the defendant had caused a policeman to arrest the
appellant on a charge of doing malicious injury to property contrary to 7 &
8 Geo. IV, c. 30 ; the arrest without warrant was justified only if the party
arrested was found committing the offence; the jury decided that when taken
into custody the plaintiff was not found committing any offence against the
Act; it was argued for the plaintiff that the defendant,

[Page 193]

who was a solicitor, was acting under the mistaken view of the
law, that the situation was covered by another statute under which the offender
could be arrested without warrant if he had actually committed the offence
although he was not found committing it, and that therefore the defendant was not entitled to notice of action. In giving
judgment Lord Denman C.J. said at p. 588:

The defendant seems not merely to have had that impression
which was suggested, as to the law, but to have thought that the mischief was
actually going on at the time. Else I am unwilling to say that, if a party acts
bona fide as in execution of a statute, he is justified at all events, merely
because he thinks he is doing what the statute authorises, if he has not some
ground in reason to connect his own act with the statutory provision. The
doctrine attributed to Bayley J. goes too far. But here the defendant might
reasonably think that, in point of fact, the circumstances were those to which
the protection of stat. 7 & 8 G. 4 c. 30 s. 41 attaches. The rule for a
nonsuit must therefore be absolute.

The reference to the doctrine attributed to Bayley J.
appears to be to the judgment of that learned judge in Cook v. Leonard et al.26, and particularly the following passage, at pp. 355-6:

These cases fall within the general rule applicable to this
subject, viz. that where an Act of Parliament requires notice before action
brought in respect of any thing done in pursuance or in execution of its
provisions, those latter words are not confined to acts done strictly in
pursuance of the Act of Parliament, but extend to all acts done bona fide which
may reasonably be supposed to be done in pursuance of the Act. But where there
is no colour for supposing that the act done is authorized, then notice of
action is not necessary.

In Burns v. Nowell27, the
officer who seized the schooner ""Aurora"" knew of facts (i.e., that
she was carrying native labourers of the South Sea Islands not being part of
the crew and had no licence to do so) which would have been a good cause for
her arrest but for the circumstance, which appears to have been unknown to him
at the time of seizure that she had sailed prior to the date of the Kidnapping
Act, 1872, c. 19, coming into force. Baggallay L.J., who delivered the
unanimous judgment of the Court, appears to have accepted the general rule to
which I have referred above but to have regarded the case as an exception to
it. This is indicated by the following passage in his reasons at pp. 450-1:

It has been contended by Mr. Wills, on behalf of the
plaintiff, that an officer detaining or seizing a vessel, cannot properly be
considered either as having reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has
been

[Page 194]

committed, or as acting in pursuance of the Act, unless he
believes in the existence of facts which if they did actually exist, would be
sufficient to establish the commission of the offence; and, in support of this
contention he has referred to decisions and dicta in cases in which notice of
intended action having been required by law to be given to persons sought to be
made responsible for having exceeded their powers, questions have arisen as to
the circumstances under which such persons are entitled to notice.

We are, however, unable to accede to the argument based upon
the supposed authority of these cases. We do not doubt their value as guides
for the decision of cases of a similar character, but the words, which we have
now to interpret, are contained in a statute of a very special character, and
their true meaning can only be arrived at by a consideration of the general
scope of the statute and of the circumstances under which, and the purposes for
which, it was avowedly passed. To adopt the limited construction, contended for
by Mr. Wills, would render the Act almost a dead letter; the practical effect
of so doing would be to make the justification of the officer depend, in almost
every case, upon the offence having been in fact committed; and he would
consequently have to discharge his duty at the risk of being held responsible
in damages, should he make a mistake in applying a newly made law to a state of
facts, believed or suspected by him to exist, but as to the existence of which
he can, speaking generally, have but very slight means of informing himself.

If the test set out in the passage from Lightwood, quoted
above, be applied in the case at bar it is obvious that neither of the
appellants had a bona fide belief, or any belief, in facts which if they
had existed would have afforded a justification under s. 15, for arresting the
respondent without a warrant. The facts were simple and obvious. It cannot, on
the evidence, be suggested that the respondent either appeared to be mentally
ill or was conducting herself in a disorderly manner at the time of her arrest.
The most favourable way in which, on the evidence, the case can be put for the
appellant Mackie is that he gave the order for the arrest in the honest belief
that the conditions prescribed by s. 15 had in fact coexisted at a time not
less than nine days prior to the day of the arrest, and under the mistaken
impression that that circumstance empowered him to proceed under s. 15. His
conduct was no mere mistake in the legal mode of carrying out a statutory duty;
rather it was, as Gordon J.A. points out, a violation of the common law rights
of the respondent without statutory authority.

If the test suggested by Lord Denman, in the passage quoted
above from Cann v. Clipperton, is applied, it is my view that there was
nothing upon which the appellants could reasonably found the belief that, in
point of fact, the conditions prescribed by s. 15 existed.

[Page 195]

Even if ""the doctrine attributed to Bayley J."",
which Lord Denman regarded as going too far in favour of the defendant, were
adopted as the proper test it would not avail the appellants since there was,
in my opinion, no colour for supposing the arrest to be authorized and no
reasonable ground for thinking that s. 15 gave the appellants the authority
which they used.

The submission of the appellants on the points now under
consideration, if accepted, would bring about the result that, provided he is
acting honestly and with no improper motive, a defendant who arrests a person
without a warrant should be regarded as intending to act under the authority,
or in pursuance, of a section which empowers him so to act only if two
conditions coexist, although he is fully aware that in fact neither condition
exists. In my opinion the mere statement of such a proposition is sufficient to
refute it.

I conclude that neither s. 61 nor s. 64 affords a defence to
the appellants.

There remains the question whether the appellant Beatty took
any part in the arrest of the respondent. In my opinion her evidence given on
discovery and put in at the trial as part of the respondent's case shows that
she and the other two police officers acted together in carrying out the orders
of the appellant Mackie to arrest the respondent, and that from the time of her
apprehension until she was handed over to the authorities at the hospital the
respondent was in the joint custody of the appellant Beatty and the other two
officers.

No question was raised as to the amount at which the damages
were assessed or as to the terms of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs, including the costs
of the motion for leave to appeal.

Appeal dismissed with costs, Rand J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Trial—Jury—Juror indicating in open Court
misapprehension of certain fact—Whether duty of trial judge to redirect jury—No
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

While crossing a street in the City of
Toronto, the plaintiff, a pedestrain, came into contact with a car driven by
the defendant and was injured. After the accident a dent was found in the right
front fender of the defendant’s car. The jury found the defendant 30 per cent.
to blame.

After the charge to the jury by the trial
judge, a juror stated in open Court and before the jury retired, that it seemed
to him that one part of the testimony was that the “bump” was on the left-hand
side of the car and another on the right-hand side. The trial judge answered
that it was a matter for the jury and that they were the sole judges of the
evidence. Before both the Court of Appeal and this Court the defendant urged
that the trial judge should have redirected the jury. By a majority judgment,
the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.

No objection was taken before either the
Court of Appeal or this Court to the adequacy or accuracy of the trial judge’s
charge. Both the evidence and the charge by the trial judge showed that the
juror used the word “bump” to describe the point of impact between the
plaintiff and the defendant’s car and not to describe the dent in the fender.
But even assuming that the juror meant to refer to the dent in the fender, no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred. The jury’s answers
contain intrinsic evidence that the supposed misapprehension did not affect the
verdict. It seems to be beyond any serious question that the jury concluded
that the point of impact between the defendant’s car and the plaintiff was on
the right-hand side of the defendant’s car, and any misapprehension which may
at one stage have existed in the mind of the one juror could not have affected
the verdict.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], reversing a
judgment of Danis J. and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

R.E. Holland and M.J. O’Donohue, for the
plaintiff, appellant.

H.H. Wengle, for the defendant,
respondent.

[Page 17]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2]
setting aside the judgment of Danis J. upon the verdict of a jury, whereby the
appellant had been awarded $5,082.82 damages, and directing a new trial.

The appellant, a pedestrian, was crossing from
the north to the south side of Bloor Street East, a highway in the city of Toronto, at about 9.00 a.m. on June 20, 1956. At the point where he was
crossing there was a “pedestrian crossing” indicated by two white lines painted
on the pavement 14 feet and 6 inches apart. At this point the width of Bloor Street from curb to curb is 54 feet.
Approximately in the centre of the street are street-car tracks for westbound
and east-bound traffic. The distance from the northerly curb of Bloor Street to the most northerly rail is
19 feet.

According to the evidence of the appellant, a
line of automobiles was proceeding westerly at a distance of about 1½ feet from
the northerly curb when a west-bound automobile stopped at the east side of
this pedestrian crossing and the persons in it motioned to him to proceed
across. He says that he had walked to the centre of the road and stopped as a
street-car proceeding easterly on the southerly track was approaching, that he
stepped back “a pace or so” so as not to interfere with this east-bound
street-car and that the next thing he remembers was after the accident when he
was lying on the pavement.

The respondent’s evidence was that he was
driving his motor-car westerly with his wheels straddling the most northerly
rail, that there was a solid line of west-bound motor vehicles between his car
and the north curb of Bloor Street, that these vehicles were stationary, that
he was going at about 20 miles per hour, that he did not see the lines
indicating a pedestrian crossing and was unaware that such lines existed,
although he had driven over this same piece of highway almost daily for some
months, that he felt a thud which was caused by his car striking the appellant
or, as he suggested, by the appellant walking into the side of his car, that he
did not see the appellant before he

[Page 18]

heard the thud and that after the accident there
was a dent in the right front fender of his car which, he suggested, indicated the
point of impact.

The theory of the defence was that the appellant
had walked out between two stopped vehicles into, or into the path of, the
respondent’s vehicle in such a manner that the latter had no chance to avoid
the accident. The theories of the plaintiff were (i) that he had reached the
centre of the road and stopped there so that the defendant had ample time to
see him or, alternatively, (ii) that even if he was struck by the right side of
the defendant’s vehicle the latter had time to see him and was negligent in
failing to do so.

No objection was taken before the Court of
Appeal or before this Court to the adequacy or accuracy of the charge of the
learned trial judge in the course of which he said:

After the accident he (the defendant) said
he found a dent on the right front fender near the top of the fender three feet
back of the headlight.

At the conclusion of the charge the transcript
reads as follows:

A Juror: My lord, it seems to me that one
part of the testimony was that the bump was on the left hand side of the car
and another on the right hand.

His Lordship: Well, that is a matter for
you. You are the sole judges of the evidence. That is a matter for you to make
your finding. You can decide what you like. I can’t influence you. You are the
sole judges of the facts.

The jury then retired.

After the jury had retired, counsel for the
respondent made an objection to the charge, with which we are not now concerned
as the learned trial judge re-charged the jury in regard to it, and the
transcript continues:

This question that one of the jurymen asked
as to the evidence, I think possibly it should have been explained to them,
because I do not recall—I may be quite wrong about this—but I do not recall any
evidence of a bump on the left side of the defendant’s vehicle. Evidently there
must have been some misunderstanding.

HIS LORDSHIP: There could have been a bump
on the left side and Mr. McRae could have been shot up in the air.

MR. WENGLE: There could have been a bump
anywhere on that car.

HIS LORDSHIP: The dent was found on the
right side of the car. The defendant said—

MR. WENGLE: There was no evidence of a dent
on the left.

[Page 19]

HIS LORDSHIP: I did not say there was any
evidence.

MR. WENGLE: I am afraid the juror
‘misunderstood that, and I think possibly that part of the evidence should have
been clarified for the juryman. That is all I have to say.

The jury answered the questions put to them as
follows:

Question 1: Has the defendant Ford Eldridge
satisfied you that the accident was not caused by any negligence or improper
conduct on his part:

Answer: No.

Question 2: Was there any negligence on the
part of the plaintiff Frank McRae which caused or contributed to the accident?

Answer: Yes.

Question 3: If your answer to question
number 2 is “Yes” then state fully of what the negligence of the plaintiff
Frank McRae consisted. Answer fully.

Answer: Frank McRae did not exercise proper
caution when attempting to cross the street.

Question 4: If your answer to question
number 1 is “No” and your answer to question number 2 is “Yes”, state in
percentages the degree of fault or negligence attributable to each:

Defendant Ford Eldridge....................................................................... 30%

Plaintiff Frank McRae............................................................................ 70%

Question 5: Irrespective of how you answer
the other questions, at what amount do you assess the total damages sustained
by the plaintiff, Frank McRae?

Special Damages...................................................................... $. 2,442.75

General Damages...................................................................... $14,500.00

           Total Damages................................................................ $16,942.75

On these answers judgment was entered for 30 per
cent. of the damages assessed.

The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal.
The only ground of appeal which was dealt with in the reasons of the Court of
Appeal and which was urged before us was stated as follows in the notice of
appeal:

The learned trial Judge erred in failing
and refusing to direct the Jury on the question of the location of the dent on
the fender of the Defendant’s automobile when it was apparent to the learned
trial Judge from a question asked by a member of the Jury that the said Juryman
misheard or misunderstood the evidence, and the learned trial Judge erred in
not requiring that part of the evidence which dealt with the said dent to be
read back to the Jury.

The majority of the Court of Appeal were of
opinion that the remark of the juryman, quoted above, disclosed an error in his
mind which it became the duty of the learned trial judge to correct and were
not satisfied that his failure to do so had not occasioned some substantial
wrong or miscarriage.

[Page 20]

Schroeder J.A., dissenting, was of opinion that
there was no error on the part of the trial judge and alternatively that, if
there were, no substantial wrong or miscarriage had been occasioned by the
omission complained of and would have dismissed the appeal.

After reading the evidence and the charge of the
learned trial judge, it is my opinion that in the remark quoted, the juryman
used the word “bump” to describe the point of impact between the appellant and
the respondent’s vehicle and not the dent in the fender; and that the learned
trial judge so understood him appears to me to follow from his statement to
Mr. Wengle:

There could have been a bump on the left
side and Mr. McRae could have been shot up in the air.

The words “bump” and “dent” are not synonymous.
One of the usual meanings of the former is “collision” and it appears to me
that it was in that sense that it was used by both the juryman and the learned
trial judge. However, as all the learned Justices of Appeal proceeded on the
view that the juryman in using the word “bump” meant to refer to the dent on
the fender of the respondent’s car, I will deal with the appeal on that
assumption.

Proceeding on this assumption, I am in
substantial agreement with the reasons of Schroeder J.A. but I wish to rest my
judgment on the second ground on which his decision was based, that is that it
can safely be affirmed that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage.

I think it altogether probable that the
suggested misapprehension on the part of the one juryman, if it existed, was
cleared up by other members of the jury, in the course of their deliberations,
but, be that as it may, it appears to me that the jury’s answers contain
intrinsic evidence that the supposed misapprehension did not affect the
verdict. If a juryman mistakenly believed that there was a dent on the
left-hand front fender of the defendant’s car the tendency of that mistake
would be to bring him to accept the first of the theories of the plaintiff as
to how the accident had happened to which I have referred above; and, had the
jury found that the plaintiff had reached the centre of the road before being
struck it seems to me that their answer to question no. 2 would have been
differently worded

[Page 21]

and that it is extremely unlikely that they
would have placed only 30 per cent. of the blame upon the defendant who, on
that view, would have been without any excuse or explanation for failing to see
the plaintiff before the impact. Counsel for the defendant submits that the
jury might have found the plaintiff 70 per cent. to blame even if they accepted
the first of his theories because they might have thought that his stepping
back “a pace or so” was the chief cause of the accident; but it seems to me
that if this had been their view the jury would have said that the plaintiff’s
negligence consisted in stepping back into, or into the path of, the
defendant’s car.

When the answers of the jury are considered in
the light of the whole evidence and of the charge of the learned trial judge it
seems to me to be beyond any serious question that they concluded that the
point of impact between the defendant’s car and the plaintiff was on the
right-hand side of the defendant’s car, and, consequently, any misapprehension
which may at one stage have existed in the mind of the one juryman cannot have
affected the verdict.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.

Appeal allowed with costs.

When a trial judge, in the course of a trial

appellant’s action was dismissed with costs.

The appellant suffered serious injuries in an
automobile accident which occurred on May 22, 1952. He brought action against
the respondents alleging that each of them had been guilty of acts of
negligence which had caused the accident. The action came on for trial before
Barlow J. and a jury in September 1953. The respondents were separately
represented. Evidence was called on behalf of the respondent McLaughlin but not
on behalf of the respondent Robillard and consequently at the conclusion of the
evidence Mr. Walker, counsel for McLaughlin, addressed the jury first
followed by Mr. MacDonald, counsel for the appellant, who would in the
ordinary course have been followed by counsel for Robillard.

At the conclusion of Mr. MacDonald’s
address Mr. Walker moved the learned trial judge to discharge the jury and
continue the trial himself without a jury. Counsel for the respondent Robillard
supported this motion. The motion, which was argued at length, was based on the
allegations (i) that counsel for the appellant had mis-stated the effect of the
evidence to the jury in several respects of which eight were specified, and
(ii) that the address was inflammatory. In opposing the motion,
Mr. MacDonald said in part:

My address was not inflammatory in any
sense of the word. All I tried to do was to discharge my duty as a plaintiff’s
counsel to his client. I would think that from the vast experience which your
Lordship has had,

[Page 353]

you would have stopped me if I had been
delivering an inflammatory address. I am not prepared to take the quotations
which Mr. Walker read to your Lordship as being my utterances, and if
there is any doubt about it I think there should be a transcript.

To this the learned trial judge replied: “I took
them down as Mr. Walker has stated them.” But on the argument before us
counsel for the appellant in a careful analysis of the transcript of
Mr. MacDonald’s address and of the complaints which had been made against
it showed that a number of the alleged mis-statements of fact complained of
before the learned trial judge had not in fact been made. In this connection it
may be noted that in the factum of the respondent McLaughlin filed in this
Court only four mis-statements are specified.

At the conclusion of the argument of the motion
the learned trial judge said:

Counsel for the defendants ask that I take
this case from the jury on the ground of mis‑statement of facts by
counsel for the plaintiffs, and also that the address was inflammatory.

It is the duty and the right of a trial
judge to deal with such a motion, the purpose being that justice may be done
between the parties. If, in the opinion of the trial judge, he considers that
the address of counsel for the plaintiffs is of such a nature that it may lead
to a verdict which is not warranted by the evidence, then it is quite proper
for him to take the case from the jury.

There is no doubt in my mind that the
address was of an inflammatory nature, and there were also various
mis-statements of fact made by counsel for the plaintiffs. I made a note of
some of them, and I made a note of some of the inflammatory statements, such
as, for example, “I suggest to you that there was guilt in his soul”, meaning
Mr. McLaughlin; “he knew in his heart that he had caused the accident”;
“was that the act of a man who had something on his conscience?” Those are only
some of the statements that are quite improper, in my opinion, so far as the
inflammatory nature of it is concerned.

For that reason, and also by reason of the
mis-statements of facts which are of such a nature that I could never expect to
correct them, and ought not to have to correct them in my charge to the jury, I
think that I would only be doing what is right and proper in the administration
of justice in taking this case from the jury and concluding it myself.

The learned judge then discharged the jury.

The appellant in his notice of appeal to the
Court of Appeal set up only the following grounds:

1. His Lordship, the trial judge, erred in
ruling that Counsel for the Plaintiffs had mis‑stated evidence in his
jury address and that the said jury address was of an inflammatory nature.

[Page 354]

2. His Lordship, the trial judge, erred in
ordering the jury dismissed and concluding the trial himself, and his action,
in so doing, was an improper exercise of his judicial discretion, and a denial
to the Plaintiffs of their right to have their causes tried by a jury.

No other ground was advanced in the appellant’s
factum or in his argument in this Court.

At the opening of the argument before us
Mr. Walker raised the preliminary objection that, the only ground of
appeal being that the learned trial judge erred in taking the case from the
jury, no appeal lies to this Court as the order discharging the jury was one
made “in the exercise of judicial discretion”, and the right of appeal is
denied by s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act. The Court decided to delay
consideration of this preliminary objection until after the argument of the
appeal. It will be observed that if this preliminary objection is entitled to
prevail this Court could not give leave to appeal as the action was commenced
before the amendment of s. 41(1) by 4-5 Eliz. II
(1956), c. 48, s. 3: see La Cité de Verdun v. Viau[1]

In Ontario the power of a judge presiding at a
trial before a jury to discharge the jury and complete the trial himself is
found in subs. (3) of s. 57 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950,
c. 190, reading as follows:

(3) Notwithstanding the giving of the
notice [i.e., a jury notice] the issues of fact may be tried or the
damages assessed without the intervention of a jury if the judge presiding at
the sittings so directs or if it is so ordered by a judge.

The subsection has existed in its present
form since 1913 when it appeared as sub. (3) of s. 56 of 3 and 4 Geo. V,
c. 19.

Its predecessors were s. 18 of The
Administration of Justice Act of 1873, 36 Vic., c. 8, and s. 255 of The
Common Law Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1877, c. 50, which read respectively as
follows:

18. All other issues shall be tried as
heretofore, unless the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or a
judge thereof, upon application being made before trial, or unless the
presiding judge upon the trial, directs or decides that the issue or issues
shall be tried and damages assessed without the intervention of a jury.

255. Notwithstanding anything in the two
next preceding sections contained, the Judge presiding at the trial may in
his discretion direct that any such action shall be tried or the damages
assessed by a jury; And upon application to the Court in which the action is
pending, or to a Judge thereof, by an order made before the trial, or by the
direction of the Judge presiding at the trial, the issues may be tried and
damages assessed without the intervention of a jury.

[Page 355]

The power given to the trial judge by the
subsection in its present form does not appear to me to differ in kind
from that conferred by the sections last quoted above. In Ontario, it has consistently been held that
the exercise of this power is committed to the discretion of the judge at the
trial.

In Brown v. Wood[2], Armour J. at the trial had struck out the
jury notice and tried the case without a jury against the protests of counsel
for the defendant. On appeal Boyd C., with whom Ferguson and Robertson JJ. concurred, said, at p. 200:

The difficulty is to get over sec. 255
of the C.L.P. Act. If this were an appeal from the order of a Judge in Chambers
striking out a jury notice, before the trial, the cases cited by Mr. Read
would be overwhelming in his favour, but the discretion of a Judge at the trial
is much larger… As no affidavit of merits has been filed, and the defendant has
not brought and does not seek to bring the amount of the verdict into Court,
and as the motion is against a discretion that the trial Judge undoubtedly has
to determine the method of trial, it should be dismissed, with costs.

In Wise v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[3], Middleton J., as he then was, said at p.
345:

It has been held that the discretion
conferred upon the Judge presiding at the trial is an absolute discretion, not
subject to review: Brown v. Wood (1887), 12 P.R. 198.

In Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co.[4], Latchford C.J., giving the judgment of the
Appellate Division in a case in which the trial judge had dispensed with the
jury, said at pp. 99-100:

Even before the enactment of
sec. 56(3) the discretion of a trial Judge in dispensing with a jury was
not interfered with by an appellate Court: Brown v. Wood (1887), 12 P.R.
198. It was within the power of the trial judge to determine the method of
trial, and his determination was not open to review.

In Owens v. Martindale[5], Ferguson J.A. with whom the
majority of the Court agreed left open the question whether such an order could
be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. He said at p. 97:

I am clearly of the opinion that the
circumstances disclosed in evidence and particularly the situation pointed out
by Mr. Slaght in his second proposition justified the learned trial Judge
in exercising his discretion in the manner he did, and that it is therefore
unnecessary to express an opinion as to our right to review an order made by a
trial Judge striking out a jury notice.

[Page 356]

In Telford v. Secord; Telford v. Nasmith[6], judgment had been entered for the
plaintiff at the trial pursuant to the verdict of a jury; the Court of Appeal
set this judgment aside and directed that a new trial be had without a jury.
This Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as it set
aside the trial judgment but directed that the new trial should be before a
jury. Kellock J. in giving the unanimous judgment of this Court said at p. 282:

There rests with the trial judge sufficient
power and authority to conduct the trial as it should be conducted, and, should
he see reason to try the action without a jury or to dispense with the jury at
any stage, his discretion is not subject to review.

I have quoted from the above judgments, and
there are many others containing expressions to the same effect, for the
purpose of indicating that the order of a trial judge dispensing with a jury
during the course of the trial is consistently treated as the exercise of a
discretion vested in him by the statute. There may be cases in which the order
could be shown to have been made otherwise, as for example if the judge in his
reasons made it clear that he had discharged the jury only because he had
erroneously decided that he was bound as a matter of law to do so. Logan et
al. v. Wilson et al.[7] was a
case of this sort.

In the case at bar counsel for the appellant
contends that it has been shown (i) that in reaching his decision to discharge
the jury the learned trial judge was proceeding, in part at least, on a
mistaken view as to what had in fact been said by Mr. MacDonald in his
address as to the evidence, and (ii) that there was nothing in that address
which could properly be held to be inflammatory. From this he seeks to draw the
conclusion that the order was not one made in the exercise of judicial
discretion.

I am unable to reach that conclusion. The
reasons of the learned trial judge quoted above show that he directed his mind
to the question whether the address of the plaintiff’s counsel was of a nature which
might lead the jury to an unwarranted verdict and for that reason he should
dispense with the jury. His conclusion that he should do so

[Page 357]

was based on some mis-statements actually,
although no doubt unintentionally, made by the plaintiff’s counsel and on
several passages which in my opinion it was open to the learned judge to regard
as “inflammatory”. The circumstances that the learned judge mistakenly thought
that there had been additional mis-statements and that on reading the written
record an appellate tribunal might regard the passages said to be inflammatory
as not going beyond the bounds permitted to counsel do not make the order one
made otherwise than in the exercise of his discretion. At the most those
circumstances, assuming their existence, would afford grounds for submitting
that the learned judge had exercised his discretion mistakenly.

The decision which the learned trial judge was
called upon to make appears to me to have required the exercise of discretion
within the definition of that term in Bouvier’s Law Dictionary which was
adopted by Cannon J. in Glesby v. Mitchell[8]:

That part of the judicial function
which decides questions arising in the trial of a cause, according to the
particular circumstances of each case, and as to which the judgment of the
court is uncontrolled by fixed rules of law.

The power exercised by courts to determine
questions to which no strict rule of law is applicable but which, from their
nature, and the circumstances of the case, are controlled by the personal
judgment of the court.

I have concluded that the order of the learned
trial judge was made in the exercise of the judicial discretion given to him by
s. 57(3) of The Judicature Act and that we have no jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal, even if we should be of opinion that his discretion was
exercised mistakenly.

I do not intend by anything I have said above to
express an opinion as to whether the discretion of the learned judge was or was
not rightly exercised in the particular circumstances of this case.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs as of a
motion to quash.

[Page 358]

LOCKE J.:—In my opinion, the order complained of
was made in the exercise of a judicial discretion within the meaning of s. 44
of the Supreme Court Act and, accordingly, we are without jurisdiction.

I would dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Offence triable in two ways—Effect
of withdrawal of information—Charge laid more than 6 months after commission of
offence—Rights of Crown counsel and accused.

The accused was charged with failing to
remain at the scene of an accident, which offence, under s. 221(2)  of the Criminal
Code , is triable either on indictment or on summary conviction. The offence
was alleged to have been committed on March 16, 1955, and the information was
laid on January 17, 1956.

When the accused was brought before a
magistrate, Crown counsel, on being asked, stated that he wished to proceed
summarily. The accused pleaded not guilty and his counsel immediately moved for
dismissal of the charge on the ground that the prosecution was barred under s.
693(2), the information having been laid more than 6 months after the
commission of the offence. The magistrate permitted counsel for the Crown to
withdraw the information and to lay a new one on which a preliminary hearing
was held, resulting ultimately in the conviction of the accused.

The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction
on the ground that what had taken place before the magistrate amounted to an
acquittal on the first information and that the accused was therefore entitled
to succeed on a plea of autrefois acquit.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The conviction should be restored.

Per Kerwin
C.J.: The Crown had a right to withdraw the information and to change its
election. There was no formal acquittal by the magistrate and what occurred at
that time did not amount to an acquittal; to have this effect the first trial
must have been concluded by an adjudication or its equivalent.

Per Taschereau
J.: The withdrawal of the first information did not amount to an acquittal and
the Crown could consequently proceed by indictment as it did. The accused was
not placed in jeopardy on the first occasion.

[Page 344]

Per Fauteux
and Abbott JJ.: The first information, considered as the institution of
proceedings by summary conviction, was bad on its face, and the Crown therefore
had no right to proceed by way of summary conviction, and the magistrate had no
jurisdiction to accept the Crown’s election and act upon it by receiving a
plea. The election and plea were therefore void and did not constitute a bar to
the subsequent proceedings by indictment.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: In the circumstances of the case, the withdrawal of the
first information was tantamount to an acquittal, since counsel for the defence
was not raising a technical objection which would be a bar to the magistrate
adjudicating upon the charge but was bringing forward a defence in law to which
there was no answer. The magistrate should have dismissed the charge and his
action in permitting it to be withdrawn was, in the circumstances, the
equivalent of a dismissal.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] setting
aside a conviction. Appeal allowed.

W.B. Common, Q.C., and E.R. Pepper, for
the appellant. Stanley Smither, for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—The Crown had the right to
change its election before the magistrate and also the right to withdraw the
information. Assuming that the respondent raised the plea of autrefois
acquit before His Honour Judge Forsyth, there had certainly not been a
formal acquittal by the magistrate on January 24, 1956, and in my opinion what
occurred at that time did not amount to an acquittal. The first trial must have
been concluded by an adjudication, or what amounts thereto: Regina v.
Charlesworth[2]; Re
Rex v. Ecker; Re Rex v. Fry[3]. It has
been held that where a trial had commenced and the jury had been discharged and
a new one empanelled, the plea could not avail even if the discharge of the
first jury had been improper or if a Court of Error or Appeal considered that
under the circumstances the first jury should not have been discharged: Regina
v. Charlesworth, supra; Winsor v. The Queen[4];
Rex v. Lewis[5].

The appeal should be allowed, the conviction
restored and the case remitted to the Court of Appeal so that the respondent’s
application for leave to appeal from the sentence may be dealt with.

[Page 345]

TASCHEREAU J.:—I am of the opinion that the
withdrawal by the Crown of the first information did not amount to an
acquittal, giving rise to the plea of autrefois acquit, and that the
Crown could consequently proceed by indictment as it did. The respondent was
not in jeopardy.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction, and remit the case to the Court of Appeal so that the respondent’s
application for leave to appeal from the sentence may be dealt with.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This appeal
is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on November 29, 1956, quashing the
conviction of the respondent on September 21, 1956, at the General Sessions of
the Peace for the County of York and directing a verdict of acquittal to be
entered.

The proceedings against the respondent were
commenced by the swearing of an information on January 17, 1956, charging:

that on the 16th day of March in the year
1955, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, owing to the presence of a
vehicle bearing license nurnber 139675 (Saskatchewan) for the year 1954 on the
highway, to wit, on Dundas St. W. an accident had occurred to SAM PECALIS
and that PETER KARPINSKI the person having the care, charge or control of the
vehicle with intent to escape liability, either civil or criminal, failed to
stop his vehicle, offer assistance and give his name and address, contrary to
the Criminal Code , section 221 , sub-section 2 .

On January 24, 1956, the respondent appeared
before His Worship Magistrate Bigelow to answer the charge. As the offence
created by s. 221(2)  may be dealt with either as an indictable offence or as an
offence punishable on summary conviction, the clerk of the Court after reading
the charge to the respondent asked Crown counsel how he wished to proceed and
he elected to proceed summarily. The clerk then called upon the respondent to
plead and he pleaded “not guilty”. After this plea and before any evidence had been
given counsel for the respondent moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that
the proceeding had been instituted more than six months after the time when the
alleged offence was committed and was consequently barred by the provisions of
s. 693(2)  of the Criminal Code . The learned magistrate then permitted
counsel for the Crown to

[Page 346]

withdraw the information against the protest of
counsel for the respondent who submitted that he was entitled to have the
charge dismissed.

A new information was then laid and read to the
respondent and Crown counsel elected to proceed by way of indictment. The
respondent, having refused to elect as to his method of trial on the ground
that the proceedings were improper, was committed for trial after a preliminary
inquiry had been held by the learned magistrate. In due course Crown counsel
preferred a bill of indictment. The grand jury returned a true bill. The trial
was held on September 20 and 21, 1956, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a
jury.

At the opening of the trial and before pleading
counsel for the respondent moved to quash the indictment on grounds which are
summarized as follows in the factum of counsel for the appellant:

(a) The Crown had no right to change their
election before the magistrate.

(b) The Crown had no right to withdraw the
information.

(c) If the Crown withdrew the information
without the consent of the accused, that withdrawal was tantamount to a
dismissal and the accused can successfully plead autrefois acquit.

The learned trial judge declined to give effect
to the motion and proceeded with the trial which resulted in the conviction
which was quashed by the Court of Appeal.

While the point was not pressed, it was
suggested that the respondent had failed to raise the plea of autrefois
acquit before His Honour Judge Forsyth. There appears to have been some
lack of formality in the proceedings, but the record shows that before entering
a plea of not guilty, counsel for the respondent made it clear that he relied
on the submission that his client was entitled to be discharged on the plea of autrefois
acquit and the matter was argued at length before the learned trial judge.
In my view the plea was sufficiently raised.

It is argued for the appellant that the
respondent was not in jeopardy in the summary proceedings before the
magistrate, “that there was no adjudication on the merits or otherwise, nor
could there have been, since the learned Magistrate was without jurisdiction”.
I am unable to give effect to this argument.

[Page 347]

Section 693(2)  which limits the time within
which proceedings in respect of offences punishable on summary conviction may
be instituted is as follows:

(2) No proceedings shall be instituted more
than six months after the time when the subject matter of the proceedings arose.

The effect of this subsection is not, in my
opinion, to deprive the magistrate of jurisdiction in a case in which the
subject matter of the proceedings in fact arose more than six months before
their institution but rather to afford a defence to the charge. While no such
difficulty arises in the case at bar, the decisions collected in 21 Halsbury,
2nd ed. 1936, at p. 598 show that questions of fact and law may well arise as
to when the six months’ period commences to run in a particular case.

In the case at bar, after the information had
been read, the Crown had elected to proceed summarily, the respondent had been
called upon to plead and had pleaded “not guilty”, the learned magistrate had
jurisdiction over the accused and over the offence with which he was charged
and, as is pointed out by Laidlaw J.A., the trial had commenced. Prima
facie, it was the duty of the learned magistrate to proceed with the trial
as provided by s. 708(3)  and s. 711  of the Criminal Code , reading as
follows:

708(3) Where the defendant pleads not
guilty or states that he has cause to show why an order should not be made
against him, as the case may be, the summary conviction court shall proceed
with the trial, and shall take the evidence of witnesses for the prosecutor and
the defendant in accordance with the provisions of Part XV relating to
preliminary inquiries.

711. When the summary conviction court has
heard the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses it shall, after considering the
matter, convict the defendant or make an order against him or dismiss the
information, as the case may be.

The provisions of s. 697(3) emphasize the
importance of the respondent having pleaded. That subsection reads as
follows:

(3) Subject to section 698, in
proceedings under this Part no summary conviction court other than the summary
conviction court by which the plea of an accused is taken has jurisdiction for
the purposes of the hearing and adjudication, but any justice may

(a) adjourn the proceedings
at any time before the plea of the accused is taken, or

(b) adjourn the proceedings
at any time after the plea of the accused is taken for the purpose of enabling
the proceedings to be continued before the summary conviction court by which
the plea was taken.

[Page 348]

I do not find it necessary to determine in what
circumstances, if any, a charge may properly be withdrawn against the objection
of the accused after the commencement of a trial before a summary conviction
court, as I have concluded that Mr. Smither is right in his submission that
in the case at bar the withdrawal was tantamount to an acquittal.

On the argument before us both counsel referred
to the judgment of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Re Bond[6], and relied upon the following passage from
the judgment of Graham J. at p. 515:

It remains to consider whether the
withdrawal should be construed under any other rule of law to be an acquittal.
The cases in other jurisdictions are not easy to reconcile, and we are,
therefore, thrown back on reason and the application of principles.

The withdrawal of a charge before any
evidence is given may be tantamount to a trial, and so may put an end to the
complaint; but that can only be so when the true inference from the
circumstances is, that the magistrate permitted the withdrawal, because he decided
that there was not a proper case for trial or that trial was unnecessary, and
so passed upon the merits. The general law is that to support the plea of autrefois
acquit there must have been a trial and an acquittal on the merits.

In Haynes v. Davis[7], Lush J. said:

I quite agree that “acquittal on the
merits” does not necessarily mean that the jury or the magistrate must find as
a matter of fact that the person charged was innocent; it is just as much an
acquittal upon the merits if the judge or the magistrate were to rule upon the
construction of an Act of Parliament that the accused was in law entitled to be
acquitted as in law he was not guilty, and to that extent the expression
“acquittal on the merits” must be qualified, but in my view the expression is
used by way of antithesis to a dismissal of the charge upon some technical
ground which had been a bar to the adjudicating upon it. That is why this
expression is important, however one may qualify it, and I think the antithesis
is between an adjudication of not guilty upon some matter of fact or law and a
discharge of the person charged on the ground that there are reasons why the
Court cannot proceed to find if he is guilty.

Applying the reasoning of the above passages to
the facts of the case at bar, it appears that in the course of the trial
Mr. Smither brought to the attention of the learned magistrate the
undisputed fact that the alleged offence was committed more than six months
before the commencement of the proceedings. In so doing he was not raising a
technical ground which would be a bar to the magistrate adjudicating upon the
charge; he was bringing forward a

[Page 349]

defence in law to which there was no answer. To
use the words of Graham J., quoted above, any further trial “was unnecessary”;
the learned magistrate was in a position to pass upon the merits as no evidence
could have been given that would have altered the result. In my respectful
view, the learned magistrate ought to have dismissed the charge, and his action
in permitting it to be withdrawn was, in the circumstances, the equivalent of a
dismissal.

It may be mentioned in passing that in actions
for malicious prosecution the withdrawal of a charge in open Court by the Crown
Attorney, otherwise than in pursuance of a compromise or agreement between the
parties, has consistently been held to constitute a termination of the criminal
proceedings in favour of the accused; see for example Fancourt v. Heaven[8], and the cases there cited.

If it should be suggested that, in the result, a
man who was convicted on sufficient evidence before a properly instructed jury
goes free because of the decision, perhaps made inadvertently, to proceed
summarily before the magistrate, I would recall the words of Viscount Sankey
L.C. in Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions[9], which although used in different
circumstances are of general application:

But it must be remembered that the whole
policy of English criminal law has been to see that as against the prisoner
every rule in his favour is observed... It is often better that one guilty man
should escape than that the general rules evolved by the dictates of justice
for the conduct of criminal prosecutions should be disregarded and discredited.

The general rule on which the respondent relies
was not questioned. It is stated in the following terms in Broom’s Legal
Maxims, 10th ed. 1939, p. 223:

The maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una
et eadem causa expresses a great fundamental rule of our criminal law,
which forbids that a man should be put in jeopardy twice for one and the same
offence. It is the foundation of the special pleas of autrefois acquit and
autrefois convict. When a criminal charge has been once adjudicated upon
by a Court of competent jurisdiction, that adjudication is final, whether it
takes the form of an acquittal or a conviction, and it may be pleaded in bar of
a subsequent prosecution for the same offence... Provided that the adjudication
be by a Court of competent jurisdiction, it is immaterial whether it be upon a
summary proceeding before justices or upon a trial before a jury.

[Page 350]

I have already indicated my view that, in the
circumstances of the case at bar, the withdrawal of the charge before the
learned magistrate was tantamount to an acquittal.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The circumstances giving rise to
this appeal are fully stated in the reasons for judgment of my brother
Cartwright and need not be related here to a similar extent.

A first information, laid and sworn to on
January 17, 1956, charged respondent with having, on March 16, 1955, failed to
stop at the scene of an accident, contrary to s. 221(2)  of the Criminal
Code . Such an offence may be prosecuted by way of indictment or of summary
conviction at the option of the complainant. The information here having been
laid and sworn to more than six months after the date of the alleged violation,
proceedings in the latter form were then barfed by the provisions of s. 693(2) 
reading:

693(2). No proceedings shall be instituted
more than six months after the time when the subject matter of the proceedings
arose.

Notwithstanding the clear terms of this
statutory prohibition, counsel for the Crown was requested, upon arraignment of
respondent, to elect and elected to proceed by way of summary conviction.
Whereupon respondent pleaded not guilty, and, promptly invoking the statutory
prohibition, moved for the dismissal of the charge. The magistrate refused to
grant this motion, permitting instead the withdrawal of the information.
Respondent was immediately arraigned upon a fresh information, couched in terms
similar to those of the first, and was ultimately indicted and convicted.

The submission of respondent, rejected by the
trial judge but accepted in the Court of Appeal, is that, the Crown having no
right to change its election and withdraw the information after the plea of not
guilty, such withdrawal was therefore tantamount to a dismissal giving rise to
a plea of autrefois acquit.

[Page 351]

In my respectful view, it is unnecessary to deal
with the merits of the conclusion of this proposition, for the premises upon
which it rests are not established. In the circumstances of this case, there
were no right for the Crown to, elect to proceed by way of summary conviction
and no jurisdiction for the magistrate to accept and act upon the election by
receiving a plea. On the face of the information itself, it was manifest that
more than six months had elapsed from the date when the subject matter of the
proceedings had arisen; and of its nature the offence charged was not capable
of being one having a continuing character. Non‑compliance with the
statutory requirement of s. 693(2)  was fatal to the validity of the election
and plea, both of which were void.

Other grounds of appeal were raised by the
accused in the Court of Appeal but were abandoned at the hearing before us.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my
Lord the Chief Justice.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Parties to
offences—Carrying out common unlawful purpose—Attempt to commit robbery—Killing
by one participant—Charge to jury—The Criminal Code , 1953—54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
21, 24, 201, 202.

G and C were jointly indicted for the murder of a police
constable, the Crown's case being that while the two men were engaged in an
attempt to rob the premises of W. Co., G shot the constable and that C,
""in complicity with [G], was a party with [G] to the said crime of
murder"". Both accused were convicted and appealed. G's appeal was
dismissed but a new trial was ordered for C on grounds of misdirection. The
Crown appealed.

Held (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and the conviction should be restored.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.:
There was evidence that G and C formed an intention in common to carry out the
unlawful purpose of robbery with violence, and to assist each other therein,
that in carrying out that common purpose G committed murder, and that C knew,
or ought to have known, that murder would be a probable consequence. It was
unnecessary to decide whether the words ""in carrying out the common
purpose"" in s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  should be construed as
requiring acts going beyond mere preparation for an offence and amounting to an
attempt as defined in s. 24 , because in this case the evidence disclosed that
the acts of the two accused did in fact amount to an attempt to rob.

Section 24(2) requires the presiding judge to determine, as a
matter of law, whether or not the acts of the accused constitute an attempt,
but that determination must be in substance a finding of fact. His function is
not merely to decide, in a given case, that there is no evidence of an attempt
and therefore withdraw that issue from the jury, but

[Page 267]

also to decide, as a question of fact and law, whether what
was done, if found by the jury, amounted to an attempt. Regina v.
Miskell, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 438 at 440, does not express the law of Canada
as laid down in s. 24(2).

There was no evidence from which the jury could have found
that the common intention had been abandoned before the constable was shot. In
any event, this issue was not withdrawn from the jury; it was left to them to
find whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the common
intention persisted.

Per Rand J.: Assuming that the Crown, because of the
position taken by counsel in opening, was bound to prove an intent to rob W.
Co. rather than a mere intent to reconnoitre with or without an intent to rob
generally, the trial judge had made it clear to the jury that the intent that
they must find was the specific one to rob W. Co. It was by no means clear that
s. 21(2)  was restricted to cases where an attempted offence had been reached
but, in any event, the trial judge's finding that the acts alleged, if the jury
found them to have been done, amounted to an attempt, could not be successfully
challenged. Although there was no direct evidence that it was part of the
common intention to overcome all resistance by force of arms, that intention
could be found as an inference from the total circumstances of the case. The
question of an abandonment of the intent to rob had not been withdrawn from the
jury.

Per Locke J., dissenting: It is not a necessary
element of liability under s. 21(2)  that the acts done in carrying out the
common purpose should be such as to amount to an attempt, as defined in s. 24,
but what was said by the trial judge in this case amounted to taking away from
the jury the decision of the question of fact as to whether there had been an
attempt.

Further, there was evidence on which the jury might have found
that, even assuming that there had been an attempt, it had been abandoned at
the time of the shooting. Although the trial judge told the jury that this
question was for them, he also told them on two occasions that there was no
evidence that the attempt had been abandoned, and the effect of this would be
that the jury would not consider the matter.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: If, as was
probable from the charge, the jury were directing their minds to s. 202 (d)
(i) in connection with C's guilt, it was of vital importance that they should
consider whether G caused the constable's death while committing or attempting
to commit robbery. Assuming, without deciding, that the trial judge was right
in telling the jury that if they found the facts which he outlined to them they
must accept his ruling that both the accused had committed the offence of
attempted robbery, he was wrong in withdrawing from them (as in fact he did)
the question whether the attempt had been abandoned before the firing of the
fatal shots. What he told them in effect was that if they once found that the
attempt to rob was made, they had no choice but to find that that attempt
continued up to the time of the shooting. Since there was evidence on which the
jury might have found that the attempt, if made, had been abandoned, the
verdict could not stand…. 

[Page 268]

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent for murder, and ordering a new
trial. Appeal allowed.

William A. Schultz, Q.C.,
for the appellant.

Norman D. Mullins, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and
Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an
appeal by the Attorney-General for British
 Columbia from a decision of the Court
of Appeal for that Province [2],
setting aside the conviction of murder of the respondent Carey and directing a
new trial. The appeal is based upon the grounds of dissent of Mr. Justice
Sidney Smith.

Carey and Gordon were jointly
indicted for the murder of police constable Sinclair on December 7, 1955, at
the city of Vancouver, the allegation being that Gordon fired the bullet, or
bullets, which killed Sinclair and that Carey ""in complicity with the said
Joseph Gordon, was a party with the said Joseph Gordon to the said crime of
murder"". A motion by Carey for a separate trial was denied. Gordon called
witnesses and testified himself in an endeavour to prove an alibi but Carey
elected to call no witnesses and did not go into the witness-box. At the
conclusion of a very lengthy trial both accused were found guilty. Gordon's
conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and his application for leave to
appeal to this Court was dismissed.

In his factum Mr. Mullins,
counsel for the respondent, set forth the three matters of dissent to which the
Crown was restricted in its appeal as:

(1) misdirection by the trial
judge ""with respect to preparation as opposed to attempt"";

(2) misdirection by the trial
judge ""in failing to distinguish between intent to rob generally and
intent to rob Watkins Winram"";

(3) misdirection by the trial
judge ""with respect to abandonment"".

Mr. Schultz, for the Crown, may
have put the points of dissent in a different form but the substance is the
same.

[Page 269]

So far as the events of December 7, 1955,
are concerned, the main, but not the only, evidence against the respondent
depended upon the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Nielson and of one Goll; and also
upon the testimony, apparently given unwillingly, as might be expected, of (a)
Noreen Lewry, who was living with the respondent although not married to him,
and (b) Robert Smith, a friend of both accused who accompanied them,
together with Mrs. Lewry and the six weeks' old child of her and the
respondent, to the vicinity of the fatal shooting. There was evidence that,
within the meaning of subs. (2) of s. 21  of the Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, Gordon and the respondent formed an intention in common to carry
out an unlawful purpose (i.e., to rob with violence) and to assist each
other therein. There was also evidence that in carrying out that common purpose
Gordon committed the offence of murder and that the respondent knew or ought to
have known that murder would be a probable consequence of carrying out the
common purpose. Mr. Justice Davey considered that the trial judge erred in
omitting reference to the suggestion that Gordon had a strong personal motive
to kill and that, therefore, the shooting was not part of a common purpose.
While it is necessary for a trial judge to put to the jury any defence which is
open, I am unable to find in the present case any evidence to found such a
contention.

About 5.30 o'clock in the
afternoon of December 7, 1955, Gordon arrived at the premises where the
respondent lived with Mrs. Lewry and their child. The respondent and Mrs. Lewry
had just finished eating a meal when Gordon arrived. Shortly thereafter the
respondent left his suite and during his absence Gordon picked up a duster,
tied a knot in the top, and placed it over his head and Mrs. Lewry cut out two
eyeholes, thereby making a mask. Gordon stated to Mrs. Lewry that he needed
$2,000 by the afternoon of December 8, on which day he expected to be committed
for trial on a bank robbery charge and that he intended to obtain the $2,000 by
armed robbery. Gordon had in his possession a .38-calibre Webley revolver and
wrapped it in the mask and placed both in one pocket of his overcoat. A .45-calibre
semi-automatic pistol, which it was proved had been in the possession of the
respondent in the previous month, appeared on December 7 on the kitchen table
in

[Page 270]

the respondent's premises,
although Mrs. Lewry testified that she did not know how it had got there. Upon
the respondent's return to the kitchen Gordon took the .45 pistol from the
table and put it in the other pocket of his overcoat.

Mrs. Lewry, the baby and the
respondent left the latter's premises in an automobile driven by Gordon. On the
trip Mrs. Lewry noticed an automobile driven by Robert Smith, who left his car
and entered Gordon's. She had already testified that it had been agreed between
her and the accused that they should go to a friend's house for dinner in Burnaby, but
that would be to the east, whereas the car proceeded west. It stopped at
Skilling Brothers fuel office. Whatever may be the description of the attention
paid to those premises Gordon drove farther west and parked his car under the
new Granville Street bridge about 200 feet directly west of the rear of
Watkins-Winram fuel office, the front of which faced Granville Street. Before parking the car Gordon had driven north on Granville Street
past the front of the Watkins-Winram premises, which were lighted and wherein
two employees working in the office could be seen, together with a vault and a
safe.

Mr. and Mrs. Nielson saw two men,
who the jury might believe were Gordon and the respondent, examining the rear
of the Watkins-Winram premises. One of the men drew on a pair of white gloves
and the other man was seen to perform movements which indicated that he was
doing the same thing. One of the men placed a mask on his head. Two men
proceeded north on what is described as the north-south lane to Third Avenue.
It was as a result of a telephone message by Nielson that the police were
alerted and police constable Sinclair was shot and killed. After the shots
which killed Sinclair were fired, the respondent and Gordon ran in different
directions. Gordon's car which, in the meantime, had been moved by Smith to a
different location, but still generally speaking at the rear of the Watkins-Winram
premises, was, with Mrs. Lewry and the infant as passengers, driven by Smith
from its last position to Fourth Avenue where it stopped and shortly thereafter was entered
by the two accused. The car then proceeded to the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue
and Fir Street where the two accused alighted from the car and ran
in different directions.

[Page 271]

Before entering an apartment
building on west Fifth Avenue the respondent threw the .45-calibre semi-automatic
pistol on the lawn of adjoining premises, whence it was recovered within a half-hour
and bore no fingerprints. Gordon was taken into custody that same night but the
respondent was not located until a long time later in Toronto, Ontario.

The evidence was overwhelming and
the trial judge, in a charge that was necessarily lengthy, left it to the jury
to find, as regards the respondent, what was necessary in order to substantiate
his guilt, including an intention in common with Gordon to carry out an
unlawful purpose of robbing with violence, in general. In the course of his
able argument Mr. Mullins contended that the words in subs. (2) of s. 21  of the
Criminal Code  ""in carrying out the common purpose"" should be
construed in the same way as the words in subs. (1) of s. 24 , ""does or
omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention"", and
should be related to subs. (2) of s. 24 :

The question whether an act
or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not
mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt
to commit the offence, is a question of law.

It is not necessary to determine
that point because, even if the argument be sound, the evidence discloses that
in carrying out the common purpose of robbery much more than mere preparation
took place and in fact that there was an attempt. The charge to the jury was
sufficient upon the question of ""carrying out the common purpose"" of
robbery in general.

Because of the fact that the
accused and Gordon were being tried jointly and because of Gordon's defence of
an alibi, it was necessary that the trial judge should deal with the charge
against the two accused in a comprehensive manner. As to point no. 2, that he
failed to distinguish between intent to rob generally and the intent to rob
Watkins-Winram, some members of the Court of Appeal considered that in his
charge the trial judge after itemizing a number of events dealt with the matter
in such a way as to confuse the jury. In my opinion, with respect, this is not
so and the trial judge did in fact distinguish between the two cases. As to the
carrying out of the intention to rob Watkins-Winram,

[Page 272]

the trial judge told the jury
that in accordance with subs. (2) of s. 24 of the Code, he had determined as a
matter of law that certain facts relied upon by the Crown were not too remote
to constitute an attempt to commit the offence of robbing Watkins-Winram with
violence. Following the listing of the events referred to, the trial judge said
this, which is particularly objected to: ""It is not necessary that you
find positively all but at least if you find substantially all these facts have
been established beyond a reasonable doubt, then my instruction to you is that
there was an attempted robbery."" In my opinion the subsection requires the
presiding judge to determine as a matter of law the point mentioned but that
determination must be in substance a finding of fact. Mr. Justice Coady
considered that this would invade the province of the jury and referred to a
number of cases, none of which, however, in my view, so holds. In Regina v.
Miskell [3],
Hilbery J. stated:

Once it is decided by the
court that what the accused has done can be an attempt to commit the crime, it
is a question of fact for the jury whether what was done should be decided to
have been an attempt.

Even if that be so at common law,
it is not the position under subs. (2) of s. 24  of the Criminal Code .
The jury must, of course, decide the question of intention and consider any
other defence raised on behalf of the accused, but the question of attempt or
no attempt is for the judge. His function is not merely to decide in a given
case that there is no evidence of an attempt and, therefore, withdraw that
issue from the jury, but also to decide as a question of fact and a question of
law whether what was done, if found by the jury, was an attempt. There is
nothing inconsistent with this in the decision in Henderson v. The King [4],
or in any of the other cases referred to. Here it was left to the jury to
determine whether the facts had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is
said that the effect of his charge was to withdraw from the jury the
consideration of all the other circumstances but upon a careful reading of the
charge, in which at several points it was made clear that the jury was the
arbiter of facts, in my opinion this is not so.

[Page 273]

As to the third ground of
dissent, Mr. Justice Coady considered that there was some evidence for the jury
to consider, assuming the intention and attempt to rob Watkins-Winram was
established, that the two accused were not continuing their attempt but had
abandoned it. With respect, I can find no evidence of abandonment. Even if
there be such evidence, I am satisfied that it was left to the jury to find
whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the common intention
either to rob generally or to rob Watkins-Winram persisted down to the time of
the firing of the shots by Gordon. The last sentence of the following extract
is relied upon as indicating that this point was removed from the consideration
of the jury:

Then counsel takes another
position: He says, ""If you think I was there and this venture was more
than a preparation, was actually an attempt, then we abandoned it; we didn't go
through with it, and if we have abandoned it, then the section won't apply,
because we were not engaging in attempting to commit a robbery."" Well,
that is a matter for you. The only evidence we have on that point is that two
men were seen, one with the mask, and then after they had looked in the window
of Watkins-Winram they came around the corner and along Third Avenue.
We have no evidence except the gun shot after that, two bullets. If you
conclude there was an attempt, we have no evidence that it was ever abandoned;
at least, I think that is the situation; it is a matter for you. But, to be
frank, I could not quite follow Mr. LePage in his argument that there was an
abandonment. I can recall no evidence that there was—if there was an attempt,
there was no evidence that that attempt was abandoned.

However, in view of the earlier
part where the judge told the jury that it was a matter for them and in view of
the many other places in the charge where he made it clear that they were the
judges of the facts, my conclusion is that the matter was not withdrawn from
their consideration.

When the trial judge was dealing
with the defences of provocation, accident and self-defence he left no doubt
that he was withdrawing them from the jury, as is shown by the following:

I accept the responsibility
of directing you that there is no evidence here that the offender acted in the
heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. Now, if there was some evidence I
would have to leave the matter with you. If I am convinced that there is no
evidence, then I take the responsibility, and I do take the responsibility,
there was no provocation. I likewise direct you that there is no evidence that
the shooting was done by accident or in self-defence. You are relieved from
considering provocation, accident and self-defence.

[Page 274]

The jury could not fail to be
impressed by a comparison between that language and what was said by the trial
judge in connection with the point of abandonment.

It was argued that the opening by
counsel for the Crown indicated that the Crown was proposing to prove only that
the common intention was to rob Watkins-Winram and not to rob generally and
that if that had not been understood the accused might have been put in the
witness-box. When one reads the indictment and the opening address of Crown
counsel it is impossible to say that the scope of the case alleged against the
respondent was restricted.

Mr. Mullins, as he was entitled
to do, referred to the following additional points which had been raised by him
on behalf of the respondent before the Court of Appeal but which were not dealt
with by the members of that Court, in view of the disposition made of the
appeal:

(a) Comment on the
character of the accused. None of the matters referred to in this heading
appear to me to have any substance.

(b) Comment on the
failure of the accused to testify. Having considered the extracts relied on
in connection with the entire charge, I am of opinion that there was no such
comment.

(c) Misdirection by
twisting, misinterpretation, and misconception of evidence. I can find no
evidence of this in the charge of the trial judge. If there was any slight
error as to what had been said by any of the witnesses, the trial judge made it
abundantly clear that the members of the jury were to rely upon their own
recollection as to the evidence and he pointed out that in case of any question
arising, reference could be had to the notes of the reporter.

(d) Misdirection by
deprecating and rebutting defence submissions and failing to put the defence as
fully and fairly as the Crown's case. I can find no basis for this
objection.

The appeal should be allowed, the
order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the conviction of the respondent
restored.

RAND J.:—I agree generally with
the reasons and conclusions of the Chief Justice, but in the particular
circumstances I think it desirable to state in my own words the considerations
which to me seem controlling.

[Page 275]

Mr. Mullins contended that the
prosecution had, on opening the case, bound itself to the view that both Gordon
and Carey, in carrying out their purpose, that is, to rob Watkins-Winram, had
been guilty of an attempt to commit that offence. As a result, it was said, of
having taken this position, the accused was not called as a witness and, on the
footing that attempt had not been reached, the Crown could not now urge that
the death could be inferred as a probable consequence of a general purpose to
rob.

I find it unnecessary to examine
this contention. I will assume, though I do not accept it, that the Crown is so
bound but for the reasons which follow the point ceases to be material.

The ground on which Davey J.A.
proceeded was based upon the absence in the charge of an adequate distinction
between the intent to reconnoitre with or without an intent to rob generally,
and the intent specifically to rob Watkins-Winram, and the relation of that
failure both to the question of attempt and of murder being a probable
consequence under s. 21(2) . He seems, also, to have assumed the Crown to have
committed its case to the specific intent and that the acts done amounted to an
attempt. Thus he says [5]:

If there had been only an
intent to rob such likely victim as the prisoners might find during the
reconnaissance, and that intent had not crystallized into an intention to rob
Watkins Winram Ltd.—and it was open to the jury to so find—it would necessarily
follow that there had been no atempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. upon which the
Crown based its case against Carey, for without such intent there could be no
attempt to carry it out as required by s. 24(1).

When Manson J., in considering s.
24 , stressed the intent to commit an offence, he made it abundantly clear that
what he meant was the offence of robbing Watkins-Winram; and his finding that
an attempt had been made was made equally clearly to depend upon that
crystallized and accompanying intent. The other interpretation of the facts,
that, in the critical period and circumstances, there was mere reconnaissance
for some future purpose, was also brought out plainly and distinctly. That was
the substantial defence and to imagine the jury to have lacked full
appreciation of it would be doing much less than justice to the intelligence of
its members. Limited to the specific

[Page 276]

sense of intent and to the
attempt, what was given the jury on the question of probable consequence under
s. 21(2) —and it was given on no other basis—was in fact more favourable to the
accused than seems to have been called for, because it is by no means clear
that s. 21(2)  is restricted to cases where an attempted offence has been
reached. Assuming, as I think to be the case, the charge in relation to intent
in both aspects to have been unobjectionable, the finding by Manson J. that the
acts done did amount to an attempt cannot, in my opinion, be successfully
challenged.

Coady J.A. comments first upon
the statement in the opening address

…that it was a part of the
common intention to overcome all resistance by force of arms either whether
that resistance was encountered outside the premises or inside the premises and
to prevent arrest or detention by the police by shooting if necessary.

It is said that no evidence
relating to such an intention was offered; nothing direct, certainly, but that
it could not have been found as an inference from the total circumstances is,
in my opinion, untenable.

He then proceeds to consider the
manner in which the matter of attempt was dealt with and he concludes that the
trial judge improperly took that question from the jury. What the latter did
was to summarize the material facts with the direction that if they were found
against Carey and his acts had been carried out with the intent to rob Watkins-Winram,
they constituted an attempt to do that. It is said that other matters, not
specified, but relevant to the intent, were in effect excluded. The
interpretation of the main or significant facts as well as the intent obviously
had to be determined in the light and background of the entire situation. That
was reviewed in its details and their relevance to the determinative facts was
obvious. Under s. 24(2) it is for the judge to rule whether the act ""is or
is not mere preparation"", and having ruled that it was not, it necessarily
followed here that there was an attempt. What the judge determines is the
point, in the line of events between the first motion towards a criminal act
and its commission, at which preparation ceases; that done, in such
circumstances as we have here, I know of no intervening area between that stage
and attempt. The acts must be done in carrying out the purpose, admittedly, but
no question of that arises here

[Page 277]

where the intent to rob
specifically was required and has been found: with that intent accompanying
them, there could have been no other object than the specific purpose in doing
them. The direction in this respect is what is given every day to juries that
if they find certain facts, including intent, their verdict will be so and so.

The final submission was that if
there had been an attempt it had been abandoned. I cannot agree that that
question was withdrawn from the jury. What Manson J. said was that, in his
opinion, there was no evidence of it—a view in which I concur—but that it was
for them, the jury, to decide. The last remark in the paragraph quoted by my
brother Cartwright simply repeats what had previously been said and was
expressly qualified to be the trial judge's opinion only.

Unnecessary complication seems to
have been injected into the case. The broad features are simple and it tends
only to confusion to treat them as being subtly and intricately involved. The
second essential question, whether what happened was a probable consequence in
the carrying out of the common and unlawful purpose of robbing Watkins-Winram,
was left with the jury on these, among other, significant matters of evidence:
that the two men had been together alone for some minutes shortly after Gordon
entered Carey's home, that they had passed the front of the office of Watkins-Winram
on Granville Street through the window of which a safe and vault were visible,
that together, after parking their car a short distance to the west, they had
reached the scene of the alleged purpose in the rear of the premises, that
gloves were put on, that one at least was armed with a revolver, that they
looked through a rear window, that the accused had remained near a rear door
for several minutes with a hood on his head though not drawn down over his face
while Gordon went a short distance northerly toward adjoining premises, that
upon his return they walked northerly together on a lane to Third Avenue and
turned east toward Granville Street on which, as mentioned, fronted the Watkins-Winram
premises, a direction opposite to that of their car, and that both had fled the
point of the shooting. A mask was found on a pile of tires a few feet from that
point, and the gun from which the bullet was fired was traced to Gordon who was
in possession

[Page 278]

of it at the time to the
knowledge of Carey. On these damaging facts, supported as they were by those
going back to the arrival of Gordon at the Carey home, the charge, although
susceptible of minor criticism in parts of its order or structure, presented
the determinative issues in such a manner as could be grasped adequately by the
jury.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and restore the conviction.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—The
charge of murder against the respondent Carey was based upon subs. (2) of s. 21 
of the Criminal Code  which reads:

Where two or more persons
form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each
other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits
an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

It is not, in my opinion, a
necessary element of the offence thus defined that the acts done in carrying
out the common purpose referred to are such as to amount to an attempt, within
the meaning of that expression in the Criminal Code . It was, however,
made clear in the opening address to the jury on behalf of the Crown that it
was contended that the unlawful purpose was to hold up and rob the premises of
the Watkins-Winram company, to overcome any resistance by force of arms,
whether that resistance was encountered inside or outside the premises, and to
prevent arrest by the police by shooting if necessary and that at the time
Gordon and Carey encountered Sinclair the offence of attempted robbery had been
committed. In the concluding argument of counsel for the Crown the matter was
put rather differently, the unlawful purpose being then stated as that of
robbery generally, but it was repeated that an attempt had been or was being
made when it was interrupted by the arrival of the police officer.

Counsel for the present respondent
contended before the jury that it was an essential element of the offence
alleged that there had been an attempt to rob the Watkins-Winram company and
that the murder was committed while such attempt was being made and argued that
Gordon, who

[Page 279]

actually fired the shots which
killed Sinclair, was only making a reconnaissance of the premises, presumably
with the purpose of robbing them later.

It was necessary under these
circumstances that the jury should be charged as to what constituted in law an
attempt to commit an offence and it is the manner in which this was done which
constitutes one of the two main grounds upon which the Court of Appeal has
proceeded in directing that there should be a new trial.

Subsection (1) of s. 24  declares
that every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does anything for
the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the
offence. Subsection (2) declares that whether an act or omission by a person
who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit
the offence and too remote to constitute an attempt is a question of law.

Before dealing with ss. 21  and 24 
the learned trial judge explained to the jury the provisions of ss. 201 and
202. In so far as the accused Gordon was concerned, it would appear upon the
evidence that nothing more was required than to explain s. 201. In Carey's
case, however, s. 202 was of vital importance if there had been in fact an
attempt to rob, within the meaning of s. 24 , and that attempt was continuing at
the time the men were intercepted by Constable Sinclair. Carey was shown to
have been aware that Gordon carried a loaded revolver and, if the attempt were
in progress when Sinclair was shot or if he and Gordon were in flight after attempting
to commit the offence of robbery, he would have been a party to the offence
defined in cl. (d) of s. 202, whether or not he knew that the commission
of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common
purpose within subs. (2) of s. 21 .

The learned trial judge informed
the jury that it was necessary for them to find whether or not there had been
an attempt in which Carey was involved and, after saying that an intention to
commit the offence of robbery was necessary in order to find guilt, explained
the difference between what was mere preparation and what would be in law an
attempt. The explanation given was in accordance with that given

[Page 280]

by Blackburn J. in Regina v.
Cheeseman[6], and
that approved in the judgment of this Court in John v. The Queen [7].
Thereafter, after reciting a number of the acts of Carey and Gordon before they
arrived at the premises of the Watkins-Winram company and while they were
there, the learned judge instructed the jury that if they found that
substantially all those facts had been established there had been an attempted
robbery. He did not include among the facts enumerated the fact that, after
whichever of the two men had worn the mask had removed it, they had gone north
in the lane and turned east on Third Avenue, a means by which they might have
reached the front of the premises, as an act done in the course of the attempt.

With the greatest respect for the
learned and experienced trial judge, I think that, for the reasons given by
Coady J.A., this really amounted to taking the decision of the question of fact
as to whether there had been an attempt from the jury. Whether the actions of
Carey and Gordon when they were at the rear of the premises and when they were
going east on Third Avenue when they met the police officer were merely to
reconnoitre the premises with the view of coming at some later time and robbing
the place, or whether they actually intended then and there to attempt to rob,
were matters for the jury alone.

I am further in agreement with
the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the issue as to
whether, assuming there had been an attempt, that attempt had been abandoned at
the time of the shooting was in effect taken away from the jury. The passage
from the charge dealing with this matter is quoted in other reasons to be
delivered and it is unnecessary to repeat it. It is true that the learned judge
said that the matter was one for the jury, but the question as to whether there
was any evidence of abandonment was one of law and for him and not for the jury
and, in the passage quoted, the jury was told twice that there was no evidence
that the attempt was abandoned. In my opinion, the effect of this would be that
the jury would not consider the matter. While the evidence was that when the
two men reached Third Avenue they turned

[Page 281]

to the east, which was away from
the direction in which their waiting car stood, it was at least arguable that
by proceeding to the corner and going from there south on Granville Street they could more quickly reach their car than by proceeding west on
Third Avenue. In my view, the evidence of abandonment was weak, but there was
some, and that was a matter for the jury.

I would accordingly dismiss this
appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
respondent was tried, jointly with one James Gordon, before Manson J. and a
jury on the following charge:

JOSEPH GORDON AND JAMES
CAREY stand charged:

THAT at the City of
Vancouver, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the seventh day of
December, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five,
they, the said JOSEPH GORDON and the said JAMES CAREY, unlawfully did murder
Gordon Sinclair, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and
provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and Dignity, in
that, at the place and on the date aforesaid, the said JOSEPH GORDON did in
fact fire the bullet or bullets which killed the said Gordon Sinclair and did
thereby commit murder, contrary to the Criminal Code , while the said JAMES
CAREY, in complicity with the said Joseph Gordon, was a party with the said
Joseph Gordon to the said crime of murder.

Both accused were convicted.

A summary of the subsequent
proceedings and of the effect of portions of the evidence is given in the
reasons of other members of the Court and I shall endeavour to avoid
repetition.

In his factum, counsel for the
appellant summarizes the errors of law which he alleges are to be found in the
reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal as follows:

It is submitted that the
Court of Appeal, the Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith dissenting, erred in
holding:—

(1) That the learned trial
Judge misdirected the jury in his instructions on ""attempt"" under
section 24(2)  of the Criminal Code , when the learned trial Judge directed the
jury that if the jury found certain enumerated facts to have been proved beyond
a reasonable doubt, then the acts constituted an attempt to commit robbery, as
distinguished from mere preparation to commit the offence and too remote to
constitute an attempt.

(2) That the learned trial
Judge misdirected the jury by instructing the jury that there was an attempt to
commit robbery under section 24(1)  of the Criminal Code .

(3) That the Appellant's
case against the Respondent, under section 21(2) , upon which the Appellant
chose to go to the jury was (a) that the common intention to carry out
an unlawful purpose

[Page 282]

was to rob Watkins Winram
Ltd. and (b) that murder of Sinclair occurred during an attempt to rob
Watkins Winram Ltd., so that the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury on
section 24(1)  of the Criminal Code  by failing to instruct the jury that the
jury must find an intent to rob Watkins Winram Ltd. specifically before the
jury was required to determine the facts of preparation or attempt under
section 24(2) , in order to find an attempt to rob Watkins Winram Ltd.

(4) That the learned trial
Judge failed to put the theory and evidence of the defence relating to (3) in
the manner required by Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495.

(5) That the learned trial
Judge withdrew from the jury the theory of ""abandonment"" of an
attempt to commit robbery.

(6) That there was any
evidence to support the theory of ""abandonment"" of an attempt to
commit robbery.

(7) That the foregoing (1)
to (6), inclusive, or any of them, constituted misdirection going to the
substance of any vital issue in the case of the Respondent under section 21(2) 
of the Criminal Code , or misled the jury, so as to constitute a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice, for which the Respondent should be granted a
new trial.

While Sidney Smith J.A. did not
deal separately with each of these points, he expressed the view that the
charge of the learned trial judge was accurate and adequate; and the right of
the Attorney-General to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 598(1)  (a) of
the Criminal Code  was not challenged.

After having put to the jury the
theory of the Crown that Gordon fired the fatal shots under such circumstances
that he was guilty of murder under s. 201 (a) (i) of the Code
in that he meant to cause Sinclair's death, the learned trial judge also dealt
with s. 202 and in so doing related the terms of that section particularly to
the respondent. He said in part:

Now we pass on to s. 202. That
is the section that you would fall back on so far as Gordon is concerned if you
had any doubt at all about his guilt under s. 201. Mind you, if you find that
Gordon was present and that he fired the shots, then you do not need to worry
about anything after 201, it seems to me. It is for you, of course. Gordon
would be, I am sure, found to be a person who intended to kill Sinclair.
However, he is not the only man who is charged here, and for that reason I want
to correlate 202 to the evidence.

The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that if Gordon while attempting to commit robbery used a
revolver or had it upon his person and the death of Sinclair ensued as a
consequence then Gordon was guilty of murder. This instruction was doubtless
correct under s. 202 (d) (i).

[Page 283]

When the learned judge came to
deal with s. 21(2)  he made it plain to the jury that if they found that Gordon
and Carey formed a common intention to rob and to assist each other in so doing
and, while they were engaged in an attempt to rob, Gordon used a revolver and
Sinclair's death ensued as a consequence, then Carey as well as Gordon would be
guilty of murder if he knew or ought to have known that the commission by
Gordon of murder, as defined in s. 202 (d) (i), would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose to rob. After reading and
rereading the charge I think it most probable that it was on this view of the
evidence that the jury proceeded in finding Carey guilty. Certainly this may
have been the view on which they proceeded, for they had, in the passage quoted
above, been invited to direct particular attention to s. 202 (d)
(i) in considering their verdict as to Carey.

If, as I think probable, the jury
were directing their minds to s. 202 (d) (i) it was of vital
importance that they should consider the question whether Gordon caused
Sinclair's death while committing or attempting to commit robbery. It is
obvious that if the jury concluded that, at the crucial moment, the two accused
were still engaged in an attempt to rob they would answer this question
adversely to the respondent.

Assuming, without deciding, that
the learned trial judge was right in telling the jury that, if they found the
list of facts stated by him, they must accept and follow his ruling that both
accused had committed the offence of attempted robbery, he was, in my
respectful opinion, wrong in withdrawing from them the question whether the
attempt had been abandoned before the firing of the fatal shots.

I agree with the conclusion of
the majority in the Court of Appeal that the learned trial judge did withdraw
this question from the jury. He deals with it in only one passage in his
charge, which is as follows:

Then counsel takes another
position: He says, ""If you think I was there and this venture was more
than a preparation, was actually an attempt, then we abandoned it; we didn't go
through with it, and if we have abandoned it, then the section won't apply,
because we were not engaging in attempting to commit a robbery."" Well,
that is a matter for you. The only evidence we have on that point is that two
men were seen, one with the mask, and then after they had looked in the window
of Watkins Winram they came around the corner and along Third Avenue.

[Page 284]

We have no evidence except
the gun shot after that, two bullets. If you conclude there was an attempt, we
have no evidence that it was ever abandoned; at least, I think that is the
situation; it is a matter for you. But, to be frank, I could not quite follow
Mr. LePage in his argument that there was an abandonment, I can recall no
evidence that there was—if there was an attempt, there was no evidence that
that attempt was abandoned.

It is true that twice in this
passage the learned judge tells the jury that it is a matter for them; but, in
my opinion, the concluding words which I have italicized would be taken by the
jury as the final word of the judge that there was no evidence of abandonment
for them to consider and would prevent them from giving any further
consideration to the matter.

It appears to me that the learned
trial judge told the jury, in effect, that if they once found that the attempt
to rob was made, they had no choice but to find that such attempt was
continuing at the crucial moment.

I share the view of the majority
in the Court of Appeal that on the evidence in the record it was open to the
jury to find that if an attempt had been made it had been abandoned and so at
the moment the fatal shots were fired the accused were neither committing nor
attempting to commit robbery; and, consequently, I agree with their conclusion
that the verdict cannot stand.

This renders it unnecessary for
me to deal with any of the other matters which were discussed before us.

I would dismiss the appeal.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal law—Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada—Extension of time—”Special reasons”—The Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51, s. 597(1)(b), as re-enacted by 1956, c. 48, s. 19 .

The discretionary power given to the Supreme Court, or a judge
of that Court, to extend the time within which leave to appeal may be obtained
under s. 597(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code , as re-enacted in 1956,
is conditional upon the existence of “special reasons”. A mere agreement
between counsel, made for their own convenience, as to the date on which an
application for leave will be made does not come within the meaning of these
words.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from two judgments of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario 1,
dismissing appeals from convictions.

C. L. Dubin, Q.C., for
the appellant, applicant.

W. M. Martin, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—The
appellant applied for leave to appeal from two judgments of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. The first, pronounced on October 17, 1956 2, affirmed his conviction on an
indictment charging him with possession and sale of a drug, contrary to the
provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The second, delivered on
the 24th of the same month, affirmed his conviction as being an habitual
criminal. The grounds, upon which leave to appeal is applied for, admittedly
raise important questions of law involving conflicting judgments of other
Courts of Appeal.

The application, however, is made under s. 597(1)  (b)
of the Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, as re-enacted in 1956 by
4-5 Eliz. II, c. 48, s. 19. The section provides for a right of appeal on any
question of law, if leave is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within
21 days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for
special reasons, allow. Counsel for the

[Page 120]

applicant was therefore invited to indicate what special
reasons, if any, could afford a justification for this Court to extend, for a
period of nearly three months, the period of time within which the application
for leave was made in this case. It was intimated to us that immediately
subsequent to the pronouncement of these judgments, counsel for the appellant
informed counsel for the respondent of an intention to appeal and suggested
that the application for leave should be made at a time convenient to both. To
this suggestion, counsel for the Crown assented in view of the importance of
the questions and of the sentence of preventive detention.

It must be noted that the exercise of the discretionary
power given to this Court or to a member thereof to extend the period of time
within which an application for leave may be made under s. 597(1) (b), is
conditional upon the existence of special reasons. Mere agreements which, for
their own convenience, counsel may care to make, do not come within the meaning
of special reasons and are foreign to the diligence required in the
administration of justice and which the expression “special reasons” is
particularly meant to foster. It may be, as. it was intimated by both counsel,
that there was a misapprehension as to the practice before this Court. However,
with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it is now emphasized that this
should” no longer be the case in the future. Under all the circumstances, we
feel that to do justice to this case, leave should not be refused on this point
which was raised by the Court.

Leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario affirming, on October 17, 1956, the conviction of the appellant, is
granted on the grounds numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the application.

With respect to the judgment of October 24, 1956, affirming
the conviction of being an habitual criminal, leave to appeal is granted
conditionally upon the appeal from the judgment of October 17, 1956, being
successful.

Leave to appeal granted.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Fraud and misrepresentation—Pleading—Necessity
for precision—Immaterial variation between pleading and facts established in
evidence.

[Page 57]

Although it is well established by the
authorities that a party relying upon allegations of fraud must plead them with
precision, the rule does not go so far as to require that a plaintiff’s action
be dismissed if the misrepresentation on which he relies is pleaded as an oral
one while the evidence at the trial proves that misrepresentation, but made in
writing. If every fact necessary to make up the cause of action for deceit is
pleaded, and the variance between the pleading and proof cannot have resulted
in the defendant failing to call evidence that he would otherwise have adduced,
or prejudiced him in any way in the conduct of his defence, the plaintiff is
entitled to succeed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1],
reversing a judgment of Barlow J. Appeal dismissed.

J.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendants,
appellants.

E.G. Black, Q.C., for the plaintiffs,
respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, setting aside a judgment of
Barlow J. and directing judgment to be entered in favour of the respondents for
damages to be assessed by the Master. Counsel agree that the amount in
controversy in the appeal exceeds $2,000.

The action is for damages for deceit.

On March 18, 1954, the respondents signed an
offer in writing to exchange certain properties owned by them for a summer
hotel property owned by the appellants at a valuation of $35,000. The offer was
accepted on March 30, 1954. The contract was carried out in due course and the
respondents took possession of the hotel property on May 1, 1954. They carried
on the hotel business from that date until the commencement of their action on
November 14, 1954.

The misrepresentation relied on by the
respondents was pleaded in para. 3 of the statement of claim as follows:

3. Prior to the making of the said offer by
the plaintiffs, the defendants each represented to the plaintiffs, orally, that
the business done by them in the year 1953 in the Rice Lake House at Gore’s
Landing amounted to $16,000. This representation was made by the defendants for
the purpose of inducing the plaintiffs to make an offer, was false to the
knowledge of the defendants, and was relied upon by the plaintiffs and was one
of the principal reasons that the plaintiffs made the said offer.

Laidlaw J.A. delivered the unanimous judgment of
the Court of Appeal. After a careful review of the evidence and giving full
weight to the opinion of the learned trial judge

[Page 58]

as to the credibility of certain witnesses, he
made findings of fact which in my opinion are correct. These may be summarized
as follows:

The appellants employed one Anderson as their
agent to find a purchaser for the hotel property. The appellant Mrs. Junkin,
acting for her husband, the other appellant, as well as for herself, told
Anderson that the gross revenue from the hotel business was approximately
$16,000 and the net profit after paying expenses approximately $9,700.
Mrs. Junkin intended that this information should be given by Anderson to
prospective purchasers as an inducement to make an offer. The information was
false, and Mrs. Junkin knew it was false. Anderson gave this information to the
respondents in writing on March 7, 1954. The respondents relied upon it and
were induced by it to make their offer to purchase. The respondents suffered damages
in that the value of the hotel and equipment was less than the price which the
respondents were induced by the false representation to agree to pay. It should
be mentioned that there is no suggestion that Anderson knew of the falsity of
the representation or was in any way a party to the fraud practised upon the
respondents.

Accepting, as I do, the findings of fact made by
the Court of Appeal briefly summarized above, it would appear that the appeal
must fail unless the point taken by Mr. Robinette as to the form of the
pleadings is fatal to the respondents’ case.

While all the findings of fact set out above
were supported by the evidence, the respondents both testified that they were
induced to make their offer by oral representations made to them by the
appellants personally on March 14, 1954, which were identical with those made
in writing by Anderson. The learned trial judge found that the respondents were
mistaken in this evidence and that the oral representations, if made, were made
not on March 14 but on March 28, after the offer had been made.

[Page 59]

Mr. Robinette referred to several decisions in
which it has been held that a party relying upon allegations of fraud must
plead them with precision. In Bell v. Macklin[2], Strong C.J. said at pp. 583-4:

In pleading fraud parties are still,
notwithstanding the laxity in pleading which seems now to some extent to be
countenanced by the Judicature Act, bound to more than ordinary exactitude,
(see observations of Fry J. in Redgrave v. Hurd, 20 Ch.D.1.) and if
there were not more substantial grounds for maintaining the judgment under
appeal it might be worth while to inquire whether a plaintiff could be entitled
to relief in a case charging fraud, when his own statement on oath varies so
materially from his pleading as we find it does here.

The observation of Fry J. to which the learned
Chief Justice referred appears at 20 Ch.D. pp. 5-6. That was an action for
specific performance of a contract to purchase a house. The defence was that
the defendant had been induced to sign the contract by misrepresentation and
there was a counterclaim for damages. Counsel for the plaintiff said in
argument:

The defence is that the contract was
induced by misrepresentation. The misrepresentations relied upon ought to be
specifically stated in the pleadings… The Judicature Act has made no
difference in this respect.

and Fry J. observed:

I do not think the Judicature Act affects
such a question as this, because it is only fair play between man and man that
the Plaintiff should know what is charged against him.

In Graham Sanson & Co. v. Ramsay[3], Masten J., as he then was, speaking for
the majority of the Appellate Division, said at p. 79:

By our Rules (see 141 and 143) fraud is not
to be alleged generally, but the particular matters constituting the fraud must
be specifically alleged. These Rules should be taken to apply to every
misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent.

In Washburn v. Wright[4], Riddell J., as he then was,
delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division, said at p. 144:

The learned Judge has found fraud, in my
opinion wrongly. No fraud is charged; the itemised statement is set up by the
statement of defence as a defence, and this is not met by a plea of fraud. We
have recently said: “It is not too much to require any one who intends to
charge another with fraud…to take the responsibility of making that charge in
plain terms”…and the person making the charge is confined to the particular
fraud charged.

[Page 60]

At p. 145 the learned judge added:

Nothing further is said about fraud during
the trial, and it is obvious, I think, that the question of fraud was not gone
into at all.

Notwithstanding all this, if the facts
proved established fraud, we might now allow an ‘amendment, and, if all the
facts were before the Court, permit the finding of fraud to stand, or, if all
the facts were not or might not be before the Court, direct a new trial.

I have no wish to suggest any doubt as to the
accuracy of any of these statements but, in my opinion, they are not applicable
to the circumstances of the case at bar. The weight of the charge made by the
respondents against the appellants in the case before us is that the latter
tricked the former into offering $35,000 for the hotel property by the
representation, false to the knowledge of the appellants, that the business
done by them in the year 1953 in the hotel amounted to $16,000. Every fact
necessary to make up the cause of action for deceit was pleaded and I have
already indicated my agreement with the finding of Laidlaw J.A. that every such
fact was proved. What is urged for the appellants is that while the respondents
proved the making of the very representation pleaded their action cannot be
maintained because in their pleading they stated it was made orally but by
their evidence they proved it was made in writing.

If it appeared that this variance between the
pleading and the proof could have resulted in the appellants failing to call
evidence which they would otherwise have adduced, or that it prejudiced them in
any way in the conduct of their defence, it might well be that the judgment
could not stand and that the question whether a new trial should be ordered
would arise; but, in my opinion, in the particular circumstances of this case
the variance was immaterial and caused no prejudice to the defence.

In his reasons the learned trial judge does not
refer to this question of pleading but does deal with the representation made
by Anderson. He says in part:

The plaintiffs allege that one Anderson,
whom they allege was the agent of the defendants, on the 7th March 1954 gave
them a statement showing gross earnings of the hotel during 1953 of $16,000,
and a net profit of about $9,700.

His reasons for rejecting the respondents’
claim, so far as it was based on this allegation, proceed not on the form of
the pleadings but on his view that the evidence did not satisfy

[Page 61]

him, (i) that the representation was false, or
(ii) that Anderson was the
agent of the appellants. Laidlaw J.A. took a different view of the effect of
the evidence on these two points and, as already stated, I agree with his
findings. The learned justice of appeal makes no mention in his reasons of the
point of pleading and it is a reasonable inference that either it was not
raised or he regarded it as immaterial. In my opinion, no amendment of the
pleadings is now necessary.

It was argued that the respondents failed to
prove damage but I agree with the Court of Appeal that damage was shown and
that in the circumstances of this case the proper course was to direct a
reference. The reasons of Laidlaw J.A. state correctly the principles to be
applied in assessing the damages.

For the reasons given by Laidlaw J.A. and those
set out above, I would dismiss the appeal with costs, with the usual provisions
as to a married woman in the case of the appellant Yetta Junkin.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

The accused was found guilty of murder by a mixed jury. His
conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal. His appeal from the
dismissal by a judge of this Court of his application for leave to appeal was
dismissed on the ground that this Court was without jurisdiction.

[Page 192]

Pursuant to s. 55; of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the Governor General in Council then
referred the following question to this Court: ""If the application made by
Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been
granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, what disposition
of the appeal would now be made by the Court?""

Held: Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and
Fauteux JJ. would have dismissed the appeal. Locke and Cartwright JJ. would
have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: The evidence was
such that a legally instructed jury could reasonably find the accused guilty.

If the possession of recently stolen goods is not explained
satisfactorily, they are presumed to have. been acquired illegally. That
possession may, also indicate not only robbery, but a more serious crime
related to robbery. There is no doubt that the jury did not accept the
accused's explanations and that they could justly conclude that he was the
thief. Thus they could see therein a motive for the murder -and it was à; which they could legally take into account.

The judge was not obliged to tell the jury that they were not
entitled to convict of murder"" simply because they came to the conclusion
that he was guilty of theft. The recent possession not only created the
presumption, failing explanation, that he had stolen, but the jury had the
right to conclude that it was a link in the chain of circumstances which
indicated that he had committed the murder.

Any possible inaccuracies in the early part of the judge's
direction in regard to the nature of the evidence, was subsequently remedied.
The rule in the Hodge's case was entirely respected.

The evidence of the police officer that as the result of
""precise information"" toe searched for a rifle at the accused's camp,
was. not hearsay evidence. The witness was not trying to prove the truth of his
information but merely to establish the reason for his visit.

All necessary precautions to prevent irregularities were taken
to the judge's satisfaction when he allowed the jury to go to the cinema. All
the constables were under oath and it is not suggested that any indiscretions
were committed. Moreover, the judge was exercising his discretion when he gave
the permission after both parties had consented.

It is within the judge's discretion to grant a jury composed
exclusively of persons who speak the accused's language, but if he refuses, he
must grant a mixed jury. He must consider what will best serve the ends of
justice. The interests of society must not be disregarded. The judge decided
that the ends of justice would not be effectively served by granting the
accused's request, for that would have eliminated eighty-five per cent of the
population from taking part in the administration' of justice.

Even if there had been any irregularities concerning the list
of jurors, they would be covered by s. 1011 Cr. C.

There was nothing more logical, since a mixed jury was
concerned, than, to have the judge, counsel for the Crown and for the accused
address the jury in French and in English.

[Page 193]

Nothing in what counsel for the Crown said was such as to
suggest that the jury bring in a verdict based on sentiments and prejudices and
not exclusively on the evidence.

S. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act  does not forbid
refreshing the memory of a witness by means of a previous testimony which he
has given. There was no attempt to discredit or contradict the witness Petrie. She admitted that her memory was better at the time
of the preliminary inquiry. Moreover, this is a question for the judge's
discretion.

Even if there had been some irregularities, s. 1014(c)
Cr. C. would apply, as no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.
The evidence left the jury no alternative. It was entirely consistent with the
guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.

Per Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.: The court has a
discretion, not open to review, to permit leading questions whenever it is considered
necessary in the interests of justice. Moreover, a witness may refresh his
memory by reference to his earlier depositions and s. 9  of the Canada
Evidence Act  applies only when it is attempted to discredit or contradict a
party's own witness.

The contention that, because of the differences between the
addresses of counsel in one language and the other, and between the two charges
delivered by the trial judge, the accused was tried by two groups of jurymen,
and further that s. 944  Cr. C. requires that the jury be addressed by one
counsel only on each side, cannot succeed. The practice followed has been the
invariable one in Quebec since 1892. Neither the differences in the addresses
nor in the charges were of a nature to call for the interference of this Court.

The judge, in exercising his discretion under s. 923  Cr. C,
was right in his view that the ends of justice would be better served with a
mixed jury.

It cannot be said that the accused gave any reasonable
explanation of how he came to be in possession of the things as to which he
even attempted to make an explanation. There was, therefore, abundant evidence
from which the jury could conclude, as they have done, that the possessor of
the money and other items was the robber and murderer as well.

Per Locke J.: The evidence of the police officer that
he acted on ""precise information"" in searching for a rifle in the
vicinity of the accused's camp, was, clearly hearsay evidence and, therefore,
improperly admitted. That evidence, to which so much importance was attached by
counsel for the Crown and by the trial judge when the matter was presented to
the jury, was on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused. It
cannot, therefore, properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and consequently, s. 592 Cr. C, has no application. (Makin
v. A.G. for New South Wales [1894] A.C. 57 and Allen v. The
King 44 S.C.R. 331 followed).

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ.: The evidence that the
police officer had information that a rifle was concealed in a precisely
indicated spot near the accused's camp, was inadmissible as being hearsay
evidence. Proof that an accused has suppressed or endeavoured to suppress
evidence is admissible, but, here, the foundation of the whole incident on
which

[Page 194]

the jury were invited to find that he had suppressed evidence
was this inadmissible hearsay evidence. It related to a vital matter and in
view of the way it was stressed at the trial, counsel for the Crown cannot now
be heard to belittle its importance.

The transcript of the evidence given at the preliminary
inquiry by the witness Petrie was used not for the
purpose of refreshing her memory but for the purpose of endeavouring to have
her admit that she was mistaken or untruthful in giving her evidence at the
trial. The cross-examination of this witness was unlawful and was attended by
further error in that no warning was given to the jury that any evidence of what
she had said at the preliminary inquiry was not evidence of the truth of the
facts then stated but could be considered by them only for the purpose of
testing the credibility of the testimony which she had given at the trial.

Although there is no evidence to suggest that any improper
communication took place on the occasion of the visit to the cinema, this
unfortunate incident falls within the principle stated in Rex v. Masuda
106 C.C.C. at 123 and 124. There is no escape from holding that the
incident was fatal to the validity of the conviction.

The judge did not direct his mind to the question whether the
ends of justice would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury. The reasons
given for the exercise of his discretion under s. 923  Cr. C. were irrelevant.
Whether the empanelling of a jury of the sort requested by the accused would be
attended with difficulty or whether the language of the accused was or was not
that spoken by the majority of the population of the district were irrelevant
considerations. The record has. failed to disclose any ground sufficient in law
to warrant the accused being denied his right to a jury composed entirely of
persons speaking his language. The error is not cured by s. 1011 Cr. C.

S. 1014(2)  does not avail to support the conviction as it is
impossible to affirm with certainty that if none of the above errors had
occurred the jury would necessarily have convicted; furthermore, even if this
could be affirmed, the error in law in admitting the hearsay evidence as to the
rifle was so substantial a wrong that the sub-section can have no application,
as the accused was deprived of his right to a trial by jury according to Jaw.
The errors pertaining to the episode of the cinema and to the empanelling of
the mixed jury are also such as cannot be cured by the sub-section.

The Chief Justice:—For
the reasons given by Mr. Justice Taschereau, my answer to the question referred
to the ] Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.

Taschereau J.:—L'appelant a été traduit devant le tribunal de Percé, district
judiciaire de la Gaspésie, pour répondre à l'accusation d'avoir, au début de
juin , assassiné Richard de Holidaysburg, Pennsylvanie, U.S.A.

Le procès, présidé par l'honorable Juge Gérard
Lacroix, s'est instruit devant un jury de langue française et de langue anglaise,
et l'appelant a été trouvé coupable dans le cours du mois d'août . Ce verdict a
été confirmé unanimement par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de
Québec 1,
et, s'autorisant alors des dispositions du Code Criminel , l'appelant s'est
adressé à l'un des juges en chambre de cette Cour pour obtenir une permission
spéciale d'appeler.Cette permission a été refusée par l'honorable Juge Abbott,
mais les procureurs de l'appelant ont tout de même demandé à cette Cour de
réviser ce jugement de M. le Juge Abbott et d'entendre son appel au mérite. La
Cour en est venue unanimement à la conclusion qu'elle n'avait pas dans
l'espèce, et a en conséquence refusé la demande.

L'appelant a ensuite fait parvenir une requête
au Ministre de la Justice, demandant qu'un nouveau procès lui soit accordé. Le
Gouverneur Général en Conseil, en vertu des dispositions de l'article de la Loi
de la Cour Suprême du Canada, a demandé l'opinion de cette Cour afin de
savoir quel aurait été le jugment rendu, si celle-ci avait entendu l'appel à
son mérite.

La preuve révèle que Hunter Lindsay, accompagné
de son fils Richard, et d'un ami de ce dernier, Frederick Claar, tous trois de
Holidaysburg, Pennsylvanie, quittèrent leur résidence le juin , pour se rendre
faire la chasse à l'ours en Gaspésie. Le voyage qui s'effectuait en camionnette
devait durer environ une dizaine de jours, et les chasseurs projetaient de
revenir chez-eux vers le juin.

Le 8 juin, à Gaspé, ils obtinrent tous trois
leur permis de chasse et de circulation dans la forêt. A la même date, ils

[Page 196]

achètent diverses épiceries chez les marchands
locaux, et le soir, ils s'engagent dans la forêt de Gaspé. Un garde-feu du nom
de Patterson raconte qu'au sud-ouest de Gaspé, sur une petite route qui longe
le nord de la Rivière St-Jean, leur camionnette s'est enlisée dans la vase d'un
ruisseau qu'ils avaient tenté de traverser, et qu'à cause de l'humidité le
moteur avait cessé de fonctionner. Comme ne réussit pas à les remettre sur la
route pour leur permettre de continuer leur voyage, il retourna seul à Gaspé,
situé à quelque dix milles seulement, et leur envoya de l'aide, soit Thomas et
Oscar et Wellie , qui arrivèrent à bord de leur camion le matin du juin et les
tirèrent du ruisseau. On remit le moteur en marche, et le midi du , on revit
les trois chasseurs à Gaspé même. Evidemment, ils sont revenus sur leur chemin,
et déclarent à un marchand local d'essence qu'ils désirent retourner aux camps ,
25 et , situés à l'ouest de Gaspé, mais cette fois non pas en longeant le côté
nord de la Rivière St-Jean, mais par une route différente.

Le lendemain, soit le 10, un garagiste revoit
à Gaspé le plus jeune des trois chasseurs en compagnie de lui-même, dans un
camion d'une demi-tonne et de marque Chevrolet, et portant une licence
canadienne. Le jeune , qui était accompagné de ffin, informa le garagiste
qu'ils sont venus tous trois en Gaspésie faire la chasse à l'ours, mais que
contrairement à leurs habitudes ils n'ont pas eu cette fois recours aux
services d'un guide. Quant à , alors qu'il est seul avec le témoin, il explique
qu'il est revenu avec un individu au village pour faire réparer une pompe à
gazoline défectueuse. Dans un bar où il achète une demi-douzaine de bouteilles
de bière, il reconte qu'en se rendant prospecter dans la forêt, il a rencontré
les trois chasseurs dont la camionnette était en panne. dit qu'il a décelé une
défectuosité dans la pompe et qu'il a remené les américains à Gaspé à bord d'un
, que Billy Baker lui aurait prêté. Le même jour, se rend chez un nommé
Napoléon Gérard, un garagiste, accompagné du jeune , et achète une pompe à
gazoline au prix de $8.80. Coffin n'a demandé à personne de réparer la pompe
défectueuse.

Evidemment, Coffin et les trois sont retournés
immédiatement dans là forêt, dans le camion conduit par , et le , Coffin est revu
à Gaspé dans le même camion, et un

[Page 197]

témoin affirme avoir vu dépasser le canon
d'une carabine. Quant aux voyageurs, on n'en a plus eu de nouvelles. La période
de vacances qu'ils s'étaient fixée s'écoula, et les familles et Claar n'en
entendent plus parler.

La preuve révèle que tard dans la soirée du
juin, T a quitté Gaspé dans le camion antérieurement emprunté de
Baker, mais sans la permission de ce dernier pour ce nouveau voyage. Avant de
partir cependant, il se procura un permis de conducteur, paya quelques dettes
contractées depuis quelque temps, acheta à divers endroits plusieurs bouteilles
de bière, paya l'un des vendeurs avec un billet américain de $20 et exhiba un
canif à usage multiple, plus; tard identifié comme étant la propriété du jeune .
Il se rendit chez sa soeur madame Stanley à qui il montra le même canif. Il se
changea de vêtements et quitta sa soeur sans mentionner sa destination. Dans la
nuit du au juin, vers :30 heure du matin, il arrêta chez un nommé Earle Turzo
de York Centre, à qui il remit une somme de $10, empruntée cinq semaines
auparavant, et se fit remettre un revolver qu'il avait donné en garantie. Il
paya la, traite au whisky à Turzo ainsi qu'à la mère de celui-ci. A :30 heures .M.,
près de Percé, son camion tomba dans le fossé. Un nommé Elément lui aida à en
sortir et se fit payer en billets américains.

A six heures du matin, le 13, Coffin est rendu
à Percé. Il fait son plein d'essence et fait réparer ses freins. Le coût de la
réparation s'élève à $8. Coffin remet au garagiste un billet américain de $20 et
se fait remettre $10, laissant la différence comme pourboire. Il expliqua au
garagiste qu'il lui fallait se rendre à Montréal, ayant reçu un appel
téléphonique en rapport avec une prétendue compagnie américaine, et qu'il ne
pouvait transmettre ses informations ni par téléphone ni par lettre.

Coffin se rend ensuite vers la Vallée de la
Matapédia. Il s'arrête près de où il fait monter à bord de sa camionnette un
nommé Diotte. Là, il s'arrête chez le coiffeur où il ""paye la
traite"". Il donne $10 à Diotte pour acheter un paquet de cigarettes.
Pendant ce temps, il se fait tailler la barbe, couper les cheveux, laver la
tête, et verse la somme de $3 en paiement quand il ne devait que $1.50. Au
cireur de chaussures qui lui demande $0.15, il lui fait cadeau de $1. Vers
midi, le juin, il arrive à

[Page 198]

St-Charles Caplan, verse dans un fossé. Un
camionneur vient lui aider et tire d'un porte-feuilles bien garni, de couleur
brune, un billet américain de $20 et ne demande que $10 de change. A Black
Cape, il fait de nouveau son plein d'essence chez un nommé Campbell, et lui
laisse un pourboire de $1. Il arrête ensuite, vers trois heures de
l'après-midi, à Maria dans le comté de Bonaventure, où il s'endort au volant de
son camion. Un nommé Audet vient le réveiller, invite à entrer chez-lui où in prend
un repas. lui donne $2 et $1 à l'un des enfants. Entre cinq et six heures, il
part en direction de Québec. Le dimanche matin, il est rendu à St-André de
Kamouraska chez un nommé Tardif où il déjeûne, et paye avec un billet de $20 de
dénomination américaine. Comme on ne peut faire la monnaie, il laisse $5 refusant
de recevoir la balance. Apparemment, il a aussi laissé $10 sous une chaise.
Madame Tardif a constaté qu'en payant, il avait tiré de sa poche un gros paquet
de billets. A Montmagny, il tombe de nouveau dans un fossé. Un nommé Chouinard
de Rivière-du-Loup le tire de ce fossé, et lui laisse $5 sur un billet de $10. A
St-Michel de Bellechasse où il couche, il repart le lendemain matin vers sept
heures, et malgré qu'on lui demandait la somme de $2.50, il laisse à l'hôtelier
$5. L'hôtelier remarque que le porte-feuilles est bien garni de papier-monnaie.
Le dimanche , il arrive à Montréal chez sa ""common law wife"" Marion Petrie
. Dans la camionnette de Baker qu'il conduisait toujours, Petrie remarque des
œufs contenus dans une boîte de biscuits soda et une bouteille de sirop ""Old
Type"", précisément une boîte semblable à celle acquise par les chasseurs
chez un épicier de Gaspé, et une bouteille portant la même marque que celle
achetée au même endroit. Petrie voit également une pompe à gazoline qui n'a
jamais été utilisée, et qui est évidemment celle achetée à Gaspé pour les
américains. Dans une valise placée également dans le camion et que les
détectives retrouvent plus tard chez madame Stanley, sœur de , et qui est
identifiée comme appartenant au jeune Claar, on y trouve des serviettes, deux
paires de salopettes que la mère du jeune Claar reconnaît comme étant la
propriété de son fils. Evidemment, ces objets avaient été apportés par le jeune
Claar pour aller faire la chasse au camp , et sont demeurés

[Page 199]

dans le camion de Coffin qui est allé le
reconduire. apporta également à Montréal une paire de jumelles appartenant
aussi à Claar.

Coffin séjourna à Montréal durant environ dix
jours où il achète des épiceries, huit à dix bouteilles de bière
quotidiennement, et dépense sans travailler. En quittant Montréal, il se rend à
Val d'Or, rencontrer un nommé Hastie, courtier en valeurs minières, et celui-ci
consent à se rendre en Gaspésie avec pour y examiner certains dépôts de cuivre.
Le juillet, le lendemain de son arrivée à Gaspé, informe Hastie qu'il lui est
impossible de l'accompagner, car il lui faut aider les policiers dans leurs
recherches commencées depuis quelque temps déjà.

Avant l'arrivée de , on avait retrouvé vers le
juillet la camionnette des chasseurs à un demi-mille du camp , et dans laquelle
se trouvent une carabine et une paire de pantalons. 

Le lendemain de la découverte de la
camionnette, les recherches se poursuivent. Les camps sont visités et, le
juillet, d'importantes découvertes sont faites. Entre les camps et séparés
d'une distance d'environ trois milles, on voit des traces de roues de camions,
et du côté gauche de la route on découvre divers objets, et le lendemain on en
découvre d'autres dissimulés dans les feuillages et d'autres reposant dans le
lit de la rivière qui coule à environ cinquante pieds du chemin. Entre autres,
on y trouve un poèle, un réservoir à essence, un coupe-vent de couleur bleue,
un sac de couchage, qui appartenaient aux américains. On constate aussi la
présence d'un contenant un film qui n'a pas été entièrement exposé, et qui en
est rendu à la cinquième pose sur un total de huit. Il était la propriété du
jeune Claar. On retrouve également un étui à jumelles dans lequel on peut
facilement introduire les jumelles que madame a identifiées, et que l'on
trouvera plus tard dans la forêt à proximité des ossements du jeune ; on trouve
également l'étui à carabine qui a été retrouvé aux environs du camp , non loin
des ossements du jeune Claar. Tous ces objets ont été retrouvés à au delà de
trois milles où la camionnette abandonnée par les américains a été localisée.
Le juillet, une carabine et divers autres objets sont retrouvés. Dans le bois
de cette carabine ony voit une impression laissée par un coup qui

[Page 200]

semble avoir été le résultat d'une balle d'une
autre arme à feu. Le magasin de cette carabine était plein de cartouches, et le
cran de sûreté était à la position ""sure"".

Près de cent pieds plus loin, de l'autre côté
de la rivière qui est large de quinze à vingt pieds, on trouve un squelette
humain complètement décomposé, et le Docteur Roussel-ayant transporté ces
restes à Montréal, conclut qu'il s'agit là des restes d'une personne de sexe
masculin, mesurant environ cinq pieds sept pouces, âgée d'au delà de quarante
ans et dont la mort remonte à au moins un mois depuis l'examen. On trouve
également un porte-feuilles identifié comme appartenant à père, avec certains
documents qui lui appartiennent, mais il n'y a plus un seul sou des $650 qu'il
avait apportés avec lui en billets américains. Il n'est certainement pas permis
de douter qu'il s'agit là du cadavre de père.

Les officiers de police ont continué leurs
recherches afin de trouver les cadavres du jeune Claar et du jeune , et ce
n'est que le juillet, aux environs du camp qui se trouve à deux milles et demi
du camp , où ont été trouvés les ossements de père, que sont découverts les
restes des deux autres américains. A proximité on y relève des pièces de
vêtements, une. paire de jumelles qui appartenait au jeune , et madame la mère
a identifié d'autres vêtements trouvés sur les lieux comme appartenant à son
fils. On a produit en outre à l'enquête un gilet blanc et une chemise de
couleur verte à travers lesquels on aperçoit un trou entouré d'une tache
noirâtre. Tout près, on voit dissimulée une veste de cuir à fermeture éclair,
propriété du jeune , et dont les poches sont retournées et vides. Il est en
preuve que les taches qui entourent les perforations sont du sang humain et que
les trous portent des traces de plomb. Leur site correspond au poumon et au
coeur, et il est logique de conclure qu'il s'agit de perforation produite par
un projectile d'arme à feu. Le Docteur Roussel témoigne que dans les deux cas
il s'agit des cadavres de deux jeunes gens de moins de vingt-cinq ans dont la
date de la mort remonte à la même période que la date de la mort de père. Sur
la chemise du jeune Claar on y aperçoit également des perforations au niveau du
bassin et autour desquelles la présence de dépôts métalliques indique qu'elles
sont attribuables à un projectile

[Page 201]

d'arme à feu. Les mêmes constatations ont été
faites au niveau de la poitrine, par conséquent au niveau d'organes vitaux.

Coffin n'est revenu en Gaspésie qu'après la
découverte de la camionnette et des ossements de père, et ce n'est que le juillet
que les détectives peuvent l'interroger. Ses réponses ne sont pas
satisfaisantes. Ses explications des faits sont boiteuses, contradictoires et
incomplètes, et le récit de ses allées et venues dénote une obstination
persistante à vouloir voiler la vérité. Ainsi, il prétend n'être jamais allé au
camp , et après s'être repris, il soutient qu'il n'est pas allé aux camps et , les
deux endroits où ont été trouvés les ossements, quand il est en preuve que ceci
est faux.

Le matin du 10 après être revenu avec
MacDonald du bois, et avec qui il est entendu qu'il doit retourner, il lui
fausse compagnie, et repart seul dans la direction des chasseurs.Il explique
qu'il préférait faire de la prospection seul. Mais au lieu d'aller faire de la
prospection à la fourche sud de la Rivière St-Jean, il se rend au camp 21. Il
est certain que quand il est retourné, il avait une carabine, car, elle est vue
le soir du 12 par MacGregor. Sur ces points, il ne: fournit pas d'explications.
Comment s'est-il procuré tout cet argent américain, qu'il distribue à
profusion? Oùa-t-il pris les épiceries, cette valise, les vêtements, les
jumelles, le canif, la pompe à gazoline, tous la propriété des chasseurs? Il
n'explique pas qu'il ait emprunté une carabine d'un nommé Eagle, qui n'a jamais
été retournée, et qui n'a jamais été retrouvée. Il ne dit pas non plus la
raison de son voyage à Montréal le soir du 12, ni pourquoi il est parti sans
avertir personne.

Coffin prétend, évidemment pour détourner les
soupçons, que deux autres américains sont allés à la chasse à l'ours avec les
victimes. Personne cependant n'a eu connaissance de leur séjour à Gaspé ou
ailleurs dans la région, à cette période. Aucun permis ne leur aurait été
donné, et on ne retrouve aucune de leurs traces. Ce qui est vrai, c'est que
deux autres américains sont venus à la chasse, en ""jeep"" de marque , et
sont entrés dans la forêt 27 le mai par York River, et qu'ils ont quitté Gaspé
le juin, c'est-à-dire plusieurs jours avant l'arrivée de et de ses compagnons.
De plus, ces chasseurs entendus comme témoins, ont juré n'être jamais allés aux
camps,21, 24, 25 et .26

[Page 202]

Au cours des recherches dans le bois avec les
détectives, qu'il a consenti à accompagner, il feint de ne pas connaître les
lieux. Au camp 24, accompagné des chercheurs, il demande au cours du repas, où
est la source pour aller j chercher l'eau, lui qui est né et a vécu dans ce
pays, et qui le 8 au soir s'était rendu à ce même camp 24 avec MacDonald, et
qui le matin du 9, sur le bord du ruisseau, avait allumé un feu. Il est en
preuve que jamais il ne porte ses regards du côté gauche de la route,
précisément aux endroits où les cadavres ont été trouvés, et où évidemment leur
ont été enlevés tous les objets trouvés en la possession de Coffin.

Avec cette preuve, le jury légalement
instruit, et maître des faits, pouvait raisonnablement trouver l'accusé
coupable. C'est donc avec raison que devant cette Cour, le procureur de
l'accusé a abandonné l'un de ses moyens d'appel, qui était à l'effet qu'il n'y
avait pas de preuve suffisante pour justifier un verdict de culpabilité. La
question de savoir si la ""common law wife"" de , Marion Petrie, était
en vertu de l'article de la Loi de la Preuve du Canada, un témoin compétent à
témoigner contre l'accusé, a été abandonnée également, et n'a pas été soumise à
la considération de cette Cour. Il en est de même d'un grief concernant la
possession récente des objets volés, et se rapportant aux objets qui auraient
été volés et n'appartenant pas à la victime, que est accusé d'avoir assassinée.
On a aussi abandonné le point concernant une prétendue preuve illégale, se
rapportant aux photographies des ossements des victimes, ainsi que celui
relatif à la réplique, exercés par l'un des avocats de la Couronne.

Il reste donc à être déterminés par cette
Cour, les points suivants, que je reproduis en anglais, la langue dans laquelle
ils nous ont été soumis:—

1: Did the Learned Trial Judge err
in respect to the instructions he gave to the jury ""with reference to the
doctrine of recent possession in the following manner:—

(a) Should .the jury have
been permitted to apply the doctrine at all?

(b) Were the jury
misdirected with reference to the burden resting on the Appellant to explain
his possession of items allegedly stolen?

2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in failing to instruct
the jury that they were not entitled to convict the Appellant of murder simply
because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of the theft of the
various articles proved to have been the property of the victim, Richard
Lindsay, and his associates?

[Page 203]

3. Did the Learned Trial Judge err by instructing the jury
in a manner that would indicate the statements and declarations made by the
Appellant to various witnesses were not to be regarded as circumstantial
evidence and evidence therefore to which the rule in Hodge's case should be
applied?

4. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting evidence
concerning a certain rifle the property of one Jack Eagle?

5. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in permitting the jury to
attend a moving picture theatre in the company of two police officers who were
subsequently called as witnesses for the Crown?

6. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in refusing the
application made on behalf of the Appellant to be tried by a jury composed
entirely of English-speaking citizens?

7. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the failure of the Sheriff of the County in which the Appellant was
tried to comply with the provisions of the Quebec Jury Act (1945, 9 George VI,
Chap. 22)?

8. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the improper mixture of the English and French language?

9. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the fact that Crown Counsel in their addresses to the jury used
inflammatory language?

10. That Marion Petrie, being a
Crown Witness, was submitted to a cross-examination by the Crown counsel,
although she was not declared hostile.

Au soutien de son premier point, le procureur
de l'accusé prétend que le jury n'aurait pas dû appliquer la doctrine de la
possession récente, pour établir que l'accusé était l'auteur des vols commis,
et que le juge a donné des instructions erronées concernant le fardeau qui
repose sur l'accusé, d'expliquer la possession des objets volés.

La doctrine et la jurisprudence enseignent que
si une personne est en possession d'objets volés peu de temps après la
commission du crime, elle doit expliquer cette possession, et si elle ne
réussit pas à le faire de façon satisfaisante, elle est présumée les avoir
acquis illégalement. De plus, c'est aussi la doctrine et la jurisprudence que
la possession d'effets récemment volés, peut indiquer non seulement le crime de
vol, mais aussi un crime plus grave relié au vol. (Rex v. Langmead
2; Wills pages 61 et 62; Regina v.
Exall 3).

Dans le présent cas, je n'ai pas de doute que
le jury n'a pas accepté les explications données par l'accusé aux policiers, et
que le jury pouvait justement conclure que était l'auteur du vol. En concluant
ainsi, le jury

[Page 204]

pouvait y voir un motif du crime de meurtre,
et c'était une circonstance dont il pouvait légalement tenir compte. Je ne vois
rien dans la charge du juge qui soit de nature à vicier le procès sur ce point.

Je crois également le second point non fondé.
Je suis d'opinion que le juge ne devait pas dire au jury ce qu'on lui reproche
d'avoir omis. Le fait pour d'avoir en sa possession des effets récemment volés,
faisait naître non seulement la présomption, faute d'explication, qu'il les
avait volés, mais le jury avait le droit de conclure que c'était un lien dans
une chaîne de circonstances, qui indiquait qu'il avait commis le meurtre.Dans Regina
v. Exall (supra page ) Pollock C.B. dit:—

And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident,
or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For, if the
possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person
who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that
the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other
crime.

Il est certain que le juge en adressant le
jury leur a dit que la Couronne avait offert deux sortes de preuve, soit la
preuve circonstancielle, et la preuve de conversations ou paroles dites par
l'accusé. Après avoir défini la preuve circonstancielle, et avoir énoncé aux
jurés les principes de la cause de Hodge, il ajouta:—

Il est évident que sur l'ensemble de ces
faits, l'on ne trouvera aucune preuve directe nulle part et c'est précisément
là que l'on vous demande d'extraire des circonstances, la ou les conclusions
que, dans votre estimation, vous devez voir comme résultant de ces faits.

Je suis fermement convaincu que s'il a pu y
avoir quelques incorrections au début de ses remarques, sur ce point, le juge y
a complètement remédié par les dernières paroles que je viens de citer. Les
règles contenues dans la cause de Hodge ont en conséquence été
totalement respectées.

J'ai signalé déjà que avait emprunté une
carabine d'un nommé John Eagle, qui n'a jamais été remise à ce dernier, et qui
n'a jamais été retrouvée. Quand l'accusé est revenu du bois dans la soirée du
juin, on a remarqué dans son camion la présence d'une carabine. On sait aussi
qu'il n'en avait pas le , quand il est allé dans le bois avec MacDonald pour
prospecter, et qu'il n'en avait pas non plus le , quand il est retourné seul
dans la forêt. Il me semble nécessaire que la Couronne fît des efforts pour

[Page 205]

trouver cette arme. En revenant le 12, Coffin n'a
pas laissé la carabine chez son père où il vivait, et il ne l'avait pas avec
lui quand il est parti pour Montréal le soir du 12. La théorie de la Couronne
est que le soir du , tel que prouvé par MacDonald qui l'accompagnait, est allé
à son camp situé à l'ouest de Gaspé, pour y chercher la carabine, et qu'il
l'avait retournée au même endroit après la commission du crime. Cette théorie
est d'autant plus vraisemblable, qu'un jour, alors qu'il était détenu au mois
d'août à la prison de Gaspé, eut une entrevue avec son frère, et dans la même
nuit, un camion s'est rendu au camp de , dont le conducteur n'a pas demandé
d'ouvrir la barrière qui conduit dans la forêt. Au contraire, cette barrière a
été contournée, et des traces fraîches sur la route indiquaient le passage
récent d'un camion que l'on croit être d'une capacité d'une tonne, comme celui
du frère de . Ces traces indiquent que le camion s'est rendu au camp et en est
revenu en contournant toujours la barrière.

Au mois d'août, le sergent Doyon s'est rendu
au camp de , y a constaté les mêmes traces, et au cours de son témoignage, il a
dit qu'ayant reçu une ""information précise"", il s'était rendu faire
des recherches au camp de , essayant de trouver quelque preuve qui lui aiderait
à retrouver cette carabine. On prétend que cette preuve est illégale vu qu'il
s'agirait de ouï-dire. Je ne puis admettre cette prétention. A mon sens, il ne
s'agit nullement de ouï-dire, car quand Doyon a dit qu'il avait agi après avoir
reçu une ""information précise"", il n'entendait pas prouver la
véracité de son information, mais bien établir la raison de sa visite au camp. Comme le dit Roscoe prius, page 53:—

When hearsay is introduced not as a medium of proof in order
to establish a distinct fact, but as being in itself part of the transaction in
question and explanatory of it, it is admissible, words and declaration are
admissible.

A la page 55, il ajoute:—

It has been justly remarked by recent text writers that many
of the above cases are not strictly instances of hearsay (i.e. second hand
evidence) though commonly so classed. The res gesta in each case is original
evidence and the accompanying declaration being part of it is also original.

[Page 206]

Phipson (hearsay) page 223:—

In some cases a verbal act may be admissible as original
evidence although its particulars may be excluded as hearsay. Thus, though the
fact that the prosecutor made a communication to the Police, in consequence of
which they took certain steps, is allowed to be proved, yet what was actually
said is excluded as hearsay, is a very dangerous form.

Dans la cause de Rex v. Wilkins 4, M. le Juge Erle dit:—

Half the transactions of life are done by means of words.
There is a distinction, which it appears to me is not sufficiently attended to,
between, mere statements made by and to witnesses, that are not receivable in
evidence, and directions given and acts done by word?, which are evidence. The
witness, in this case, may say that he made inquiries, and in consequence of
directions given to him in answer to those inquiries, he followed the prisoners
from place to place until he apprehended them.

Les détectives agissent souvent comme
conséquence d'informations qu'ils reçoivent, et le fait de dire qu'ils ont été
""informés"" ne constitue nullement une preuve illégale. Ce n'est pas
un moyen de preuve de nature à établir un fait particulier.

Un autre grief de l'accusé, est que le juge a
erré en permettant aux jurés, durant le procès, d'assister au cinéma,
accompagnés de plusieurs officiers de police, qui furent subséquemment appelés
comme témoins de la Couronne. Je suis satisfait que toutes les précautions
nécessaires ont été prises, à la satisfaction du juge pour que rien
d'irrégulier ne s'est passé. Tous les ont été assermentés, et il n'est pas
suggéré qu'aucune indiscrétion n'ait été commise. D'ailleurs, cette permission
d'assister au cinéma a été donnée par le juge lui-même, exerçant sa discrétion,
après qu'il eût obtenu le consentement de l'avocat de la Couronne et de celui
de l'accusé.

En ce qui concerne le 6ème grief, il est
nécessaire en premier lieu de citer l'article du Code Criminel , qui
détermine les droits d'un accusé à un jury mixte, ou composé entièrement de
personnes parlant la langue française ou anglaise. Cet article se lit ainsi:—

923. Dans ceux des districts de la province de
Québec où le shérif est tenu par la loi de dresser une liste de petits jurés composée
moitié de personnes parlant la langue anglaise, et moitié de personnes parlant
la langue française, il doit, dans son rapport, mentionner séparément les jurés
qu'il désigne comme parlant la langue anglaise, et ceux qu'il désigne comme
parlant la langue française, respectivement; et les noms des jurés ainsi
assignés sont appelés alternativement d'après ces listes.

[Page 207]

2. Dans tout district, le prisonnier peut,
lorsqu'il est mis en jugement, demander par motion, d'être jugé par un jury
entièrement composé de jurés parlant la langue anglaise, ou entièrement composé
de jurés parlant la langue française.

3. Sur présentation de cette motion, le
juge peut ordonner au shérif d'assigner un nombre suffisant de jurés
parlant la langue anglaise ou la langue française, à moins qu'à sa
discrétion il n'apparaisse que les fins de la justice sont mieux servies par la
composition d'un jury mixte.

Je suis fermement d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas eu
d'erreur de la part du juge en ordonnant un jury mixte. Quand un accusé demande
la composition d'un jury exclusivement composé de personnes parlant sa langue,
comme la chose a été faite 'dans le cas présent, il est à la discrétion du
juge d'accéder à cette demande, mais s'il la refuse, il doit accorder un
jury mixte. Le droit de l'accusé à douze jurés de sa langue, n'est pas un droit
absolu, et le juge devra prendre en considération ce qui doit le mieux servir
les fins de la justice. Malgré que dans un procès criminel, l'intérêt de
l'accusé soit primordial, l'intérêt de la société ne doit pas être méconnu. (Alexander
. Regem 5; Mount . Regem 6;
Bureau v. Regem 7; Duval
v. Regem 8).
Dans la présente cause, exerçant sa discrétion le juge a décidé
que les fins de la justice ne seraient pas utilement servies, en: accordant la
demande de l'accusé, car il aurait ainsi éliminé % de la population française,
à la participation de l'administration de la justice. Il n'appartient pas à
cette Cour d'intervenir dans l'exercice de cette discrétion.

Je disposerai brièvement du grief N° 7, où
l'on prétend que les dispositions de la loi (1945, 9 Geo. VI, c. 22) concernant
la; liste des jurés n'ont pas été suivies. Ainsi, et c'est le grief qu'on
invoque, les jurés doivent être choisis dans un rayon de milles de la
municipalité (art. ) et ils l'ont été, non pas dans un rayon de 40 milles, mais
bien jusqu'à une distance de 40 milles, mesurés sur la route.

Même s'il y avait là une irrégularité, elle
serait couverte par l'article C. Cr. qui dit:—

1011. Nulle omission dans l'observation des
prescriptions contenues dans une loi à l'égard de la compétence, du choix, du
ballotage ou de la répartition des jurés, ou dans la préparation du registre
des jurés, le choix des listes des jurys, l'appel du corps des jurés d'après
ces listes, ou la convocation de jurys spéciaux, ne constitue un motif
suffisant pour infirmer un verdict, ni n'est admise comme erreur dans un appel
à interjeter d'un jugement rendu dans une cause criminelle.

[Page 208]

Je trouve que cette objection ne repose sur
aucun fondement sérieux.

Le grief N° 8 ne me semble pas plus sérieux.
On reproche au juge, aux avocats de la Couronne, comme d'ailleurs pas ricochet
aux avocats de la défense d'avoir adressé le jury en français et en anglais. Y
avait-il rien de plus logique d'agir de la sorte quand il s'agit d'un jury
mixte? D'ailleurs, il semble qu'on peut facilement disposer de cette objection
en référant à la cause de Veuillette v. Le Roi 9, et particulièrement aux raisons de
M. le Juge Brodeur à la page 424:—

Ce serait, suivant moi, un droit bien
illusoire si, malgré le droit qu'aurait un anglais, par exemple, de choisir un
jury mixte, il était permis à la couronne de faire entendre les témoins en
langue française et de ne pas traduire leurs témoignages en anglais de manière
à ce que la teneur de ces témoignages fût comprise par les jurés de langue
anglaise. Cela constituerait un grave déni de justice.

Il en serait de même pour le résumé (charge)
du juge. Ce dernier devrait voir à ce que son allocution soit comprise de tout
le jury.

Il est vrai que la loi est silencieuse sur la
manière dont une cause devra être conduite devant un jury mixte. Mais je ne
veux pas de meilleure interprétation de la loi que cette pratique, constamment
suivie depuis plus de cent cinquante ans, que dans le cas de jury mixte les
dépositions de témoins sont traduites dans les deux langues et le résumé du.
juge est également fait ou traduit en anglais et en français.

Et M. le Juge Mignault s'exprime de la même
façon aux pages 430 et 431.

Je ne crois pas nécessaire de discuter le 9ème
grief, car je ne trouve pas que les procureurs de la Couronne, s'ils ont parlé
avec énergie, ont employé un langage enflammé. Rien dans ce qu'ils ont dit
était de nature à suggérer aux jurés de rendre un verdict non pas exclusivement
basé sur la preuve, mais aussi sur les sentiments et les préjugés.

Il reste donc le dernier motif d'appel qui est
à l'effet que Petrie, appelée comme témoin de la Couronne, aurait été
transquestionnée par le procureur de la Couronne, sans avoir été déclarée
hostile. L'objection est basée sur l'article 9 de la loi de la Preuve du
Canada. Il se lit ainsi:—

9. La partie qui produit un témoin n'a pas la
faculté d'attaquer sa crédibilité par une preuve générale de mauvais
réputation, mais si le témoin est, de l'avis de la cour, défavorable à la
partie en cause, cette partie dernière peut le réfuter par d'autres témoignages,
ou, .avec la permission de la cour, peut prouver que le témoin a en d'autres
occasions fait une déclaration incompatible avec sa présente déposition; mais
avant de

[Page 209]

pouvoir établir cette dernière preuve, les
circonstances dans lesquelles a été faite là prétendue déclaration doivent être
exposées au témoin de manière à désigner suffisamment l'occasion en
particulier, et il doit lui être demandé s'il a fait ou non cette déclaration.

On voit; donc, que ce. que défend cet article
est de discréditer ou contredire son propre témoin, mais nullement de
rafraîchir la mémoire d'un témoin, au moyen de témoignages antérieurs qu'il a
rendus. Quand l'avocat de la Couronne a questionné madame Petrie sur la
bouteille de sirop d'érable, la pompe à gazoline, la présence des deux autres
américains, retournés aux Etats-Unis avant l'arrivée de et de ses compagnons,
comme ses réponses ne concordaient pas entièrement avec celles données à
l'enquête préliminaire, elle a lu elle-même ses réponses pour se rafraîchir la
mémoire. Elle admet que sa mémoire était meilleure au temps de l'enquête
préliminaire une année auparavant. Je ne vois aucune tentative de discréditer
le témoin oude la contredire. Il s'agissait seulement de savoir quelle était la
véritable version, et le témoin a accepté celle de l'enquête préliminaire.
C'est là d'ailleurs une question de discrétion pour le juge, qui décide suivant
les circonstances et; l'attitude du témoin.

Je suis donc d'opinion que j'aurais rejeté cet
appel, si la Cour avait eu pour l'entendre. Il y a dans toute la preuve qui a
été faite un faisceau de circonstances telles que même si j'avais trouvédans
les griefs soulevés par le procureur de l'accusé, non pas des erreurs
fondamentales, auxquelles on ne peut remédier, mais quelques irrégularités
affectant le procès, je n'aurais pas hésité à appliquer l'article (c) du
Code Criminel , car il ne s'est produit aucun tort réel, ni déni de
justice. Allen v. The King 10. Les
circonstances établies, ne laissaient aucune alternative au jury. Elles sont
entièrement compatibles avec la culpabilité de l'accusé, et incompatibles avec
toute autre conclusion rationnelle.

Ma réponse, en conséquence, à la question
posée par Son Excellence la Gouverneur Général en Conseil est que j'aurais
rejeté l'appel.

Rand J.:—For the reasons given by my brother Kellock, my answer to
the question referred to the Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.

[Page 210]

Kellock J.:—The
appellant first contends that while the jury were properly charged as to the
treatment of circumstantial evidence, the learned trial judge removed from the
ambit of such evidence all statements made by the accused himself to the
various witnesses.

Initially that is so but the learned trial judge had previously
told the jury that, with respect to both direct and circumstantial evidence,
the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the accused who
had committed the crime for which he was indicted, and immediately following
the direction objected to, proceeded to particularize the evidence of ""the
circumstances"" and included therein not only what had been stated by the
various witnesses as to the conduct of the appellant but also the statements
made by him. Not only so, but he told the jury that ""considering the whole
of these facts, no direct proof can be found anywhere"" and charged them
that if they were not convinced by the evidence ""beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused has committed the offence for which he stands indicted, this
doubt must work in his favour and it is your duty to discharge him."" In
these circumstances, all basis for any objection on the above ground, in my
opinion, disappears.

The appellant further contends that the examination on
behalf of the Crown of the witness Petrie, with respect
to whom the learned judge had refused an application to declare her a hostile
witness, amounted to cross-examination and was for that reason inadmissible,
and, in particular, that the use made by counsel for the Crown of her previous
depositions was illegal.

In the course of her examination as to articles which Coffin
had brought to Montreal, the witness stated that she had seen a certain maple
syrup bottle while giving evidence at the preliminary hearing a year before.
She went on to say that it was ""like"" the one produced at the trial
but smaller ""as far as I can remember"". Crown counsel agreed that
""we are talking about evidence that had been given over a year ago""
and asked the witness if she would care to refresh her memory, to which she
responded that she ""wouldn't mind"". After having read her depositions
to herself, she stated what she had said at the earlier hearing and agreed that
her earlier memory was to be preferred.

[Page 211]

Similarly, on a question as to her having seen a gas pump
with Coffin, the witness at first said she had seen only the box in which it
was contained. But on refreshing her memory by reference to her depositions,
she said her memory had been better on the former occasion and that she had
seen the pump.

Evidence had already been given at the trial of a statement
made to the police by Coffin that when he had last seen the Lindsay party, two
other Americans, driving a yellowish-coloured jeep, were with them. Evidence
had also been given that two Americans driving a vehicle of the above
description had been in the Gaspé some days earlier but
had recrossed the border to the United States on June 5, the day the Lindsay
party had left Pennsylvania. This was the only evidence of the presence in the
district at any time of any similar American party.

On this subject the witness Petrie deposed
that Coffin had, a few days after his arrival, told her the same story he had
told the police but not on the night of his arrival, when he had told her the
other things. She also said, in answer to; a question to that effect, that she
had not made such a statement on any previous occasion, including an occasion
when she had given a statement to the police. She was then asked as to her
memory of the facts at the time of the preliminary inquiry. Having answered
that it was ""a little better than they are now"", she looked at her
depositions and testified that she had previously said that Coffin had told her
only of the Lindsay party. She said that her memory when she had thus testified
was ""not too bad I guess"". In my opinion, in this answer the witness
was adopting as the fact what she had said at the preliminary inquiry and her
evidence is to be taken accordingly.

It is quite true that the initial answers made by the
witness as to these three matters were not ""accepted"" by counsel for
the Crown but while, as a general rule, a party may not: either in direct or
re-examination put leading questions, the court has a discretion, not open to
review, to relax it whenever it is considered necessary in the interests of
justice, as the learned judge appears to have considered was the situation in
the case at bar; ex parte Bottomley 11; Lawder
v. Lawder 12.
Moreover, the authorities

[Page 212]

make it clear that a witness may be allowed to refresh his
memory by reference to his earlier depositions and that it is only where the
object of the examination is to discredit or contradict a party's own witness
that s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act  applies. In the present case it is
evident that the object was to show that the mention by the appellant to the
police of having left the Lindsay party in the company of two other persons was
an afterthought which had not occurred to him when he gave his earlier account
to the witness Petrie. did not wish, therefore, to
discredit Petrie to obtain from her the evidence she
had given in her depositions if, on bringing the depositions to her attention,
her memory would permit her to adopt them.

In Reg. v. Williams 13, à for the
prosecution, having replied in the negative to a question put to him, was
permitted by Vaughan Williams J., to have his depositions put into his hands,
and, after having looked at them, to answer the question. Similarly, in Melhuish
. Collier 14, a
witness for the plaintiff was asked by the plaintiff's counsel as to whether or
not she had not made a certain answer in previous proceedings before the
magistrate. The question being objected to on the ground that it went to discredit
the party's own witness, the learned trial judge ruled that the question was a
proper one. Upon a rule nisi a new trial, the rule was discharged. At p.
496, Coleridge J., said:

A witness from flurry or forgetfulness may omit facts and on
being reminded may carry his recollection back so as to be able to give his
evidence fully and correctly, and a question for that purpose may properly be
put.

As to the difference between a question directed to
refreshing memory and contradicting one's own witness, the learned judge
continued:

But as to the first point it is objected that the object of
the question put here was to contradict and not to remind a witness and that
therefore it could not be put. It is certainly very difficult to draw the line
of distinction in practice and I am not now disposed to do it. In the present
case I do not think the question objected to went further than was proper

See also The King v. Laurin 15, distinguishing R. v. Duckworth
16.

[Page 213]

In the case at bar the learned trial judge, having come to
the conclusion that the witness was not hostile in the legal sense land having
therefore refused to permit her to be cross-examined, was, nevertheless,
entitled, in his discretion, to permit leading questions to be put, and,
similarly, was right in allowing the memory of the witness to be refreshed by
reference to her previous statements. As in each case the witness adopted what
she had previously said, no such situation arose as in Duckworth's case,
ubi cit, or Rex v. Darlyn 17, where the earlier statements were
not adopted.

The very fact that the learned judge did not regard the
witness as hostile, i.e., as not giving her evidence fairly and with a desire
to tell the truth because of a hostile animus toward the prosecution, would
seem to indicate the propriety of his permitting the examination to proceed and
the attention of the witness to be called to her statements when her memory as
to the matters to which she deposed was, as she herself said, much better than
at the time of the trial, a year later.

A further objection made is that two of the guards attending
the jury at a moving picture theatre during an adjournment of the trial,
subsequently gave evidence for the Crown. The evidence given was of a statement
made by the appellant to his father during the coroner's inquest that
""They are not men enough to break me."" Only one of the witnesses
could depose as to what was said. The other did not understand English and
could testify only that Coffin had spoken to his father on the occasion in
question.

The jury had been permitted to attend the theatre by the
learned trial judge upon the consent of counsel for the
accused as well as the Crown. The guards were provincial police and all took
the usual oath as to communication with the jury. It is not suggested that
there was any breach of, this oath on the part of the witness nor any of the
other members of the guard. It would appear from the procès-verbal
the selection of the guard and the administering of the oath was
left by all concerned to the clerk of the court, and that the. inclusion of the
two constables was a pure oversight by him. In these circumstances, I see no
reason for assuming that either constable

[Page 214]

was guilty of any impropriety in communicating, in breach of
his oath, with the jury on the subject of his prospective evidence, any more
than it would be assumed that any constable in attendance at a trial, during
the course of which he is required to guard a jury during an adjournment, had
discussed with them anything he had heard at the trial or from any other
source. We have been referred to reported cases involving facts in which the
courts there concerned considered a new trial called for but I cannot agree
that the present circumstances call for such a result.

The appellant further calls attention to the fact that the
trial took place before a mixed jury, the evidence being translated from one
language into the other; that the learned trial judge charged the jury in both
languages, and that one counsel for the prosecution as well as one for the
defence addressed the jury in one language while his associate in each case
addressed the jury in the other. It is contended that because of differences between
the addresses in one language and the other and between the charges delivered
by the. learned judge, the result is that the appellant was really tried by two
groups of jurymen composed of six men each. It is also contended that s. 944  of
the Criminal Code . requires that the jury
be addressed by one counsel only on each side.

When it is remembered (as we were told by Crown counsel
without contradiction) that the practice followed with respect to translation,
the charge and the addresses has been the invariable practice in the Province
of Quebec since 1892 at least, when the Code was first enacted, and that
during all of that- time s. 944  has been in its present form, the contention,
in so far as it is based on that section, cannot, in my opinion, succeed.

In Veuillette v. The King 18, the appellant, being tried on an
indictment for murder, stated through counsel that the language of the defence
was French. The jury impanelled was a mixed jury, each of the French-speaking
members stating to the court on his selection that he understood and spoke both
languages. The proceedings were carried on throughout in English and the
summing up was in English only. It was held by this court that even assuming
there was any error in law in so proceeding, no

[Page 215]

substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had been thereby
occasioned to the appellant. In the course of his judgment, Mignault J. said at
p. 430:

Revenant maintenant à la disposition de la loi
-28 Vict. ch. , il est clair que cette disposition serait illusoire si, dans un
procès instruit devant un jury mixte, les témoignages n'étaient pas traduits du
français en anglais, et réciproquement, et si l'adresse du juge présidant le
procès n'était pas faite, du moins quant à ses parties essentielles, dans
ces deux langues. Telle a toujours été la pratique en la province de Québec, …

At p. 431, the same learned judge
said:

Je suis bien d'avis qu'il a été fait quelque
chose de non conforme à la loi pendant le procès, c'est-à-dire que l'accusé
avait droit à ce que le procès fût instruit dans les deux langues, et à ce que
l'adresse du juge au jury fût faite ou traduite, au moins dans ses parties
essentielles, dans les deux langues, …

In my opinion, neither the differences
to which we were referred as between the address on behalf of the prosecution
in the one language and the other, nor the charges, were of a nature to call
for the interference of this Court in the grant of a new trial.

It is next contended that the trial judge erred in refusing
the appellant's application under s. 923 of the Code to be tried by ah
exclusively English-speaking jury. The foundation for this contention is
certain evidence given by the sheriff that in preparing ""the list of
jurors"", only the names of those who resided within a distance of forty
miles by road from the court-house were included. The appellant relies
upon the interpretation section of the Jury Act, 9 Geo. VI (Quebec) C.
22, s. 1, para. (a), which defines ""municipality"" as any municipality
situated wholly or in part within a radius of forty miles, and he says
that ""it would appear from the evidence of the Sheriff that had this
method of selection been used, a larger number of jurors of English tongue
could then have been obtained.""

The appellant therefore submits that

when it was brought to the attention of the trial judge that
the Jurors had not been selected in the manner prescribed by the Jurors'
Act, that it was the duty of the trial judge to order the sheriff to
summons a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English language under the
provisions of s. 923 , ss. (3) and that in the circumstances there was no
proper exercise by the trial judge of his discretion in the instant case, and
the appellant was thus deprived of a trial according to law.

The italics are mine.

While the definition of ""municipality"" is as
above, the statute provides, by s. 6 and following, for the preparation

[Page 216]

of a permanent jury list in each judicial district by a
""special officer"", from extracts furnished to him by the
secretary-treasurer of each municipality. Upon the completion of this list, the
special officer is required, by s. 23, to submit it for approval to a judge of
the Superior Court, which approval ""shall render the list valid and incontestable""
and upon its deposit in the office of the sheriff, s. 18 provides that it shall
be the ""only"" list in force in the judicial district.

It is from the list thus prepared that the sheriff is
required to prepare the panel of jurors for any particular sittings but the
sheriff has nothing to do with the preparation of ""the list"" itself.
That duty falls upon the special officer and the Superior Court judge. The
contention of the appellant under this head is therefore founded upon a complete
misconception of the statute. Moreover, it is provided by s. 1011  of the Criminal
Code  that

No omission to observe the directions contained in any Act
as respect … the selecting of jury lists, the drafting of panels from the jury
lists … shall be a ground for impeaching any verdict or shall be allowed for
error upon any appeal to be brought upon any judgment rendered in any criminal
case.

On this reference we are, as is the appellant, restricted to
a consideration of ""the grounds alleged"" upon the application for leave.
If, however, anything is open under this head of objection which is not
disposed of by what I have already said, I am of opinion that there was, in the
circumstances of this case, no error on the part of the learned judge in
exercising his discretion under s. 923 of the Code against the motion.
The learned judge took the view that, even if a full panel of English-speaking
jurors could be obtained from the list, which appeared extremely unlikely,
""the ends of justice"" would be better served by a trial with a mixed
jury, as to do otherwise would exclude eighty to eighty-five per cent of the
population of the district who were French-speaking from all participation in
the administration of justice so far as that trial was concerned.

The ground of objection concisely put is that ""the ends
of justice"" could only be ""better served"" by what the accused
conceived to be in his interests. In my opinion, the section is not to be so
construed. It is to be noted that the statute does not say ""the interests
of the accused"" but the ""ends of justice."" In my opinion, the
interests of the

[Page 217]

accused are gathered up in the larger interests of the
administration of justice. I do not think, therefore, that in the exercise of
his discretion under the section for the purposes of this trial, the learned
judge took into consideration any matter which can be said to be outside the
scope of what was proper in the due administration of justice.

It is next contended that certain comment by counsel for the
Crown while addressing the jury in French with respect to the statement by the
appellant to his father already referred to, was inflammatory. Having
considered that comment, however, I am unable to say that it was not one which
might not fairly be made.

The appellant also contends that the address of Crown
counsel was inflammatory in its reference to the responsibility resting upon
the jury in a case which had undoubtedly received international attention, as
indeed the appellant in his factum expressly states. Having read the portion of
the address referred to, the impression made upon my mind is best expressed in
the language of Duff J., as he then was, in Kelly v. The King 19, as follows:

… although some of the observations of the learned Crown
counsel were no doubt excessive heightened, it is impossible to think that in
the circumstances of this case the accused could suffer in consequence of them.
Such expressions could not deepen the effect of a bare recital of the facts in
the story which the officers of the Crown had to put before the jury.

It is also contended that evidence relating to a rifle
borrowed by the appellant from one Eagle, was irrelevant and inadmissible and
of so prejudicial a nature as to call for a new trial.

In May, 1953, the appellant had borrowed from Eagle a 32-40
rifle and Eagle also gave him eighteen or twenty cartridges for it. Eagle
subsequently gave the police other cartridges of this kind. He further said
that early in June, Coffin had told him he had the rifle at his home at York
Centre. Eagle, who was quite obviously an unwilling witness for the Crown,
further testified that he had had a conversation with Coffin in August
following but that the subject of the rifle was not mentioned.

An expert witness called by the Crown testified that in the
case of the bullet holes found in the clothing of

[Page 218]

Lindsay Jr., and the bullet mark on the stock of the rifle
of Lindsay Sr., there was no deposit of potassium nitrate, which deposit,
according to the expert evidence, is found in the case of all calibres of rifle
excepting the .32-40. It was also proved that the cartridges Eagle had given to
the police, when fired in the type of rifle he had loaned to Coffin, did not
leave such a deposit either. None of the four rifles possessed by the Lindsay
party were of this calibre.

While, according to the evidence of MacDonald, the appellant
did not have a rifle with him on June 8th or 9th, and while the appellant
stated to the police that he had not had a rifle with him in the bush between
June 10th and 12th, the witness MacGregor saw the muzzle of a rifle in the back
of the truck which Coffin was driving immediately upon his coming out of the
bush on the evening of the 12th,

Coffin had a camp of his own some ten miles from Gaspé a bush road which led nowhere beyond that point but
faded out into the bush. Access to this road was protected by a gatekeeper, as
in the case of the other roads in the neighborhood leading into the forest
area. The gatekeeper testified that on June 9 Coffin had passed the gate going
toward his camp. This could only have been after his return from the bush that
day.

Coffin told the police that he had left for the bush very
early on the morning of the 10th. This according to MacDonald, was in breach of
Coffin's agreement with MacDonald of the day before to go back into the bush
with him at 6.00 a.m. on the 10th. It was also shown that while Coffin had left
his home around midnight on June 12 without telling anyone of his plans, he
had, by 3.00 a.m., progressed only about thirteen miles on the way to Montreal.
He had, therefore, plenty of opportunity to visit his camp in the interim, had
he so desired, and to place the rifle there if he did not wish to leave it at
his home in York Centre. On arrival in Montreal in the early morning of June
15, he did not have a rifle.

On the 27th of August the appellant, while in custody, was
visited by a brother who parted from the appellant in tears. The following
morning the police went to Coffin's camp and made a search for the rifle,
without result. They, however, found tracks in the soft earth of a vehicle which
had preceded them, which they were able to follow to the

[Page 219]

camp, where the vehicle had turned about and gone back. The
night of August 27-28 had been a very wet night and: the marks, of the truck
were clearly visible in the soft ground. The gatekeeper and his wife deposed
that late on the evening of the 27th or the early morning of the 28th, sounds
of a vehicle rushing past the barrier had been heard. The driver did not stop
to have either his entrance or exit cleared, as was required. The tracks of the
vehicle around the barrier, were clearly visible. When the police arrived at
the camp, they made a search for the missing rifle but found nothing. Had there
been no other evidence with regard to the rifle it might be that the evidence
of the visit of the police, as well as that of the nocturnal visitor who
preceded them, should be considered too remote to be properly admissible. But
there was other evidence.

Eagle testified that when he ""lost"" the rifle
loaned to Coffin he bought another in its place in October, 1953. It is a
legitimate inference from this evidence, and one the jury were entitled to
draw, that Mr. Eagle had learned, from some; source, that his rifle was
irrevocably gone when he spent his money on a new one. It is also a fair inference
that when; the rifle was not mentioned between them when Eagle was talking to
Coffin on the occasion of the August interview, the realization of his
""loss"" must have come to him subsequently. When it is realized that
no person would have any business at Coffin's camp except the appellant himself
or someone under his direction or with his permission, it is also a fair
inference that the object of the police officers and that of the nocturnal
visitor of August 27-28, was the same, namely, the rifle. All of the above
evidence is part of a whole, which, in my opinion, was admissible, its weight,
of course, being a matter for the jury. Moreover, all of this evidence was
merely incidental to the main fact deposed to by the witness MacGregor that the
latter had seen a rifle in Coffin's truck immediately upon his coming out of
the bush on the evening of June 12, as well as to the fact that the rifle
loaned to Coffin by Eagle was not accounted for.

In Blake v. Albion 20, Cockburn C.J., said at p. 109:

… with a few exceptions on the ground of public policy … all
which can throw light on the disputed transaction is admitted—not of course
matters of mere prejudice nor anything open to real, moral or sensible
objection, but all things which can fairly throw light on the case.

[Page 220]

In my opinion, however, that portion of the evidence of the
police officers that it was because of having obtained ""precise""
information that they had gone to the appellant's camp to make the search, was
not proper. For reasons to be given, however, I am satisfied that, in the
circumstances of this case, neither the admission of this statement nor the
reference to it in the judge's charge produced any substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

It is next said for the appellant that the learned judge did
not instruct the jury in accordance with the principle in Schama's case 21, with reference to such account as
Coffin gave of his possession of the property of the deceased hunters. In so
far as the early part of his charge is concerned, I think there is room for
objection. However, the learned judge went on to point out to the jury that the
appellant had given no explanation at all to account for his possession of some
of the articles and, after putting before them such explanation as the
appellant did make with regard to others, he asked the jury to consider whether
the explanation given was ""likely"". Also, after asking the jury to
consider which of the respective contentions of counsel for the Crown and the
appellant as to the appellant's conduct they considered ""the most logical,
the most plausible, the most likely and the most reasonable, according to the
facts"" which had been proved, the learned judge again returned to the
appellant's possession of articles belonging to the deceased, of American money
and his story of having been paid by Lindsay Sr., as well as his failure to
make any explanation at all as to certain articles, and, placing before the
jury the theory of the prosecution and the defence; concluded:

Gentlemen, you have two theories which are opposed to one
another. Is one more likely than the other? Does the theory of the Crown rest
on a body of evidence which points beyond any reasonable doubts towards Coffin
and towards his guilt as to the crime he stands indicted? Does the theory of
the Defence spring reasonably from the same facts, and may it cause you
to believe in the incompatibility of the proven circumstances with the guilt of
Coffin and their compatibility with his innocence?

In re R. v. Garth 22, Lord Goddard C.J., in reference to
the decision in Abramovitch, said, at p. 101, that ""a much more accurate
direction to the jury is: 'if the prisoner's account raises a doubt in your
minds, then you

[Page 221]

ought not to say that the case has been proved to your
satisfaction.'"" See also Richler v. The King 23, per Sir Lyman Duff C.J. In my
opinion, the charge of the learned judge, on this subject, when read as a whole
is not open to the objection which the appellant takes. If it could be said to
fall short of what is required, I would, in any event, be of opinion that, in
the circumstances of this case, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
occurred because of it.

The appellant further contends that the learned trial judge
erred in failing to direct the jury that they were not entitled to convict of
murder ""simply because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of
theft"" of the various articles. In his factum the appellant says:

While the jury might well have seen fit to conclude that the
appellant had stolen the items found in his possession from the abandoned truck
of the victims there was nothing in the evidence to compel them to conclude
that he had killed the deceased tourists and had stolen from their persons.

In this connection it is necessary to refer to the
evidence at some length.

The deceased, with his father, Eugene Lindsay, and another
youth, Frederick Claar, left their homes in Pennsylvania on June 5, 1953,
intending to return by the 15th of that month. As they did not return, a search
was instituted and ultimately the remains of all three were found. Little more
than bones remained as the bodies had been eaten by bears and other wild
animals. According to the expert evidence, the death of each had occurred not
later than June 17.

The country where the remains were found is a forest area
adjoining a bush road which, some distance to the east of the locality in
question, has two branches which commence at what is called the ""Mine Road"",
which runs from Gaspé Murdockville. The westerly end of
this bush road again meets the Mine Road approximately six miles to the east of
Murdockville. This country is, so far as the evidence shows, completely
uninhabited, and resorted to only by prospectors and hunters.

Approximately midway between the point where the two
branches join and the point where its westerly terminus meets the Mine Road,
there are four hunting camps- used

[Page 222]

spasmodically by hunting parties, the camps being numbered,
from east to west, 21, 24, 25 and 26. They are approximately three miles apart.
Access to the bush road is obtained only through barriers for which a pass must
be presented to the attendants in charge.

On July 10, the truck of the deceased was found abandoned on
the bush road at a point about three miles east of camp 21. On July 23, the
remains of Lindsay Jr., were found in a heavily wooded area at a distance of
approximately 175 feet from Camp 26. With them were found a sweater and two
shirts, each perforated by a bullet hole in what would have been the vicinity
of the heart had the clothing been worn at the time of the death. Undoubtedly
they had been so worn as the bullet holes were in the same place in each
garment. There was also found nearby a watch, a? silver ring, and a cigarette
lighter, all belonging to the deceased, as well as his rifle, the muzzle being
buried in the earth, suggesting that as he fell the rifle had been pushed into
the ground. The left pocket of the trousers of the deceased had been turned
inside out and his wallet was missing. It was proved that he had had a wallet
made of brown leather.

In a locality of the same character approximately 200 feet
away, the remains of Claar we're also found the same day. Nearby there were
some of his clothing, boots, a camera, as well as his rifle. Beneath a large
stump, under which it had been stuffed, a leather windbreaker belonging to
Claar was also found, as was also his wallet which had been rifled. Holes in
the bones of the lumbar region of Claar were similar to the bullet holes found
in the clothing of Lindsay Jr., but the experts were not able to swear
positively that they were bullet holes.

The remains of Lindsay Sr. had previously been found on July
15, at a distance of approximately one hundred and fifty feet from Camp 24,
near the bank of a small stream. On July 27, his wallet was discovered in the
bed of this stream. The zipper had been pulled open and most of the documents
it contained were partly pulled out, but the wallet was empty of money. When
the deceased had left his home on the 5th of June, he had with him at least
$650. On the butt of his rifle, which was found approximately fifty feet from
his remains, there was evidence of blood and

[Page 223]

human hair, and there was more hair on the ground. In
addition, there was a mark on the butt suggesting it had: been caused by being
grazed by a bullet.

In the vicinity of Camp 24 also, there were first discovered
a sleeping bag containing some bread, a camera case and a couple of jackets.
The sleeping bag had been tightly rolled up and tucked under some trees in the
bush away from the road. This discovery led to a further examination in the
vicinity with the result that, spread over an area of approximately one hundred
feet in the bush, other articles were found including a camp stove, the legs of
which were in the branches of the trees, while the stove itself was down below
in the bushes. All these articles were proved to have belonged to one or other
of the deceased. It was apparent to the searchers from the places in which they
were found that these latter articles had been thrown away. In addition to the
three rifles mentioned, another was found in the abandoned truck, from which
nothing else appeared to have been taken. None of the rifles had been recently
fired. The Lindsay party had taken with them four rifles only.

It is reasonably apparent from the articles not taken, and
the jury could so conclude, that the motive for the killing was robbery and
that it was money which the robber chiefly wanted.

Coffin, with one MacDonald, had been in the area in question
on the 8th and 9th of June, had spent the night at Camp 24 and had gone as far
as a mile and a half west of Camp 26 before returning to Gaspé
on afternoon of June 9, arranging to meet MacDonald next morning at
Coffin's home at six o'clock for the purpose of returning to the area for
prospecting purposes. Coffin did not, as already mentioned, keep this
appointment. Instead, according to his own story, very early on the morning of
June 10, he set out for Camp 21 alone in the truck which he had borrowed from
one Baker and which he and MacDonald had used on the two preceding days. He
told the police that he had come upon the three Americans about three miles
east of Camp 21 and had had breakfast with them.

According to Coffin, Lindsay Sr., had requested him to go to
Gaspé Lindsay Jr., to have the gas pump of the Lindsay
truck, which Coffin said was not working, repaired. He did so and the presence
of the two in Gaspé day was independently proved. On
arrival at Gaspé, Coffin said

[Page 224]

they found it impossible to repair the pump and young
Lindsay purchased a new one. They then returned, reaching the others about four
or five o'clock that afternoon. At this time, according to Coffin's story to
the police, there were the two other Americans there with a yellowish plywood
jeep. Coffin said he was introduced but did not remember their names.

Coffin stated that Lindsay Sr. took out his wallet and paid
him $40 in American currency, a $20 bill and two $10 bills. Coffin stated that
after having a meal with the Americans, he left for Camp 21 and that he
prospected in the vicinity until June 12, when he set out on the return trip to
Gaspé. On the place where he had left the five
Americans on the evening of the 10th, he said the Lindsay truck was there but
no person. After waiting some time, he went on, reaching the home of MacGregor,
a neighbour, in the early evening. Subsequently and about midnight, he left for
Montreal, where he remained until on or about July 14.

On arrival in Montreal, Coffin had in his possession a knife
having a number of attachments, the property of Lindsay Jr., as well as a pair
of binoculars, the property of Claar's father, which the latter had lent his
son for the purposes of the trip. These binoculars had a value of $65. Coffin
had also the gas pump and a valise of Claar Jr., which contained a shirt, two
pairs of shorts, two pairs of socks, a pair of blue jeans and two towels.
According to the witness Petrie, Coffin told her that
the knife and the binoculars had been given to him as souvenirs by some
Americans he had helped in the Gaspé . He made no
explanation to her or to anyone else with respect to the valise or any of its
contents nor as to the pump. When Coffin returned to Gaspé had
the valise and the knife with him. The valise was unpacked by his sister, Mrs.
Stanley, who found in it the two towels and thé pair jeans.
He made the same statement to her with regard to the knife as he had made to Petrie but nothing about any of the other articles.

As already pointed out, the appellant concedes that there
was sufficient evidence of the theft of the various articles but not of any
connection between the theft and the killing.

[Page 225]

With respect to Coffin's account of his possession of the
knife and the binoculars, it is to be kept in mind that he made no attempt to
explain to anyone his possession of the other articles. That Coffin would be
paid $40 for going back to Gaspé Lindsay Jr. on June 9
would, taken by itself, seem likely to cause some raising of eyebrows among the
jury, but when that story is coupled with the further statement that Coffin
had, in addition, been ""given"" binoculars of a value of $65, a gift
which no one but Claar Sr., who was in Pennsylvania could make, and the knife,
which was of a special character and which had been a special gift to young
Lindsay, the limits of credulity are surely overpassed. It cannot, therefore,
be said, in my opinion, that the appellant gave any reasonable explanation of
how he came to be in the possession of the things as to which he even attempted
to make an explanation; R. v. Curnock 24.

Moreover, if the jury did not believe the story that Coffin
had been ""paid"" $40 by Lindsay Sr., it was established out of his
own! mouth that he was in possession on June 10 of part, at least, of money
belonging to Lindsay Sr.

In my opinion, therefore, there was abundant evidence from
which the jury could conclude that the possessor of the money and the other
items was the robber and the murderer as well. I think they have done so.

In Regina v. Exall 25, Pollock C.B., said at 924:

The principle is this, that if a person is found in
possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery.

And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident,
or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For, if the
possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person
who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that the
person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.

The law is, that if recently after the commission of the
crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person is
called upon to account for the possession, that is, to give an
explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.

In a note to the above case at p. 850 of vol. 176 of the
English Reports, the editor refers to the case of R. v. Muller at
p. 385 of the same volume, where the murder in question had occurred in a
railway carriage on a Saturday

[Page 226]

evening and on the following Monday the prisoner was found
in possession of the watch of the murdered man which he said he had bought off
a pedlar at the London docks. The question arose as to whether, supposing the
jury were not satisfied of the accused's guilt upon the evidence apart from the
recent possession of the hat and watch, such possession would be sufficient
proof of the prisoner's guilt of the murder. The note reads:

That it would have been sufficient, if no explantion at all
had been offered, would be conceded. For the absence of explanation would have
amounted to an admission.

In the case at bar the evidence which I have thus far
discussed, does not stand alone.

Very shortly after Coffin came out of the bush on the
evening of June 12, he went to see the witness Boyle and paid him an ""old
debt"" of $5.25. The same evening, also, he went to the hotel of the
witness White where he purchased a case of ale, in payment for which he
tendered a $20 American bill, and on being told that he owed White $5
""from last year"", he paid that. Change was given to him in Canadian
money.

At 1.30 a.m. on June 13, before he had left York Centre for
Montreal, he also visited one Tuzo and paid him $10 which the latter had loaned
him approximately five weeks earlier.

About 3 a.m. on the same morning, Coffin got into the ditch
at a place called Seal Cove about twelve miles on the road to Montreal from Gaspé was helped out by the witness Element, who was paid by
Coffin $2 in American bills.

At about 6.30 a.m. the same day, the witness Despard
testified that he had filled the tank of Coffin's truck at Percé
repaired the brake at a cost of $8, for which Coffin tendered
a $20 American bill, asking for only $10 in change, thereby tipping him
$2.

Later, at a place called Chandler, Coffin received a
haircut, a shave and a hair wash at the barber shop of the witness Poirier at a cost of $1.50. In. addition to paying this, he
left a tip of $1.50, and paid $1 for a shoeshine. He also paid for the haircut
of another customer in the shop and left as well a tip of $1.75.

[Page 227]

Later the same morning, Coffin got into the ditch again near
a place called St-Charles de Caplan, out of which he
was assisted by the witness J. P. Poirier, to whom he
tendered another $20 American bill. Poirier testified
that Coffin took the money out of a brown wallet which was filled with
bills to a depth of approximately half an inch.

At noon the same day, at Black Cape, Gaspé,
appellant incurred a small garage bill and left the proprietor a tip of
$1. About 8.30 a.m. on June 14, he went to the home of the witness Tardif St-André de Kamouraska he purchased toast and coffee
and seven bottles of beer, for which he paid $5. After he had left, a $10 Canadian
bill was found under the chair which he had occupied.

Prior to leaving York Centre for Montreal, the only money
which Coffin was known to have had was $20 which he had received from MacDonald
on the evening of the 9th of June to enable him to buy gas and other supplies
for their return trip into the bush. This is apart from the $40 in American
funds which he alleged he had received from Lindsay Sr. Coffin's last known
employment was in May but how long he had worked or how much money he had was
not shown.

The character of the above expenditures was such as to call
as much for explanation as the recent possession of stolen goods; Wills on
Circumstantial Evidence, 7th ed., p. 105.

On Coffin's return from Montreal on July 20, when the
remains of Lindsay Sr. had been found but the search for the others was
proceeding, he was asked by the police to assist. He went with them the next
day and it was then that he gave the account of his movements between June 10
and 12 to which I have already referred.

Coffin told the police, also, that on his visit from June 10
to 12 inclusive, he had not gone beyond Camp 21 but on July 21, when the search
party were having lunch at Camp 24, Gold water was asked for and Coffin went
out to get it. He had, however, gone only five or ten feet beyond the door when
he turned and asked ""Where is the brook?"", and did not go farther.
The brook was within sixty feet of the shanty and readily visible. Upon Coffin
saying this, one of the other men of the party, one Adams, said to him

[Page 228]

that he knew the country as well as Adams did himself. To
this Coffin made no answer. Moreover, MacDonald testified that he and Coffin
had eaten a meal within ten feet of that brook on June 9. It will be remembered
that it was in the bed of this brook that the rifled wallet of Lindsay Sr. was
later found on July 27. When the search party reached Camp 24, Coffin said he
remembered having ""come up to"" Camp 24 with MacDonald. According to
the latter, he and Coffin had gone beyond Camp 26 about a mile and a half on
June 9.

Members of the search party testified that Coffin
participated on a small scale in the search, during which he kept away from the
sides of the road where the various articles thrown into the bush had been
found.

As was said by Cockburn C.J., in Moriarty v. Ry.
Co. 26:

… it is evidence against a prisoner that he has said one
thing at one time and another at another, as shewing that the recourse to
falsehood leads fairly to an inference of guilt.

This is clearly applicable to the case at bar, which, in my
opinion, is completely covered by the principle stated by Lord Tenterden C.J.,
in R. v. Burdett 27:

No person is to be required to explain or contradict, until
enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him,
in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when such proof has been
given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or
contradiction, if the conclusion to which the proof tends be untrue, and the
accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human reason do
otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?

This being so, the circumstances, in my opinion, are such as
to call for the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by s. 1014(2)  of the Criminal
Code , notwithstanding error in the proceedings as already mentioned.

The effect of the sub-section has been variously expressed
but the underlying principle was thus stated by Viscount Simon in Harris v.
Director of Public Prosecutions 28:

If it could be. said that a' reasonable jury after being
properly directed would, on the evidence properly, admissible, without doubt
have convicted …, the proviso should be applied. This is the test laid down by
this House in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, 1914
A.C., 315 at 321.

Similar language had previously been used by Anglin J., as
he then was, in delivering the judgment of the majority

[Page 229]

in Kelly v. The King 29, where the decisions of the Privy
Council in Makin v. Attorney General of New
South Wales 30 and Ibrahim
y. The King 31,
were referred to. It may be observed that in the latter case, Lord Sumner, at
p. 616, called attention to the former, as follows:

Even in Makin's case, however, reservation was made of cases
""where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted
can have had any influence on the verdict of the Jury,"" and this
reservation is not to be taken as exhaustive.

Again, in Stein v. The King 32, Anglin C.J.C., after referring to Makin's
case, Ibrahim's case, Allen v. The King 33 and Gouin v. The King 34, said:

It may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which
there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified
in taking the view that in all human probability it could have had no effect
upon the jury's mind, and on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict.

In that case the court considered the section
inapplicable as the trial judge had erred in a most vital matter. In my
opinion, the error in the case at bar was confined to matter of a comparatively
minor character. Even where there has occurred misdirection in a material
matter, the section is applicable if the court is satisfied that the jury,
properly directed, must have reach the same conclusion: Boulianne v.
The King 35.

In the case at bar, the evidence being as above reviewed
with no explanation attempted by the appellant as to some of the articles in
his possession and no explanation as to the others that could reasonably be
true, no reasonable jury could, in my opinion, have done ""otherwise than
adopt the conclusion to which the proof tend(ed).""

Accordingly, if the application made by Wilbert Coffin for
leave to appeal had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said
application, I would have dismissed the appeal.

Locke J.:—The
facts, so far as it is necessary to consider them, are stated in the reasons
for judgment to be delivered by my brother Cartwright which I have had the
advantage of reading.

[Page 230]

As to the fourth ground of appeal, that portion of the
evidence of Sergeant Doyon as to the ""precise information"" on which
he acted in searching for the rifle in the vicinity of Coffin's camp was
clearly hearsay. During the course of the argument of counsel for the Crown, he
was asked if he could suggest any meaning which could be given to the language
employed, other than that some one (unnamed) had given the witness information
that the rifle was to be found there. He was unable to do so. I also find
myself unable to attribute any other meaning to the words. The answer made by
Constable Synnett that:—

We proceeded to the place where Sergeant Doyon had got his
information from—where the indicated spot was supposed to be, and we got there
at the indicated place, and the rifle was not there.

amounted to repeating the inadmissible evidence of
Doyon.

The fact that the learned trial judge and both of the
counsel who presented the case of the Crown to the jury accentuated its
importance in determining the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused
appears to me to be decisive of the question as to the material nature of the
evidence.

In Allen v. The King 36, this Court considered an appeal, by
a person convicted of murder in British Columbia, upon a reserved case, the
basis for the appeal being that evidence had been improperly admitted at the
trial. At the time Allen's Case was considered, s. 1019  of the Criminal
Code  (c. 146, R.S.C. 1906), dealing with appeals in criminal cases to a
court of appeal, read:—

No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed,
although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or
that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection
given, unless in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial wrong or
miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.

It was contended for the Crown that this section should
be applied in disposing of the appeal. Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., with whom
Duff J. (as he then was) agreed, said in reference to this (p. 339):—

It was argued that the section of our Code, upon which the
Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that the appeal
shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is
otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of
the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal
a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where

[Page 231]

the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial
that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there
is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter
favorem vitœ. say that we are in this case
charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which the improperly admitted
evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I have
already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused in a capital
case of the benefit of a trial by jury.

Having said this, the Chief Justice said that the law on the
point had been laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1893
in Makin v. Attorney General for New
South Wales 37, and
quoted the following extract from the judgment of Lord Chancellor Herschell:—

It was said that if without the inadmissible evidence there
were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict and to shew that the accused
was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of
justice. It is: obvious that the construction transfers from the
jury to the court the determination of the question whether the evidence—that
is to say, what the law regards as evidence—established the guilt of the
accused. The result is that, in a case where the accused has the right to have
his guilt or innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to
depend not on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the court. The
judges are in truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and
theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any
opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence
with the assistance which this affords.

It is impossible to deny that such a change of the law would
be a very serious one, and the construction which their Lordships are invited
to put upon the enactment would gravely affect the much-cherished right of
trial by jury in criminal cases. The evidence improperly admitted might have
chiefly, affected the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the
evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction
might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury in view of the demeanour of
the witnesses. Yet the court might, under such circumstances, be justified, or
even consider themselves bound to let the judgment and sentence stand. These
are startling consequences. … 

Their Lordships do not think it can properly be said that
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point
material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have,
notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider, in arriving
at their verdict, matters which ought not to have been submitted to them. In
their Lordships' opinion, substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he
were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence,
and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon
a perusal of the evidence.

The language above quoted was followed by the following,
which was the concluding paragraph of the Lord Chancellor's judgment:—

Their Lordships desire to guard themselves against being
supposed to determine that the proviso may not be relied on in cases where it
is

[Page 232]

impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted
can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury, as for example where
some merely formal matter not bearing directly on the guilt or innocence of the
accused has been proved by other than legal evidence.

While this was not quoted by the Chief Justice, it was
clearly adopted by him in the passage from his judgment above recited.

Anglin J., saying that to accept the construction of s. 1019 
urged on behalf of the Crown would be, in effect, to substitute the court for
the jury in determining the question whether the evidence which was admissible
established the guilt of the accused, quoted that passage from the judgment of
the Lord Chancellor in which it was said that in their Lordship's opinion
substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the
verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence and there were
substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon the perusal of
the evidence. While both the Chief Justice and Anglin J. noted that the
enactment considered in Makin's Case differed from the language of s.
1019  in that it read:—

Provided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be
reversed arrested or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial
wrong or other miscarriage of justice.

both clearly were of the opinion that there was no real
distinction between the statutory provisions.

S. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the new Code which
applies to the disposition of the present matter by virtue of s. 746 provides
that the court may dismiss the appeal, notwithstanding that it is of the
opinion that, on any question of law, the appeal might be decided in favour of
the appellant if ""it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred."" The meaning of the language quoted
is indistinguishable from that of the section 1019  considered in Allen's
Case. In my opinion, we are bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee
in Makin's Case and by that of the majority of this Court in Allen's
Case. It cannot, in my opinion, be said that the evidence in question, to
which so much importance was attached by the learned trial judge and by Crown
counsel when the matter was presented to the jury, was evidence of the nature
referred to in the concluding passage of the Lord Chancellor's judgment above
referred to. Once it is determined that the evidence improperly admitted is on
a point

[Page 233]

material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, it cannot
properly he said that there has been no substantial wrong ] or miscarriage of
justice and the section has, in my opinion, no application.

The decision of this Court in Schmidt v. The King
38, was not in a case in which there had
been an improper admission of evidence of this character and was not intended
to be at variance with Allen's Case, in my opinion.

On all of the other questions discussed by my brother
Cartwright I agree with his conclusions and with his reasons for those
conclusions.

If leave to appeal had been granted on those grounds
advanced on the application for leave to appeal, dealt with by my brother
Cartwright and by me, it would have been my opinion that the appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

Cartwright J.:—On
August 5, 1954, following his trial at Percé the
Province of Quebec before Lacroix J. a jury, Wilbert
Coffin was convicted of having, between June 1, 1953 and July 23, 1953,
murdered Richard Lindsay. He appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal
Side) 39, and
his appeal was dismissed without dissent. He then applied to a Judge of this
Court for leave to appeal to this Court upon a number of questions of law; this
application having been dismissed, he appealed to the Court from such
dismissal; and the Court, being of opinion that it was without jurisdiction,
dismissed the appeal.

His Excellency the Governor General in Council has referred
the following question to the Court:—

If the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been granted on any of the grounds
alleged on the said application, what disposition of the appeal would now be
made by the Court?

We have had the assistance of full and able arguments by
counsel for the Attorney General of Quebec and for Coffin.

The grounds alleged on the application for leave to appeal
to this Court which were argued before us are as follows:—

1. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in respect to the
instructions he gave to the jury with reference to the doctrine of recent
possession in the following manner:—

(a) Should the jury have been permitted to apply the
doctrine at all?

[Page 234]

(b) Were the jury .misdirected with reference
to the burden resting on the Appellant to explain his possession of items
allegedly stolen?

2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in failing to instruct
the jury that they were not entitled to convict the Appellant of murder simply 'because
they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of the theft of the various
articles proved to have been the property of the victim, Richard Lindsay, and
his associates?

3. Did the Learned Trial Judge err by instructing the jury
in a manner that would indicate the statements and declarations made by the
Appellant to various witnesses were not to be regarded as circumstantial
evidence and evidence therefore to which the rule in Hodge's case should be
applied?

4. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting evidence
concerning a certain rifle, the property of one Jack Eagle?

5. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting the evidence
of one Marion Petrie Coffin, common law wife of the
Appellant?

6. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in permitting the jury to
attend a moving picture theatre in the company of two police officers who were
subsequently called as witnesses for the Crown?

7. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in refusing the
application made on behalf of the Appellant to be tried by a jury composed
entirely of English-speaking citizens?

8. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the failure of the Sheriff of the County in which the Appellant was
tried to comply with the provisions of the Quebec Jury Act (1945, 9 George VI,
Chap. 22)?

9. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the improper mixture of the English and French languages?

10. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law
by reason of the fact that Crown Counsel in their addresses to the jury used
inflammatory language?

The evidence indicated that Richard Lindsay, aged 17
years, his father, Eugene Lindsay and a friend Frederick Claar left their home
in Pennsylvania on June 5, 1953, in a truck to go on a hunting trip in the
District of Gaspé which they never returned. Their
remains were discovered by search parties in July 1953, those of Eugene Lindsay
on July 15 about 150 feet from a camp known as Camp 24 and those of Richard
Lindsay and Claar, about two hundred feet apart, in a heavily wooded area in
the vicinity of a camp known as Camp 26 which is distant about two and a half
miles from Camp 24. Camp 24 is about 60 miles from Gaspé. medical
evidence was that their deaths had occurred not later than June 17.

[Page 235]

As is pointed out by Hyde J. the Crown's case against Coffin
was based on circumstantial evidence. The main circumstances claimed to be
established were:—

(a) that Richard Lindsay was shot;

(b) that property belonging to him and his two
deceased companions was stolen;

(c) that Coffin had an opportunity to commit the
crime;

(d) that a weapon (Eagle's rifle), which
could have been used to shoot Richard Lindsay, was loaned to Coffin prior to
the date of the crime and was never returned to its owner;

(e) that when Coffin came out of the bush on
June 12 the muzzle of a rifle was seen in his truck;

(f) that the motive of the murder was theft;

(g) that Coffin had possession of
articles which were the property of the three deceased;

(h) that as to some of these he gave no
explanation and as to others no reasonable explanation of having them in his
possession;

(i) that when he left home Eugene Lindsay
had about $650 in cash but that when his wallet was found there was no money in
it;

(j) that after June 12 Coffin had possession of
a substantial amount of money although prior to that date he was shewn to owe
some small debts;

(k) that Coffin made contradictory statements as
to his actions during the period when the murder was committed;

(l) that Coffin's conduct during the search for
the remains of some of the deceased, in which he took part, was suspicious;

(m) that Coffin, after being arrested,
arranged to have Eagle's rifle made away with.

Coffin did not testify and no witnesses were called for the
defence. Statements which he had made to police officers and to Marion Petrie , who was described as his common law wife, were
proved as part of the Crown's case. Some parts of these statements, if true,
were exculpatory; they contained no admission of guilt. This brief

[Page 236]

summary, while far from complete, is, I think, sufficient to
indicate the evidentiary background against which the questions of law raised
for decision must be considered.

Ground 4.

I propose to deal first with ground 4 above. There was
evidence that in May 1953 the witness Eagle had loaned his Marlin .32-40
calibre rifle to Coffin; that up to the time of the trial the rifle had not
been returned to him; and that the holes in the clothing of Richard Lindsay,
indicating that he had been shot, could have been made by a bullet of the
calibre of Eagle's rifle. It was part of the theory of the Crown that Coffin
had shot Richard Lindsay with Eagle's rifle. The evidence objected to was
introduced in an endeavour to establish that at some time after the murder and
probably before leaving for Montreal on June 13 Coffin had hidden this rifle
near his camp; that on August 27 he had told his brother Donald Coffin where he
had hidden it and that in the night of August 27 Donald Coffin had gone in a
truck to Wilbert Coffin's camp, got the rifle and made away with it.

Coffin's camp is in wooded country about 14 miles from Gaspé. On forest road leading to this camp there is a barrier
at which persons going into the bush to hunt are required to obtain a permit.
Coffin had been taken into custody on August 10. On August 27 he was allowed to
have a private interview with his brother Donald at Police Headquarters in Gaspé. came out from this interview in tears. In the early
morning of August 28 the sound of a motor vehicle was heard rushing past the
barrier on the road leading to Coffin's camp. Later on the morning of August 28
Sergeant Doyon and Police Constable Synnett went to Coffin's camp; they saw
marks on the road of the tires of a truck. It was said that Donald Coffin had a
truck but there was no evidence as to whether the marks of its tires were
similar to those seen on the road. Doyon and Synnett made a search in the
vicinity of Coffin's camp but found no rifle.

The evidence objected to is found in the following passages
in the evidence in chief of Sergeant Doyon and Police Constable Synnett.

[Page 237]

Sergeant Doyon—

Q Maintenant, il y a un monsieur Eagle qui a
été entendu au sujet d'une carabine qu'il avait prêtée à . Voulez-vous dire à
la Cour et à messieurs les jurés si vous avez fait quelques recherches au sujet
de cette carabine?

R Oui, j'avais eu une information précise, et
j'ai fait certaines recherches aux alentours du camp de Coffin à la grande
fourche, et plus précisément …

Q A quelle date?

R En date du 28 août.

Q Etait-ce quelle partie de la journée?

R A bonne heure le matin.

Q Et avec qui avez-vous fait ces recherches?

R Avec l'agent Synnett de la Police de la
Route.

Q Alors, où vous êtes-vous rendus?

R De Gaspé, nous nous sommes rendus jusqu'au
petit camp de Coffin à l'endroit appelé Grande Fourche.

Q Et quelle partie avez-vous visitée ou
fouillée?

R Plus précisément, à environ quarante à
cinquante pieds au nord du petit camp de Coffin.

Q Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait, là?

R J'ai fait des recherches avec Synnett dans
cette partie de la forêt, principalement près de petits sapins.

Q Et puis, combien de temps avez-vous cherché
comme ça?

R A partir de sept heures et demie du matin
aller jusqu'à onze heures de l'avant-midi, je crois.

Q Et avez-vous trouvé quelque chose?

R Non monsieur.

Q Pour aller au camp de et à l'endroit où vous
avez fait des recherches sur l'information précise que vous aviez obtenue,
est-ce qu'il faut passer par une barrière?

R Oui, il y a une barrière à environ un
demi-mille de la route nationale, qui conduit de Percé à Gaspé.

Police Constable Synnett—

Q. Now, Mr. Synnett,
had you the occasion to accompany Mr. Doyon in
order, to make any searches in the vicinity of a camp belonging to Coffin?

A. Yes, we went there on the day of the last Coroner's
inquest, or the day following the last Coroner's inquest.

Q. Do you remember what date it was?

A. On the 28th day of August.

Q. Now, will you tell us in what circumstances you made that
trip, and what you noticed at that occasion?

A. We were going to look for a rifle.

Q. Do you know to whom belonged that rifle?

A. Yes, I did, at the time.

Q. Who?

A. John Jack Eagle.

Q. Will you go on?

[Page 238]

A. We proceeded to the place where Sergeant Doyon bad got
his information from—where the indicated spot was supposed to be, and we got
there at the indicated place, and the rifle was not there.

Q. How long did you spend for your search?

A. About an hour.

In my view all those parts of these passages which shewed
that Doyon had information that Eagle's rifle was concealed in a precisely
indicated spot in the neighbourhood of Coffin's camp were inadmissible as being
hearsay evidence. Their meaning is not doubtful; and the jury could only
understand them as a statement that someone, unnamed and not called as a
witness, had told Doyon that Eagle's rifle was concealed near to some small fir
trees 40 or 50 feet to the north of Coffin's cabin and had given Doyon precise
information as to its hiding-place. On this illegal foundation there was
erected and placed before the jury the theory that Coffin had told his brother
Donald where the rifle was and had prevailed on him to get it and make away
with it and that Donald was"" the driver of the vehicle heard to rush past
the barrier in the early morning of August 28. Without evidence that Eagle's
rifle was in fact hidden near Coffin's camp prior to the night of August 27/28
the whole incident was of negligible probative value and connected with the
accused so remotely, if at all, as to be inadmissible because irrelevant; but
with evidence that the rifle was so concealed counsel for the Crown was in a
position to ask and did ask the jury to infer a conspiracy between Coffin and
his brother to destroy what was, in the Crown's theory, the murder weapon.
Evidence that an accused has suppressed or endeavoured to suppress evidence is
admissible circumstantial evidence against him, but here the foundation of the
whole incident on which the jury were invited to find that he had suppressed
evidence was the inadmissible hearsay evidence dealt with above.

In my view, the admission of this hearsay evidence was a
grave error in law. I do not think that counsel for the Crown can be heard to
say that the evidence was unimportant for it was forcibly put to the jury, in
the address of counsel, as a circumstance pointing to Coffin's guilt and
throwing upon the defence the onus of calling Donald Coffin as a witness which
they had not done.

[Page 239]

When he came to charge the jury the learned trial judge did
so firsi in English and then in French. His charge in English concluded at
12.15 p.m. and the Court adjourned; on resuming at 2.15 p.m. the learned judge
addressed the jury in English as follows:—

Gentlemen, before I address you in French, I want to make
certain corrections. There is an incident in the evidence which I had noted and
I intended to draw your attention to, and I unfortunately overlooked it this
morning.

I told you that on the occasion of that trip in the bush,
MacDonald had declared! that he had not seen any rifle in the equipment, and
that on the 12th of June MacGregor at Murray Patterson's place, had testified
to the fact that he had seen a rifle in the pick-up which was driven by Coffin.

Now, maybe something could be said to complete that part of
the evidence, because there is the testimony of Doyon who later went to
Coffin's camp, following what he declared to be a precise information, the
nature of which has not been established, though; and he says that he had not
found any rifle at that place.

And you have then the conversation which on the previous day
Coffin would have had with his brother at Gaspe, and during that night the gate
keeper's wife, on the road leading to Coffin's camp, would have heard the noise
of an automobile, and the following morning, they saw tracks that didn't cross
on the highway through the gate, but went around.

You will give to these facts the interpretation that should
be given in the light of your judgment and the evidence.

The learned trial judge dealt with the incident in
substantially similar terms when he charged them in French. We find therefore
that inadmissible testimony which had been vigorously stressed by Crown counsel
was again brought to the attention of the jury by the learned trial judge with
an instruction that they should consider it.

In my view the following words of Anglin C.J.C., giving the
unanimous judgment of the Court in Stein v. The King 40, are applicable to the case at bar:—

It is impossible to say that in the case now before us there
has been no miscarriage of justice. It may be that sometimes objectionable
testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the
court would be justified in taking the view that in all human probability it
could have had no effect upon the jury's mind, and, on that ground, in refusing
to set aside the verdict. But it is impossible so to regard this case, where,
in a most vital matter, the learned judge did not merely fail to warn the jury
to disregard the objectionable matter contained in the statements which had
been admitted in evidence, but actually stressed it.

It is my view that this hearsay evidence in the case at
bar related to a vital matter and, as I have already mentioned,

[Page 240]

I do not think that, in view of the way in which they
stressed it to the jury, counsel for the Crown can now be heard to belittle its
importance. Allegans contraria non est audiendus.

Ground 5.

I will deal next with
ground No. 5. In the memorandum filed on the application for leave to
appeal, this ground was extended to read as follows:—

It is respectively submitted that the crucial testimony
given by Marion Petrie inadmissible for two reasons:—

(a) Her testimony was
privileged by virtue of the provisions of section 4  of the Canada Evidence Act ;
and

(b) She was submitted to a
severe cross examination by Crown Counsel notwithstanding the fact that the
Trial Judge had refused the application of Crown Counsel to have her declared a
hostile witness.

Before us, Mr. Maloney did not argue ground (a),
on which the authorities seem to be conclusive, but pressed ground (b).

The witness Marion Petrie was called
by the Crown; she was shown to have lived with Coffin for some years as his
wife. According to her evidence he arrived at her residence in Montreal at
about 2.00 a.m. on June 15 and remained for some days. Some of her evidence
assisted the Crown's case, for example she deposed that Coffin had possession
of articles which other witnesses testified had belonged to the deceased. Her
evidence in chief reads, in part, as follows:—

… When we were talking, he told me about when he went in the
woods, he met three Americans, they had their truck that was broke down, and he
took one of the fellows down to Gaspe to get a gas line or something fixed; he
brought the fellow back, they gave him a pair of binoculars and a knife as a
souvenir. He didn't mention anything about any money.

Q. Did he say he had left the three Americans in the bush?

A. Yes, when he came back, he left the other fellow with the
other two.

Q. You mean the one …

A. The one that he had taken down to Gaspe, he brought back.

Q. That he had left him in the bush with the other two?

A. With the other two.

Q. Is that all he said?

A. Oh, when I asked him if they got the truck fixed, he said
there was another two chaps there the last time he seen them.

Q. Did he say who those fellows were?

[Page 241]

A. He just: said he left them with another two friends, he
didn't say who, and I didn't bother to ask him.

Q. He gave you no more details on that?

A. No, I was not interested.

* * *

Q. So, when did Coffin mention for the first time that there
were two others but the three Americans that we are interested in?

A. Well, it was a few days after he had arrived, I had asked
him, it was just something that was going through my head, and I asked him if
they got the truck fixed. When I asked him if they got the truck fixed, he
said: ""The last time I seen them, there was two chaps with them.""

It is obvious from the record that Crown counsel did not
accept as truthful the witness' statement, that Coffin had told her that when
he last saw them he had left the Lindsays and Claar in company with two other
Americans; and counsel proceeded, against the repeated objections of defence
counsel and in spite of the definite refusal of the learned trial judge to
declare Miss Petrie an witness, to conduct a
cross-examination, in the course of which he referred her to a statement she was
alleged to have made to a police officer and to the evidence she had given at
the preliminary inquiry. The examination of this witness by Crown counsel
concludes as follows:—

Q. Do you recall having been heard as a witness at the
preliminary. inquiry ?

A. Yes sir.

Q. And that was about a year ago?

A. Yes sir.

Q. Was your memory fresh over the facts we are concerned
about, at the time?

A. A little better than they are now. Q. Now, would you like
to refresh your memory?

A. ………….

Q. What did your memory tell you at the time?

Mr. Raymond Maher,

For the Defence:

OBJECTED to the way of putting the question.

Mr. Paul Miquelon, Q.C.

For the Prosecution:

Q. What did your memory tell you at the time?

A. He just said three; he mentioned the three when he went
out with them.

OBJECTION BY Mr. Francois Gravel,

For the Defence:

Mr. Paul Miquelon, Q.C.

For the Prosecution:

Q. How did your memory serve you at the time?

A. Not too bad, I guess.

[Page 242]

Q. Well, what did it say?

A. He just said ""three"", he mentioned the three
when he went out with them.

Q. To what question did you give that answer at the time?

A. Did he talk about one American hunter or a second group
or a party.

Q. And, to that question, the answer was the one you just
gave us?

A. He just said three.

Q. And that answer was?

A. He just said three, he mentioned the three when he went
out with them.

It was argued before us that, whether or not counsel was
entitled to cross-examine his own witness, he was entitled to have her refresh
her memory by reading inaudibly to herself the evidence which she had given at
the preliminary inquiry. In Lizotte v. The King 41, the question whether a witness may
refresh his memory by referring to the transcript of his evidence at the
preliminary hearing was left open after attention had been called to the views
expressed by eminent writers and I do not find it necessary to decide that
question in this case, as it seems clear from reading the record that the
transcript of the preliminary hearing was used not for the purpose of
refreshing the memory of the witness, who had already without assistance
testified as to her conversations with Coffin, but for the purpose of
endeavouring to have her admit, (i) that at the preliminary inquiry she had not
referred to any statement by Coffin that he had left the three deceased with
two other Americans, and (ii) that she must have been mistaken or untruthful in
her evidence at the trial in saying that Coffin had made such statement to her.

When all of the evidence of this witness is read it does not
appear to me that there was any unexplained difference between her evidence at
the preliminary inquiry and that which she gave at the trial; but the jury may
well have taken a different view as they were invited to do by Crown counsel as
appears from the following passages in his address:—

Now, I am not here to judge Coffin's personal life, nor his
wife's personal life, but on the other hand you know that that person who goes
around as Mrs. Coffin is not Mrs. Coffin, they live as man and wife, I could
not expect, and neither could you expect her to come here and tell us the whole
story. I could not expect that, and she wouldn't be his wife, common wife or otherwise,
and even if she did deny that Coffin confessed everything to her, but there is
one other important point, after

[Page 243]

many contradictions, she admits—and keep that in mind—she
admits that Coffin never mentioned two other American and she, at the last part
of her testimony, she came back to what she had said at the preliminary inquiry
when she told us her memory served her much better, that he only mentioned
three Americans, and remember that later on, when we get Coffin back in Gaspe,
because if there is one person in the world to whom he should have confided
during that night, it was Mrs. Coffin, not his mother but his common-law wife.

* * *

Did Coffin try to point those two Americans as possible
culprits? I know he did, we brought them here to tell us their story. Do you
think that story is true when you have heard the story of Marion Petrie whom he never mentioned, according to her own
testimony—and you can believe that woman when she comes up and says anything
that would hurt Coffin—I don't say she should be believed as easily when she
says something in favour of Coffin, but when she states something against
Coffin, it is because she has to say it and can't get out of it.

In my view the cross-examination of this witness by
Crown counsel was unlawful, and was attended by a further error in that no
warning was given to the jury that any evidence of what the witness had said at
the preliminary inquiry was not evidence of the truth of the facts then stated
but could be considered by them only for the purpose of testing the credibility
of the testimony which she had given before them at the trial. Similar errors
were treated as grounds for quashing a conviction in Rex v. Duckworth
42 and in Rex v. Darlyn43.

Ground 6.

I will deal next with
ground No. 6. It appears that during the course of the trial the jury asked
permission to attend a moving picture theatre. The learned trial judge
consulted counsel and a consent in the following terms was signed by Coffin and
his counsel:—

Nous soussignés consentons que les jurés se
rendent au cinéma à ce 27e jour de juillet , sous les conditions suivantes:

1. Que six gendarmes aient la charge des
jurés, sous la direction du sergent Cassista;

2. Que la représentation ne représente aucun
procès quelconque;

3. Que les jurés et les gendarmes soient tenus
complètement à part du public dans le théâtre et à la sortie.

Six constables were sworn to escort
the jury to and from the moving: picture theatre at Chandler, the journey being
made in automobiles. The record does not disclose the oath administered to the
constables. There is. nothing in the

[Page 244]

record to suggest that during the
course of this excursion any of the jury had communication with any member of
the public or that there was an improper conversation between the constables
and the members of the jury; but a few days later two of these constables were
called and examined as Crown witnesses. One of them, Poirier, did
not give evidence of any importance, but the other, Pépin, evidence
of a conversation between Coffin and his father which took place after Coffin
had been in custody for about 17 days. As to this Pépin:—

A. Well, all I heard was this: Mr. Coffin, Wilbert's father,
said: ""are they treating you well?"" He says: ""Yes, I am
well."" He says: ""don't worry Dad, I'll be home soon,"" and before
he left, the accused: ""they are not man enough to break me.""

In the Court of Queen's Bench, Hyde J. after quoting
the above answer continues:—

This is certainly not one of the essential links in the
chain of circumstances. I do not regard it as necessarily incriminating but
certainly, looked at in a certain light, it could be prejudicial to the
Appellant.

At the trial however it had been stressed by Crown
counsel in the following terms:—

Et je terminerai par ce dernier mot qui a été
également l'un des derniers de la preuve, celui-là qu'il a prononcé lui-même
devant les hommes de police à l'adresse de son père: ""They are not man
enough to break me."" Ils ne sont pas assez hommes pour me casser ou me
briser.

Messieurs, est-ce là le langage d'un innocent?
Est-ce là le langage d'une personne qui n'a rien à se reprocher? Est-ce là le
langage d'une personne qui ne fuit pas la justice? Est-ce là le langage d'une
conscience qui véritablement est en paix? .

Je vous pose la question, et je crois que ces
derniers mots sont lourds' de signification. Il ne crie pas: ""Je suis
innocent, mon père,"" il ne crie, pas: ""Je n'ai rien fait de tel, mon
père."" Non: ""Non, ne vous inquiétez pas, ils ne sont pas assez hommes
pour me casser ou pour me briser."" En d'autres termes: Non, la vérité, ils
ne la connaîtront jamais, la vérité, je l'ai enfouie avec mon crime dans les
profondeurs des bois où j'ai abattu ces trois Américains; la vérité n'éclairera
pas, et si la vérité n'éclate pas, la justice sera muette.

Eh bien non, messieurs les jurés, j'ai
confiance que la justice ne sera pas muette, et que vous allez donner l'exemple
d'abord à votre district, …

and in his charge the learned trial judge invited the jury to consider whether or not Coffin's statement to his father indicated a guilty mind. I
mention this not to suggest that either the learned judge or counsel for the
Crown made improper use of this piece of evidence but to shew the importance
assigned to it in the conduct of the Crown's case at the trial. While, as
mentioned above, there is no

[Page 245]

evidence to suggest that any improper communication in
fact took place between this officer and any member of the jury, this
unfortunate incident appears to me to fall within the principle stated by Sloan
C.J. in Rex v. Masuda 44, as
follows:—

Stripped to its bare essentials, there can be no escape from
the fact that three Crown Witnesses dined with the jury during a murder trial.
It seems to me that to countenance such a situation as is thus presented,
violates two essentials of justice. The one is that the jury must be kept
completely free from any opportunity of communication during the trial, except
under the most exceptional circumstances calling for a direction from the
Court; and, secondly, that nothing must occur during the trial of a case from
which a suspicion may arise that any taint attaches to the proper and
meticulous fairness which must always surround the administration of public
justice, more especially when a man is on trial for his life.

* * *

Moreover, if Crown witnesses are permitted to join the jury
in an atmosphere of sociability during the adjournment of a murder trial, the
confidence of the public in our present system of trial by jury would be
shaken. The Courts are the custodians of that confidence and it must be upheld
and not weakened. Thus it appears to us that the opportunity for communication,
while a factor for consideration, is not the whole test to be applied in the
circumstances. The test, in our opinion, is that enunciated by Lord Hewart,
C.J. in R. v. Sussex Justices, (1923) 93 L.J.K.B. p. 129 at p.
131 wherein he said: ""Nothing is to be done which so much as creates even
a suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of
justice"", and ""it is … of fundamental importance, that justice should
not only be done, but be manifestly and undoubtedly seen to be done.""

I agree with everything that was said by the learned
Chief Justice in the passages quoted; and I am unable to find any such
essential difference between the circumstances under which the jury were in
company with the Crown witness in the case before us and those in the case with
which the learned Chief Justice was dealing as would justify our refusing to
apply the principle which he enunciated. In my view, unless we are prepared to
overrule the judgment in Rex v. Masuda, there is no escape from
holding that the incident on which this ground of appeal is founded was fatal
to the: validity of the conviction.

Ground 7.

I will deal next with ground No. 7. It appears from the Procès-verbal Coffin's trial commenced at Percé on 15, 1954, and that on, May 29, 1954 a notice had
been

[Page 246]

served on the Attorney General of Quebec and the Clerk of
the Queen's Bench, Criminal Assize Division, Percé, on of
Coffin, indicating that he could not speak or understand the French language
and that he would ask at his trial for a jury of his own tongue. On his
arraignment on July 15, 1954 the defence moved that Coffin be tried by a jury
composed entirely of jurors speaking the English language. On this motion Crown
counsel called as a witness the Sheriff of the district of Gaspé
deposed that of the jurors on the list of those qualified for the
district about twelve to fifteen per cent were English-speaking and the
remainder were French-speaking. The learned trial judge reserved judgment on
the motion and gave judgment the' following day rejecting the motion and
ordering that the trial proceed before a mixed jury. The reasons for this
decision are set out in full in Volume I of the record at pages 25 to 30
inclusive. As I read these reasons the decision of the learned judge was based
upon the following considerations: (i) that the persons whose names appeared
upon the list of jurors who were English-speaking was twelve to fifteen per
cent of the total, the remainder being French-speaking; (ii) that because of
exemptions granted by the Court and the anticipated challenges, either for
cause or peremptory, it appeared almost impossible to obtain a jury composed
entirely of persons speaking the language of the accused; (iii) in the words of
the learned judge:—

CONSIDERING that it does not seem to be in the spirit of the
law that to exercise its discretion, in the sense of paragraph 3, Section 923,
the Tribunal must eliminate eighty-five to eighty-eight per cent of the
qualified talesmen in one district;

Section 923  of the Criminal Code , in force at the
date of the trial, reads as follows:—

923. In those districts in the province of Quebec in which
the sheriff, is required by law to return a panel of petit jurors composed,
one-half of persons speaking the English language, and one-half of persons
speaking the French language, he shall in his return specify separately those
jurors whom he returns as speaking the English language, and those whom he
returns as speaking the French language respectively; and the names of the
jurors so summoned shall be called alternately from such lists.

2. In any district, the prisoner may upon arraignment move.
that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English
language, or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language.

[Page 247]

3. Upon such motion the judge may order the sheriff to
summon a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English or the French
language, unless in his discretion it appears that the ends of justice are
better served by impanelling a mixed jury.

This section was considered by this Court in Piperno
v. The Queen 45
After re-reading the judgment of the majority in that case, delivered by my
brother Fauteux, and all the authorities to which reference is made therein, it
is my view that the proper construction of s. 923  as applied to the facts of
the case before us is as follows. Coffin having moved that he be tried by a
jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, and it being
conceded that English is his mother tongue and that he does not I speak the
French language, was prima facie entitled to be so tried and could be
required to stand his trial before a mixed jury only if it appeared to the
learned judge presiding at the trial in his discretion that the ends of justice
would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury. Provided the learned judge
exercised his discretion on relevant grounds and in accordance with the law an
appellate court would not interfere with his decision; but, with respect, it
appears to me that he did not direct his mind to the question whether the ends
of justice in the case before him would be better served by empanelling a mixed
jury; that the three reasons, set out above, which he assigns for exercising
his discretion in the way he did, and particularly the last mentioned of these
reasons, were irrelevant considerations; and that, in the result, Coffin was
deprived of a right of which he could only be lawfully deprived by the learned
judge exercising his discretion on relevant and legal grounds.

On a proper construction of s. 923  of the Criminal Code  the
question which the learned judge was required to put to himself was whether in
the case which he was about to try the ends of justice would be better served
by empanelling a mixed jury rather than one composed entirely of jurors
speaking the language of the accused, and not whether the empanelling of a jury
of the sort last mentioned would be attended with difficulty or whether the
language of the accused was or was not that spoken by the majority of the
residents of the district in which he was on

[Page 248]

trial for his life. I respectfully
agree with the following passage in the judgment of Langlais J. in Rex v.
Twyndham and McGurk 46:

If I refer to s. 923  of the Criminal Code , subsection (2), I
read: ""In any district, the prisoner may upon arraignment move that he be
tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, or
entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language.""

Therefore the prisoner when English or French has a right to
move for a jury of his own tongue. It is his privilege and unless there are
special grounds not to grant him such a motion he has an absolute right to it.

Is there a restriction and what is it?

We find it in subsection (3) of the same section which reads
as follows: ""Upon such motion the judge may order the sheriff to summon a
sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English or the French language, unless
in his discretion it appears that the ends of justice are better served by
impanelling a mixed jury."" 

That subsection gives a discretion to the presiding Judge.

Then it is quite clear that the general rule favours
granting the motion unless there are special reasons to refuse it.

In Piperno v. The Queen (supra)
at page 295 my brother Fauteux said:—

Ce qui est sanctionné par la loi, c'est une
faculté donnée à un prévenu, dans la province de Québec, de demander à être
jugé par des jurés familiers avec la langue qu'il parle lui-même—pourvu que ce
soit le français ou l'anglais—et le droit d'obtenir alors au moins un jury
mixte si, dans la discrétion du Juge, il apparaît que les fins de la Justice
soient ainsi mieux servies qu'en faisant droit à sa demande.

There was no need in that case to consider the nature
of the grounds on which the exercise of the discretion given to the trial judge
by s. 923 (3) can lawfully be based. An examination of the record in the case
before us has failed to disclose any ground which appears to me to be
sufficient in law to warrant the accused being denied a jury composed entirely
of persons speaking his language.

This error does not appear to be cured by the provisions of
s. 1011  of the Criminal Code . It was, in my respectful view, an error in
law on the part of the learned trial judge in deciding how the case should be
tried. If the provisions of s. 1011  were an answer in this case they would
equally have been an answer to the objection to which effect was given in Alexander
v. Regem 47,
which was one of the decisions approved in Piperno v. The Queen. Had
this ground alone been raised it would, in my opinion, require

[Page 249]

the setting aside of the verdict; and consequently I do not
find it necessary to consider the related grounds numbers 8 and 9.

Ground 3.

I will deal next with
ground No. 3. What is here complained of is not that the learned trial judge
failed to direct the jury in the manner required by the rule in Hodge's case
but rather that, having properly instructed them as to how they should approach
a case resting solely on circumstantial evidence, he mistakenly gave them to
understand that the case against Coffin did not consist solely of
circumstantial evidence, as, in fact, it clearly did. The passages which are
chiefly objected to are as follows:—

In the present case, the evidence which has been adduced by
the Crown is of two distinctive kinds.

There is: 1) The circumstantial evidence which I have
explained; and 2) The declarations which would have been made by the accused.

* * *

We can say, I believe, that the evidence offered by the
Crown can be divided in two kinds:

1. Circumstantial evidence.

2. Evidence of conversation or words spoken by the accused.

It is argued by counsel for the Attorney General that any
harm done by these passages was remedied later in the charge and particular
reference is made to the following passage:—

It is evident that considering the whole of these facts, no
direct proof can be found anywhere and it is precisely there where you are
asked to extract from the circumstances the conclusions which, in your
estimation, you must take as the result of these facts.

It should tie borne in mind, as was pointed out by
Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Comba 48 and
by some members of this Court in Boucher v. The Queen 49, that the rule in Hodge's case
is quite distinct from the rule requiring a direction on the question of
reasonable doubt; and if, on reading the charge as â ,
I came to the conclusion that the jury were left in doubt as to whether the
rule in Hodge's did not apply to all the evidence in the case before us
I would have regarded this as serious error. When the charge is read as a whole
I incline to the view that the jury were not misled in the way suggested; but,
as on several other grounds I have concluded that there should be a new

[Page 250]

trial, I do not pursue this further.
For the same reason I find it unnecessary to deal with grounds numbers 1, 2 and
10 and I express no opinion in regard to them.

Mr. Miquelon, while maintaining that there had been no error
in law at the trial, argued, alternatively, that, even if we should be of
opinion that any of the errors alleged by Coffin's counsel were made out, the
legally admissible evidence was overwhelming and that, had such errors not
occurred, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict; and that the
Court should apply the provisions of s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code  and
dismiss the appeal. That the Crown's case was a very strong one cannot be
denied but I find myself unable to affirm with certainty that if none of the
matters which I regard as errors had occurred the jury must necessarily have
convicted. Reading the written record we cannot say to what extent each witness
weighed with the jury or how much importance they attached to one or another of
the items of evidence; and, to borrow the words of Viscount Sankey in Maxwell
v. Director of Public Prosecutions 50, it
may well be that the hearsay evidence as. to Eagle's rifle or the effect which
the jury were invited to give to the unlawful cross-examination of Marion Petrie may have been the last ounce which turned the scale
against the accused. But the matter does not rest here. Section 1014 (2)  reads
as follows:—

The court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding
that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

This sub-section has often been considered by this
Court and its meaning is stated in the following passage in the judgment of
Kerwin J., as he then was, in Schmidt v. The King 51:

The meaning of these words has been considered in this Court
in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King, from all of
which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to satisfy the Court that
the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct
or if no evidence had been improperly admitted. The principles therein set
forth do not differ from the rules set forth in a recent decision of the House
of Lords in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e.,
that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred

[Page 251]

in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a
reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly
admissible, without doubt convict.

It will be observed that, once error in law has been
found to have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to
satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such
error had not occurred. The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent
to the right of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the sub-section at
all. The Court is not bound to apply the sub-section merely because this onus
is discharged. Even if the onus referred to could be regarded as having been
satisfied by the Crown in the case before us it would nonetheless be my opinion
that the error in law which I have dealt with under ground 4 above was so
substantial a wrong that the verdict could not be saved by the application of
s. 1014 (2) . To hold otherwise would, I think, be contrary to the principles
enunciated in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales 52, Allen v. The King 53, Northey v. The King 54 and the judgment of my brother Locke
in Boucher v. The Queen 55.

In Makin's
case at page 70 Lord Herschell L.C. said in dealing with; a
provision similar to s. 1014 (2) :—

Their Lordships do not think it can properly be said that
there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, where on a point
material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the jury have,
notwithstanding objection, been invited by the. judge to consider in arriving
at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them.

In their Lordships' opinion substantial wrong would be done
to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved
by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the Court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need scarcely be said that
there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in
the manner contended for.

This passage is I think applicable to the case before
us.

What I have said as to s. 1014 (2)  has been related
primarily to the grounds other than grounds numbers G and
7. As to ground 6 the passages which I have quoted from the reasons of Sloan
C.J. seem to me to show that the conviction must be set aside on this ground
even if the Court should be of the view that there was in fact neither
substantial; wrong nor miscarriage of justice because one

[Page 252]

of the main grounds of the decision of Sloan C.J. rests on :
the importance of justice being not merely done in fact but being plainly seen
to be done.

As to ground 7, I think that the error which occurred is such
that by its very nature it cannot be cured by the application of s. 1014 (2) .

In the result, if leave to appeal had been granted on those
grounds advanced on the application for leave to appeal with which I have dealt
above, it would have been my opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

Fauteux J.:—For
the reasons given by my brother Kellock, my answer to the question referred to
the Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Habitual
criminals—Procedure—Impropriety of judge hearing evidence as to previous record
before commencing enquiry—The Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 660,
662.

[Page 769]

The appellant was convicted by a jury of
theft. Notice had been served on him, pursuant to s. 662(1)  of the Criminal
Code , that the prosecutor would ask to have him found to be an habitual
criminal. Immediately after the jury’s verdict the trial judge heard
representations as to sentence, and had before him a probation officer’s report
setting out the appellant’s previous history, including numerous convictions.
Before actually sentencing the appellant on the theft charge, the trial judge
held an enquiry in respect of the allegation that the appellant was an habitual
criminal, and at the end of that enquiry, having found the allegation proved,
he sentenced the appellant to preventive detention, as well as to two years’
imprisonment on the conviction for theft. The accused appealed against the
finding that he was an habitual criminal, and the sentence of preventive
detention.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the sentence of preventive detention should be
quashed.

The provision in s. 662(2) that an
application under Part XXI shall be heard and determined before sentence is
passed for the primary offence, requires that that hearing be opened
immediately after the accused is found guilty, which enables the trial judge to
enter upon the enquiry without previous knowledge of the accused’s past
conduct. By considering the probation officer’s report before commencing the
enquiry, and then relying upon it in finding that the accused was an habitual
criminal, although it was not proved on that hearing, the trial judge had acted
contrary to the provisions of the Code, and the proceedings on the
enquiry were a nullity. In the circumstances the appeal could not be dismissed
under s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], dismissing an
appeal against a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed.

E.P. Hartt, for the appellant.

W.B. Common, Q.C., for the
Attorney-General for Ontario, respondent.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The appellant was convicted on
June 7, 1955, at St. Thomas, Ontario, by His Honour Judge Grosch
and a jury, upon the following charge:—

That Joseph Wilfred Parkes, at the Township of Bayham, in the County of Elgin, on
or about the 8th day of February in the year 1955, unlawfully did steal one
automobile the property of Basil Nevill, contrary to the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

Previous to that conviction, an application,
with the consent of the Attorney-General, had been made by the Crown prosecutor
pursuant to s. 660  of the Criminal Code , to have the accused declared a
habitual criminal. This section reads as follows:—

660. (1) Where an accused is convicted of
an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive
detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the offence of
which he is convicted if

[Page 770]

(a) the accused is found to be
an habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the
opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has previously, since
attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent
occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to
imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal
life, or

(b) he has been previously
sentenced to preventive detention.

Section 662 enacts certain provisions which
apply to applications of this kind, and s-s. (2) says:—

(2) An application under this Part shall
be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which
the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.

(The italics are mine.)

It is clear from the record, that before hearing
this application His Honour Judge Grosch, instead of hearing it immediately as
required by law (vide Rex v. Triffitt[2]),
considered a detailed probation report on the accused, obviously for the
purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on the theft charge. He then
proceeded to hear the application under s. 660 , found the accused to be a
habitual criminal as defined by s-s. (2). He ordered him to be confined to a
penitentiary for an indeterminate period and sentenced him to two years on the
charge of theft. The Court of Appeal confirmed the order of preventive
detention, and we are concerned only with that particular appeal.

I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge
did not follow the proper procedure in considering the probation report before
hearing and determining the application made under s. 660 . I entertain no doubt
that this report, covering a period of twenty-five years, influenced him
considerably in reaching the conclusion that the appellant was a habitual
criminal and was leading persistently a criminal life. The latter suffered a
prejudice such that I cannot see the possibility of applying s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code . I am not satisfied that the judgment on the
application would have necessarily been the same if the provisions of the law
had been followed.

[Page 771]

I would allow the appeal and quash the order for
preventive detention.

RAND J.:—This is an appeal from the affirmance
by the Court of Appeal for Ontario of a determination by a county court judge that the appellant was
an habitual criminal.

The Criminal Code  deals with this matter
in s. 662 , the relevant provisions of which are as follows:

662. (1) Notice of application. The
following provisions apply with respect to applications under this Part,
namely,

(a) an application under
subsection (1) of section 660  shall not be heard unless

(i) the Attorney General of the province in
which the accused is to be tried consents, 

(ii) seven clear days’ notice has been
given to the accused by the prosecutor specifying the previous convictions and
the other circumstances, if any, upon which it is intended to found the
application, and 

(iii) a copy of the notice has been filed
with the clerk of the court or the magistrate, as the case may be; and

(b) an application under
subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear
days’ notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy
of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the
magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.

(2) An application under this Part shall be
heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the
accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.

Several grounds were raised which were said to
go to the invalidity of the conviction, among them the following: that the
trial judge had heard evidence of a police record of the accused for the
purposes of the sentence on the primary conviction before entering upon the
subsidiary charge; that the proof of the prior convictions by way of
certificate was defective because they had not been signed by the authorized
officer of the court of conviction and that the description of the conviction
was insufficient in omitting in each case the name of the court and the
sentence given; that in the notice to the accused there was a similar failure
to specify the court and the sentence imposed; that the notice failed to set
forth the particulars of conduct to be adduced to show that the accused was
“leading persistently a criminal life”. The question also of the powers of the
Court of Appeal in such an appeal was raised, that is

[Page 772]

whether the appeal given by s. 667 and the
reference in s-s. (3) to the provisions of Part XVIII “with respect to
procedure on appeals” enables the court to deal with the appeal as fully as in
the case of an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence.

I do not find it necessary to examine more than
the first ground. Section 660(2) expressly requires that the application
shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the main offence.
The reference to sentence means before any step is taken toward the
pronouncement of sentence and it embraces what has come to be a practice of
submitting to the court a record or information showing the conduct, character,
reputation, events, and circumstances of the life of the accused. What is the
consideration behind this requirement of the subsection?

The question has been raised in England in a number of cases. In Rex v.
Turner[3]
Channell J., delivering the judgment of the court, at p. 363 says:—

The facts which are to be proved on the
charge of being a habitual criminal are the same as those with reference to
which the Court at a trial always desires information before passing sentence,
and it is therefore impossible that the Legislature could have intended that
sentence must be passed before those facts are inquired into.

This was followed in Rex v. Coney[4]. At p. 129 the Lord Chief Justice said:—

Counsel for the prosecution then called
witnesses with reference to appellant’s previous convictions and character, and
counsel for the appellant addressed the Court, putting forward reasons why he
should not be sent to penal servitude. If that procedure is followed, the jury,
and other jurors waiting in Court, may hear all that is relevant about a
prisoner’s antecedents given to enable the Court to decide whether a sentence
of penal servitude should be imposed. All kinds of statements adverse to the
prisoner and relevant to his punishment may be given in evidence in the
presence of those who, on different and more limited grounds, may afterwards be
called upon to decide whether he is a habitual criminal… It was never intended
that the persons who, upon the particular grounds set out in the statute, might
have to decide whether a prisoner was a habitual criminal, should have in their
minds all the material necessary to enable a Court to decide whether a sentence
of penal servitude should be imposed.

[Page 773]

In Rex v. Triffitt[5], in which the conviction and sentence on
the main charge were made and pronounced by one court and the subsequent
application dealt with by another, Humphreys J., speaking of the ground
now being considered and referring to Rex v. Jennings[6], quotes the headnote of that case with
approval:—

An indictment for being a habitual
‘criminal under the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, must be tried immediately
after the primary charge.

Finally, in Rex v. Vale[7], a case somewhat similar to Triffitt in
which, however, only the plea of guilty had been received by the first court,
Branson J. at p. 356, dealing with language of Humphreys J. in Triffitt, observes:—

“Follow immediately” means dealing with the
case without hearing the man’s previous history and before sentencing him.

In the proceeding before us the police record of
the accused was handed to the judge immediately after he had found the accused
guilty of the principal offence, and the latter was questioned on it as a
preliminary to the sentence. This brought into the mind of the judge the very
information the subsection was aimed to keep out. It goes to the substance
of the proceeding and is fatal to the subsequent determination.

On the other questions I should add generally
that there is no reason why a complete description of each conviction with
particulars should not be set forth both in the notice given to the accused and
in the certificate which likewise should be signed by the appropriate officer
of the court of conviction. The grounds of conduct, evidence of which it is
intended to adduce to show the criminal life being persistently followed by the
accused to the time of the notice, should be furnished by at least general
description such as persistence in petty offences, association with
disreputable characters and other characteristics of criminal habit, sufficient
to enable the accused reasonably to know what he is to meet.

There seems to be a tendency to treat a
proceeding under the section as one in which strict compliance with the
express requirements of the Code is not to be insisted on. That is altogether a
mistake. Under such a determination.

[Page 774]

a person can be detained in prison for the rest
of his life with his liberty dependent on the favourable discretion of a
minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most serious step in the
administration of the criminal law in relation to which it is well to recall
the words of the Lord Chief Justice of England in Martin v. Mackonochie[8], quoted by Meredith C.J.C.P. in Rex v.
Roach[9]:—

It seems to me, I must say, a, strange
argument in a court of justice, to say that when, as the law stands, formal
proceedings are in strict law required, yet if no substantial injustice has
been done by dealing summarily with a defendant, the proceeding should be
upheld. In a court of law such an argument à convenienti is surely inadmissible.
In a criminal proceeding the question is not alone whether substantial justice
has been done, but whether justice has been done according to law. All
proceedings in pœnam are, it need scarcely be observed, strictissimi juris; nor
should it be forgotten that the formalities of law, though here and there they
may lead to the escape of an offender, are intended on the whole to insure the
safe administration of justice and the protection of innocence, and must be
observed. A party accused has the right to insist upon them as a matter of
right, of which he cannot be deprived against his will; and the judge must see
that they are followed. He cannot set himself above the law which he has to
administer, or make or mould it to suit the exigencies of a particular
occasion. Though a murderer should be taken red-handed in the act, if there is
a flaw in the indictment the criminal must have the benefit of it. If the law
is imperfect, it is for the legislature to amend. The judge must administer it
as he finds it. And the procedure by which an offender is to be tried, though
but ancillary to the application of the substantive law and to the ends of
justice, is as much part of the law as the substantive law itself.

Mr. Common, with his customary fairness,
conceded the importance of some of these omissions but took the position that,
in view of all that had taken place before the judge including admissions drawn
out, some by the judge in questioning the accused on his police record for the
purpose of the first sentence, there could not by any possibility be a
miscarriage of justice, the ground on which the Court of Appeal acted. For the
reasons given, that submission cannot be accepted. In such a case form is
substance and if the loose practice followed in the present proceedings were
tolerated, the clear intention of Parliament to surround this new and extreme
power over the individual with specific safeguards would be nullified.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and quash
the conviction.

[Page 775]

LOCKE J.:—The appellant was on June 7, 1955
found guilty of stealing an automobile, by a jury in the Court of General
Sessions at St. Thomas.

In advance of this hearing the Crown had caused
a written notice to be served on the appellant, which appears to me to comply
with the requirements of s. 662  of the Criminal Code, informing him
that, if he should be convicted of the charge of theft referred to, an
application would be made under s. 660(1)  for a sentence of preventive
detention, in addition to any sentence that should be imposed for the offence
of which he was then convicted. 

The grounds for the proposed application as
stated in the notice were that, since the age of eighteen years on at least
three separate and independent occasions, the appellant had been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or
more and that he was leading persistently a criminal life.

Section 662(2) of the Code requires
that an application under Part XXI for preventive detention shall be heard and
determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is
convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.

Upon the jury returning its verdict, before
proceeding with the Crown’s application a discussion took place between the presiding
judge and counsel for the Crown and for the prisoner, which was relevant only
to the consideration of the sentence to be imposed for the theft, in the course
of which a document entitled “Probation Office Presentence Report”, signed by a
probation officer, was handed to the judge by the Crown prosecutor. This
report, apparently prepared under the provisions of s. 2 of The Probation
Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 291, contained an extensive review of the previous
career of the convicted person including information as to the criminal record
of one of his brothers, the fact that he had some 22 years earlier abandoned
his wife and four children, information as to his general habits and a detailed
history of his criminal record said to have been taken from reports of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and covering a period from 1929 to 1954. In
addition to convictions for some comparatively minor offences, this report
showed that during the previous period

[Page 776]

of 25 years the appellant had been convicted and
imprisoned for not less than 12 indictable offences for which he might have
been imprisoned for periods of five years or more. During the discussion that
took place, counsel acting for the appellant appears to have admitted three of
the four convictions mentioned in the notice served upon the appellant in
advance of his trial.

After the appellant’s long and unfavourable
criminal record had been discussed, the learned judge proceeded to hear the
Crown’s application under s. 660(1). Counsel for the prisoner was asked if he
had admitted three of the four convictions mentioned in the notice given to the
prisoner and, referring to what had taken place during the discussion regarding
sentence on the theft charge, counsel said that he had. Proof which appears to
me to be in satisfactory form was then given of the fourth of these convictions
which had been made at St. Thomas on July 15, 1952, on a charge of theft
preferred under s. 377 of the Code, for which a penalty of two years’
imprisonment had been imposed. Other than the evidence afforded by these four
convictions during the past ten years, the only evidence given on behalf of the
Crown in support of the contention that the appellant was “leading persistently
a criminal life” within the meaning of s. 660(2) (a) was that of a
police constable who had first seen the accused when he was tried in 1952 on
the offence above mentioned and who, when asked as to his general reputation in
the community in which he lived, said that it was bad.

The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf,
saying that he had been trying to straighten up but that whenever he got a job
he lost it as soon as his criminal record became known. He was asked as to
whether he was convicted of forgery at Whitby in 1929 but declined to admit the
fact. He was not cross-examined as to the other convictions which had been
referred to in the probation officer’s report, other than in regard to the
offence of breaking and entering for which he had been given five years’
suspended sentence in January of 1955.

Part X(A) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, dealing with habitual criminals, was first enacted in 1947, by c.
55, s. 18. Sections 575A to 575D were taken almost verbatim from
s. 10 of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908,

[Page 777]

8 Edw. VII (Imp.), c. 59. If
the person sought to be declared an habitual criminal was first tried for an
indictable offence and found guilty by a jury, the issue as to whether or not
he was an habitual criminal was tried by a jury. When these
subsections were re-enacted in the new Code, this procedure was
changed. Section 662(2), in addition to requiring that the application
should be heard before sentence was passed for the offence of which the accused
had then been convicted, directed that it should be heard by the court without
a jury. There was no change in the requirement that upon the application,
unless the accused person had previously been sentenced to preventive
detention, it was necessary to show that since attaining the age of eighteen
years, on at least three separate and independent occasions he had been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for
five years or more and was leading persistently a criminal life.

As pointed out by Channell J. in delivering the
judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Turner[10], dealing with the requirement of s. 10(2)
(a) of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, that if it is to be
found that he is “leading persistently a dishonest or criminal life”:—

  . . .the evidence against him must be brought
down to date—that is the important thing and that is necessary.

This applies with equal force to the language of
s. 660(2) (a).

In the case of Brusch v. The Queen[11], decided under the sections of the Code
applicable at that time, it will be noted that the Crown did not content
itself with proving the three convictions but asserted that the accused had
been “leading a persistently criminal life in that you have been an associate
of criminals, prostitutes, drug addicts and have had no regular employment or
occupation”, and called evidence in support of these statements. The
sufficiency of the evidence in the present matter to justify a finding that

[Page 778]

the present appellant should be found to be an
habitual criminal is, in my opinion, a matter of grave doubt. I, however, do
not consider that the present appeal should be disposed of on that ground.

The judgment delivered by the learned judge upon
the application showed clearly that, in arriving at his conclusion that the
appellant was an habitual criminal, he had considered the statements made in
the probation officer’s report purporting to cover a period of 25 years prior
to the trial. None of this was evidence that was properly before him. Evidence
of this long previous criminal record was doubtless admissible on the
application but it was not given and, in basing his decision at least partly
upon it, the learned judge acted upon matters outside the record.

In these circumstances there is, in my opinion,
no justification for applying the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii). As to this, I refer to what was said by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J.,
with whom Duff J. (as he then was) agreed, in Allen v. The King[12]:—

It was argued that the section of our
Code, upon which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially
provides that the appeal shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has
been admitted, if there is otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I
cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I said
before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to
exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial
that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there
is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter
favorem vitae.

While the trial referred to in Allen’s Case was
before a jury, these remarks, in my opinion, apply with equal force to a
hearing such as this before a single judge where the reasons delivered indicate
that he relied, at least in part, upon evidence which was not properly before
him.

Following the finding made, the learned judge
sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment on the charge of theft and,
accordingly, nothing further can be done under the application for preventive
detention. I would quash the finding that the appellant was an habitual
criminal and the direction that he be held in preventive detention.

The judgment of Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was
delivered by

[Page 779]

FAUTEUX J.:—Whether or not an accused is a
habitual criminal and by reason of this fact should, for the protection of the
public, be sentenced to detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate
period, involves an important issue of fact which must be heard and determined
according to law. Under the imperative provisions of s. 662(2)  of the Criminal
Code , the hearing and determination of this issue must take place before
sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted. The
reason for this order of precedence established in the procedure is to assure
the effective operation of all the safeguards which, both by the method of
inquiry and by the rules of evidence, attend the trial of any issue and, more
particularly, to exclude definitely any possibility that the judge entrusted
with the matter be, until it is finally determined, adversely influenced in any
degree by facts or representations of which, once an accused is convicted, he
may, without the same safeguards, be apprised for passing a sentence.

In the present instance, the sentence for the
offence of which the appellant was convicted was actually pronounced after the
hearing and determination of the issue related to preventive detention.
However, prior to such hearing, the judge, for the purpose of determining what
sentence he should impose, received from the prosecution and exacted from the
defence, in a most exhaustive manner, information of a character highly
damaging to the accused. In the result, when the subsequent hearing of the
issue related to preventive detention commenced, his mind was no longer free,
in the measure it should have been, had the provisions of s. 662(2)  been
complied with, and the effective exercise of the right which the appellant had,
on the hearing of such issue, to remain silent and hold the prosecution
strictly to its obligation to prove its case according to rules of procedure
and rules of evidence, was thenceforward jeopardized.

Counsel for the respondent admitted the
violation of s. 662(2) , attempting however, but in my view unsuccessfully, to
show that “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”. The
trial of the issue conducted in violation of the imperative provisions was
wholly invalid and such defect is not one contemplated under the curative provisions
of s. 592(1)  (b)(iii).

[Page 780]

The appeal should be allowed; the finding that
the appellant was a habitual criminal and the direction that he be held in
preventive detention should be quashed.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OP QUEEN'S BENCH (APPEAL SIDE) FOR
THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Common gaming houses—Slot machines—Machine
vending only amusement or ""services""—The Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 168, 170, 176.

A machine that vends only ""services"" or amusement (the
terms are synonymous) is within the definition of ""slot machine"" in
s. 170(2)  of the Criminal Code , if the result of one of any number of
operations is

[Page 799]

a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator. The
difference in wording between s. 170 and s. 986(4) of the old Code has
changed the law as laid down in Laphkas v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 84.
The finding of such a machine therefore gives rise, under s. 170(1), to a
conclusive presumption that the place where it is found is a common gaming
house, as defined in s. 168, and renders the keeper of the premises liable to
the penalties prescribed by s. 176.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench
(Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec 1,
reversing an acquittal by a magistrate. Appeal dismissed.

Dollard Dansereau, Q.C., and Rosario
Richer, for the appellant.

André Tessier, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux,
Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J. :—M. le Juge municipal Pascal Lachapelle a rendu, le 27 juillet 1955,
un jugement acquittant l'appelant, d'avoir, le 26 mai 1955, tenu une maison de
jeu publique à Montréal, utilisée pour l'opération de ""Bingo Pin Ball
machines"". Dans son jugement, le juge au procès se base sur les raisons
qu'il a données dans une cause similaire de Roland Beausoleil, pour rejeter la
plainte. Ce dernier jugement a été produit au dossier. La Cour d'Appel 2 a renversé cette décision, et le
prévenu veut la faire rétablir.

Les arts. 170 et 176 du Code Criminel  sont
ceux qui s'appliquent dans la présente cause. L'article 170  se lit ainsi:—

170. (1) Aux fins des procédures prévues par
la présente Partie, un local que l'on trouve muni d'un appareil à sous est de
façon concluante présumé une maison de jeu.

(2) Au présent article, l'expression
""appareil à sous"" signifie toute machine automatique ou appareil à
sous

a) employé ou destiné à être employé pour toute fin autre que la vente de
marchandises ou services; ou

b) utilisé ou destiné à être utilisé pour la vente de marchandises ou
services

(i) si le résultat
de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une affaire
de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur;

[Page 800]

(ii) si, en
'Conséquence d'un nombre donné d'opérations successives par l'opérateur, l'appareil
produit des résultats différents; ou

(iii) si, lors
d'une opération quelconque de l'appareil, celui-ci émet ou laisse échapper des
piécettes ou jetons.

L'article 176 est dans les termes suivants:—

176. (1) Est coupable d'un acte criminel et
passible d'un emprisonnement de deux ans, quiconque tient une maison de jeu ou
une maison de pari.

(2) Est coupable d'une infraction punissable
sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité, quiconque

a) est trouvé, sans excuse légitime, dans une maison de jeu ou
une maison de pari; ou

b) en qualité de possesseur, propriétaire, locateur, locataire,
occupant ou. agent, permet sciemment qu'un endroit soit loué ou utilisé pour
des fins de maison de jeu ou pari.

A l'art. 168 on y voit les définitions
suivantes:—

e) ""maison de désordre"" signifie une maison de débauche, une
maison de pari ou une maison de jeu;

f) ""jeu"" signifie un jeu de hasard ou un jeu où se mêlent
le hasard et l'adresse.

Dans cette cause de Beausoleil, identique à la
présente, M. le Juge Lachapelle a dit ce qui suit:—

Cette machine ne paye aucune monnaie, ne distribue
aucune marchandise ou jeton et ne procure au gagnant que le seul choix de jouer
l'appareil de nouveau avec un certain nombre de points enregistrés tel que déjà
décrits. Les possibilités de chance du joueur sont laissées au caprice et
hasard fixés d'avance par un mécanisme électronique compliqué, et l'habileté du
joueur n'y est pour rien.

Et plus loin dans son jugement, il s'exprime
de la façon suivante:—

La machine sous saisie est certes plus
dispendieuse à jouer que celle étudiée dans la cause de Adam 3, mais comme résultat elle ne
fait que procurer un divertissement et un amusement au joueur.

Dans la cause de Laphkas v. The King 4, la machine qui faisait l'objet
du litige a été déclarée légale parce qu'elle ne faisait que procurer un
amusement légitime au joueur en retour d'une modique somme d'argent. Dans cette
même cause, cette Cour a également décidé, qu'en vertu de l'ancien texte du Code
Criminel  (art. 986(4) ), lorsqu'une machine ne vendait que des ""services"",
elle n'était pas illégale et que le mot ""services"" avait
la même signification que le mot

[Page 801]

""amusements"". Le savant juge de
première instance a conclu que la machine en question dans la présente cause,
ne faisait que vendre des ""amusements"" et a, en conséquence,
déclaré l'opération de la machine légale.

Je ne puis m'accorder avec cette conclusion,
et je partage entièrement les vues de M. le Juge Hyde de la Cour du Banc de la
Reine qui, parlant au nom de tous ses collègues, en est arrivé à une conclusion
contraire. Il signale en effet, avec raison, que la loi a été amendée depuis le
jugement dans l'affaire Laphkas, et que la machine est illégale si elle
est utilisée pour la vente de marchandises ou services, si le résultat
de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une affaire
de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur. (C. Cr., art. 170.)

On voit donc que lorsqu'une opération dépend
du hasard, et que même si le résultat ne fournit que des ""services""
ou ""amusements"", deux mots qui ont le même sens, l'appareil est
illégal, et la maison où il se trouve est présumée de façon concluante être une
maison de jeu. Il ne fait aucun doute que, dans le cas présent, le résultat des
opérations de cette machine est exclusivement du domaine du hasard, et fournit
un amusement au joueur, comme résultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre
d'opérations. C'est à cette conclusion qu'en sont arrivés le juge au procès
et la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Ceci fait tomber ce genre d'appareil sous le
coup de la prohibition du statut.

Quant au point soulevé concernant l'absence
d'un acte formel d'accusation, pour les raisons données dans la cause de Beauvais
v. The Queen 5,
je ne le crois pas fondé. Il s'agit en effet d'une dénonciation où le magistrat
a juridiction absolue, et en conséquence, l'absence d'un acte formel
d'accusation ne vicie pas les procédures. (C. Cr., arts. 467 et 176.)

L'appel doit donc être rejeté avec, cependant,
une modification qui devra être faite au jugement de la Cour du Banc de la
Reine. Cette dernière Cour, comme elle avait le droit de le faire en vertu des
dispositions de l'art. 638 (C. Cr.), a suspendu la sentence, à condition
que le prévenu souscrive un engagement, sans caution, selon la formule 28 (C. Cr.).

[Page 802]

Cet engagement devra être souscrit pour la
durée d'une année à compter de la date du présent jugement, et non à compter de
la date du jugement de la Cour d'Appel.

Rand J. :—The machine in question here, subject to one added feature,
can be taken to be as described by the language of the magistrate quoted by the
Chief Justice of this Court in DeWare v. The Queen 6. The added feature is that by
inserting in the machine not a five-cent piece which will initiate an operation
but a sum reaching as high as $1 in coins a chance is created of having the
normal scores increased by a quantity related to the amount deposited but
dependent on a fortuitous relationship of results in the individual's
operations. No person is obliged to make the additional deposit, but the
machine is offered for that as well as for its ordinary use.

The issue is whether the device is within s. 170  of the Criminal
Code . Since the use is entertainment within the meaning given the word
""services"" in Laphkas v. The King 7 and as no slug or token is
discharged or emitted, the machine must, if at all, come within para. (b)(i)
or (ii) of subs. (2) which defines ""slot machine"" as follows:—

(2) In this section ""slot machine"" means any automatic
or slot machine …

(b) that is used or
intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator, [or]

(ii) as a result of any given
number of successive operations by the operator the machine produces different
results.

The Court of Queen's Bench interpreted the finding of the
magistrate to mean that the operations were essentially governed by chance,
that whatever the skill exercisable in the control of the plunger or the
flippers, there was not that degree which, although probably sufficient to
exclude the machine from the category of the automatic, is insufficient to
qualify the condition of chance in producing results. This interpretation was
challenged by counsel for the appellant who took the finding to be related to
the added feature

[Page 803]

only. But as the section includes ""intended"" as
well as actual use this does not help the appellant; and admittedly the bonus
operation is pure chance. This brings the case within para. (b)(i).

I think it should be said that not every degree of
influencing skill can be taken to eliminate or modify the contingent nature of
results and that the scope for skill should be of such character and degree as
to be capable of enabling an effectiveness to be maintained over the average of
the unskilled.

But the machine comes also within the language of cl. (ii).
The results are the scores and different results are different scores. The
contention faintly advanced was that ""different results"" are in
relation to their nature and not mere dimensions in the same nature; that, for
example, different results must exhibit, say, scores, prizes and goods as
against differences in scores and that the paragraph does not apply. But I see
nothing to support that contention. The scores are the objects aimed at and
accomplished and in ordinary parlance they are as fully capable of exhibiting
differences as other results provided by these or similar machines.

A further ground challenged the validity of the conviction
in the absence of an indictment, but on this I agree with my brother
Taschereau.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH
(APPEAL SIDE) FOR THE PROVINCE
OF QUEBEC.

Criminal Law—Trials by magistrates for
indictable offences—Sufficiency of information and complaint without formal
indictment—The Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 467, 478.

Where an accused is brought before a magistrate
charged with an indictable offence that is within the magistrate’s absolute
jurisdiction to try, there is no necessity for the preparation of an
indictment. The magistrate’s jurisdiction is absolute and does not depend upon
the consent of the accused, under s. 467  of the Criminal Code , where the
accused is “charged in an information”, and s. 478 , requiring the preparation
of an indictment in Form 4, applies only where the accused has elected under s.
450 , 468  or 475  to be tried by a judge without a jury. Ship v. The King (1949),
95 C.C.C. 143 at 150, approved.

While it is true that criminal prosecutions
must be conducted in the name of the Crown, and not in that of the informant,
this requirement is sufficiently satisfied if the information is headed “Au Nom
de Sa Majesté la Reine”.

[Page 796]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec, affirming, without written
reasons, a conviction made by a judge of the Municipal Court of Montreal.
Appeal dismissed.

Antonio Lamer, for the appellant.

André Tessier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

TASCHEREAU J.:—L’appelante a été poursuivie en
vertu des dispositions de l’art. 182 du nouveau Code Criminel  qui
stipule que toute personne qui tient une maison de débauche, est coupable d’un
acte criminel et passible d’un emprisonnement de deux ans.

Le 17 juin 1955, soit après l’entrée en vigueur
du nouveau Code Criminel , un juge municipal de la ville de Montréal a
émis un mandat de perquisition, à la demande du constable Louis Desjardins,
l’autorisant à entrer et à perquisitionner les lieux occupés par l’appelante.
Tel que la loi l’autorise (C. Cr., art. 171), après s’être rendu compte
que la maison en question était véritablement une maison de débauche, le
constable procéda à l’arrestation de l’appelante. Le lendemain il logea une
plainte formelle, et la dénonciation fut dûment signée par lui et assermentée
devant M. le Juge Henri Monty de la Cour Municipale de Montréal. Après enquête,
l’appelante fut trouvée coupable et condamnée à être détenue dans la prison
commune du district de Montréal durant une période de six mois. L’appel à la
Cour du Banc de la Reine fut rejeté.

L’appelante a obtenu la permission d’appeler à
cette Cour pour le motif suivant:—

Les tribunaux inférieurs ont-ils erré en
décidant que la dénonciation de Louis Desjardins, constable de la Cité de
Montréal, était suffisante sans qu’il y ait un acte d’accusation formel, au nom
de Sa Majesté la Reine?

C’est la seule question que nous avons à décider
pour déterminer le présent litige.

Il est certain qu’il n’y a pas eu d’acte formel
d’accusation et que M. le Juge Monty a entendu la cause sur la seule
dénonciation du constable Desjardins.

[Page 797]

L’appelante soutient qu’il fallait de toute
nécessité un acte d’accusation écrit en vertu des dispositions de l’art. 491  du
Code Criminel , qui dit qu’un acte d’accusation est suffisant s’il est
sur papier et rédigé d’après la formule 3 ou 4 suivant le cas.

Les formules 3 et 4 exigent évidemment que
l’acte d’accusation soit au nom de Sa Majesté la Reine. En outre, l’art. 478
édicte que lorsqu’un prévenu choisit, en vertu des arts. 450, 468 ou 475,
d’être jugé par un juge sans jury, un acte d’accusation selon la formule
4 doit être présenté par le procureur général ou son représentant.

En premier lieu, on peut disposer de ce grief de
l’appelante qui prétend que la dénonciation a été faite au nom du constable
lui-même, et non pas au nom de Sa Majesté la Reine. La lecture de la
dénonciation établit clairement le contraire, car elle porte comme titre “Au
Nom de Sa Majesté la Reine”.

Cependant, le juge municipal avait-il le droit
d’entendre ce procès sur cette dénonciation, sans qu’il y ait eu un acte
d’accusation au nom de Sa Majesté la Reine?

Il est essentiel de ne pas oublier que, dans le
cas qui nous occupe, la juridiction du magistrat est absolue et ne dépend pas
du consentement du prévenu. Lorsqu’en effet un inculpé est traduit devant le
tribunal comme conséquence d’une dénonciation d’avoir commis certaines
offenses, et entre autres d’avoir tenu une maison de débauche, son consentement
est immatériel (C. Cr., art. 467 ). L’article 478 ne couvre que les cas
prévus aux arts. 450, 468 et 475 où le consentement du prévenu est requis pour
donner juridiction au magistrat. Il est alors impératif qu’il y ait, en outre
de l’information, un acte formel d’accusation au nom de Sa Majesté la Reine.

Tel n’est pas le cas qui se présente, et quand
la compétence du magistrat est absolue les tribunaux ont décidé qu’il n’était
pas nécessaire qu’il y ait un acte d’accusation formel, et je ne vois pas de
motif sérieux qui nous justifierait de changer cette jurisprudence constante.

Ainsi, dans Snow’s Criminal Code  of Canada,
6e éd. 1955, p. 409, l’on voit ce qui suit:—

An information and complaint in a summary
trial case is often used as the formal charge or indictment and care should be
taken to see that it properly describes the offence mentioned in s. 467 …

[Page 798]

Dans Ship v. The King[1]
M. le Juge Barclay de la Cour du Banc du Roi de Québec, parlant pour toute la
Cour, s’est exprimé de la façon suivante:—

Where the Magistrate has absolute
jurisdiction… “before calling on the person charged for any statement which he
wishes to make, shall state to such person the substance of the charge against
him”, it has been held that it is not necessary under this provision that there
be a written charge…

La cause actuelle est bien différente de celles
qui nous ont été citées par l’appelante, Woo Tuck v. Scalen[2];
Gaboury v. Gagné; Fortier v. Gagné[3]; Lavoie v. La
Reine[4]. Dans ces trois arrêts la Cour d’Appel de Québec a justement
réaffirmé le principe que les poursuites criminelles doivent être prises au nom
de Sa Majesté. Elle a conclu dans les trois cas que les accusés devaient être
libérés parce que les dénonciations avaient été poursuivies par les plaignants
eux-mêmes, sans la participation du Souverain.

L’appel doit être rejeté.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeals to Supreme Court of
Canada—Questions of law alone—Admissibility of confession—Court of Appeal
holding confession inadmissible on mistaken ground of law—The Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 598(1)(a).

Where a Court of Appeal orders a new trial on
the ground that a statement by the accused was wrongly admitted at the trial,
and there is dissent on this point, there is a right of appeal by the Crown if
the difference of opinion between the majority and the minority was based, not
on any question in respect of the evidence or the inferences to be drawn from
it, but on differing views of the law applicable to the situation, and
different interpretations of decided cases; the question of the admissibility
of the statement is in such circumstances one of law alone.

Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. (dissenting)
were of opinion that there was no dissent in the Court of Appeal on any
question of law.

Evidence—Confessions—Admissibility—Test of
voluntary nature of statement—Effect of decisions—Questioning by police
officers—Suggested “cross-examination”—Intimation that previous statement not
believed.

The decision in Boudreau v. The King, [1949]
S.C.R. 262, did not extend in any way the rule laid down in Ibrahim v. The
King, [1914] A.C. 599 at 609, as to the admissibility of confessions in
evidence at the trial. It is still the law that a statement is admissible in
evidence if it is shown to have been voluntary “in the sense that it has not
been obtained…either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or
held out by a person in authority”, and the Crown need go no further than this,
even in a case where questions have been asked by the police of a person in custody.
In particular, the Crown is not required to show that the statement was not
otherwise influenced by the course of conduct adopted by the police, or that it
was “self-impelled” in any sense other than that it was not induced by fear or
hope.

The accused, having been taken to the police
station early in the morning, and there given an account of his movements on
the previous evening, was left there all day, not formally under arrest. About
5 p.m. the police officers returned and told the accused that they had been
working all day on the case (one of murder) and that they had discovered
further facts indicating that what he had told them in the morning was untrue.
The accused thereupon “blurted out” a damaging statement, whereupon he was
stopped and given a formal warning in respect of a charge of murder, after
which he made a statement, obtained in the form of question and answer, that
was reduced to writing and signed by him.

[Page 959]

Held: There
was nothing in the circumstances to make either the oral statement or the
written one that followed it inadmissible in evidence, and the trial judge had
rightly admitted them both.

Criminal law—Trial judge’s charge to jury—Whether
defence adequately put to jury—Murder.

The accused was charged with the murder of a
young girl by choking her, the theory of the Crown being that the killing took
place during the commission of a rape. The principal ground of defence, based
on a statement made by the accused to the police, was that sexual intercourse
had taken place with the full consent of the girl, and that the act that
resulted in her death had taken place some time later, and was in no way
connected with the act of intercourse.

Held: This
defence had been adequately put to the jury by the trial judge, and there was no
ground for interfering with the conviction.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for Ontario from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1] ordering a new
trial on an indictment for murder. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

W.B. Common, Q.C., and W.C. Bowman, Q.C.,
for the appellant.

D.G. Humphrey, and J.G.J. O’Driscoll, for
the accused, respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—The
respondent’s conviction of murder was set aside by the Court of Appeal for
Ontario1 and the Attorney-General for that Province now appeals
based on the dissent of Roach J.A. on two points, as to one of which Aylesworth
J.A. agreed with him. The majority ordered a new trial on both grounds. As to
the question of the admissibility of the oral and written statements of the
accused, my view is that the dissent was on a question of fact and therefore we
are without jurisdiction. According to my interpretation of the reasons in the
Court of Appeal there is no difference as to the law, but merely as to its
application to the circumstances. The evidence on the voir dire was
uncontradicted and, in my opinion, the reasons of the majority and minority in
the Court of Appeal are based on conflicting views as to the proper inferences
to be drawn from that evidence. Such inferences are questions of fact.

However, the majority of the members of this
Court read the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal differently and are of
opinion that this Court has jurisdiction. Since

[Page 960]

that is to be the judgment of the Court, I
conceive that I should do what I would not otherwise do—express my opinion upon
both points. I am unable to discern any error in the trial judge’s charge and
particularly that he had not presented all aspects of the accused’s defence to
the jury. As to the other point, in view of the decision of this Court in Boudreau
v. The King[2] I deem
it unnecessary to restate the law as there enunciated, and applying that rule I
agree with Roach J.A. that the trial judge correctly interpreted and applied
it.

As the majority of the Court are of opinion that
there is jurisdiction, the appeal is accordingly allowed and the conviction
restored.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The respondent was convicted by
the Honourable Mr. Justice Treleaven and a jury at the Toronto assizes on April 27, 1956, on the following indictment:—

The jurors for our Lady the Queen present
that Robert George Fitton on or about the 18th day of January in the year 1956,
at the city of Toronto in the county of York, murdered one Linda Lampkin,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

The respondent was found guilty and sentenced to
be executed, but the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Roach dissenting,
allowed the appeal and directed a new trial[3].
The majority of the Court reached the conclusion that there had been
misdirection of the jury by the learned trial judge in matters of law under ss.
201  and 202  of the Criminal Code , and that the theory of the defence was
not adequately explained to the jury.

The Chief Justice of Ontario, Laidlaw J.A. and
Schroeder J.A. held that the oral admission and the signed statement of the
respondent were improperly admitted at the trial, and allowed the appeal and
also directed a new trial on this ground. Mr. Justice Aylesworth
(dissenting on this ground) as well as Mr. Justice Roach, held that the
learned trial judge did not err in law in holding that the oral admission and
the signed statement of the accused were admissible in evidence at the trial,
and would have dismissed the appeal on this point.

[Page 961]

Her Majesty the Queen now appeals to this Court pursuant
to the provisions of s. 598 (1)  (a) of the Criminal Code , which
reads as follows:—

598. (1) Where a judgment of a court of
appeal sets aside a conviction, pursuant to an appeal taken under paragraph (a)
of section 583 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a)
of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents.

The evidence might be summarized as follows:—

At approximately 9 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the
respondent, who is an employee of a cartage agency under contract with the Post
Office Department, took the deceased Linda Lampkin for a ride in his mail
truck, and two hours later left her dead body on Commissioners Street in south central
Toronto. When the body was discovered, the underclothing was ripped and torn,
and it is in evidence that this young girl of 13 years old, had been the
subject of sexual intercourse. Around her neck was a deep groove in the flesh
tissue, which corresponded in size to the width of a scarf which she was
wearing. The evidence reveals that she died of asphyxia due to strangulation.

After having discovered the body, the Toronto police force, as a result of their
investigation, took the respondent Fitton into custody the next morning. During
the day, Fitton made oral admissions and signed a statement, and it is the
admission of this statement, which has been allowed by the trial judge, which
is the first point in issue in the present appeal.

I must admit that I am at a loss to understand
the contradictory position taken by the respondent on this matter. This written
statement was admitted without objection, and constitutes the only defence
raised by the respondent. It is now said that it has been illegally admitted as
not having been made freely and voluntarily. With this last contention I cannot
agree, and I fully share the views of my brother Fauteux who holds that it was
admissible and that this case must be governed by the rules laid down by this
Court in Boudreau v. The King[4].

[Page 962]

I am also of the opinion, for the reasons given
by my brother Fauteux, that the rejection or admissibility of this statement is
not merely a question of fact, but raises a question of law, conferring
jurisdiction on this Court, in view of the dissenting opinions in the Court
below.

I further endorse what has been said by
Mr. Justice Roach in his dissenting judgment as to the exposition of the
theory of the defence by the trial judge, and as to the use that could be made
of the expert evidence of Dr. McLean and as to the obligation of the jury to
reject any of his opinions which he was not qualified as an expert to give.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

The judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was
delivered by

RAND J.:—The rule on the admission of
confessions, which, following the English authorities, was restated in Boudreau
v. The King[5], at
times presents difficulty of application because its terms tend to conceal
underlying considerations material to a determination. The cases of torture,
actual or threatened, or of unabashed promises are clear; perplexity arises
when much more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of mind and will
of the accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of
questions or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part
they have played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether
what was said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the
influence of hope or fear aroused by them.

The inference one way or the other, taking all
the circumstances into account, is one for drawing which the trial judge is in
a position of special advantage; and unless it is made evident or probable that
he has not weighed the circumstances in the light of the rule or has
misconceived them or the rule, his conclusion should not be disturbed.

The Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the
majority of the Court of Appeal, has treated the expression “freely and
voluntarily”, used in Boudreau v. The King, as if it connoted only a
spontaneous statement, one unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the
conduct of the police officers; but with the greatest respect that is an
erroneous

[Page 963]

interpretation of what was there said. The
language quoted must be read primarily in the light of the matters that were
being considered. As the opening words show, there was no intention of
departing from the rule as laid down in the authorities mentioned; the phrase
“free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority”[6] means free from the compulsion of
apprehension of prejudice and the inducement of hope for advantage, if an
admission is or is not made. That fear or hope could be instigated, induced or
coerced, all these terms referring to the element in the mind of the confesser
which actuated or drew out the admission. It might be called the induced motive
of the statement, i.e., to avoid prejudice or reap benefit. As Professor
Wigmore intimates, the terms promise or threat may be reduced to the word
“inducement”, but that again may raise a question of meaning; and the
justification of the illustrative use of other words is that together they
indicate the general conception of influence of a certain kind producing the
admission. Even the word “voluntary” is open to question; in what case can it
be said that the statement is not voluntary in the sense that it is the
expression of a choice, that it is willed to be made? But it is the character
of the influence of idea or feeling behind that act of willing and its source
which the rule seizes upon. Nothing said in Boudreau v. The King was
intended to introduce a new quality of that influence.

But it was with an enlarged view of what that
case decided that the Chief Justice held the questions, express or implied, of
the police officers, taken to be of the nature of cross‑examination, that
is, as I understand it, that they suggested several items of his earlier
statement to be false, and put without a warning, ipso facto, as having
“instigated” it, ruled out the statement. In this I think he has, and in a
matter of law, erred. The accused was not at the time under formal arrest
although he had been requested to stay in the police station and, for the
greater part of the time, remained in the general office, and the earlier
questions were such as the police might have addressed to any person in the
remotest way drawn into the enquiry. Ques-

[Page 964]

tions without intimidating or suggestive
overtones are inescapable from police enquiry; and put as they were here, they
cannot by themselves be taken to invalidate the response given. The question
still remains: was the statement made through fear or hope induced by
authority?

The rules adopted in England relating to this
matter express, no doubt, the wisdom of long experience; but they in fact
contemplate questioning after the arrest has been decided on and a warning
given; and there is discretion in the trial judge to admit a statement
notwithstanding their non-observance. In this country they have no other force
than what their innate good sense may suggest in individual determinations, as
considerations to be kept in mind in weighing the total circumstances.

On the voir dire no attempt was made by
counsel to show by cross-examination either coercion or inducement, and it was
frankly conceded that the admission of the evidence, if not facilitated, was
not seriously challenged for the reason that the statement contained the only
evidence upon which the defence intended to rely. Not only, then, was the
testimony of the officers accepted by the trial judge and unopposed on behalf
of the accused, but its admission was looked on as for the benefit of the
defence. In that situation I should say that there is nothing to warrant a
finding that the statement was not shown to have been voluntary; and the ruling
in appeal, on this view, also, is on a question of law.

I am, therefore, in agreement with Roach J.A.
and Aylesworth J.A. that the admission of the statement by the trial judge
should not have been disturbed.

The second ground of dissent was from the
holding of the Court that the charge was inadequate in presenting the case for
the defence. That defence was extremely simple and it was contained in two or
three sentences of the statement. It was to the effect that after the sexual
intercourse had taken place and after the accused had proceeded on his route to
another mail-box,

she started kibitzing around again and I
just went out of my head. I grabbed her by the scarf and she just went limp.
She didn’t breathe no more, then I continued with the rest of my mail run.

[Page 965]

The act causing death was thus represented to
have been completely divorced from the sexual act. The trial judge, after
making it clear that the jury could believe any part of the evidence and
disbelieve any other part, applied this rule to the statement. He contrasted
this direct evidence with the circumstantial facts which could be held to show
that death from strangulation had been immediately connected with the act of
intercourse; and his final reference to the statement was in these words:

Now gentlemen, as I see it, if I may put
this very briefly to you, I would think that you would take that statement of
the accused, consider it very carefully, and if you conclude that it is the
truth or if you really have an honest doubt as to whether it is the truth or
not, he is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and you would not find him
guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

Counsel urged before us that this paragraph in
some way deals with strangulation accompanying ravishment but I cannot so
construe it. It is, strictly, more favourable to the accused than was
justified: in effect it says, if you think the circumstances of tightening the
scarf were as he puts them, you are to find manslaughter. This rules out intent
in the act within s. 201 (a) (ii) or (c) of the Criminal Code .

I think we must credit the jury with ordinary
intelligence. The defence had been elaborated to them by counsel, it was set
forth on the statement which they had in the jury-room and they were told how
to deal with it. There was no complication in the facts or their interpretation
or in the distinction between the two views of the facts put to them, and I
have not the slightest doubt that they came to their verdict with an
intelligent appreciation of both.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore
the conviction.

The judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was
delivered by

NOLAN J.:—The respondent was convicted of murder
at a trial before a judge sitting with a jury. On appeal to the Court of Appeal
for Ontario the appeal, by a majority judgment, was allowed, the conviction
quashed and a new trial ordered[7]. This
is an appeal by the Attorney‑General for Ontario pursuant to the
provisions of s. 598 (1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

[Page 966]

At about 7.45 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the
deceased, Linda Lampkin, left a dancing-school at 40 Wellesley Street East in
the city of Toronto and at approximately 8.30 p.m. she boarded a Jane Street
bus at Jane and Bloor Streets and shortly afterwards left it at Jane and
Annette Streets. At approximately 8.45 p.m. a young girl was seen talking to
the driver of a Royal Mail truck at Jane Street and St. John’s Road.

The respondent was employed by the Bacon Cartage
Company Limited as a Royal Mail truck-driver and his route on the day in
question covered the area in which the deceased was last seen alive. The
respondent turned in his truck at the Bacon Cartage garage at 104 Berkeley
Street at 10.57 p.m., although his usual time was between 9.30 and 10 p.m.

At approximately 11.05 p.m. on January 18, 1956,
the body of the deceased was found on Commissioners Street in the city of
Toronto. Her wool skirt and underslip were pulled up around her waist. The
three pairs of underpants she was wearing were torn, exposing her thighs and
genitalia, and her brassiere was torn, exposing her breasts. One shoe was
missing. A red truck, similar to the one driven by the respondent, was seen,
during the evening of January 18, parked on Commissioners Street in the
vicinity of the place where the body was found.

A post-mortem examination disclosed that
the deceased had been a virgin and that death had been caused by asphyxia due
to strangulation resulting from the application of extreme force to a silk scarf
which was knotted around her neck. There was a mark almost encircling the neck
which showed a complete ring of bruising, with the exception of a gap under the
right ear where the bruising was reduced. It was the opinion of the pathologist
that such force would have to be applied for several minutes to cause death.
The deceased had been the subject of a completed act of sexual intercourse.
There was a tear in her hymen and in her vagina which, in the opinion of the
pathologist, would have caused great pain. Her face was dark with acute
congestion of blood and there were tiny

[Page 967]

haemorrhages in the skin of the face, the
forehead, the ears and the mucous membrane of the eyes. Bloodstained froth had
issued from the nose and mouth.

On the morning of January 19, 1956, two officers
of the Toronto police force went to the Globe and Mail garage, at which time
the respondent was putting mail-bags into a truck. The truck was searched and a
paper bag containing two apples, a bobby pin and a tube of lipstick were found
inside. This lipstick was, in evidence, identified and admitted by counsel for
the respondent to have been the property of the deceased. The respondent was
observed to be collapsing or fainting.

The respondent was taken by Detective Sergeant
O’Driscoll and Detective Coghill to police headquarters, where he was
interrogated by Detective-Sergeant O’Driscoll, and a T-shirt, a pair of
trousers and a windbreaker were taken from the person of the respondent. An
examination of the clothing disclosed that there was human blood on the
trousers and the leather jacket. The detective‑sergeant told the
respondent that he was “investigating the rape and murder of a girl by the name
of Linda Lampkin” and that she lived on Brookside Avenue. This was the first
time her name had been mentioned. The respondent said that he knew the deceased
and that the last time he saw her was about 5.15 in the afternoon of January
17. He denied that he had seen her on January 18. He gave an account of his
movements on January 18 until he stopped work at night. The discussion, which
contained no reference to Linda Lampkin, lasted until approximately 9 a.m. and
no caution was given. The discussion was not taken down in writing. O’Driscoll
and Coghill left to be present in court at 10 a.m. and the respondent was left
in the custody of Detective Smith, who told the respondent that he wanted to
get on paper a record of his movements on January 18. Detective Smith had typed
about one paragraph when he was relieved by Detective Sergeant Simmonds, who
typed the statement as it was related to him by the respondent. When it was
finished the respondent read it, made certain changes and signed it. No
objection as to its admissibility was made at trial and it was admitted in
evidence.

[Page 968]

In his statement the respondent said that about
the end of June he had met the deceased when he was collecting mail on his
route and about a week later had taken her, at her request, for a drive around
part of his route; that he had seen her three times since then, but only to say
“hello”. The statement relates his movements during January 18 and concludes by
stating that he did not know anything about a lipstick or how it got in the
truck.

Detective Sergeant Simmonds then asked the
respondent for a list of the box clearances on his route, which was given and
typed on a sheet of paper, which was admitted at trial. He had a sandwich and
milk brought in for the respondent for lunch.

At approximately 5 p.m. Detective Sergeant
Simmonds and Detective McNeely again interviewed the respondent, who had been
kept in the main detective office since the morning interview. What took place
at this afternoon interview is described in the evidence of Detective Sergeant
Simmonds:—

We took our coats and hats off and hung
them up and Detective McNeely and I went up to the accused and I told him, I
said, “I want to have another word with you. Would you come over to the office
with us?” He stood up and followed us out. We went over to the small room off
the main detective office and into the office there.

I told the accused to sit down and he sat
down at a desk, at a chair opposite a desk, and I said to him, I said, “You
know who I am. I was talking to you this morning” or words to that effect. I
said, “This is Detective McNeely, my partner.” I then sat down at the desk
opposite him and Detective McNeely sat to my right.

I said to the accused man, “Bob, you have
been sitting in the office here this afternoon and I haven’t seen you since I
left you around noon when you told me where you were last night and your
movements last night.” I said, “You have had all afternoon to think over where
you were last night.”

He said, “What I told you this morning was
true.” I said, “Well, it no doubt was true as far as your work with the post
office was concerned but,” I said, “we have been out going over the area in the
west end of the city where you worked and we have been working pretty hard this
afternoon,” and I said, “I have received information to the effect that you
were seen last night with Linda Lampkin at St. John’s Road and Jane about
8.45 p.m.”

He was sitting in the chair, which has arms
on it, and he had his elbows on the arms and his hands crossed in front of him
and he was looking at me and at this moment he looked down to the floor, he put
his head down. I was just about to say something else to him when McNeely spoke
up, and McNeely said to him, “Yes, Bob, we have been working since 5 o’clock
this morning. It may be necessary for us to take you out

[Page 969]

with us in the police car and have you show
us just how you do your work in the west end in the area that you work in.
There may be other witnesses out there—we don’t know—who may have seen things.
We don’t know. But the lipstick that was found in your truck this morning has
been identified.” He then said, “And along with this information that we
obtained this afternoon, it indicates that you may have been seen with Linda
Lampkin last night. We don’t believe what you have been telling us.”

At this point the accused who was still looking
at the floor paused and—or he just seemed to just sit there, he didn’t say
anything, and at this point he said, “I was just thinking of my wife and my
kids. I didn’t mean to do it. She started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by
the scarf and she didn’t breathe no more.”

At this moment I said, “Just a minute,
Bob,” and I pulled the drawer open in the desk and there was a pad of what we
call caution sheets in the drawer and I put them on the table. I wrote some
detail on the top of this caution sheet which has a printed form at the top,
including the fact that I was at headquarters and the date and my name, the
name of the accused and his age, and the charge. And I read from the sheet to
the accused man.

The learned trial judge ruled that the inculpatory
oral statement made in the course of this interview,

I was just thinking of my wife and kids. I
didn’t mean to do it. She started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the
scarf and she didn’t breathe no more.

was voluntary and admissible in evidence.

As soon as the respondent had made this
statement he was immediately stopped, charged with the murder of the deceased
and cautioned.

The written statement was obtained by question
and answer and was written down in longhand by Simmonds. When it was completed
the respondent was asked to read it aloud, including the caution, which he did,
and then he signed it.

In the written statement the respondent said
that he had seen the deceased on the evening of January 18; that she had come
over to his truck and asked if she could go for a ride, he had said she could
and she had gotten into the truck.

The statement further says:

I parked up on Gooch Ave. to empty my small
mail bag and tie up my big one and she started necking and then I had
intercourse with her and then I went on a ways and did my other box and she
started kibitzing around again and I just went out of my head, I grabbed her by
the scarf and she just went limp. She didn’t breathe no more, then I continued
with the rest of my mail run and dropped my mail off and drove down to

[Page 970]

Cherry St. and took in my CODs I had
left. She still wasn’t breathing so the best thing I thought was to get rid of
her. I drove to Commissioner St., I don’t know Commissioner St. very well,
I took her out of the truck and put her on the ground there. Then I took the
truck back to Berkeley St. and went home.

At about 8.10 p.m. Detectives Simmonds, McNeely
and Sellar drove the respondent out to the west end of the city to try to find
the missing shoe. It was found underneath a truck on a vacant lot in the
downtown area on Berkeley Street. A broken compact was found in the shoe. The
girl’s wallet was found by the police stuck in a sewer-grating on a street in
the vicinity of a garage where the mail trucks were stored.

The learned trial judge held that the
last-mentioned written statement was voluntary and it was admitted in evidence.

The majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario (Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A.), reversing the learned
trial judge, held that[8]:

…the Crown has failed to show that the oral
statement made by the appellant, or the written statement made by him
immediately afterwards, was free and voluntary. Therefore the learned judge, in
my opinion, should not have admitted either of those statements in evidence.
The erroneous admission in evidence of these incriminating statements is in
itself sufficient to warrant this Court directing a new trial.

It is contended by counsel for the respondent
that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal on the question of
the admissibility of the second statement, as it is not a strict question of
law, but rather a question of fact, or at least a question of mixed law and
fact. Section 598 (1)  of the Criminal Code , under which the appeal
on this ground is taken, reads as follows:

598. (1) Where a judgment of a court of
appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under paragraph (a)
of section 583 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a)
of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

(b) on any question of law, if leave
to appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within
twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the judge may, for special reasons, allow.

[Page 971]

If the decision as to the admissibility of the
oral and second written statements turned upon the inferences to be drawn from
the evidence, it would seem clear, from the decisions of this Court, that that
was not a question of law alone and consequently this Court would be without
jurisdiction.

In a case in which a statement is received in
evidence over the objection of counsel for the accused and the point is raised
that the statement is not free and voluntary, having been obtained by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage held out by a person in authority, the Court
must weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses. The
correctness of such a decision could not, I think, be raised before this Court
on an appeal on a question of law alone.

In the present case entirely different
considerations arise. The statements were admitted in evidence without
objection. Indeed, it may be said that the second statement contained the
defence of the respondent to the charge. No conflict arose as to the manner in
which the statements were obtained, no suggestion was made that they had been
improperly instigated or induced, and that they were free and voluntary appears
to have been unchallenged.

In other words, the voluntary nature of the
statements was not in dispute at trial. There was no evidence of any previous
threat or promise and nothing in law to warrant their exclusion. To hold them
to be inadmissible would, in my view, be contrary to established legal
principles and would raise a question of law alone.

Assuming that this Court has jurisdiction to
hear the appeal as to the admissibility of the oral and second written statements
of the accused, it remains to be determined, as a question of law alone on
which there has been dissent, whether they were properly admissible in
evidence.

It was contended by the respondent in this Court
that the statements obtained by the police officers were not freely and
voluntarily made, but were obtained as a result of cross‑examination
calculated to induce admissions.

On the other hand the Crown contended that, even
though there was cross-examination (which was not conceded), failure to give a
warning, or other violation of the

[Page 972]

usual rules relating to the proper securing of
statements, such violation or failure does not, of itself, necessarily render
such statements inadmissible.

In Regina v. Gavin et al.[9], it was held (per Smith J.) that
when a prisoner is in custody the police have no right to ask him questions.
This decision was overruled by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Best[10], which was a case in which, while the
prisoner was in custody and had been cautioned, he was searched and a sum of
money was found in his possession. The constable thereupon asked the prisoner
where the money came from. Lord Alverstone C.J. at p. 693 said:

There is no ground for interfering in this
case. It is quite impossible to say that the fact that a question of this kind
has been asked invalidates the trial. There are many cases in which the
prisoner is entitled to give an explanation as to anything found on him, and
the question might give him an opportunity of saying and shewing that the thing
found was his own property. In our opinion Reg. v. Gavin is not a
good decision, and it is commented on in a note printed at the end of the
report. The decision has certainly not been followed to its full extent. As set
out in the report the statement of the law is too wide and requires
qualification.

In Rex v. Voisin[11], the Court of Criminal Appeal considered
the effect of the decision in Rex v. Best, supra, and at p. 539 A.T.
Lawrence J. said:—

We read that case as deciding that the mere
fact that a statement is made in answer to a question put by a police constable
is not in itself sufficient to make the statement inadmissible in law. It may
be, and often is, a ground for the judge in his discretion excluding the
evidence; but he should do so only if he thinks that the statement was not a
voluntary one in the sense above mentioned, or was an unguarded answer made in
circumstances that rendered it unreliable, or unfair for some reason to be
allowed in evidence against the prisoner.

In the present case there was no evidence of
inducement or coercion, no evidence of threat or promise of reward.

In my view it would be quite impossible to
discover the facts of a crime without asking questions of persons from whom it
was thought that useful information might be obtained. Indeed, such questions
might give the suspected person an opportunity of demonstrating that the
suspicion of guilt attaching to him was without foundation. The questioning
must not, of course, be for the purpose of

[Page 973]

trapping the suspected person into making
admissions and every case must be decided according to the whole of the
circumstances.

The question of the admissibility of a statement
made by an accused person was fully discussed in the judgment of this Court in Boudreau
v. The King[12]. In
that case the appellant Boudreau was convicted of murder and the point of
dissent on which he came before this Court was the improper reception of two
written statements, the first containing an admission of intimacy with the wife
of the murdered man and the second, in addition to a repetition and an
elaboration of the first admission, a full confession of the deed itself. At
the time of making them the appellant was held under a coroner’s warrant as a
material witness. There was no more than a suspicion against him when, in the
first conversation with police officers in which questions were asked him, he
purported to detail his movements on the two or three days before the death and
admitted the intimacy. Boudreau having consented to make the statement in
writing, a justice of the peace was summoned and the statement was made out,
signed and sworn to by him. Before the signing the justice read out the words
of the usual warning, which were printed across the top of the paper. Two days
later, after a formal warning, a further discussion took place with two police
officers and, while one of them was momentarily out of the room and after a
reference had been made to his mother, Boudreau suddently burst out with the
words: “J’aime autant vous le dire, c’est moi qui l’a tué.” The second
statement was put in writing, with the consent of the appellant, and was signed
and sworn to by him. The trial judge ruled that these statements were
admissible in evidence and the majority of the Court of King’s Bench, Appeal Side,
Province of Quebec, agreed with him.

In this Court, Kerwin J. (as he then was), at p.
267, states that the fundamental question is whether a confession of an accused
offered in evidence is voluntary and goes on to point out that the mere fact
that a warning was given is not necessarily decisive in favour of
admissibility, but, on the other hand, the absence of a warning should not bind

[Page 974]

the hands of the Court so as to compel it to
rule out a statement. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning is a
factor and, in many cases, an important one.

Rand J., at p. 269, points out that no doubt
arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a warning
may or may not suffice to remove. The rule is directed against the danger of
improperly instigated, or induced, or coerced admissions and the statement
should be that of a man “free in volition from the compulsions or inducements
of authority”.

Kellock J., at p. 276, states that in all cases
the question is whether the Crown has satisfied the onus that the statement
has, in fact, been made voluntarily and that in none of the cases is it laid
down that a statement made by a person in custody, in answer to questions put
by a person in authority, is, as a matter of law, inadmissible.

In Boudreau v. The King the Court
followed the governing principle as stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v.
The King[13]:

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority.

The principle laid down in Ibrahim v. The
King was followed by this Court in Prosko v. The King[14], where, at p. 237, Anglin J. pointed out
that the two American detectives who had the custody of the appellant were
persons in authority and that the appellant was in the same plight as if in
custody in extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder and
that no warning had been given, and that while these facts did not, in
themselves, suffice to exclude the admissions, they were undoubtedly
circumstances which required that the evidence tendered to establish their
voluntary character should be closely scrutinized.

Applying the principles contained in the
authorities to the facts of the present case, I am of the opinion that the
statements were properly admissible in evidence.

[Page 975]

It was contended by the respondent that there
was misdirection and non-direction amounting to misdirection on the part of the
learned trial judge in that he had failed to lay the theory of the defence
adequately before the jury and failed to direct the jury as to how the law in
relation to murder should be applied to the facts that they might find.

The majority of the members of the Court of
Appeal, that is Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A.,
upheld this contention. The appeal was allowed and a new trial was directed.

Roach J.A., dissenting, held that there was no
misdirection or non-direction amounting to misdirection by the learned trial
judge in such matters of law and that there was no failure to lay the theory of
the defence adequately before the jury and no failure to direct the jury as to
how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts, and would
have dismissed the appeal.

The main theory of the defence is that the
respondent had sexual intercourse with the deceased with her consent and,
although the act of sexual intercourse was completed, the deceased was not
sexually satisfied and wanted it repeated; that she then commenced to annoy the
respondent and that, without intending to do her any harm, he grabbed her scarf
and “she just went limp”. This theory is based upon the evidence that there was
haemorrhaging from injury to her private parts and consequently the deceased
was not dead when the act of sexual intercourse took place. Put shortly, the
intercourse and strangling were independent acts.

The Crown contended that the deceased had been
raped and strangled and that the act of strangulation was done in furtherance
of the act of rape.

In my view, the real problem which presented
itself to the jury was the difficulty in reconciling the written statement of
the respondent with the other evidence in the case. In other words, did the
respondent cause the death of the deceased under the circumstances as set out
in his statement, or did her death ensue as a result of bodily harm
intentionally inflicted by him to facilitate the act of sexual intercourse?

[Page 976]

I agree with the opinion of Roach J.A. that the
learned trial judge placed the two opposing theories fairly before the jury, so
that they could not fail to understand the issue they had to decide. I am
further in agreement with Roach J.A. that the fact of haemorrhaging is equally
consistent with the Crown’s theory that the respondent was throttling the girl
while he was attempting, or engaging in, the act of intercourse as it is with
the theory of the defence that the intercourse was completed and the strangling
occurred subsequently.

The defence that the act of sexual intercourse
was voluntary on the part of the deceased was rejected by the jury and, in view
of the evidence relating to the disarray of the clothing of the deceased when
her body was found, the pathological evidence as to the description of her
injuries, together with the photographs which were entered as exhibits at the
trial showing the condition of her neck and head, in my opinion it was properly
rejected.

At the trial objection was quite properly taken
to the evidence of the pathologist, Doctor McLean, where he stated that the
deceased had been raped. This was a matter for the jury, but, on cross‑examination,
the doctor made it quite clear that he was not prepared to venture an opinion,
based on his medical observations, as to whether the deceased had or had not
consented to having sexual intercourse with the respondent.

I have nothing further to add to the reasons of
Roach J.A. on the appeal on the ground of misdirection.

In the result, in my view, the charge was
adequate and there was no misdirection or non‑direction amounting to
misdirection and, in any event, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—On
April 27, 1956, the respondent was convicted before Treleaven J. and a jury at
the Toronto assizes of having murdered one Linda Lampkin on or about January
18, 1956. He appealed, and applied for leave to appeal, to the Court of Appeal
on a number of grounds. His appeal was heard on June 18 and 19, 1956, the Court
being composed of Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw, Roach, Aylesworth and Schroeder
JJ.A. At the conclusion

[Page 977]

of the argument the learned Chief Justice
announced that the appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial
directed, with Roach J.A. dissenting, and that written reasons would be
delivered later. These were delivered on June 27[15].

Pickup C.J.O., with whom Laidlaw and Schroeder
JJ.A. agreed, was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed on two grounds,
(i) that the Crown had failed to show that an oral statement made by the
respondent to two police officers between 5 and 6 p.m. on January 19 and a
written statement made by him immediately afterwards were free and voluntary;
and that the erroneous admission in evidence of these statements was in itself
sufficient to require the quashing of the conviction, and (ii) that, even
assuming for the purpose of dealing with the sufficiency of the charge of the
learned trial judge to the jury that the statements were admissible, the
learned trial judge had failed to lay the theory of the defence adequately before
the jury and had failed to direct them as to how the law in relation to murder
should be applied to the facts as they might find them.

Roach J.A. was of opinion (i) that the learned
trial judge was right in holding that the written statement referred to above
was admissible, and, while he does not say so expressly, it is, I think,
implied in his reasons read as a whole that he was also of opinion that the
oral statement which preceded it was admissible, (ii) that, while not saying
that the charge of the learned trial judge was a perfect charge, he was
satisfied “that it was entirely adequate; that there was no misdirection and no
non-direction amounting to misdirection, and that in any event no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”.

Aylesworth J.A. agreed with the reasons and
conclusion of Pickup C.J.O. on the ground of the inadequacy of the charge to
the jury; but as to the admissibility of the statements he said[16]:—

I do not, however, agree that the
statements given to the police by the appellant were inadmissible. On the
contrary, I think they were admissible and were properly received in evidence
at the trial. I concur in the reasons of my brother Roach in this respect and I
have nothing to add to those reasons.

[Page 978]

It would appear from the paragraph quoted that
Aylesworth J.A. read the reasons of Roach J.A. as deciding that the oral
as well as the written statement was admissible.

In the result Aylesworth J.A. agreed with the
order proposed by Pickup C.J.O.

On June 28, 1956, the Attorney-General for
Ontario gave notice of appeal to this Court. In the view which I take of this
case it is necessary for me to deal only with the point relating to the
admissibility of the statements made by the respondent and therefore I quote
only those parts of the notice of appeal which refer to that point. These are
as follows:—

In regard to the second statement of the
Respondent filed as Exhibit 53 at the trial [i.e., the written statement
referred to above], the Chief Justice of Ontario, Laidlaw and Sohroeder, JJ.A.,
held that the learned trial Judge erred in law in holding that the said
statement was admissible in evidence at the trial and allowed the appeal also
on this ground.

Mr. Justice Roach and Mr. Justice
Aylesworth (dissenting on this ground) held that the learned trial Judge did
not err in law in holding that the said statement was admissible in evidence at
the trial.

The Attorney-General for Ontario appeals to
the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following grounds:...

2. There was dissent on a question of law
by the Honourable Mr. Justice Roach and the Honourable Mr. Justice
Aylesworth from the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which
erred in law in holding that the trial Judge erred in holding that the second
statement of the Respondent, filed as Exhibit 53 at the trial, was admissible
in evidence at the trial.

Counsel for the respondent moved at the opening
of the hearing before us to quash the appeal on the ground that ground of
appeal no. 2, quoted above, did not raise a strict question of law alone. The
Court decided to hear the argument of the motion with the argument of the
appeal.

In my opinion the motion should be granted.
After reading all the evidence and everything that was said by counsel and by
the learned trial judge during the hearing and disposition of the issue raised
as to the admissibility in evidence of the oral and written statements above
referred to and everything said on the point in the reasons for judgment
delivered in the Court of Appeal I am unable to discern any dissent on, or
indeed any difference of opinion as to, any point of law. The difference of
opinion was as to whether the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence

[Page 979]

as to the primary facts leading up to and
surrounding the making of the statements was that the Crown had satisfied the
onus of showing that the statements in question were freely and voluntarily
made. In the circumstances of the case at bar the question whether or not that
inference should be drawn was, in my opinion, one of fact.

The evidence of the witnesses on the voir
dire as to what I have called the primary facts was not conflicting nor was
its veracity attacked in cross-examination and all of the learned judges in the
Courts below have proceeded on the basis that it contained an accurate account
of what occurred. The effect of that evidence is set out in some detail in the
reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal (vide [1956] O.R. 696). I
propose to give a comparatively brief summary of it.

The lifeless body of Linda Lampkin was found on
Commissioners Street late in the evening of January 18, 1956, and the police
immediately commenced an investigation. At about 7 a.m. on January 19, police
officers visited the place in which a truck which had been driven by the
respondent on the previous evening was standing. They examined the truck and
found in it a bobby-pin and a lipstick said to have belonged to the deceased.
On seeing the lipstick the respondent collapsed and the officers rendered some
assistance to him. When he had recovered his composure Sergeant-Detective
O’Driscoll and Detective Coghill asked him to accompany them to police
headquarters. On arrival there he was questioned by these two officers in a
small room, called the interrogation-room, until about 9 a.m. During this
period police officers took from him a windbreaker, a shirt, a pair of pants,
scrapings from his finger‑nails and some hairs taken from his head and
body. Shortly after 9 a.m. these detectives left and Detective Simmonds
proceeded to obtain a statement from the respondent which was later typewritten
and was signed by the respondent about noon. There was nothing in this
statement of an incriminating character. It contained a denial of having seen
the deceased on January 18. Just after this statement was signed and completed,
Sergeant-Detective O’Driscoll and Detective Coghill entered the
interrogation-room, and Detective Simmonds left them there with the

[Page 980]

respondent. They remained for a short time. The
respondent was given a sandwich and a glass of milk for lunch. The respondent
was kept in the general detective office during the afternoon, under close
supervision, while Detective Simmonds and Detective McNeely continued their
work of investigation elsewhere. About 5 p.m. they returned to headquarters and
again took the respondent into the interrogation-room where he had been in the
morning. They told the respondent that they had been working since 5 o’clock in
the morning, that they had been working pretty hard, that they had received
information that he was seen with the deceased on the previous day about 8.45
p.m., that it might be necessary for them to take him out with them in the
police car to the west end in the area that he worked in, that there might be
other witnesses out there who might have seen things, that the lipstick that
was found in his truck had been identified and that they did not believe what
he had been telling them. It was at this point that the respondent made the
oral incriminating statement. He was at once formally cautioned and then made
the longer statement which was reduced to writing and signed by him.

After a full recital of this evidence, the
learned Chief Justice of Ontario quotes from the judgment delivered in this
Court in Boudreau v. The King[17], and
continues[18]:—

The principle as set forth in that case is
a positive rule of English criminal law. It has been applied in many subsequent
cases to which I need not refer, because the ruling which ought to be made by
the Court depends on the evidence and particular circumstances disclosed
therein in each case. I simply direct my mind and consideration to the
fundamental question: Were the statements in question in the instant case
freely and voluntarily made?

After a further review of the facts and another
reference to the Boudreau case the learned Chief Justice continues[19]:—

Applying that principle to the particular
facts in this case, I have reached the conclusion that the Crown has failed to
show that the oral statement made by the appellant, or the written statement
made by him immediately afterwards, was free and voluntary. Therefore the
learned

[Page 981]

judge, in my opinion, should not have
admitted either of those statements in evidence. The erroneous admission in
evidence of these incriminating statements is, in itself, sufficient to warrant
this Court directing a new trial.

Roach J.A. opens the portion of his reasons
dealing with this point as follows[20]:—

In my opinion the learned trial judge was
right in holding that it was admissible. The question before him and now before
this Court may be stated thus: Was that statement freely and voluntarily made
or was it obtained from the appellant either by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage exercised or held out to him by the detectives? If it was a free and
voluntary statement it was admissible: if it was not it should have been
barred.

There can be no doubt as to the rule.

The learned justice of appeal then refers to Ibrahim
v. The King[21],
quoting a passage on which, amongst others, the judgments in this Court in Boudreau’s
Case were founded. He stresses the fact that the respondent had not given
evidence on the voir dire, attaches great weight to the caution given
immediately before the taking of the written statement, points out that there
had been no threats or promises and in concluding says[22]:—

In determining whether the answers made are
admissible or not, the Court inevitably must come back to the primary question:
Were they made voluntarily in the sense described in the rule as laid down by
Viscount Sumner, supra?

On reading and rereading the reasons of Pickup
C.J.O. and Roach J.A. I look in vain for any difference as to the applicable
law.

It was suggested in argument that the learned
Chief Justice of Ontario had held as a matter of law that the fact, if
established, that police officers “cross-examined” the respondent while in de
facto custody and under suspicion required the trial judge as a matter of
law to reject the statements. I can find no such ruling in his reasons. He
regarded the fact that certain questions were put as one of the relevant
circumstances to be weighed in deciding the question before the Court which he
had already accurately described in words, which I have quoted above, which do
not differ in any matter of substance from those used by Roach J.A.

[Page 982]

There is no suggestion in any of the reasons
that the learned trial judge misdirected himself on the law on this branch of
the case. His conclusion on the evidence before him was that the statements
were shewn to be voluntarily made. The minority in the Court of Appeal reached
the same conclusion but the majority were of the contrary opinion. It is not
relevant to inquire which conclusion I would have reached on the evidence, for
such a conclusion is one of fact and not of law.

No doubt there may be cases in which the
question whether a statement made by an accused is admissible in evidence
becomes one of law; but, in my opinion, the case at bar is not such a case. I
conclude that we are without jurisdiction to deal with ground 2, quoted above
from the notice of appeal of the Attorney-General. This being so it follows
that the appeal cannot succeed as it is clear from the portion of the reasons
of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario secondly quoted above that in dealing
with this ground the majority decided that the erroneous admission of the
statements in question was in itself sufficient to require the directing of a
new trial.

If, contrary to the view that I have expressed,
it could be asserted that (i) there is a difference of substance between the
statement of the principles of law which are to be applied in determining
whether a statement by an accused is admissible made by Pickup C.J.O. and that
made by Roach J.A. and (ii) that there was error in the former statement, it would
not follow that so far as this ground of appeal is concerned the appeal should
be allowed and the conviction restored. Before restoring the conviction this
Court would, at least, have to be satisfied that it could safely be affirmed
that but for the supposed error in law the majority in the Court of Appeal
would necessarily have concluded that the statements were admissible. As is
pointed out by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, supra, at pp. 609-10,
the question whether it has been shewn by the prosecution that the statement of
an accused was voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him
either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a
person in authority is one of fact to be

[Page 983]

decided by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal
has jurisdiction to weigh the evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the
making of the statement and to substitute its decision for that of the trial
judge. This Court has no jurisdiction to re-weigh the evidence and substitute
its opinion for that of the Court of Appeal. In view of the rule that the onus
of proving a statement by an accused to have been voluntary in the sense
mentioned rests upon the prosecution, I find difficulty in accepting the view
that it can ever be said as a matter of pure law that the question whether that
onus has been satisfied must be answered in the affirmative. However in view of
the conclusion which I have reached above as to our lack of jurisdiction in
this case, I do not pursue these questions further.

I would quash the appeal.

FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal from a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[23]
setting aside the conviction of the respondent for the murder of one Linda
Lampkin and ordering a new trial. The appeal is taken under the provisions of
s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  and the questions of law as to
which a dissent is alleged are (i) whether, as held by Pickup C.J.O., with the
concurrence of Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A.
dissenting, a written statement, filed as ex. 53, and an oral statement
immediately prior thereto, both made by the respondent, were illegally admitted
in evidence, and (ii) whether, as held by Pickup C.J.O., with the concurrence
of Laidlaw, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A., Roach J.A. dissenting, the trial
judge failed to lay the theory of the defence adequately before the jury and
direct them as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the
facts.

Dealing with question (i): it is the submission
of counsel for the respondent that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain
this ground of appeal for the reason that it does not involve a question of law
in the strict sense, but a pure question of fact or at the most a question of
mixed law and fact. With this submission I am unable to agree. Whether or not
evidence is admissible is always a question to be determined in the light of
what the law is with respect to

[Page 984] 

the particular nature of the evidence tendered.
While as to certain subject-matters of evidence such as confessions, this
determination requires a prior examination of the facts which, if judicially
found to foe within the rule of law governing the admission of such evidence,
will render the same admissible, any question as to what the rule is in the
matter involves a question of law in the strict sense. Hence a divergence of
views between the majority and minority members of a Court of Appeal as to what
the law is clearly gives jurisdiction to this Court to examine the point and
satisfy its statutory duty to determine the matter. With reference to the rule
of law governing the admissibility of the extrajudicial admissions made by the
respondent in the present instance, Roach J.A., for the minority, said[24]:—

There can be no doubt as to the rule. It
was stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 at
609, as follows: “It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in
the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.”

* * *

There is no positive rule of evidence that
if improper questions are asked of a prisoner in custody the answers to them
are, merely on that account, inadmissible. The cases are reviewed by Kellock J.
in Boudreau v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262 at 270 et seq., 94
C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R. 427, [1949] 3 D.L.R. 81. I do not review them here. In
determining whether the answers made are admissible or not, the Court
inevitably must come back to the primary question: Were they made voluntarily in
the sense described in the rule as laid down by Viscount Sumner, supra.

(The italics are mine.)

On the other hand, Pickup C.J.O., for the
majority, stated[25]:—

In my opinion, the Crown does not discharge
the onus resting upon it by merely adducing oral testimony showing that an
incriminating statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise
or by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage. That statement of the rule of law
is too narrow. The admissions must not have been “improperly instigated or
induced or coerced”: per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra, at p. 269.
The admissions must be self-impelled and the statement must be the statement of
a man “free in volition from compulsions or inducements of authority”.

[Page 985]

Thus it appears that Roach J.A., with the
concurrence of Aylesworth J.A., held the view that the decision of this Court
in Boudreau v. The King did not change the law as stated by Viscount
Sumner and that a declaration made by an accused is a voluntary statement if it
has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority. In the view of Pickup C.J.O.
and Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., this statement of the rule is too narrow and
in addition to proving that the statement has not been obtained by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage, the prosecution must further show that the
statement was not otherwise influenced by the course of conduct adopted by the
police, that it must be self-impelled, failing which it is not a voluntary one
in the sense required by law. The merit of each of these views of the law is,
of course, foreign to the consideration of our jurisdiction to entertain this
ground on appeal, for it is the precise point which this Court will have to
determine on the appeal itself. The above difference in the statement of the
law applied is essentially what gives jurisdiction to this Court. It may be
added, before parting with the consideration of this preliminary objection,
that none of the cases invoked by the respondent supports it or conflicts with
the views here expressed.

On the merits of ground (i): as to what the law
is in the matter, I agree with the views held by Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. As
I read the reasons for judgment of the majority in this Court in Boudreau v.
The King, supra, I find nothing to suggest an intention to modify the rule
of law as stated by Viscount Sumner. With respect to the English “Judges’
Rules” as to questions put by police officers, it has been repeatedly and again
recently said that they are administrative rules for the guidance of police
officers but not rules of law and that a breach thereof does not per se render
the statement inadmissible if the true test of voluntariness laid down by
Viscount Sumner is met: Regina v. Wattam[26]; Regina v. May[27]; Regina v. Bass[28]; Regina v. Harris-Rivet[29]. As to all the evidence in

[Page 986]

this case and particularly that related to the
circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the impugned statements, it is
extensively reviewed in the reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. in the Court
below[30], and
need not likewise be related here. In brief, while the law‑enforcement
officers were apprising the respondent at police headquarters, where he had
agreed in the morning to accompany them, that, as a result of further
investigation, they could not believe some of the declarations he had there
made in the morning, he was preoccupied in mind, eventually breaking his
silence by saying:—

I was just thinking of my wife and kids. I
didn’t mean to do it. She started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the
scarf and she didn’t breathe no more.

He was immediately stopped and informed that he
was arrested on a charge of murder, and having been given the customary
warning, he proceeded to make the declarations reduced in writing in ex. 53,
which he signed. The above attitude and utterances of the respondent are no
evidence that his mind was in any way affected by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage. On the evidence, led in the cross‑examination of the police
officers relating the event, the thoughts of the respondent throughout the day
had been directed to his wife and children, and he was explaining that it was
on account of them that he had made, in the morning, some false declarations.
Indeed it was never suggested by counsel for the respondent at any stage of the
trial, including that of the procedure on voir dire, nor can it be
implied from any of the questions or answers appearing in any part of the whole
of the evidence, that the impugned statements were not voluntary in the sense
indicated by Viscount Sumner or that the burden of the Crown to meet that
particular test had not been discharged. As the issue was tried before, and
left, to, the jury, these impugned statements, on the unchallenged information
given at the hearing before this Court by counsel for the respondent, were
represented by the defence to be voluntary in any sense of the word and
truthful. The submission that these particular statements were inadmissible was
raised for the first time for the purpose of the appeal, not in the original,
but in a supplementary notice of appeal. That these statements were voluntary
under the rule stated by Viscount Sumner

[Page 987]

is not challenged by the majority in the Court
below which found it necessary to hold as a matter of law that the statement of
the rule was too narrow and, on the law they applied, found as a fact, not that
fear of prejudice or hope of advantage was exercised or held out by the police,
but that the course of conduct they adopted precluded any conclusion that the
statements were self-impelled. Assuming that it could be said that the conduct
of the police in the circumstances of this case was not in accordance with the
“Judges’ Rules”, it was, particularly under the authorities above quoted,
within the discretion of the trial judge, if otherwise satisfied that the test
of voluntariness stated by Viscount Sumner had been met, to admit these
statements in evidence. Again, while the defence objected successfully to the
admissibility of certain declarations made subsequent to the signing by the accused
of ex. 53, it did not invite the Court to reject the impugned statements. And
if, on the view the trial judge formed on the voir dire, the occasion
arose for him to exercise this discretionary power, I find it impossible to say
that he failed to do so judicially in admitting them in evidence.

Dealing with question (ii): the theory of the
Crown was that Linda Lampkin had been strangled in furtherance of the act of
rape. The theory of the defence, contained in the statement filed as ex. 53,
was that, sexual intercourse having taken place with her full approval and
consent, Linda Lampkin not being sexually satisfied began to annoy the accused
who then grabbed her scarf without intending any harm, “and she didn’t breathe
no more”. The evidence with respect to the condition both of the body of the
victim and of her clothing is violently inconsistent with any suggestion of
consent on her part. On the evidence, the cause of death was asphyxia due to
strangulation resulting from the forceful tightening during a continuous period
of 3 to 5 minutes of a knotted scarf she had around her neck, producing thereby
a deep groove in the flesh-tissue corresponding in size to the width of the
scarf. The fact that

[Page 988]

death actually occurred subsequent to the rape
does not necessarily show that this forceful and continuous tightening of the
scarf, which brought death by strangulation, was divorced from the act of rape.
As Roach J.A. puts it[31]:—

That theory [the theory of the defence]
rested on the foundation that the act of sexual intercourse was voluntary on
her part and that she wanted it repeated. Remove that prop from beneath that
theory and it would collapse. It was her persistence, so the accused said, in
wanting the act repeated that caused him to take hold of the scarf. That was
his explanation. If that explanation should be rejected then he must have taken
hold of it for some other purpose. What was that other purpose? That other
purpose, according to the Crown’s theory, was to overpower her so that against
her will he could have sexual intercourse with her.

That the accused killed the girl there was
no doubt. He said so. What the jury had to decide was: Did he slay her under
the circumstances contained in his explanation or did her death ensue as the
result of bodily harm intentionally inflicted by him to facilitate him in
having sexual intercourse with her?

Weak as it was, the theory of the defence was
put to the jury and I agree with Roach J.A. that the two opposing theories were
fairly and squarely explained to them in such a manner that they could not fail
to understand the issue they had to decide according to law.

There remains to consider two other grounds of
appeal raised by the respondent before the Court of Appeal and with which the
majority did not find necessary to deal in view of their conclusions as to the
two points already heretofore considered. It is the respondent’s submission
that the learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury (i) as to what use
could be made of the expert evidence of Dr. Chester McLean and (ii) of their
obligation to reject any of his opinions which he was not qualified as an
expert to give.

These objections are dealt with in the reasons
for judgment of Roach J.A. and I am in respectful agreement with the manner in
which he disposed of them.

I am also of the opinion that, on all the
evidence in this case, no jury properly instructed could, if true to their
oath, return any other verdict than that the accused was guilty as charged.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and restore the verdict of the jury.

[Page 989]

ABBOTT J.:—A question which has caused me some
difficulty is that raised by respondent in his motion to quash the appeal,
namely, whether or not, in connection with the ground of appeal relating to the
admissibility of certain oral and written statements made by respondent, there
was dissent on a question of law. I have reached the conclusion that there was.

As to the admissibility of the incriminating
oral and written statements made by the accused, in his reasons in the Court
below, Roach J.A. (speaking for himself and Aylesworth J.A.) has stated the
rule of law to be applied in the following terms[32]:—

Was that statement freely and voluntarily
made or was it obtained from the appellant either by fear of prejudice or
hope of advantage exercised or held out to him by the detectives?

(The italics are mine.)

It is to be noted that he has used the precise
words of the rule as laid down by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[33], with the exception that he has
substituted the words “the detectives” for “a person in authority”.

The Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the
majority and referring to the rule in question, held that[34]:—

In my opinion, the Crown does not discharge
the onus resting upon it by merely adducing oral testimony showing that an
incriminating statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise
or by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage. That statement of the rule of law
is too narrow. The admissions must not have been “improperly instigated or
induced or coerced”: per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra, at p.
269. The admissions must be self-impelled, and the statement must be the
statement of a man “free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of
authority”. The statement must be “freely and voluntarily made”.

This difference between the dissenting judgment
and that of the majority is in my view clearly a question of law, which gives
this Court jurisdiction.

Moreover, referring to the statements made by
the respondent, Roach J.A. said[35]:—

The appellant did not give evidence either
on the voir dire or in defence to the charge. To put it otherwise he has
not at any time said in evidence that in making the statement he felt under any
compulsion or that it was induced by any fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
held out to him. When he blurted out the words “I was just thinking of my

[Page 990]

wife and kids”, and so forth, he was
immediately stopped by the detectives and cautioned. He said he understood that
caution. If he understood it then he understood that he was not obliged to say
anything, because in administering the caution to him he was told “you are not
obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so”. In my respectful opinion the
statement could be held inadmissible only on the theory that he did not
understand the caution, in the face of his statement, not denied, that he did,
or that, though he understood it, he still felt under some compulsion induced
by some improper external stimulus to make it.

I do not think it should now be held that
he did not understand the caution, in the face of his statement that he did. If
he understood it then I can see no room for the suggestion that, despite his
understanding, he still felt some compulsion. It would have been quite a
different matter if, on the voir dire, he had gone into the witness-box
and stated either that he did not understand the caution or that, understanding
it, he nevertheless made the statement because he was fearful that if he did
not he would be prejudiced, or hoped that if he did it might be to his
advantage. In the absence of such a complaint or explanation coming out of his
mouth, to hold now either that he did not understand the caution or that,
understanding it, he felt under some compulsion, would in my respectful opinion
be to act on sheer speculation, and would not be justified by the evidence.

It was not suggested on cross-examination
of the officers on the voir dire, in the argument submitted by counsel
for the accused to the trial judge, or in the argument presented to this Court,
that what the detectives said to the appellant with respect to the information
they had obtained that afternoon was not true and that by pretending that they
had such information they had tricked the accused into making an admission of
guilt. If I understood the argument of counsel for the appellant in this Court
it was simply this, that when the detectives told the accused that as a result
of their investigations they had received some information to the effect that
he had been seen with the deceased on the previous night at St. John’s
Road and Jane Street, and that they did not believe what he had told them to
the contrary in the morning, they thereby invited him to make some reply. I concede
that that is so. It is true that what the detectives said consisted of
affirmative statements and was not interrogatory, but I think there could have
been no other reason for them to make those statements than to invite a reply.
The detectives did not know what the reply might be. It might be a denial or an
explanation, or it might be an admission. Let me assume for the moment that the
detectives hoped that it would be an admission of guilt. The fact remains that
they made no threats that may have raised any fear in the mind of the
appellant, nor did they hold out any promise or hope of advantage if he
admitted his guilt nor did they suggest to him that he might be prejudiced if
he did not.

As I read this passage, the learned judge has
held that in his opinion there was no evidence to justify a finding that the
respondent’s statements were obtained from him “either by fear of prejudice or
hope of advantage exercised or held out to him”

 by the two detectives. This is a question of

[Page 991]

law upon which I share his view. I am therefore
in agreement with Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. that the statements in
question were properly admitted by the trial judge.

As to the other ground of dissent, I am in
respectful agreement with Roach J.A. that there was no misdirection and no
non-direction amounting to misdirection. There is nothing which I could
usefully add to his reasons for judgment.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

Appeal allowed and conviction
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Habitual criminals—Matters to
be proved by prosecution—Proof that accused “is leading persistently a criminal
life” at time of primary offence—The Criminal Code , now 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 660(2)(a).

Before a person can be found to be an
habitual criminal the Crown, in addition to proving the prescribed number of
previous convictions, must satisfy the onus of proving beyond a reasonable
doubt that at the time of committing the primary offence the accused was
“leading persistently a criminal life”. This onus is not satisfied by showing
that since his release from imprisonment he has done no work and has no visible
means of earning an honest livelihood, and on the other hand the fact that he
has done some honest work since his last release is far from conclusive proof
that he is not an habitual criminal, although it is an important consideration.
Rex v. Stewart (1910), 4 Cr. App. R. 175 at 178; Rex v. Baggott (1910),
4 Cr. App. R. 67 at 70; Rex v. Lavender (1927), 20 Cr. App. R. 10,
quoted or referred to.

There are cases in which an accused’s
criminal record, coupled with the conviction for the substantive offence, may
form a sufficient basis for the finding that he is an habitual criminal. But
Parliament did not intend that a man should be found to be an habitual criminal
merely because he has a number of previous convictions against him. Rex v.
Jones (1920), 15 Cr. App. R. 20 at 21, agreed with. In all the cases in
which this has been held sufficient the substantive offence has been of such a
nature as to show premeditation and careful preparation, and in this way to
constitute in itself evidence of leading persistently a criminal life. Rex
v. Keane and Watson (1912), 8 Cr. App. R. 12 at 14; Rex v. Heard (1911),
7 Cr. App. R. 80 at 83, quoted. If the circumstances of the primary
offence are consistent with the view that the accused yielded to a sudden
temptation, and do not establish premeditation or a plan, the fact of that
offence, even when coupled with a lengthy criminal record, does not constitute
sufficient evidence to support a finding that the accused is an habitual
criminal.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dismissing an
appeal from a sentence of preventive detention imposed on the appellant as an
habitual criminal. Appeal allowed.

J.W. Brooke, for the accused, appellant.

W.B. Common, Q.C., for the respondent.

[Page 4]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal, brought
pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from an order of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dated May 26,
1953, affirming the finding of His Honour Judge Lovering dated February 26, 1953, that the appellant was an
habitual criminal.

On February 26, 1953, the appellant was tried
before His Honour Judge Lovering, without a jury, on the charge of having, on October 4, 1952, stolen from the person of Hugh
McCulloch a wallet containing $107 in money and personal papers. The learned
judge convicted the appellant on this charge and then proceeded with the
hearing to determine whether or not he was an habitual criminal, with the
result indicated above.

In view of the dates of the proceedings the
questions raised on this appeal are to be determined under the provisions of Part
X (A) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as enacted by 1947, c.
55, s. 18.

The notice required by s. 575C(4)(b) was
given to the appellant. In it the grounds upon which it was intended “to found
the charge of being an habitual criminal” were specified as follows:

1. That since attaining the age of eighteen
years you have been convicted of the following indictable offences for which
you were liable to at least five years imprisonment, that is to say,

(a) On the 18th day of January, 1936, in
the Magistrate’s Court for the City of Toronto in the County of York, you were
convicted for that you did on the 30th day of December, 1935, at the City of
Toronto in the County of York, unlawfully did steal one carton containing
thirty pounds of tea the property of the Toronto St. Catharines Transport,
value under $25.00, contrary to the Criminal Code , and that you were sentenced
to imprisonment for 60 days.

(b) On the 11th day of May in the year
1936, in the County of York Magistrate’s Court, you were convicted for that on
the 28th day of April in the year 1936, at the Township of Scarboro in the
County of York, you unlawfully did steal four cases of beer, the property of
the Brewery Corporation, value under $25.00, contrary to Section 386  of
the Criminal Code , and you were sentenced to a definite term of 6 months.

(c) On the 15th day of May in the year
1936, in the Magistrate’s Court for the City of Toronto in the County of York,
you were convicted for that in the month of April in the year 1936, at the City
of Toronto in the County of York, you unlawfully did receive in your possession
eighteen cartons of beer, the property of Reinhardt Brewery and theretofore
stolen, then well knowing the same to have been so stolen, value over $25.00,
contrary to the Criminal Code , section 399 , and you were sentenced to a
definite term of 6 months in the Ontario Reformatory.

[Page 5]

(d) On the 27th day of October A.D., 1937,
in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of York, you were
convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York on or about the
27th day of September in the year 1937, you unlawfully stole a diamond ring,
two watches, a set of dress studs, a silver ring, a silver brooch, a silver
ring box and the sum of forty-five dollars ($45.00) in money, the property of
Henrietta Dunn, contrary to the Criminal Code , and you were sentenced on the
2nd day of November, 1937, to serve a term of one year in jail.

(e) On the 5th day of November, A.D., 1937,
in the County of York Magistrate’s Court, you were convicted for that you did
on the 4th day of October, A.D., 1937, at the Township of North York, in the
County of York, unlawfully have, receive, or retain in your possession one cuff
link, the property of W.G. Richards, 9 Brook Street, before then stolen, well
knowing the same to have been stolen, contrary to Section 399  of the
Criminal Code , and you were sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months.

(f) On the 15th day of November, A.D.,
1938, in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of York, you
were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York, on or
about the 1st day of October in the year 1938, you broke and entered the shop,
warehouse, store or storehouse of Dominion Stores Ltd., situate and known as
number 497 Parliament Street, in the said city, and stole therein a quantity of
cigarettes and other articles, the property of Dominion Stores Ltd., contrary
to the Criminal Code ;

(g) And further at the time and place last
above mentioned, you were also convicted for that at the City of Toronto on or
about the 1st day of October in the year 1938, you robbed Benjamin Pearson of a
revolver, and at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such
robbery, wounded, beat, struck or used personal violence to the said Benjamin
Pearson, contrary to the Criminal Code ;

(h) And further at the time and place last
above mentioned, you were also convicted for that at the said City of Toronto,
on or about the 9th day of October in the year 1938, you robbed one Alex Thompson
of the sum of two hundred and eight dollars, ($208.00) in money, a wrist watch
and a fountain pen, and at the time of or immediately before or immediately
after such robbery, wounded, beat, struck or used personal violence to the said
Alex Thompson, contrary to the Criminal Code .

(i) On the 21st day of November, 1938, you
were sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary for three years for
each of the offences mentioned in paragraphs f, g, and h above, the sentences
to run concurrent.

(j) On the 4th day of June, A.D., 1946, at
the sittings of the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of York,
you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York, on or
about the 9th day of June in the year 1945, you unlawfully did steal the sum of
three hundred and eighteen dollars ($318.00), the property of Kenneth Adair,
contrary to the Criminal Code  and that you were sentenced to imprisonment in
Kingston Penitentiary for two years.

(k) On the 20th day of June, A.D., 1946, at
sittings of the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of York, held
at the City of Toronto, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in
the County of York, in or about the month of May in the year 1946, you
unlawfully did steal three suitcases and two week-end bags and contents,

[Page 6]

the property of Albert Catalone, Irma
Wolfe, Margaret L. Clark and Eli Van Dirlin, contrary to the Criminal Code  and
that you were sentenced to serve a term of three years in Kingston
Penitentiary.

(l) On the 15th day of December, A.D.,
1949, at a sittings of the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of
York, held at the City of Toronto you were convicted for that at the City of
Toronto in the County of York, in the month of October in the year 1949, you
broke and entered the dwelling house of Wilfred Deschamp, situate and known as
number 338 Bloor Street East, in the said City, by night, with intent to commit
an indictable offence therein, to wit, theft, contrary to the Criminal Code ,
and that you were sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary for three
years.

2. That since the expiration of your last
term of imprisonment you have been doing no work and you have no visible means
by which to earn an honest livelihood.

3. You are charged with being a persistent
criminal because shortly after your release from Kingston Penitentiary,
you committed the fresh offence that you are now charged with.

The convictions as set out in items (a)
to (I) of para. 1 of this notice were proved at the hearing. It
appears from the certificates of conviction, which were filed as exhibits, that
the sentences imposed under items (b) and (c) were
to run concurrently as was also the case in regard to those imposed under items
(d) and (e), those imposed under items (f), (g)
and (h) and those imposed under items (j) and (k).

There was evidence that in November 1937 the
appellant had stated his age to be 19 and that in September 1945 he had stated
it to be 27.

We were informed by counsel that the appellant
was released from the penitentiary on April 4, 1952, so that exactly six months
elapsed between the date of his release and that of the commission of the
substantive offence of which he was convicted by His Honour Judge Lovering. The
only evidence given for the prosecution as to the activities of the appellant
during this period was that in July and August 1952 he was seen in the village
of Belle Ewart assisting from time to time in a booth operated by his sister in
which refreshments were sold.

The defence called William Dineen, a nephew of
the appellant, who testified that the latter had helped the mother of the
witness in the operation of the booth at Belle Ewart; that the appellant had
tried to get employment at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 but could
not do so as he was not a union member; that

[Page 7]

the witness and his wife then took the appellant
into their home and that he helped with digging the cellar and with some
reconditioning and decorating of their house; that the appellant got some odd
jobs as a stevedore; that the appellant was “living for free at home” and
getting some money from his sister, the mother of the witness; and that during
the war years the appellant had worked at war-work but that the witness knew of
this only by hearsay as he was in the armed services at that time.

The learned County Judge gave no reason for his finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal and the Court of Appeal gave no reasons
for their decision that the appeal from that finding should be dismissed.

While the grounds of appeal were expressed in
varying terms in the memorandum filed on behalf of the appellant, the main
ground argued before us was that on the evidence the Crown had failed to
satisfy the onus of proving that at the time of the commission of the
substantive offence the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. We
were informed by counsel that this ground was not urged in the Court of Appeal.
It must be borne in mind that, leave to appeal having been granted under s.
41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, our
jurisdiction is not restricted to questions of law alone: vide the
judgment of this Court granting leave to appeal in Parkes v. The Queen[1].

Section 575C(1) so far as relevant to the
question now before us read as follows:

(1) A person shall not be found to be a
habitual criminal unless the judge… finds on evidence,

(a) that since attaining the age of
eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the
crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to at least five years’ imprisonment, whether any such
previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that
he is leading persistently a criminal life;

Part X(A) of the Criminal Code , first
enacted in 1947, is in its wording similar to, although not identical with,
Part II of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, c. 59, and
counsel in the course of their full and helpful

[Page 8]

arguments discussed a number of the decisions of
the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases arising under the last-mentioned statute.

In my opinion it is established by these
decisions, and I would so hold on the wording of s. 575C(1) if the matter
were devoid of authority, that before an accused can be found to be an habitual
criminal the Crown, in addition to proving the prescribed number of previous
convictions, must satisfy the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at
the time when he committed the indictable offence referred to in s. 575B the
accused was leading persistently a criminal life. It is true that a finding
that a person is an habitual criminal is not a conviction of a crime: vide
Brusch v. The Queen[2] and Parkes
v. The Queen[3]; but,
as was said by Rand J. in Parkes v. The Queen[4] when the finding that Parkes was an
habitual criminal was quashed:

Under such a determination a person can be
detained in prison for the rest of his life with his liberty dependent on the
favourable discretion of a minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most
serious step in the administration of the criminal law.

and, in my opinion, the rule requiring proof
beyond a reasonable doubt applies to such an adjudication as fully as in the
case of any criminal charge.

In the case at bar there is no evidence that
during the six months following his release from the penitentiary in April 1952
the appellant had done anything unlawful or dishonest. Such evidence as there
is goes to show that he was trying to obtain work, albeit without much success,
and was doing such work as he was able to get. Ground no. 2 set out in the
notice required under s. 575C(4)(b) and quoted above is not made out on
the evidence but if it had been it would not have required a finding adverse to
the appellant. It was said by Jelf J., giving the judgment of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Stewart[5],

It does not follow, because he is not
getting an honest living, that it must be a dishonest one—he may be doing
nothing.

[Page 9]

and by Pickford J. giving the judgment of the
Court in Rex v. Baggott[6]:

He refused the work of stone-breaking that
had been offered him by the guardians. It is said that you can infer
criminality from this. But the evidence was that the appellant was living on
the charity of his relations. Therefore the choice was not stone-breaking or
stealing, but stone-breaking or charity. He chose the latter.

I agree with the view expressed in a number of
cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal that the mere fact that the prisoner has
done some honest work since his last release is by no means conclusive proof
that he is not an habitual criminal: see, for example, Rex v. Lavender[7]; although the fact of his having done such
work is an important consideration.

It was argued on behalf of the respondent that
the appellant’s criminal record coupled with the conviction of the substantive
offence formed a sufficient basis for the finding that he was an habitual
criminal. As to this I agree with the view expressed by Lord Reading L.C.J.
giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Jones[8]:

The legislature never intended that a man
should be convicted of being a habitual criminal merely because he had a number
of previous convictions against him.

There have however been cases in which the Court
of Criminal Appeal has upheld a finding that a prisoner was an habitual
criminal on the ground that the nature of the substantive offence viewed in the
light of his previous record was in itself evidence that he was leading
persistently a criminal life. For example in Rex v. Keane and Watson[9], Channell J. in giving the judgment of the
Court said:

The point is whether, at the time when he
commits the offence then being dealt with, he is leading persistently a
dishonest or criminal life. The verb is in the present tense. If he has done
some honest work but has given it up and committed another crime, it may well
be that he has returned to a life of crime and is then a habitual criminal, and
the nature of the most recent crime may itself be evidence that at the time he
commits it he is persistently leading a dishonest or criminal life. In Baggott’s
case, which was relied on for the appellants but is really an authority
against them, the offence of coining was given as an illustration of such a
crime. But the present case is another illustration which will do equally well.
The appellants, who must have planned the crime

[Page 10]

together, broke into this dwelling-house by
means of a jemmy and stole bracelets and rings and other property from the
bedrooms. We think that when they were committing this offence, they must then
have been leading persistently a dishonest and criminal life. In our opinion,
therefore, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdicts of the jury… 

I have examined all the cases of this class to
which we were referred by counsel and find that in each of them the substantive
offence was of such a nature as to show premeditation and careful preparation.
I shall refer to only one example. In Rex v. Heard[10], Hamilton J., speaking for the Court,
said:

Where the interval between the last known
fact against the prisoner and the commission of the substantive crime is
considerable—and six or nine months are a considerable interval—there should be
additional evidence. In this case there was such evidence, for the crime was
carefully planned, was committed in association with another habitual criminal,
and was carried out with skill, so the jury, with the facts before them, were
justified in convicting… 

In the case at bar the transcript of the
evidence given at the trial on the charge of the substantive offence was not
before the Court of Appeal nor was it before us at the argument. In considering
the matter, after judgment had been reserved, this Court was unanimously of the
opinion that this transcript should have formed part of the material in the
Court of Appeal, and requested the Attorney-General to furnish it to us unless
counsel should desire to make any submission that it should not be before us.
No objection was made and we have now received the transcript.

The evidence of McCulloch whose wallet was
stolen is uncontradicted. He was walking north on Jarvis
 Street about midnight after watching television in a
hotel. There had been a collision and an argument was in progress as a result.
McCulloch had stopped to observe this and was having a conversation with the
appellant during the course of which he offered the appellant a cigarette. He
does not say who started the conversation. He says in part:

Anyway, we talked for about a minute or two
and he said, “All right sir, you are a good sport”, and gave me a pat on the
shoulder and walked off across the street.

A moment later, on putting his hand in his
pocket to get his handkerchief, McCulloch noticed that his wallet which had
been in his left hip pocket was gone. He ran after

[Page 11]

the appellant calling for the police and the
appellant was seen to drop the wallet. The appellant did not give evidence.

In my opinion, the offence thus committed by the
appellant is not of such a nature as to warrant the inference that he was
leading persistently a criminal life. The circumstances are consistent with the
view that, yielding to a sudden temptation, he availed himself of the
opportunity afforded by his chance meeting with McCulloch following the
collision. It may be said that the circumstances are not inconsistent with the
view that the appellant had gone out that night for the express purpose of
picking someone’s pocket if the opportunity offered, but so to hold would be
mere speculation. Bearing in mind that the appellant is entitled to the benefit
of every reasonable doubt it is my opinion that there is not sufficient
evidence to support the finding of the learned County Court Judge that the
appellant was an habitual criminal. As pointed out above we are not restricted
to a consideration of the question of law whether there was any evidence on
which such a finding could have been made and I express no final opinion upon
it although it is my present view that there was no such evidence.

I do not intend in anything I have said above to
minimize the seriousness of the substantive offence of which the appellant was
convicted, and for which he has been punished by two years’ imprisonment; but
that offence was not, in my opinion, of such a nature as, without more, to
furnish evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life.

I would quash the finding that the appellant was
an habitual criminal and the direction that he be held in preventive detention.

Appeal allowed.

Brooke, Toronto.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Evidence—Admissibility—Res gestae—Conduct of
accused driver immediately after accident—Relevance to issue of anterior
negligence.

Criminal law—Criminal
negligence—Admissibility of evidence of driver’s conduct immediately after
accident.

Evidence of the conduct of an accused person
immediately after an accident, if it is of such a nature that it may reasonably
be thought sufficient, if believed, to warrant an inference upon the issue of
criminal negligence, may be properly received in evidence and considered by the
jury in determining that issue.

On a trial for causing death by criminal
negligence evidence was admitted that the accused’s car, immediately after
striking another car, “skidded and swerved up the street” and “as soon as it
got under its right control it picked up speed” and disappeared. The trial
judge told the jury that they were entitled to consider this evidence in
determining whether or not the accused had been guilty of criminal negligence.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The evidence was properly admitted and there was no
misdirection. It was open to the jury, in the circumstances of the case, to
draw an inference from the subsequent conduct of the accused as to his
wantonness and reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons at
the time of and immediately before the accident. The whole conduct was part of
the res gestae.

Gudmondson v. The King (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332, distinguished.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: Criminal negligence, as defined by s. 191  of the Criminal
Code , must be shown to have existed prior to or at the instant of the
accused’s car striking the other car, and although the fact that the driver
fled from the scene was a relevant item of circumstantial evidence, it was
essential that it be made plain to the jury that his conduct after the accident
was relevant only in so far as it assisted them to determine by inference the
nature of his conduct before it, and whether or not he had, before the impact,
been driving with wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
others. Without such a warning (which was not given) there was grave danger of
their convicting because in their opinion the accused had acted with that
disregard after the impact.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
affirming his conviction, before Ferguson J. and a jury, of causing the death
of one Lawrence Vipond by criminal negligence. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 21]

J.G.J. O’Driscoll and Patrick Galligan,
for the appellant.

W.B. Common, Q.C., for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal should be
dismissed. As to the second ground of appeal, I agree with the reasons of
Mr. Justice Kellock and merely add that, in addition to the references by
him to the charge of the trial judge, it might be pointed out that the latter,
at several earlier stages, had referred to the fact that “this is a hit-and-run
case”—and necessarily so, since one of the main matters in dispute was as to
the identification of the driver of the automobile. The subsequent conduct of
the driver relied upon by the Crown occurred immediately after the impact and
could be treated as part of the res gestae as accompanying those earlier
acts as to which it was contended that the driver had been criminally negligent
in doing, or omitting to do, anything which it was his duty to do, showing
wanton, or reckless, disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.
Unquestionably no appreciable time elapsed between the automobile striking
Vipond and the skidding, swerving and picking up speed.

The first point upon which leave to appeal was
granted is:

Was the verbal statement attributed to the
appellant by the investigating police officer improperly admitted in evidence?

Whether or not one considers that at the time of
the making of this statement the appellant was under arrest on any charge, the
rule laid down by this Court in Boudreau v. The King[1], was not infringed. Although the evidence
as to this verbal statement was given before the voir dire, and the
trial judge was apparently of the view that it should not have been so given,
at that time, and although he ruled against the admissibility of a subsequent
written statement, there is nothing, considering all the circumstances, to take
the case out of the rule so established.

The judgment of Kellock, Locke and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—When the sequence of events is
properly understood, I do not think the ruling of the learned trial

[Page 22]

judge, confirmed, as it was, by the Court of
Appeal, as to the admissibility of the oral statement of the appellant to the
police officer, can be questioned.

With regard to the second ground of appeal, it
is contended that there was misdirection on the part of the learned trial judge
in instructing the jury that in determining the issue as to criminal
negligence, they were entitled to take into consideration the conduct of the
appellant in leaving the scene after the accident.

The evidence was that of two witnesses, who
testified as to seeing the appellant’s car immediately after the accident, one
of them stating that “it skidded and swerved up the street; as soon as it got
under its right control it picked up speed” and disappeared. The learned trial
judge instructed the jury:

This, you see, is a hit-and-run case and
you have to consider that in considering whether this was a reckless disregard
for the lives and safety of other people. Is the conduct of the person who hit
Vipond consistent with anything but a reckless disregard for the lives and
safety of other people?

And again:

Ask yourselves, how could he have failed to
see this car; how did he get over in front of the door? You will ask yourselves
about these questions. If he had any regard for the life and safety of people
on the street would he not have stopped after he came in collision with this
door? It is for you to say. In order to convict him you must be able to say
that he showed a reckless and wanton disregard for the lives and safety of
other people.

In my opinion, evidence of the conduct of an
accused person immediately after an accident, if of such a nature that it may
reasonably be thought sufficient, if believed, to warrant an inference upon the
issue of criminal negligence, may be properly received in evidence. The appellant’s
subsequent conduct was, therefore, a proper consideration for the jury in the
case at bar.

Counsel for the appellant referred to the
decision of this Court in Gudmondson v. The King[2], as supporting a contrary view. In that
case there was evidence on behalf of the Crown that the car which had struck
the deceased kept on going after the accident and in order to get away, drove
around another car which had been stopped in the middle of the highway in an
effort to bring it to a stop.

[Page 23]

In addition, there was evidence on behalf of the
accused that his conduct in not stopping was due to panic and that in any
event, his brakes were gone and he could not a bring the car to a stop. The
learned trial judge had charged the jury that the conduct of the accused after
the accident was relevant on the issue of criminal negligence from the
standpoint of “similar facts” and had told them: “There is no doubt he fails by
hitting and running away in this case. As far as I am concerned I will tell you
that has been established by the evidence.”[3]
It was in these circumstances that this Court said, at p. 333:

Having said what he did upon this matter,
he ought at least to have added a warning to the jury that such conduct,
however reprehensible, could have no more than an indirect bearing upon the
issue before them. He had already virtually withdrawn from them the charge of
intoxication; but, in view of his other observations, he should have told them
that they ought to be very cautious in imputing to the accused a consciousness
of guilt, because of actions which, on reflection, they might think capable of
explanation as due to panic.

In the case at bar there was no evidence with
regard to the conduct of the appellant after the accident apart from that to
which I have already referred. In my view, therefore, what the learned trial
judge said to the jury was not objectionable from the standpoint which this
Court considered objectionable in the case to which I have referred and, in my
opinion, it was open to the jury in the circumstances of this case to draw an
inference from the subsequent conduct of the appellant as to the wantonness and
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons at the time of and
immediately prior to the accident here in question. The whole conduct was part
of the res gestae.

I do not think the charge is open to the
construction that the jury were told they could draw from the mere fact that
the appellant ran away from the scene of the accident, the inference that his
driving at the time of the accident amounted to criminal negligence. The
learned judge had already instructed the jury with considerable care as to the
elements of negligence of that character.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 24]

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—-The
appellant was tried at the assizes at Brantford before Ferguson J. and a jury and, on January 16, 1956, was
convicted on the charge that at the town of Paris, on November 12, 1955, he did by criminal negligence cause the death of Lawrence Vipond,
contrary to s. 192  of the Criminal Code . On April 9, 1956, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario unanimously
dismissed his appeal.

On April 24, 1956, Abbott J. granted leave to
appeal on the following questions of law:

1. Was the verbal statement attributed to
the appellant by the investigating police officer improperly admitted in
evidence?

2. Did the learned Trial Judge misdirect
the jury when he instructed them that in determining whether or not the
appellant was guilty of criminal negligence they were entitled to take into
consideration his subsequent conduct, namely, leaving the scene of the
accident?

As in my opinion there should be a new trial I
will refer to the evidence only so far as may be necessary to make clear the
reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.

At about 11.20 p.m. on November 12, 1955 Lawrence Vipond and a Miss
Pfeiffer were standing on Dundas Street in the town of Paris on the south or right-hand side of an automobile which was parked
facing easterly on the north side of the street. The right‑hand door of
this automobile was open. A motor vehicle driven westerly struck the open door
and the right rear fender of the stationary automobile with considerable
violence. Vipond suffered injuries from which he died shortly afterwards. Miss
Pfeiffer was seriously injured and was found 14 feet west of the stationary
automobile. The motor vehicle which struck Vipond did not stop and none of the
witnesses could identify its driver or say whether it was driven by a man or a
woman.

The theory of the Crown was that the appellant
was the driver of the motor vehicle which struck the deceased. There was
circumstantial evidence to support this theory and the Crown also relied on an
oral statement said to have been made by the appellant to a police officer
after he had been arrested on a charge of vagrancy on the day following the
fatality.

[Page 25]

It is to the admissibility of this oral
statement that the first question is directed. I do not find it necessary to
answer this question. Unfortunately the statement in question was given in
evidence by the police officer in the presence of the jury without any
preliminary enquiry or ruling as to its admissibility. The learned trial judge
appears to have been at first inclined to the view that the statement was
inadmissible and that a mistrial would result; but as he did not discharge the
jury and in his charge invited them to consider the statement, it must be taken
that at the conclusion of the evidence he had decided that it was admissible,
although he ruled against the admissibility of the written statement said to
have been made by the appellant immediately afterwards. It will be for the
judge presiding at the new trial to decide the question of admissibility upon
the evidence then given as to the circumstances in which the statement was
made.

Turning to the second question, it was, of
course, incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not
only that the appellant was the driver of the car which struck Vipond but also
that he was criminally negligent in driving it. In dealing with this question I
will assume that the jury found that the appellant was the driver of the car.

Criminal negligence is defined in s. 191  of the Criminal
Code , which reads as follows:

191. (1) Every one is criminally negligent
who

(a) in doing anything, or

(b) in omitting to do anything that
it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

(2) For the purposes of this section,
“duty” means a duty imposed by law.

The appellant while driving was under a legal
duty to take reasonable care to avoid injuring any persons on the highway; but,
in view of the definition quoted, he could be found guilty only if the jury
were satisfied not merely that he failed to perform this duty but also that his
failure showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others.
Such wanton or reckless disregard must be shown to have existed prior to or at
the instant of the car striking Vipond.

[Page 26]

Counsel for the respondent argues that the jury
were entitled to infer the existence of such disregard from the facts that it
was a clear night, that the parking lights of the stationary car were on, that
it was parked between two street lights, that there was nothing to prevent the
driver of the car which struck Vipond from seeing the stationary car, that the
impact was violent, and that the driver fled from the scene. I agree that all
of these were relevant items of circumstantial evidence. But, in my opinion, it
was of vital importance that the jury should be carefully instructed that they
must consider the fact of flight only for the purpose of reaching a decision as
to the manner in which the driver was driving up to the instant of the impact,
and particularly as to whether up to that instant he was driving with wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. Without such a
warning there would be a grave danger of the jury convicting the appellant
because in their opinion he had immediately after the impact acted with
such wanton or reckless disregard. In other words, it was essential that it be
made plain to the jury that the conduct of the accused subsequent to the impact
was relevant only in so far as it assisted them to determine by inference the
nature of his conduct prior to the impact.

Far from giving any such direction the learned
trial judge used words which the jury may well have understood, and which, in
my opinion, they would have understood, to mean that they might convict the
appellant if satisfied that he had immediately after the impact acted with a
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others. I refer to the following
passage in the charge of the learned trial judge, and particularly to the
sentences which I have italicized:

If you decide it was negligence, was it the
kind of negligence I described? that is, was it criminal? This, you see, is
a hit-and-run case and you have to consider that in considering whether this
was a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people. Is the
conduct of the person who hit Vipond consistent with anything but a reckless
disregard for the lives and safety of other people? The car had crossed the
bridge; there was not very much traffic on Dundas Street; the street lights
were on; the driving conditions, as you have heard, were good; this is a fairly
wide street; yet whoever drove this car crashed into the door of Kennedy’s car
and crushed these two young people.

[Page 27]

Miss Verna Farr said they flew through the
air, and Miss Pfeiffer was found fourteen feet beyond the rear of Kennedy’s
car, and Vipond was found with his feet sort of underneath the rear wheel. The
car skidded, according to Miss Farr, and then speeded up when it righted and
after swerving, passed on. You will ask yourselves how could a driver driving
under those conditions with the car parked between these two lights—someone
gave the exact distance the car was from the easterly light, and as you can see
there is seventy-six feet from Burwell Street to the first light, and then
there is some distance from the first light to the car—so that whoever passed
Burwell Street and crossed this corner had, as I recall it, some ninety feet
before he would come to this door. Ask yourselves, how could he have failed to
see this car; how did he get over in front of the door? You will ask yourselves
about those questions. If he had any regard for the life and safety of
people on the street would he not have stopped after he came into collision
with this door? It is for you to say. In order to convict him you must be able
to say that he showed a reckless and wanton disregard for the lives and safety
of other people.

I am unable to find anything elsewhere in the
charge of the learned trial judge which would make it clear to the jury that
they must not convict unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused was driving prior to or at the moment of impact with a wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.

In considering the likelihood of the jury having
been misled it is well to bear in mind the natural tendency towards a feeling
of indignation at the conduct of a person who, having struck another down,
leaves him lying on the roadway and flees from the scene. That Parliament takes
a stern view of such conduct is evidenced by the penalty prescribed by
s. 221 (2)  of the Criminal Code ; but the appellant was not on trial
for an offence against that section.

In my opinion the second question on which leave
to appeal was granted should be answered in the affirmative.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Accomplice—Misdirection—Corroboration—Improper statement of Crown counsel.

The appellant was convicted by a jury of having broken and
entered a garage and stolen property therein. His appeal was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal.

The Crown's case rested chiefly on the evidence of an
accomplice whom, according to the Crown's theory, the appellant had agreed to
drive to the locality of the crime for the purpose, known to the appellant, of
committing the crime. It is conceded that the accomplice did himself commit the
crime. The appellant's case was that he had driven the accomplice without any
knowledge of his guilty purpose, had left him at his destination and had
returned home alone. There was some evidence which was capable of being
regarded as corroboration of the evidence of the accomplice.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction
quashed and a new trial directed.

It was misdirection for the trial judge to charge the jury
with words from which they would normally understand that there lay an onus on
the appellant to satisfy them of his innocence.

The trial judge failed also to direct the jury adequately as
to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice and
as to what constitutes corroboration; and particularly failed to explain that
facts although independently proved could not be regarded as corroborative of
the accomplice's evidence if they were equally consistent with the truth of the
appellant's evidence.

The trial judge failed also to point out to the jury what was
the theory of the defence and to tell them that they should acquit if, on all
the evidence, they entertained a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.

The statement of Crown counsel in the presence of the jury
that he was going to have the appellant arrested for perjury on the following
morning or that afternoon, was improper and could scarcely fail to prejudice
the fair trial of the appellant.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant.

J. Vernier for the appellant.

G. Normandin, Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 96]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Cartwright J.:—The
appellant was convicted at his trial before Rhéaume J. and
a jury of having, during the night of October 26 to 27, 1953, broken and
entered the garage of Gaétan Poisson at Rougemont and
stolen therein property of the said Gaétan Poisson of the
value of about $125. His appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, was
dismissed by a unanimous judgment for which no written reasons were given.

Pursuant to section 1025 (1)  of the Criminal Code  leave
was granted to the appellant to appeal to this Court on the following questions
of law:—

1. Did the learned trial judge err in failing to direct the
jury correctly with reference to the burden resting upon the Crown to prove the
guilt of the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt?

2. Did the learned trial judge err (a) in failing to
direct the jury as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence
of an accomplice? (b) in failing to direct the jury that the Crown
witness Chaput was an accomplice or as to what, in law, constitutes an
accomplice? (c) in failing to direct the jury as to what constitutes
corroboration? (d) in failing to direct the jury that evidence which is
equally consistent with the evidence of an accomplice and that of the accused
is corroborative of neither?

3. Did the learned trial judge err in failing to place the
theory of the defence fully and fairly before the jury?

4. Did the learned trial judge err in failing to explain to
the jury the application of the law to the facts?

5. Was the appellant deprived of a trial according to law by
reason of the fact that at the conclusion of the evidence given by the
appellant in his defence the Crown counsel stated in the presence of the jury
that he was going to have the appellant arrested for perjury either on the
following morning or that afternoon?

At the conclusion of the hearing the Court gave judgment
allowing the appeal, quashing the conviction and directing a new trial and
stated that written reasons would be delivered in due course.

As there is to be a new trial I will refer to the facts and
the evidence only so far as is necessary to make clear what is involved in the
questions submitted for decision.

The case for the Crown was that the accused had agreed with
one René Chaput to. drive the latter from Montreal to
Rougemont for the purpose, made known to the accused at the time of the
agreement, of committing the crime charged and which it is conceded that Chaput
did himself commit. It is not suggested that the accused entered the garage or
ever had possession of any of the stolen articles. His alleged

[Page 97]

participation in the commission of the
offence consisted in driving Chaput to Rougemont with guilty knowledge of his
purpose. No doubt such participation would, if proved, be sufficient, under the
provisions of s. 69 (1)  (b) of the Criminal Code , to render the
appellant guilty of the offence committed by Chaput. Driving Chaput under such
circumstances would be doing an act for the purpose of aiding him to commit the
offence.

The appellant's case was that he and Chaput were drinking
together in a tavern in Montreal on the evening of the crime, that he agreed to
drive Chaput to Rougemont for $5 which Chaput paid to him, that he left Chaput
at Rougemont and returned alone to Montreal and that he acted throughout
without any knowledge of Chaput's guilty purpose.

From this brief statement of the theories of the Crown and
of the defence it at once becomes obvious that the Crown's case rested chiefly
on the evidence of Chaput who was, on the Crown's theory, clearly an accomplice
of the appellant. It will be convenient to first set out all the passages in
the charge of the learned trial judge touching on (i) the onus resting upon the
prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused and the duty of the jury to give
the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt, (ii) the way in which the jury
should approach the evidence of an accomplice, and (iii) the theory of the
defence.

The learned trial judge having said that the youth of
counsel for the accused at the trial would excuse him for a little exaggeration
continued:—

Je fais allusion à la question
du doute, quand il a dit que ""si vous avez le moindre
doute""; alors, je dis: ""Ce n'est pas tout à fait ce que nos tribunaux
exigent des jurés, ce n'est pas le moindre doute, c'est un doute sérieux,
raisonnable, qui doit être interprété en faveur de l'accusé.

The only other portion of the charge making any reference to the three above matters is as
follows:—

Maintenant, je vais me limiter aux questions
de droit. La Couronne a l'obligation de faire la preuve de l'accusation portée contre
l'accusé. C'est à vous de l'apprécier. Et là, la question du doute intervient.
Si vous avez un doute, un doute sérieux, non pas fantaisiste, mais un doute
raisonnable, alors votre devoir est d'en donner le bénéfice à l'accusé qui est
dans la boîte.

Maintenant, il est question de la preuve d'un
complice, dans cette cause-ci. Comme vous l'a fait remarquer le procureur de la
Couronne, il faut accepter le témoignage d'un complice sous réserve. Cependant,
la loi reconnaît un tel témoignage s'il est corroboré par des circonstances,
d'autres

[Page 98]

témoignages et des circonstances. Il vous
appartiendra de dire si les circonstances qui ont été placées devant vous
rendent vraisemblable la véracité du témoignage du complice en cette cause.

Maintenant, comment apprécier la preuve, je
laisse cela à votre entière liberté. Prenez d'abord l'expérience de la vie,
vous avez droit de vous en servir, et vous apprécierez la preuve selon les
dictées de votre conscience. Vous vous demanderez—il y a
certaines questions que vous avez droit de vous demander pour arriver à la
vérité—vous vous demanderez si les explications données
par l'accusé et par ses témoins vous ont satisfaits; vous vous demanderez
pourquoi ce voyage dans la nuit, qu'est-ce qui a motivé ce voyage dans la nuit,
et vous vous demanderez si là il n'y a pas une circonstance qui fortifie le
témoignage du complice.

As to the first point, it was argued
that the learned trial judge erred in using the adjective ""sérieux""
which he coupled with the adjective ""raisonnable""
whenever the latter was used. As to this it may be recalled that in the
reasons of the majority of the Court in Boucher v. The Queen 1,
the use of the word ""sérieux"" in place of the word ""raisonnable""
when describing that doubt the existence of which requires a jury to return a
verdict of not guilty was deprecated. However, the misdirection which, on this
point, appears to me to be fatal is that contained in the following sentence
and particularly in those words which I have italicized:—

… vous vous demanderez si les explications
données par l'accusé et par ses témoins vous ont satisfaits; …

From these words the jury would normally understand
that there lay an onus on the appellant to satisfy them of his innocence.

Turning now to the second ground of appeal, it is obvious
that on the Crown's theory Chaput was an accomplice. There is to be found in
the record some evidence which, if they believed it, the jury might regard as
corroboration of that of Chaput. Under the circumstances of this case it was the
duty of the learned trial judge; (i) to tell the jury that it is always
dangerous to convict an accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice, although it is within their legal province to do so; (ii) to tell
them that Chaput was an accomplice; while in doubtful cases the Judge will
instruct the jury as to what in law constitutes an accomplice and leave it to
them to say whether a particular witness is or is not an accomplice, in the
case at bar this point was not in issue; (iii) to explain to the jury what is
meant by

[Page 99]

the term corroboration; the classic statement as to this is
found in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Baskerville
2:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him
with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that
is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the
crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. The test
applicable to determine the nature and extent of the corroboration is thus the
same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within
that class of offences for which corroboration is required by statute. The
language of the statute, ""implicates the accused"", compendiously
incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of practice. The
nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular
circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in high degree dangerous to
attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as
corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which
shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused
committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but
that it was committed by the accused.

The corroboration need not be direct evidence that the
accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial
evidence of his connection with the crime.

This statement has been repeatedly approved in this
Court. See, for example, Hubin v. The King 3, Thomas
v. The Queen 4 and Manos v. The Queen 5.
The learned trial judge should have directed the jury in the sense of this
passage and particularly should have made it plain to them that facts although
independently proved could not be regarded as corroborative of Chaput's
evidence if they were equally consistent with the truth of the evidence of the
appellant. As to the first of these requirements the direction of the learned
judge:—""il faut accepter le témoignage
d'un complice sous réserve."" was inadequate; as to the remaining
two nothing was said. The concluding sentence from the portions of the charge
quoted above:—""Vous vous demanderez pourquoi ce voyage dans
la nuit, qu'est-ce qui a motivé ce voyage dans la nuit, et vous vous demanderez
si là il n'y a pas une circonstance qui fortifie le témoignage du
complice."" is not helpful. It was common ground that the journey to
Rougemont was made in the night and that admitted fact was equally consistent
with the theory of the Crown and with that of the defence.

[Page 100]

The third and fourth grounds of appeal may be dealt with
together. The theory of the defence was simple enough and no elaborate
direction was called for; it was however incumbent on the learned trial judge
to point out to the jury that this theory was that the appellant drove Chaput
to Rougemont because he was asked and paid to do so and
that he was ignorant of Chaput's guilty purpose, and to tell them that they
should acquit if, on all the evidence, they entertained a reasonable doubt of
the appellant's guilt.

As to the fifth ground of appeal, the record shews that at
the conclusion of the appellant's cross-examination he was being questioned as
to the number of occasions during the night in question on which he had been
stopped and questioned by the police. The police officers had testified that
there were three such occasions and the appellant that there were only two, one
on the way to Rougemont and one on his return journey. The cross-examination
concluded as follows :—

D      Mais, vous les avez vus une deuxième
fois en revenant, arrêté dans une petite rue à Marieville?

R Non, ils m'ont arrêté seulement une fois en
descendant.

D       Et là, on vous aurait demandé
qu'est-ce que vous faisiez dans ce bout-là, qu'est-ce que vous cherchiez?

R      Non, il n'a pas été question de ça.

D      Vous leur auriez répondu : ""Je cherche mon chum qui est débarqué dans une rue, je ne le trouve
pas""?

R      Il n'a pas été question de ça.

D      Vous jurez que c'est faux?

R      Je jure ça.

D      Deux officiers de police sont venus
jurer, cet avant-midi, et vous jurez que c'est faux?

R      Moi, je dis que je les ai vus seulement
une fois en descendant.

D      Je vais vous faire arrêter pour
parjure, demain matin.

R      C'est correct.

D      Peut-être cet après-midi.

It will be observed that the last two
""questions"" by the learned counsel for the Crown are not questions at
all; they are threats or statements of his intention, which it was improper for
him to make, and the making of which before the jury could scarcely fail to
prejudice the fair trial of the accused.

[Page 101]

For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Murder—Conspiracy
to Rob—Minimum force to be used—Death by strangulation at hands of one
assailant—Liability of other—Jury, adequacy of charge—Whether furnishing jury
with transcript of part of charge prejudicial to accused—Criminal Code , ss. 69(1) ,
(2) , 260 (a), (c), 1014(2) .

The appellant with three others conspired to rob a
storekeeper. It was agreed that no weapons would be used and only the amount of
force required to overcome such resistance as might be offered. The appellant
seized the storekeeper from behind, placing a hand over his mouth and an arm
around his throat and then hit him on the head with a can of meat. The victim
was still struggling when the appellant handed him to an accomplice and started
searching for money. The only evidence of what then happened was that of the
appellant who stated his accomplice told him he had put his knee against the
storekeeper's throat. The appellant and the accomplice were both charged with
murder and tried separately. The appellant appealed his conviction.

Held by Kerwin C.J., Rand, Estey and Cartwright JJ.
(Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): 1. That the giving to the jury
of a transcript of only a portion of the trial judge's charge, which emphasized
the Crown's case but did not set out the theory of the defence, was in the
circumstances such an irregularity as to justify a new trial.

2. That a new trial should also be directed because the judge
in summarizing the law as related to the facts omitted to direct the jury that:
(a) the appellant could only be a party to the offence of murder under
s. 69 (1)  of the Criminal Code  if the jury thought that the accomplice
had committed the murder and that the appellant had

[Page 102]

aided or abetted him; (b) that under s. 69 (2)  the
appellant would be guilty only if the commission of the murder was known or
ought to have been known to him to be a probable consequence of the prosecution
of robbery.

Per Taschereau and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The
appellant on his own testimony was ready to overcome any fight put up and s.
260 (a) and (c) of the Code therefore applied and, as a
result of their combined effect and of s. 69 (1) , the killing amounted to
murder. The appellant was guilty of abetting and procuring the commission of
the crime if the strangulation was imputed to his accomplice and by virtue of
s. 260  (c) if he himself stopped the breath of the victim. The jury was
properly charged and directed and permitting it to take a portion of the
judge's charge into the jury room could not vitiate the trial. It was open to
it to ask for additional oral instructions which would have had the same result
and which not only would have been proper but imperative for the judge to
furnish.

Per Locke and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting): On the
appellant's own testimony, the nature of the agreement and the manner in which
it was executed are clear. The violence to be exerted was to be measured by the
resistance of the victim. The appellant was the first to resort to violence and
the injuries he inflicted, first alone and then with the assistance of his
accomplice, amounted to grievous bodily injury as defined under the
authorities. At that moment, both parties were then of one mind and there is
nothing to suggest that when, in order to search the premises, the appellant
handed over the victim to his accomplice, this situation was changed. The
appellant left it to his accomplice to overcome their victim, and even if the
blows then inflicted by the latter were ill-measured, the appellant is
nonetheless a party thereto. The case comes squarely under the law as laid down
in ss. 260  and 69 (1)  and is a proper one for the application of s. 1014(2) . Beard's
case [1920] A.C. 470, followed, The King v. Hughes [1924] S.C.R.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1]
affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murder. O'Halloran and
Davey JJ. A., dissented; the former would have substituted a conviction for manslaughter,
the latter, a new trial. The appellant was tried separately on a charge of
joining with three others in committing murder. In separate trials one of the
other three was convicted of murder, one acquitted and the Crown did not
proceed against the third.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—I agree with
Mr. Justice Estey.

[Page 103]

TASCHEREAU J. (dissenting):—The
charge against the appellant is:

THAT at the City of
Vancouver, on the Sixth day of January, in the year of our Lord, one thousand
nine hundred and fifty-five, he, the said Donald Keith Cathro, together with
Eng Git Lee, Chow Bew and Richard Wong, unlawfully did murder Young Gai Wah,
otherwise known as Ah Wing, against the form of the Statute in such case made
and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

He was tried by Mr. Justice
Manson and a jury, was found guilty and sentenced to death. His appeal was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia[2], O'Halloran J.A. and Davey J.A. dissenting. The
former would have substituted a verdict of manslaughter, and the latter would
have ordered a new trial. No charge was laid against Richard Wong, Eng Git Lee
was acquitted, and the present appellant and Chow Bew were found guilty. Mr.
Justice Manson granted separate trials.

The evidence reveals that on the
6th of January, 1955, the appellant was approached by Bew, whom he did not
know. Bew explained to him there was an old Chinese by the name of Ah Wing,
owner of the MacDonald Market on MacDonald Street, and that ""it would be
easy"", and in his evidence given on his own behalf, the appellant says
that he knew ""pretty well what he meant"". At nine o'clock that
night the appellant met Chow Bew, who was in a parked car with two friends in
it, namely, Eng Git Lee who was driving the car, and Richard Wong sitting in
front next to him. On the way to the restaurant, they discussed how to enter
the premises, and the appellant was told that the Chinese had $5,000 in his
store. They were familiar with the place where the money was, because two of
them had been there previously to change a large bill, and Ah Wing had gone to
the back of the store to make the change for them. The appellant was also told
that the Chinese was an elderly man and ""that there would be no trouble
about it"". He was informed ""that there would be no violence"" and
that none of his companions ""had any weapons or any club or anything of
that kind"". He nevertheless said that if the Chinaman ""put up a
fight"", ""he was going to do just what he did"", and ""that
whatever fight the old man would put up he was ready to overcome it"".

[Page 104]

When they arrived at the
restaurant, they parked their automobile across the street, waiting for the
shop to close. They then moved the car around the corner and the appellant went
in first. Several customers came in and left, and the appellant bought a
""coke"" and some other minor articles. The appellant helped Ah Wing to
find a dentist's address and, as planned, when Bew came in, he asked the
deceased for a can of meat, and when the Chinaman went to the back of the store
to get the meat, the appellant put his arm around him and ""took him into
the backroom"". Chow Bew unlocked the backdoor and put out the lights. A
struggle ensued and the appellant told him that if he did not keep quiet he
would hurt him. The deceased kept making a noise, so the appellant hit him on
the head with a can of meat, and Wing started to yell putting up a good fight.

The appellant told Bew to get a
flashlight and Chow Bew hit Wing with it. Bew tried to ""wad"" a cloth
in the deceased's mouth so to stop him from yelling, but without success. The
appellant then told Bew to hold the Chinese while he would look around for the
money. The Chinaman was lying on the floor. They took a few bills from his
pockets and when they heard somebody coming at the front door, they ran out
through the back door to the waiting car.

The medical evidence reveals that
the deceased had a minor cut over the right eye, scratch on the lips, a cut on
the right side of the tongue from which there had been some bleeding. The skin
of the chin and upper neck had a rubbed appearance, as though a rough cloth had
been rubbed across the skin and there were several abrasions on the right side
of the neck. The examination of the throat showed hemorrhage or bruising into
the muscles of the neck. There was a fracture of the voice box with hemorrhage.
There was obviously strangulation, and the pressure applied to the neck must
have been very severe in order to fracture the voice box.

In his evidence given on his own
behalf, the appellant swears that the deceased was alive when Bew ""took
charge of him"". Very soon after, the four companions were arrested down
town by the police, after the deceased had been found dead in his shop. They
were in possession of

[Page 105]

an old cigar box, that belonged
to the deceased, in which there was a small amount of money. The appellant
admits that he agreed with Bew, Lee and Wong to join in the robbery of the
grocery store operated by Wing.

The appellant now appeals to this
Court alleging that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,
in dismissing the appeal is erroneous and ought to be set aside on the
following grounds:—

1. In not holding that the
learned trial judge failed to present the defence to the jury fairly, fully and
adequately, in a way that would have brought out its full force and effect, and
particularly in failing to fully and properly direct the jury as to a possible
verdict of manslaughter.

2. The learned trial judge
permitted the jury during their deliberations to take with them into the jury-room
a transcript of a portion of his charge, said transcript containing a powerful exposition
of the Crown's case, and including misdirection upon the law to which the
defence counsel had objected, and remarks which directed the jury's attention
to weaknesses in the defence, and not containing that part of the charge in
which the learned trial judge explained the case for the defence to the jury.

3. The learned trial judge
told the jury that a verdict of guilty, by the exercise of executive clemency,
may not result in the carrying out of the death sentence.

4. The learned trial judge
misdirected the jury on evaluating credibility and on determining the weight of
evidence, particularly by repeated reference to the interest of the appellant
in the verdict.

5. The learned trial judge
erred in curtailing cross—examination of the Crown witness Det. Sgt.
McCullough.

6. The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that their verdict ""must be unanimous"" and
""must be arrived at"" without also saying ""if you can agree upon
a verdict"".

For the purpose of the
determination of this case, it will be necessary to deal only with grounds 1, 2
and 4, as there has been no dissent in the Court of Appeal on grounds 3, 5 and
6, and no special leave to appeal has been granted on these points.

It is clear as revealed by
appellant's own evidence that he, with the others, joined a conspiracy with a
common intention to commit robbery, and that although the appellant was
told that there would be no violence, he was ready to overcome any fight that
the Chinaman would put, and that he was also prepared to do just what he has
done. It is also in evidence that when the robbery was planned between the
appellant and the others, the fear of trouble from neighbours was discussed,
and in his statement to the Police of January 10, 1955, he said he knew

[Page 106]

that the beauty-parlor next door,
""was run by two women"", and that they would ""give no
trouble"". This, to my mind, is a clear indication of what the intention of
the appellant and the others was.

The law on the matter is clear,
and s-ss. (a) and (c) of s. 260  of the Criminal Code  find
here their application. These section and sub-sections are to the effect that
in case of treason, piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody,
resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery,
burglary or arson, culpable homicide is also murder, whether the offender means
or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to ensue, if the
offender meant to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of any of the above mentioned offences, or if by
any means he wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes
above mentioned, and death ensues.

I have no hesitation in reaching
the conclusion that as a result of the combined effect of s. 260  (a), (c)
Cr. C. and of s. 69 (1) Cr. C. the killing of the Chinaman amounts to murder.
As stated above, it is in evidence that death was due to strangulation. It is
also my opinion that the jury could not reasonably find, in view of the
evidence, that the two assailants were not prepared to inflict grievous bodily
injury, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the offence of
robbery. In such a case, it is immaterial that they meant or not death to
ensue, or knew or not that death would likely ensue.

It necessarily follows that by
virtue of s. 69 (1)  Cr. C., the appellant is guilty of the offence for abetting
and procuring the commission of the crime, if the strangulation is imputed to
Bew, and by virtue of s. 260  (c) if he himself stopped the breath of the
victim. In my opinion, there was no room for a verdict of manslaughter, and it
was unnecessary for the trial judge in his charge to the jury to deal with this
feature of the case. It is, therefore, quite irrelevant if his instructions on
this point were inadequate. It was not necessary for the judge, as stated in Manchuk
v. The King [3], to
tell them that if as a result of the evidence as a whole, they were in
reasonable doubt

[Page 107]

whether the crime was murder or
manslaughter, they should convict of manslaughter. Nothing in the evidence
would justify a verdict of manslaughter.

The case of Rex v. Hughes
[4]
has no application. In that case, the learned trial judge told the jurors that
the only possible verdict could be murder or acquittal, and completely eliminated
the possible verdict of manslaughter. There were evidence however to show that
the shot that killed Hughes went off accidentally, and it was found by this
Court that it could not be said as a matter of law that this was an act of
violence done by the accused in furtherance of, or in the course of the crime
of robbery as held by the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Beard [5] and in Rex
v. Elnick [6].
Moreover, the law as it stood at the time of the Hughes decision given in 1942,
was not the same as it is now, as s. 260  was amended in 1947 (Statutes of
Canada, c. 55, articles 6 and 7) to cover the Hughes case, and paragraph (d)
was added to the section.

I believe that the jury were
properly charged, in view of ss. 260  (a). (c) and 69 (1) Cr. C.
It has been argued that the jury should have been instructed that the act done
was the probable consequence of the common purpose, and that it was known, or
ought to have been known to the appellant that such consequence was probable.
Sections 260  (a) (c) and 69 (1)  Cr. C. negative these
propositions, and I do not think they can prevail. They have their foundation
on ss. 69  (d) and 69 (2)  of the Criminal Code , but they totally ignore
s. 260  (a) and (c), which clearly hold one or the other liable
although he did not mean death to ensue, and also s. 69 (1) . A party to an
offence is a person who not only counsels, but abets or procures
another to commit a crime. Such is the present case, and it is immaterial
therefore that the appellant knew or ought to have known that the death of Ah
Wing by strangulation, was a probable consequence of the prosecution of the
common purpose.

If the opposite view should
prevail, and if a new trial were ordered, I cannot imagine how the trial judge
could logically instruct the jury. He would of course have to

[Page 108]

tell them that under s. 260  (c)
Cr. C., in case of robbery, culpable homicide is murder whether the
offender means or not death to ensue, if he wilfully stops the breath of
the deceased. He would also have to instruct them, by virtue of s. 69 (2) , that
if the accused knew or ought to have known that the killing of the
victim was a probable consequence of the common purpose, he was guilty of
murder. That, to my mind, would constitute a flagrant contradiction. Section 69
(2) , I think, contemplates an entirely different case. It would apply, for
instance, if two persons formed the common intention of committing the crime of
forgery, and one of the offenders killed a police officer with a hidden weapon,
the possession of which was unknown to the other. In such a case, it could
surely be said as an excuse; that he did not know or ought not to have known
that the killing was a probable consequence of the common purpose of forgery.

I also believe that the fourth
ground of error raised by the appellant is unfounded. It is my view that the
learned trial judge properly directed the jury in evaluating credibility, and
in determining the weight of evidence.

The last ground of appeal raised,
and on which there was a dissent, is that the learned trial judge allowed the
jury during their deliberations, to take with them into the jury—room a
transcript of a portion of his charge. I do not think that this can vitiate in
any way the trial. It is open to the jury to ask for whatever information they
desire, and instead of being furnished with a part of the written address, they
could have asked the trial judge for additional oral instructions which would
have had the same result, and it would have been not only proper, but imperative
upon the judge to furnish all this information. That the additional
instructions were written instead of verbal, does not appear to me to have the
effect of invalidating the verdict.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RAND J.: — The ground of dissent in which O'Halloran and
Davey JJ.A. concurred was this. At the request of the jury, a transcript of a
portion of the charge was furnished them which they retained during their
deliberation;

[Page 109]

it consisted in large measure of
a forceful statement of the Crown's case and, in the opinion of these justices,
it so overshadowed the defence as to obscure it.

The essence of the latter was
that the death had been caused by an offence which was not ""a probable
consequence"" in the prosecution of the robbery as required by s. 69 (2)  of
the Criminal Code , a requirement which seems to differentiate our law in
respect of joint wrongdoers from that of England. The accused took the stand
and gave evidence to the effect that the death could only have been caused
while he was searching the premises for the money and the deceased was in the
hands of the accomplice Bew. In the light of the violence of the force applied
as indicated by its effects on the larynx, its mode of application was
suggested by an alleged remark of Bew to the accused that he had put his knee
on the victim's throat. It was also asserted by the accused that it had been
expressly agreed that no force would be used beyond preventing the outcry of a
small man of 65 years who was considered, apparently, to be unable to put up
much resistance. Admittedly there were no weapons, although the accused, who
for the first minute or so had tried to smother the noise by putting his right
arm around the neck of the deceased and his left hand over his mouth, had
struck the latter on the head with a can picked up in the shop, a blow which
could have been found to have played no part in inflicting the ""grievous
bodily harm"" or in the death. The truth of the whole or any part of this
account, which is the only evidence of what actually took place in the shop,
was for the jury. It was likewise for them, in the event of their believing it
and in the light of the evidence as a whole, uninfluenced by overemphasis on
any feature of it, to say whether the infliction of the grievous bodily harm or
the strangulation by Bew was a ""probable consequence"" of the
prosecution of the robbery. I am unable to say that the jury could not have
found that it was not. They might equally have entertained a reasonable doubt
that it was. They could, on the other hand, have come to the conclusion that
the act either of that harm or strangulation was such a probability, but that
determination was for them.

[Page 110]

I cannot agree, however, with
O'Halloran J.A. that in this aspect we can substitute a verdict of
manslaughter. S. 69 (2)  means, in my opinion, this: the offence, here the
culpable homicide under either paras. (a) or (c) of s. 260 , which
must be a ""probable consequence"" of carrying out the criminal plan of
several persons, in this case robbery, must be such as severs the connection of
the person not otherwise associated with it than by the original scheme. The
accused and his companion, Bew, undoubtedly intended force to be applied to
their victim; but was there such an excess in mode or degree as converted it
into an act and an offence so outrageous or so unforeseeable as to be beyond
the scope of probable consequence? On that question—which, by the charge, had
been placed in doubtful adequacy before the jury—the transcript could easily
have been the decisive factor.

I agree, therefore, with the
dissenting justices and would order a new trial.

ESTEY J.:—The appellant's
conviction for murder was affirmed by a majority of the learned judges in the
Appellate Court of British Columbia. Mr. Justice O'Halloran, dissenting, would
have substituted a verdict of manslaughter, while Mr. Justice Davey, also
dissenting, would have awarded a new trial.

The appellant, in giving evidence
on his own behalf, admitted that he, Chow Bew and two others, in the afternoon
of January 6, 1955, had agreed to rob the deceased Ah Wing that night
at his store in Vancouver. About 9:30 that evening the four proceeded in an
automobile and parked at a place near the store of the deceased. Ah Wing was a
Chinaman about sixty-five years of age whom they referred to as an old man who
would not offer much resistance. Though they were without weapons, they were
prepared to exercise physical strength in order to overcome such resistance as
the deceased might offer. Only two of the four entered the store and, while in
the course of their intent to rob, such force was applied to the person of the
deceased, by the appellant and Chow Bew or one of them, as to cause his death.

The appellant admitted that, as
arranged, he entered the store first and in a matter of minutes Chow Bew

[Page 111]

entered. When there were no
customers present the appellant asked the deceased for a can of meat which he
knew would be toward the back of the store. In order to obtain this can the
deceased turned his back upon the appellant, who thereupon put his hand over
his mouth and an arm around his neck. At the same time Chow Bew put out the
lights, locked the front and opened the back door. They were in the store
approximately ten minutes and at some point appellant handed the deceased over
to Chow Bew. At that time, the appellant deposed, the deceased was struggling
and endeavouring to make a noise and was doing the same when later, while Chow
Bew was still holding him, the appellant searched his person for money. The appellant
further stated that when Chow Bew took over the deceased he searched the
premises for money and, as the store was in darkness, he did not know what Chow
Bew was doing to the deceased and, because of their understanding that they
would not cause serious bodily harm to the deceased, he neither knew nor ought
to have known that the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon, or the wilful
stopping of the breath of Ah Wing was a probable consequence of what Chow Bew
did to the deceased.

Under s. 260 of the Criminal
Code , so far as its provisions are relevant to the facts in this case, one
in the course of committing a robbery will be guilty of murder, whether he knew
or ought to have known that death was likely to ensue, if he means to inflict
grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the
robbery and death ensues, or if he, by any means, wilfully stops the breath of
a person in order to facilitate the commission of the offence and death ensues
from such stoppage. Under this section it was open to the jury to find that the
appellant's participation was such that he was guilty of murder.

However, the main contentions
advanced on behalf of the appellant were that Chow Bew had inflicted the fatal
injury (although based on what the appellant alleged had been told him by Bew)
and that he was not a party to the murder as a participant under s. 260, nor
was he made so by virtue of the provisions of s-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 69 . Under
s-s. (1) (s. 69 ), if the appellant did or omitted

[Page 112]

some act for the purpose of
aiding Chow Bew to commit the offence of murder, or abetted Chow Bew in the
commission of that offence, the jury might find the appellant guilty of murder.
It was, however, the contention on behalf of the appellant that, however much
he may have aided and abetted in the commission of the robbery, he never did
aid or abet, or in any way assist Chow Bew in the commission of the murder
within the meaning of s. 69 (1) .

Under s-s. (2) (s. 69 ), if, as
here, the appellant and Chow Bew had formed a common intention to rob Ah Wing
and, while assisting each other in the prosecution of that robbery, Chow Bew
murdered Ah Wing, the appellant would be a party to the offence of murder if
the commission thereof was, or ought to have been known by him to be a probable
consequence of the prosecution of such robbery. I agree with the appellant that
these subsections ought to have been explained in such a manner that the jury
would understand the difference between the two and the respective effects
thereof in relation to the facts as adduced in evidence.

There was evidence in support of
issues under the foregoing sections which counsel for both parties apparently
discussed and certainly were dealt with by the learned trial judge in the
course of his charge. The learned trial judge, at the outset of his charge,
explained the functions of the jury, presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt
and other matters, and then devoted approximately twelve pages to a discussion
of the relevant statute law, including the foregoing ss. 260  and 69 . In the
course thereof he selected the relevant portions of the sections and, in
illustrating their general effect, referred to parts of the evidence.
Thereafter in about eighteen pages, he discussed the evidence as given by the
respective witnesses. At the end thereof, and before discussing the evidence
and the issues raised on behalf of the appellant, the learned judge deemed it
advisable to summarize the law that he had explained in the earlier part of his
charge.

I am in agreement with the
learned trial judge that where, as here, he had discussed the law, with some
reference to the facts, followed by a rather lengthly review of the evidence,
the law should be restated and summarized

[Page 113]

in relation to the facts in a
manner to enable the jury to appreciate the issues upon which they had to
decide. That the law should be so related to the facts has often been a matter
of discussion in the decided cases, not only in this, but in other courts, and
more recently in this Court in Azoulay v. The Queen [7].
It may be added that this can seldom be accomplished by first a discussion of
the law followed by a review of the evidence, unless there is some restatement,
or summary, that will relate the law and the facts, as contemplated under the
authorities. It would seem, and with great respect to the learned trial judge,
that in his summary these two sub-sections of s. 69  were not sufficiently
distinguished in relation to the facts. In particular, the summary did not
include a statement to the effect that the appellant could only be a party to
the offence of murder under s-s (1) of s. 69  if the jury thought Chow Bew had
committed the murder and the appellant had aided or abetted Chow Bew in the
commission of the murder, and that under s-s. (2) of s. 69  the appellant would
be guilty only if the commission of the murder was known or ought to have been
known by him to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of the robbery.
These omissions were upon matters so vital in this prosecution as to largely
nullify the purpose of the summary. Indeed the remarks of my Lord the Chief
Justice (then Kerwin J.) are particularly appropriate:

However, while the general
statement of the law of conspiracy made by the trial Judge may be unimpeachable,
it was of the utmost importance in this case that the application of the law to
the facts should be explained fully to the jury, particularly so far as the
evidence relating to Carson's activities was concerned. Forsythe v. The
King [8].

It would, therefore, seem that
because of these omissions the law was not related to the facts in respect of
these vital issues, as required by the authorities. Moreover, from the
appellant's point of view, these omissions prevented his case being fully
presented to the jury. It, therefore, follows that a new trial must be
directed. There were a number of other points raised with respect to the
charge, but, inasmuch as there must be a new trial in which many of these may
never arise, it seems unnecessary that they should be here discussed.

[Page 114]

I am also in agreement with Mr.
Justice Davey that giving to the jury a portion of the learned trial judge's
charge constituted, in the circumstances, such an irregularity as to justify a
new trial. At the conclusion of the learned trial judge's address the jury
retired and were recalled when the learned judge supplemented the instructions
he had already given. At the conclusion thereof the foreman of the jury
requested a copy of the remarks made by his Lordship with respect to the law
prior to the hearing of any of the witnesses. When his Lordship intimated that
such would have to be considered in the light of his further instructions, the
foreman stated: ""Maybe we could have the section you read this
morning."" The word ""section"" had reference to that portion of
the learned judge's charge dealing more particularly with the law. While
counsel for the Crown concurred, counsel for the defence at once pointed out
that this section contained a direction which the learned judge had supplemented
in his further instructions and, notwithstanding that his Lordship stated that
he would repeat the additional remarks in handing this portion to the jury,
counsel for the appellant said he could not consent to this portion of the
charge being handed to the jury. His Lordship felt that he should accede to the
request of the jury and accordingly that portion of his charge dealing with the
law, with such reference to the evidence as he deemed appropriate to explain
and illustrate the respective sections, was extended and placed in the hands of
the jury, together with the comment repeated by the learned trial judge as
above mentioned.

At the conclusion of the portion
so extended his Lordship dealt at length with the evidence and made some
further observations with respect to the law. This latter part constituted a
larger portion of the charge than that handed to the jury. It is well
established that a charge must be considered as a whole. With this in mind, it
seems impossible to conclude otherwise than that the jury, in the course of
their deliberations, would inevitably give more weight to the portion
transcribed than to that part which they had heard but verbally expressed in
the court room. Moreover, in this particular case there was that portion which
counsel for the defence had discussed at the

[Page 115]

end of the learned trial judge's
charge and upon which the learned judge made further comment, which he repeated
to the jury as he handed them the typewritten portion. It would, therefore,
seem, as a matter of principle, that a part of a charge should not be handed to
the jury.

No case was cited in support of
such a portion being handed to the jury. There are jurisdictions in the United States
where the practice of delivering a copy of the judge's charge to the jury is
recognized by statute. In other jurisdictions it seems to be permissible, even
without a statute, and in that country there is authority for the giving of a
copy of a penal section of the law to the jury, but there does not seem to be any
decision which would support the view that a substantial portion of the charge
could be delivered to the jury.

It may be that a section of the Code,
or even a small passage of a learned trial judge's charge, with the consent of
counsel concerned, may be handed to the jury, but even then the question must
remain whether, in the circumstances, there has been prejudice or miscarriage
of justice. Where, however, as here, the transcribed part of the charge
contains important references to the evidence and contentions made on behalf of
the Crown, and but slight reference to the evidence and none to the contentions
on behalf of the defence, there can be no doubt but that the giving of such a
portion to the jury ought not to be permitted.

The learned trial judge, discussing
the duty of the jury to arrive at a fair and just conclusion, warned them that
sympathy ought not to be a factor in their deliberations and went on to call
their attention to the fact that sympathy might have a place in a consideration
of executive clemency. At the conclusion of his charge counsel for the defence
took the position that from his Lordship's remarks with respect to executive
clemency the jury might conclude that he was of the opinion that this was a
case in which a conviction should be found and executive clemency exercised.
The learned trial judge, as a result of this comment, dealt further with it in
his supplementary instructions to the jury and stated that he was not in any
way suggesting what their verdict should be, or any view on his part that an
""occasion might arise for an application for such clemency."" Sir
Lyman Duff, in commenting upon a reference

[Page 116]

to executive clemency in the
course of a charge to the jury, described such as ""unfortunate"" and
concluded his remarks as follows:

Such a reference could not
assist the jury in performing their duty to decide the issue of fact before
them, and there is always some risk that a suggestion that the verdict is to be
reviewed may result in some abatement of the deep sense of responsibility with
which a jury ought to be brought to regard their duty in passing upon any
criminal charge, and, preeminently, when the offence charged is murder, to
which the law attaches the capital penalty. McLean v. The King [9].

In this case the Court concluded
that no substantial harm or miscarriage resulted and, in view of the fact that
here a new trial is directed, it is unnecessary to do more than to repeat the
warning expressed by Sir Lyman Duff.

The appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—I agree
with my brothers Taschereau and Fauteux and would dismiss this appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J.:—For the reasons
given by my brothers Rand and Estey I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and direct a new trial.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—On the
6th of January, 1955, at the city of Vancouver, Ah Wing, a grocer of about
sixty-five years of age, was murdered in his store while resisting the
commission of a robbery perpetrated actually by both the appellant and one Chow
Bew, pending which their accomplices stood ready, outside of the store, for the
flight in an automobile; intending thereafter to share amongst themselves five
thousand dollars of savings anticipated by them to be found in possession of their
victim.

Cathro and Bew each had a
separate trial and were found guilty of murder. These verdicts were upheld by
majority judgments of the Court of Appeal. We are only concerned here with the
case of Cathro.

The substance of the principal
grounds of appeal, upon which there was a dissent, is related to the
instructions of the trial Judge.

[Page 117]

I agree with Robertson and Bird
JJ.A., that a verdict of manslaughter was not open to the jury in this case.
Furthermore and—assuming the presence of certain illegalities—on a careful
consideration of the evidence, and particularly of the testimony falling from
the very lips of the appellant, who was the only one of the group to testify, I
also agree with these two members of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia
that this is a proper case, if any, for the application of section 1014(2) .

In Beard's case [10],
it was proved that there was a violent struggle in which the accused
overpowered a child and stifled her cries by putting his hand over her mouth
and pressing his thumb upon her throat, the acts which, in her weakened state
resulting from the struggle, killed her. This, the House of Lords held, was
murder, although the accused had no intention of causing death. In this
country, as stated at page 524, by the then Chief Justice of this Court, Sir
Lyman Duff, who delivered the uananimous judgment for the Court, in The King
v. Hughes et al[11],
""a charge arising out of circumstances such as those considered in the Beard's
case, would be disposed of under the law laid down in s. 260  of the Criminal
Code ."" The parts of this section relevant to the present case read:—

260. In case of …robbery …culpable
homicide is also murder, whether the offender means or not death to ensue, or
knows or not that death is likely to ensue.

(a) if he means to
inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission
of any of the offences in this section mentioned, …and death ensues from such
injury; or

 ***

(c) if he by any
means wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes
aforesaid, and death ensues from such stopping of the breath.

Were there, in this case, but a
single offender implicated in the robbery and the material facts leading to the
death of Ah Wing, a verdict of murder could be the only proper one which a
reasonable jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could render; for
the proof of the constituent elements of the substantive offence created under
s. 260  is beyond doubt; death did ensue from grievous bodily injury meant and inflicted
for the purpose of facilitating the commission of robbery.

[Page 118]

However, because there is, in the
present case, a plurality of offenders, and though both Cathro and Bew, acting
individually as well as together, had a hand in the infliction of violence to
advance their criminal and common purpose, the following submission is made, in
the present appeal, on behalf of Cathro. The original agreement, it is
contended, was that there would be no violence; strangulation, which was the
cause of death, might, on one view of the medical evidence, have resulted from
the acts of violence which Cathro—through evidence of doubtful admissibility—attempts
to ascribe to Bew, rather than from the acts of violence which he admitted
having committed; the acts of Bew would then be beyond the scope of the
agreement; with the consequence that Cathro, having had, directly or by
complicity, no part in the infliction of the fatal injury, could not be held
guilty under s. 260 .

The agreement. Of the agreement
there is no other evidence than (i) what Cathro said it was and (ii) what, from
the subsequent conduct of the parties in the store, as related by Cathro, is to
be deduced.

(i) There was, of course, a clear
agreement to rob the store owner of the five thousand dollars of savings he was
estimated by them to possess. As to the means to be used to achieve this end,
Cathro, in his examination in chief, says:—

On the way to the store,
they more or less discussed the situation, told me what it was all about, the
other surrounding buildings, they said he was an old man and there wouldn't be
no trouble, there was no necessity of any violence.

And later he repeats:—

A Yes, I asked them if they
had any weapon, anything to hit him with, or anything, and they said: No, there
wasn't, there was no need of it.

Q And no such thing was
carried?

A We understood before we
went out there, that there would be no violence.

Whether this is tantamount to a
restrictive agreement as to the means or rather to a simple understanding as to
the anticipated measure of means to be used in the circumstances, it rested on
an alleged expectancy that there would be no trouble, no necessity for
violence. However, at no time, during the preparation of the plan,—or its
actual execution, as will be seen later—was an abandonment of 

[Page 119]

the plan followed by an immediate
withdrawal from the premises, even thought of as being the conduct to adopt in
the event of resistance and necessity for violence arising and developing, as
indeed it did to culminate into death. On the contrary, on Cathro's own
evidence, notwithstanding his declaration that he had no intention to hurt,
what was then to be done, failing the materialization of the expectancy, was
not left in doubt. Pressed, in cross-examination, Cathro admitted the
expectation of a fight and, on his understanding of the plan, the degree of
violence to be then used upon Ah Wing was to be measured by the degree of
resistance opposed by their victim to the fulfilment of their common aim:—

Q Well now, it is perfectly
plain that if you had put up a fight for six hundred dollars (the biggest
amount Cathro said he once had), the old Chinaman was to put up a fight for
five thousand dollars?

A Yes.

Q Well, what were you going
to do if he did?

A Hold him.

Q And you were to apply
whatever force was necessary to silence him?

A Not necessarily.

 *** 

Q And if he had put up a
fight, you would have to put up a fight also?

A Well to a certain extent.

 *** 

Q Well, just answer the
question now. Wasn't that the situation, whatever fight that old man put up,
you were there to overcome it?

A Yes, sir.

Q And that is what you did,
isn't it?

A Yes, sir.

This evidence does not exclude
grievous bodily injury, if needed in the judgment of either of the parties to
the agreement.

(ii) The subsequent conduct of
the parties. At closing hours, the appellant went in the store first to be
followed thereafter by Bew. Each in turn bought soft drinks. The last customer
having departed, Cathro went to the back of the store and asked the owner for a
can of meat. The latter turned his back in order to fetch this object; Cathro
grabbed him from behind, put an arm around his neck and the hand of the other
on his mouth. Meanwhile Bew locked 

[Page 120]

the front door, opened the back
door and put out the lights. Examined in chief, he then, in a rather dimmed
recital of the facts, proceeds to say:—

I then—the Chinaman was
making quite a bit of noise, trying to struggle. I told him to keep quiet or I
would have to hurt him, more or less as a threat. He kept making noise, so I
hit him with the can, not intending to hurt him at all, more or less to scare
him. He made more noise than ever.

Q Where did you hit him? A
High on the head.

Q How many times did you hit
him? A Once.

Q Then what happened? A
Well, I had seen a flashlight before the lights had gone out. Billy, who had
been looking around, I told him to get the flashlight so he could see better.
Instead of putting the flashlight on, he hit the man with it, which I told him
to stop and get something to put in his mouth. I heard some cloth tearing. He
tried to put something in his mouth and it didn't seem to work, it was much too
thick, he was still making noise.

Q Go on.

A I then asked Chow Bew to
hold him while I looked around.

Cathro then went to the bedroom
where he found rolls of coins underneath the bed, then to the till which he
emptied and returned to the back room. At the request of Bew, who was with Ah
Wing then lying down on the floor, he searched the pockets of the victim and
obtained a few bills. Asked by Bew how much money he had, Cathro answered,
""Very little"". At the suggestion of Bew, he then went for further
searches in the back room in which he was when somebody knocked at the door,
whereupon both fled immediately. In cross-examination, Cathro testifies:—

Q Well, how could you stuff
this cloth in his throat, or how could you expect to stuff this cloth in his
throat if you took your hand off his mouth, even for an instant, without him
making such an outcry that the whole neighborhood would hear?

A Just what I was saying, I
was holding him, I had my arm around him and his head back, at the same time he
was putting the cloth in his mouth.

Q At that time you had your
hand off his mouth, didn't you?

A When the cloth was trying
to be forced in.

Q How were you silencing him
then?

A He did yell then, that is
why I say it didn't work.

Q Well nobody next door
heard it through this partition?

A It doesn't appear that
way.

Q Why did you let him yell?

A Trying to put that cloth
in his mouth.

Q I didn't ask that, I asked
why did you let him yell?

A What else was I going to
do when he tried to put something in his mouth.

[Page 121]

Q You could just put the
pressure on his throat with your good right arm, couldn't you?

A I guess so.

Q And that is what you did,
didn't you?

A I might have put some
pressure on his throat.

Q If the man didn't yell you
would have to?

A The man was yelling after
that.

***

Q Well, I'm suggesting that
you would have to render him unconscious before you transferred him over to
Chow Bew? Now, what do you say about that?

A The man was not
unconscious.

Q Or practically so?

A No, he was yelling,
putting up a fairly good fight, yet fairly active.

Cathro is referred to the small
cut over the right eyebrow, scrapes of the lips, cut on the tongue from which
there had been some bleeding in the mouth, the rubbed appearance of the skin of
the chin and of the neck and abrasions on the right side of the neck of the
victim, and asked:—

Q Actually you didn't know
how much pressure you used on that man's neck, do you?

A I never used very much
pressure.

Q Well, you don't know what
you did in the excitement there, do you?

A Not in complete detail,
no.

And as to the moment at which the
victim went on the floor, the evidence of Cathro is:—

Q At what stage did the old
fellow get down on the floor?

A When I was turning him
over to Chow Bew, I guess.

***

Later:—

Q At what stage did you get
the old man down on the floor?

A I don't know exactly.

Q Wasn't it a fact that he
just fell down?

A No, he didn't fall down.

THE COURT: Q He didn't fall
down?

A Not that I know of.

Q Well, he got there
ultimately, didn't he?

A He was on the floor when I
went through his left front pocket, the one I could get at.

Q And unconscious then too,
wasn't he?

A Not to my knowledge.

Q Well, did he struggle when
you were rifling his pockets? 

A He might have, but the
other man was holding him.

Q He was not gagged though?

A Not to my knowledge, no.

[Page 122]

On Cathro's own story:—he was the
first to resort to violence in the manner planned for; he grabbed his victim
from behind, he held him in a manner, known to him to permit strangulation; he
hit him on the head with a meat can; both he and Bew, notwithstanding their
combined strength, unsuccessfully attempted gagging. And it is then that Cathro
turned Ah Wing over to Bew, with the implied request to take responsibility for
the means to be adopted in order to permit him to search the premises, and
later their victim, for the money.

As to the law. If death, whether
intended, anticipated or not, ensues as a consequence of grievous bodily
injury, meant and inflicted for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a
robbery, the offence, under s. 260  standing alone, is murder. Under s. 69 (1)
of the Criminal Code , every one is party to such offence who actually
commits it, or whose conduct, in relation to its commission by another, comes
within the description of either one of sub-paragraphs (b), (c)
or (d) of paragraph 1  of section 69  reading:—

69 (1). Every one is a party
to and guilty of an offence who

(a) actually commits
it;

(b) does or omits an
act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person
in commission of the offence; or

(d) counsels or
procures any person to commit the offence.

The fatal injury, in this case,
was inflicted either by the appellant or by Bew. On the first hypothesis,
Cathro is guilty of murder. On the second, Cathro is a party to murder under
section 69 (1) . For, on the two hypotheses, the evidence does not permit
doubting either that the fatal injury was meant and inflicted for the purpose
of facilitating the commission of the robbery in which both were engaged, or
that, on Cathro's own evidence, both were at one mind as to the purpose and the
means of their common plan, as made and as executed. In such circumstances,
this case comes squarely under the law laid down in s. 260  and s. 69 (1)  of the
Criminal Code . As defined, ""bodily harm becomes grievous whenever
it seriously interferes with health or even comfort. It is not necessary that
its effects should be dangerous or that they should be permanent.""
(Roscoe's Criminal Evidence 16th ed. p. 631; Russell

[Page 123]

On Crime, 10th ed. Vol. 1, p. 690; Archbold's Criminal
Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 32nd ed. p. 968; Harris and Wilshere's Criminal
Law, 17th ed. p. 282; Rex v. Cox [12];
Rex v. Ashman [13].
Before he transferred him over to Bew, the violence which Cathro himself, first
alone and then with the assistance of Bew, exerted upon Ah Wing, comes within
that definition; hence Cathro and Bew were then at one mind as to inflicting
grievous bodily injury. And there is nothing to suggest that, from the moment
of transfer—when, in Cathro's own words, Ah Wing was still ""yelling,
putting up a fairly good fight, yet, fairly active yet"", there was a modification
in the mind of either party with respect to the flexible rule by which the
degree of violence had to be measured. From then on, Cathro relied on Bew to
overcome the resistance or yelling of Ah Wing. The evidence does not show that
Bew did more than was necessary for that purpose; even if the fatal blow was
ill-measured, Cathro, under s. 69 (1) , is none the less party thereto.

Assuming that the grounds of
appeal, upon the consideration of which we have jurisdiction to enter, might be
decided in favour of the appellant, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal allowed,
conviction quashed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Murder—Death
resulting from robbery by violence at hands of accused or an accomplice—Whether
proof of intent to kill necessary—Criminal Code , ss. 69 (2) , 260  (a), (c).

The appellant charged with three others of murder, tried
separately and convicted, appealed on the ground among others that the jury as
charged could reasonably have believed that it was entitled to convict of
murder under s. 260  (a) or (c) of the Criminal Code 
without proof of intent to kill and apart from s. 69 (2) .

Held: 1. That upon a charge of murder based on s. 260  (a)
or (c) proof of intent to kill is not necessary, nor is it when s. 69
(2)  is invoked.

2. (Cartwright J. dissenting): That the charge upon this
aspect of the matter was sufficient.

3. (By Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.):
That it was not necessary that the jury be charged as to the defence of
manslaughter since there was no evidence upon which such a defence could be
based.

Per Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: There was
evidence from which the jury might properly infer that the appellant and his
companion meant to inflict grievous bodily injury to the deceased and had aided
and abetted each other in doing so for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of robbery and that death had ensued. Such an offence is murder as
defined by s. 260  whether they or either of them meant or knew that death was
likely to ensue. In such circumstances it would be a matter of indifference
which inflicted the fatal injury since each was liable for the other's act. The
appellant might also be found guilty of murder if the jury inferred that a
common intention had been formed by the appellant and his associates to rob the
deceased and to assist each other in doing so and that the killing was an
offence which ought to have been known to the appellant to be a probable
consequence of such common purpose.

Per Cartwright J. (dissenting): The jury should have
been instructed, that if they concluded from the evidence that the violence was
inflicted by the appellant's companion alone, they could find the appellant
guilty only if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt: (i) that it was
in fact a probable consequence of the prosecution of the common purpose of the
appellant and his accomplice to rob the deceased that the accomplice, for the
purpose of facilitating the robbery, would intentionally inflict grievous
bodily injury on the deceased or would wilfully stop his breath, and (ii) that
it was known or ought to have

[Page 125]

been known to the appellant that such consequence was
probable. While on the evidence it was open to a properly instructed jury to so
find, the jury was not adequately instructed on this vital matter.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1955)
112 Can. C. C. 180, affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1]
affirming, the appellant's conviction for murder. O'Halloran J.A. dissenting,
would have set aside the murder conviction, substituted a verdict of
manslaughter and imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment.

In separate trials one of the
other three was convicted of murder, one acquitted and the Crown did not
proceed against the third.

F. G. P. Lewis for the
accused, appellant.

L. H. Jackson and W. G.
Burke-Robertson, Q.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is
based upon five grounds of dissent taken by Mr. Justice O'Halloran in the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia[2]. As to numbers two, three and five, I am of opinion
that the charge of the trial judge is not open to the objections raised. These
are as follows:—

(2) Upon the charge as given
them the jury could reasonably believe they were entitled to convict of murder
under Code s. 260 (a) and (c) without proof of intent to
kill and apart from Code s. 69(2).

(3) The jury were not
instructed that proof of intent to kill was essential under Code s.
69(2) upon the evidence before them, in order to convict of murder.

(5) The instructions upon
reasonable doubt did not bring home to the jury the distinction between the
proof required in a criminal case of murder vis-à-vis manslaughter contrasted
with that required in a civil case.

Numbers one and four may be considered
together:—

(1) The Learned Judge
omitted to put the defence of manslaughter adequately before the Jury and
nowhere in the charge was the defence of manslaughter put in such a way that
the Jury would realize that manslaughter vis-à-vis murder was the transcendent
issue for them to decide.

(4) No mention of
manslaughter was found at pages 189, 193, 195 and 197 in the Charge to the Jury
where in eleven places it ought to have appeared with murder and acquittal as a
verdict open to the jury.

[Page 126]

After a careful reading of the
charge I am of opinion that the trial judge unequivocally directed the jury as
to returning a verdict of manslaughter if they were not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that murder had been proved; but, in any event, there was no
evidence in this case upon which any verdict of manslaughter could be based.

The appeal must be dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau, Locke
and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

LOCKE J.:—The second and third
grounds of dissent upon which this appeal has been taken imply that, in a
charge of murder based on s. 260 (a) or s. 260 (c) of the Code,
proof of intent to kill is necessary and that this is also so when s. 69(2) is
invoked. I am unable, with respect, to agree with these conclusions in view of
the terms of the sections mentioned.

S. 259 defines some of the
circumstances in which culpable homicide is murder in law, and certain others
are defined in s. 260. As declared by s-s. (a) of the latter section, if
a person means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the offences, inter alia, of robbery or
burglary and death ensues from such injury, the offence is murder, whether the
offender means or not death to ensue or knows or not that death is likely to ensue.
S-s. (c) provides that if a person by any means stops the breath of any
person for any such purpose and death ensues from such stopping of the breath,
the offence is murder.

The first sentence of s. 69
provides, inter alia, that every one is a party to and guilty of an
offence who actually commits it, or does or omits an act for the purpose of
aiding any person to commit the offence, or abets any person in committing it.
This section appeared as s. 61 when the Code was first enacted in 1892.

As it affects the present case,
the matter is thus stated in the 10th Edition of Russell on Crime, at p.
1853, as follows:—

Thus where several persons
are together for the purpose of committing a breach of the peace, assaulting
persons who pass, and while acting together in that common object, a fatal blow
is given, it is immaterial

[Page 127]

which struck the blow, for
the blow given under such circumstances is in point of law the blow of all, and
it is unnecessary to prove which struck the blow.

There was evidence in the present
matter from which a jury might properly draw the inference that the appellant
and Cathro had meant to inflict grievous bodily injury to Ah Wing and had aided
and abetted each other in doing so for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of the offence of robbery and that his death had resulted. If the
jury chose to draw this inference, the offence was murder as defined by s. 260,
whether they or either of them meant that death should ensue or knew that death
was likely to ensue. In such circumstances, it would be a matter of
indifference which of the two struck the fatal blow or inflicted the fatal
injury, since each would be liable in law for the act of the other.

The appellant might also have
been found guilty of murder, if the jury were to draw the inference that a
common intention to rob Ah Wing had been formed by the appellant and his
associates and to assist each other in doing so, and that the killing was an
offence which ought to have been known to the appellant to be a probable consequence
of the prosecution of such common purpose. The charge upon this aspect of the
matter appears to me to have been sufficient.

As to the objections to the
charge on the ground that what has been referred to as the defence of
manslaughter was not put to the jury properly, I think nothing in the evidence
raised any such issue and, accordingly, this criticism of the charge is not
justified. In my opinion, upon the evidence only two verdicts were possible,
that is, guilty or not guilty. I cannot think that it affected the appellant's
position to his detriment that the jury were told, as they were, that they
might find manslaughter.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RAND J.:—The evidence in this
case, differing in this respect from that adduced in the trial of the
accomplice, Cathro, whose conviction of murder has likewise been brought in
appeal before us, did not go directly to what had taken place in the store
resulting in the death. The facts before the jury were these: about 10:30 p.m. from his
home a witness saw an automobile, draw up right opposite him 

[Page 128]

on 24th Avenue on which a lane
opened leading to the rear of the store of the deceased; a man was sitting
slouched in the driver's seat, and the engine was running which upon the
witness's coming out of the house was shut off; about this time Cathro was seen
in the store drinking from a bottle by three other witnesses also inside;
before the latter went out the accused entered and he and Cathro were left
alone with the deceased on their departure; the lights of the store were
noticed to be out earlier than usual; within ten or fifteen minutes from the
time the car was observed by him, the first witness who had returned from a
short errand in his car noticed two persons, one of them carrying a small box,
running westerly along the avenue from the direction of the store to the parked
automobile which they hurriedly got into and drove away at high speed; the.
witness, who had previously recognized the make of car, followed them and was
able to obtain the license number; upon returning from this pursuit, he found
the police in the store to whom he gave a description of the car, including its
number; the police had been called in by a neighbour of the deceased upon
hearing moaning within the store; a general alert was sent out at about 10:58
o'clock the police came upon the car with four occupants, the accused and
Cathro being in the back seat with the former holding a small box containing
about $50 and a receipt shown to have been given to the deceased. The cause of
death was the force which not only had broken the walls of the larynx but by
shutting off respiration had brought about asphyxia. On these primary facts the
jury could admittedly have found the death to have been brought about in the
course of robbery by acts of force to which both men were party: as is seen,
there is nothing whatever on which a distinction could be made by the jury
between the parts played by Cathro and the accused. the vital circumstances in
which the evidence differs from the case of Cathro.

In that situation must a trial
judge, in his charge, embark upon a speculation of the many possible modes in
which the fatal occurrence might have taken place? Without more, it would, I
think, be improper for him to invite the jury to indulge in any such
imaginings. What they must do is to draw their conclusions from the evidence
submitted to them or the reasonable inferences arising from it; but on any
feature on which the evidence, including in that the 

[Page 129]

inferences to be drawn from the
total circumstances disclosed, is silent, in general and specifically here no
special direction is warranted.

A number of grounds were urged
against the charge, but I find myself quite unable to say that as a whole it
did not present the law and the case for the defence to the jury both fairly
and adequately.

I would dismiss the appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
appellant was tried before Manson J. and a jury at the Vancouver assize and on
March 30, 1955, was convicted on the charge, ""that he, the said Chow Bew
at the City of Vancouver, in the County of Vancouver, in the Province of
British Columbia, on the 6th day of January, 1955, together with Donald Keith
Cathro, Eng Git Lee and Richard Wong, unlawfully did murder Young Gai Wah,
otherwise known as Ah Wing.""

His appeal to the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia was dismissed. O'Halloran J.A., dissenting, would
have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and substituted a verdict of
manslaughter and a sentence of ten years imprisonment.

The following statement of the
facts is taken from the reasons for judgment of Bird J.A.:—

The case for the Crown rests
upon the evidence of various persons who between approximately 10.30 and 11.00
p.m. on the night in question were either present in the store where the
killing occurred or in its near vicinity; as well as that of police officers
who investigated the circumstances surrounding the crime and of the physician
who conducted the autopsy on the body of the deceased man.

The facts now set out emerge
from the uncontradicted testimony of these persons called as Crown witnesses:

(1) The store is situate at 4017 MacDonald Street from the rear of which a passage leads to the 2800 block on West 24th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.

(2) At 10.30 p.m. January 6, 1955, Dickinson saw
a car stop in the 2800 block W. 24th
 Avenue, from which two persons alighted
and walked away in the general direction of the store. He said that the car, in
which was one occupant, remained there with lights out.

(3) About 10.40 p.m. the deceased
man served in the store the witness Cowie, who, with his wife, occupied the
premises adjoining the store to the north, as well as Shearer and Wood. Cathro
was then observed in the store by Cowie, Shearer and Wood, and the appellant
was seen entering by Shearer when the latter left the premises.

(4) At 10.50 p.m. a groan
from the store premises was heard by Cowie and his wife who then observed that
the interior lights of the store were out. She called the police immediately by
telephone.

[Page 130]

(5)About 10.45 p.m.
Dickinson returned by car to his home in the 2800 block 24th Avenue West and
soon after, in company with Scholes, saw two men, one of whom carried what
looked like a cigar box, run west on 24th Avenue from the direction of
MacDonald Street, and enter the parked car which then rapidly drove east
without lights.

(6) Dickinson
followed the eastbound car for two miles, observed that it was a Pontiac and
noted its licence number which information soon after was reported by him to
police officers whom he found near the store premises on his return.

(7) Shearer and Wood, who
stood talking outside the store after leaving it, did not observe anyone enter
or leave the premises before police cars arrived at 10.50 p.m. Meantime they
had observed the store lights go out.

(8) Upon examination of the
store premises made by police officers about 10.50 p.m. the front door was
found locked, the rear door leading to the passage to 24th Avenue was open. The
lights had been shut off from the fuse box and the dead body of Ah Wing was
found within the premises.

(9) A Pontiac car
bearing the licence number given to the police officers by Dickinson was
stopped by a constable on a downtown street some miles from the store premises
at 10.58 p.m. In the car were the four men charged in the
indictment. The appellant then had in his possession a cigar box containing
money, as well as a receipt which was shown to have been issued to the deceased
man.

The facts thus elicited from
the various Crown witnesses and particularly the fact that only Cathro, the
appellant, and Ah Wing were present in the store between 10.40 and 10.50 p.m.
do not appear to have been seriously questioned by defence counsel at the
trial.

T. R. Harmon, a qualified
physician and surgeon, retained as pathologist and autopsist by the City of Vancouver,
expressed the opinion, founded upon his examination of the body of the deceased
made January 7, 1955, that the latter had come to an ""unnatural
death from asphyxia due to strangulation with a fracture of the voice
box"". It was his belief that ""death resulted from strangulation by
pressure that shut off the breathing,"" that ""very great pressure was
required to fracture the voice box"". The application of ""a knee on
the neck was the most likely cause of injury, very powerful hands could do
it"" but they would leave marks on the neck of which the witness found
none. He said further that the identical type of injury to the voice box is not
usual and he could not recall having seen another. There were superficial
injuries to the face; left wrist, and scalp, none of which in the witness'
opinion were likely to have caused death, though the injuries to the head may
have caused loss of consciousness.

There was no direct evidence
of what transpired in the store premises subsequent to 10.40 p.m. when Cathro,
the appellant, and Ah Wing, were shown to have been the only occupants.

The appellant did not take
the witness-box nor did the defence adduce evidence.

It may be added, as is pointed
out by O'Halloran J.A., that there was no evidence that any weapon was in the
possession of the appellant or of any of the other three named in the
indictment or played any part in causing the death of Ah Wing.

[Page 131]

It is apparent from this summary
of the evidence that it was open to the jury to find that the appellant and
Cathro had formed a common intention to rob Ah Wing and to assist each other in
so doing, that Ah Wing came to his death as the result of an assault committed
for the purpose of facilitating the carrying out of the robbery, that the force
used was so great as to indicate that the person who applied it meant to
inflict grievous bodily harm on Ah Wing or to stop his breath or to do both. It
is, I think, also apparent that it was open to the jury to find that the
evidence was not inconsistent with the view that the force which caused the
death of Ah Wing was applied by one only of the two who were together
committing the robbery and that it was impossible to say which one actually
committed the assault. It therefore became of crucial importance that the
learned trial judge should make plain to the jury the law by which they should
be guided if they took the view of the evidence that all the injuries from
which the death of Ah Wing ensued were inflicted by Cathro alone.

From the description of the
injuries given by Dr. Harmon there could be little doubt that the individual
who actually applied the force was guilty of murder under the provisions of
either clause (a) or clause (c) of s. 260  of the Criminal
Code , in force at the date of the offence and at the date of the trial. It
would seem that such individual meant, for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of the robbery, to inflict grievous bodily injury or, as an
alternative to the intention just mentioned or in addition thereto, meant to
stop the breath of Ah Wing. The question is how the jury should have been
instructed as to what they must find before they could properly convict of
murder the other individual taking part in the robbery on the assumption that
he did not personally use any force from which the death of Ah Wing ensued.

In my view the law of Canada on
this point is to be found in ss. 259 , 260  and 69  of the Criminal Code 
and differs from the law of England as laid down in the cases of Rex v. Betts and
Ridley [3] and
Rex v. Grant and Gilbert [4].

Applying the relevant sections of
the Code to the state of facts mentioned, I am of opinion that it should
have been

[Page 132]

made plain to the jury that, if,
in their view, the circumstances proved were not inconsistent with the view
that the violence inflicted on Ah Wing was inflicted by Cathro alone, they
could find the appellant guilty of murder only if they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt of two things, (i) that it was in fact a probable consequence
of the prosecution of the common purpose of the appellant and Cathro to rob Ah
Wing, that Cathro, for the purpose of facilitating the' commission of the
robbery, would intentionally inflict grievous bodily injury on Ah Wing or would
wilfully stop his breath, and (ii) that it was known or ought to have been
known to the appellant that such consequence was probable. While in my view, on
the evidence, it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to so find,
I am in agreement with O'Halloran J.A. that the jury were not accurately
instructed on this vital matter.

The learned trial judge having
told the jury that in ss. 259  and 260  the word ""offender"" extended to
all who were involved and that the singular included the plural if the evidence
so required, went on to say in dealing with these two sections:—

If you are of the opinion
beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused did intend to inflict grievous
bodily harm, for the purpose of facilitating—when I say the Accused, I think I
might well join with it the Accused or his companion or the two of them
together—if you are of the opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
did intend to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating
the commission of the robbery, then the earlier words of Section 260  come into
play and the crime is that of murder, regardless of whether the offender meant
or not death to ensue, or whether he knew or not that death was likely to
ensue.

and a little later continued:—

It seems to me—and the
finding of fact is for you—that the acts of the offenders were for the purpose
of facilitating the commission of the robbery, as it seems to me that the
offenders wilfully stopped the breath of the deceased to facilitate the
commission of the crime of robbery and death ensued. And if I am right in my
view that that word ""offender"" as used in that section extended to
the plural, then you at once arrive at the position that it is quite immaterial
which of these two men that were in the premises, seemingly, stopped the breath
of the Accused (sic—obviously the word ""accused"" should be
""deceased"") and it is immaterial whether they meant to cause death or
not, or knew or not that death was likely to ensue, if they stopped the breath
and death did ensue.

I now leave those sections
and turn to Section 69 of the Code …

It appears to me that the jury
may well have understood from the passages which I have quoted, and in the
first of which I have italicized some words, that it was open to

[Page 133]

them to find a verdict of guilty
against the appellant, even if in their opinion he had not personally used any
force to Ah Wing, by the application of the terms of ss. 259  and 260  and
without the necessity of considering or applying the terms of s. 69 (2); and I
think that this was a fatal error. If I am right in my view as to the existence
of this error, it is obvious that it could not be cured merely by an accurate
direction, as to the effect of s. 69 (2), for, ex hypothesi, the jury
might feel no need to consider that section at all; and I can find nothing in
the remainder of the charge which has the effect of correcting or removing such
error. I conclude therefore that the verdict cannot stand.

The ground of misdirection on
which I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed appears to me to be
sufficiently raised in the second ground of dissent of O'Halloran J.A. set out
in the formal order of the Court of Appeal as follows:—

Upon the charge as given
them the jury could reasonably believe they were entitled to convict of murder
under Code s. 260 (a) and (c) without proof of intent to
kill and apart from Code s. 69 (2).

While I trust that it so appears
from all that I have said above, I wish, so as to avoid the possibility of
misunderstanding, to say explicitly that I do not agree with the view, implied
in the wording of the ground of dissent just quoted, that in order to enable a
properly instructed jury to convict of murder in this case proof of intent to
kill was necessary. My view as to the misdirection which I regard as fatal
would be correctly summarized as follows:—

Upon the charge as given
them the jury could reasonably believe they were entitled to convict of murder
under Code s. 260 (a) and (c) apart from Code s. 69
(2).

As already indicated this ground
is, I think, included in the ground of dissent which I have quoted. The greater
includes the less.

It does not appear to me that
this is a case in which the provisions of 1014 (2) can be applied. I have
already indicated my view that the evidence was sufficient to permit a properly
instructed jury to convict of murder but I do not think it can safely be
affirmed that they must necessarily have done so.

[Page 134]

I would allow the appeal, quash
the conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Theft—Mens Rea—Beachcomber
collecting logs from booming ground without consent of owner—Whether theft—Whether
mens rea—Criminal Code , ss. 22 , 396 .

The respondent was charged
under the Criminal Code  with the theft of two saw logs belonging to a
lumber company and stamped with a registered brand, which had been floating
within a recognized booming ground but not contained in any boom. He admitted
taking and selling them to another beachcomber who, according to the existing
practice, had them scaled by the Forest Branch of the provincial government.
But he contended that he did not intend to do anything wrong and thought that
he had the right to do what he did; that they were drifting and that he thought
that the tide or the wind had carried them into the enclosure.

His acquittal by the trial
judge, on the ground that there had been no mens rea, was affirmed by the Court
of Appeal.

Held (Locke J. dissenting),
that the appeal should be allowed and a conviction directed.

Per Taschereau and Rand JJ.: The respondent's belief
that by the general law he had the right to collect the logs as he did, to
dispose of them, and in effect to require the owners to pay him or the person
to whom he transferred them a remuneration for his salvage work, being a
mistake of law, was not admissible as a defence by virtue of s. 22  of the Criminal
Code .

Per Estey and Fauteux JJ.: In the circumstances of this
case, it cannot be said that the respondent could justify his collecting the
logs by stating that they were drifting. The were not drifting in an area that
would permit a beachcomber to take them into his possession. He did not collect
them in such a place or under such circumstances that he could reasonably
presume that they had been abandoned or that he might take them out of
possession of the party in control of the booming ground. Knowing that they
were in a booming ground under the control and direction of the company, he
could not be said to have had an honest and reasonable belief in the existence
of facts which, if true, would have constituted a defence and, therefore, he
possessed mens rea.

By trespassing upon the
booming ground and taking the logs fraudulently and without colour of right,
with intent of disposing of them in a manner that deprived the company
temporarily of its property, he was guilty of theft.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): There was evidence upon which
the trial judge could find that the respondent took possession of the logs
believing that he was entitled to do so with the intention not of stealing them

[Page 607]

but of profiting by obtaining
salvage from the owners if they were found, or which could leave the trial
judge in such doubt as to require him to acquit. To constitute the crime of
theft, the act must be done fraudulently and without colour of right.

Section 22  of the Criminal
Code  did not affect the matter since the question to be determined was
whether or not the respondent committed any offence.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the acquittal by the trial judge of the
respondent on a charge of stealing saw logs from a booming ground.

S. J. Remnant, Q.C. for
the appellant.

Glen McDonald for the
respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau and
Rand JJ. was delivered by:—

RAND J.:—The external facts in
this appeal are few and simple. The accused removed from a booming ground,
within which a lumber company, the prosecutor, had exclusive privileges for the
putting down of mooring dolphins, the anchorage of booms, a line of piles and a
log haul-up, two logs belonging to the company which at the time of removal had
become lodged against the easterly end of a line of booms. He did that by
entering the water area over a boundary line of single logs a distance of approximately
40 feet and towing the two logs out and down the Fraser river where on the
following day he sold them, along with 23 others, for eighty dollars or so.

He was believed in saying that he
did not intend to do anything wrong and that he thought he had the right to do
what he did. This both the County Court judge who tried him and the Court of
Appea[2] have
found to be an answer to the charge laid.

The accused can be said, as he
was in the courts below, to have acted upon a mistake, but in what did the mistake
lie? He acknowledged that the logs were not drifting, that is, not at large in
the river; he claims they were floating, that is, within the leased area, and
for a distance of about 40 feet, they might move as the tide came in or went
out. With admittedly no claim whatever to any property

[Page 608]

interest in them but as a means
of earning what may be called salvage money, he proceeded to gather them up as
if they were adrift and, if not interfered with, might be carried out to sea
some miles distant. He knew or abstained from ascertaining that the logs were
stamped with the mark of the logger and that they were owned by some person who
could establish his title to them. They were not lost and he was not in the
position of a finder, though if that circumstance had been present it would not
yield much benefit to him. He admits that, for all he knew, they might have
belonged to the company, but with that he was not concerned. He does not
suggest that from the company he had any right or privilege in any manner or
degree to appropriate them and in fact he was aware of a memorandum of advice
published by the provincial land department which told him that even when logs
gathered up were drifting, he was, if called upon, bound to surrender them to
the owner, and whether or not he would be entitled to receive compensation for
his trouble depended on some form of understanding between himself and the
owner. No such distinction between a drifting and a floating log is made in
that memorandum.

What, then, he believed was that
by the general law he had a right to collect them as he did, to dispose of
them, and in effect to require the owners to pay him or the person to whom he
transferred them remuneration for his salvage work. Is that admissible as a
defence? I have no doubt that it is not. As Kenny in his outlines of criminal
law, 1952 Ed. at p. 48 says:—

The final condition is, that
the mistake, however reasonable, must not relate to matters of law but to
matters of fact. For a mistake of law, even though inevitable, is not allowed
in England to afford any excuse for crime. Ignorantia juris neminem excusat. The
utmost effect it can ever have is that it may occasionally, like drunkenness,
rebut the existence of the peculiar form of mens rea which some particular kind
of crime may require.

This principle is embodied in
sec. 22  of the Criminal Code :—

The fact that an offender is
ignorant of the law is not an excuse for any offence committed by him.

A claim to ownership of a
chattel, although it may depend on matter of law, is, in most cases, a question
of fact, or its legal basis may, in the ordinary sense of the 

[Page 609]

word, be subsumed in
""fact"". This enhances the difficulty of separating legal from factual
elements in any relation to property and in any case it may resolve itself into
a refined conceptual distinction. But a distinction between justifying an act
as authorized by law and as a bona fide belief in a property interest does seem
to correspond with an instinctive discrimination between the two concepts.

This idea is given its best
expression by Lord Westbury in Cooper v. Phibbs[3]
in the following language:—

It is said ""ignorantia
iuris haud excusat""; but in that maxim the word ""ius"" is used in
the sense of denoting general law, the ordinary law of the country. But when
the word ""ius"" is used in the sense of denoting a private right, that
maxim has no application. Private right of ownership is a matter of fact; it
may be the result also of matter of law; but if parties contract under a mutual
mistake and misapprehension as to their relative and respective rights, the
result is that that agreement is liable to be set aside as having proceeded
upon a common mistake.

This language was used in a civil
proceeding but it furnishes a most helpful distinction for the application of
the maxim in criminal law of which it has always been taken to be a basic
principle.

The taking into possession and
the conversion of the logs obviously was intended to deprive the owner
temporarily at least of its property and this comes within the express language
of the definition of theft given by the Criminal Code .

I would therefore allow the
appeal and direct a judgment of conviction upon the second count, with a fine
of $25 imposed upon the accused.

The judgment of Estey and Fauteux
JJ. was delivered by:—

ESTEY J.:—The respondent was
found not guilty in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court of Westminster,
British Columbia, on a charge containing two counts: (1) that he did, on February 15, 1953,
without the consent of the owner, fraudulently collect two saw logs stamped
with a registered brand and thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 394 (a)
(i) of the Criminal Code ; (2) that he did steal the said logs and
thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 396  of the Criminal Code . His
acquittal was

[Page 610]

affirmed in the Court of Appeal[4].
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted, but restricted to the acquittal
under the second count.

These logs were each stamped with
a registered brand—8 over 697 within a triangle. They had been sold by the
owner of that brand and at all times material hereto were the property of McKay
and Flanagan Brothers Lumber Mill Limited (hereinafter referred to as the
company). This company operates a sawmill on the Fraser River near New
Westminster and leases an area of that river in front of its mill site, about
1,300 feet in length and in width varying from 240 to 265 feet, as a booming
ground. For some distance from the shore this booming ground is well marked on
the surface thereof and the respondent admits that these logs were within that
marked area and that he knew the logs were in this booming ground, both when he
first saw them and when he collected them.

The respondent describes himself
as a fisherman who does ""a bit of beachcombing"". About ten o'clock Sunday
morning, February 15, 1953, accompanied by a boy fifteen years of age named Hamilton, he
went out in his fishing boat upon the Fraser River to ""look for some logs"". He deposed
that in ""going up river and passing Flanagan's booming ground I noticed
two logs drifting down and I circled the boat and came up against the tide, it
was just about slack tide by that time. By the time I got the boat turned
around the logs landed on top of the boom, at the head end of their boom"".
He directed his boat into the booming ground and collected the two logs which
he estimated had floated approximately forty to fifty feet since the time he
first saw them. The next day he disposed of the logs to another beachcomber,
Patterson, along with some twenty-six other logs he had obtained in
beachcombing, all for a sum which he recollected to be $78.

Patterson, called on behalf of
the Crown, described the respondent as a ""fisherman, and he picks up a few
logs for me"". Patterson states that on the Monday the respondent brought
some twenty-eight or thirty logs for which he paid him $80. That Patterson
intended to communicate with the authorities and have these logs disposed of in
the

[Page 611]

usual way there can be no doubt,
but before the scalers had arrived a representative of the company called and
Patterson delivered to him the two logs in question, as well as three more of
the company's logs which he had in his possession.

The Fraser River at this point flows approximately westward and these
logs were at the upper or east end of the booming ground, well inside of the
marked area thereof. At this end a barrier exists between that of the Farris
Lumber Company Limited and the booming ground of the company, for the purpose
of separating these grounds.

Respondent justifies his
collecting these logs upon the basis that they were drifting and, therefore, he
""was entitled to go and pick them up"". When it was suggested he
incurred some risk, he replied: ""I didn't figure it was a risk picking up
logs at all, because they were loose and floating and drifting"".

Respondent based his belief in
his right to take a floating log upon his reading of the pamphlet issued by the
British Columbia Forestry Service entitled ""General Information on
Beachcombing"" and which was filed as an exhibit at the trial. He did not
specify any particular portion thereof, but contented himself with stating:
""According to this, as long as you don't steal them"" it is all right
to collect floating logs, but that ""if you take a log out of a boom that
is stealing"". In fact the pamphlet makes no reference to a booming ground
or a boom. It refers to the civil rights of one engaged in the business of
beachcombing and indicates his position to be that of ""a finder of lost
things"". Section 394  of the Criminal Code  is specifically referred
to, and in part set out. It further reminds the beachcomber that he must comply
with the provisions of the Forest Act. Indeed, when one reads the
pamphlet as a whole it supports the view that the purpose and intent of
beachcombing is to restore to the owner logs which have passed out of his
control. In Watts and Grant
v. The Queen[5],
the logs were collected at points not under the control or direction of the
owner and the issues concerned the collection by the accused parties of logs
belonging to a particular owner and what, if any, were the rights of the
accused

[Page 612]

with respect to these logs, while
in the present case the issue turns on the right of one, while engaged in the
business of beachcombing, to knowingly enter and collect logs floating outside
of a boom but within a private booming ground.

Counsel for the Crown, upon these
facts, submitted that, as respondent took the logs from an area which he well
knew was a booming ground and, therefore, an area under the control and direction
(except with respect to certain matters not material hereto) of the company as
lessee, he could not do so with other than a dishonest or fraudulent intent.
The logs within such an area are subject to the control of the company and,
apart from the rights of an owner (with which we are not here concerned), the
lessee has a right to the possession thereof against a person in the position
of the respondent. South Staffordshire Water Company v. Sharman[6].
The conduct of the respondent, in the submission of the Crown, in going into
and trespassing upon the booming ground with the intent and purpose of
collecting floating logs therein, though not inside a boom, was itself, in the
circumstances, such evidence of dishonest or wrongful intent that the mere assertion
on his part that he thought he had a right to collect floating logs would not
establish an honest intent. The conduct of the respondent, at the time of
collecting the logs, as well as later when the police officer called at his
home, appears to support the contention of the Crown. When the police officer
called, and before he had intimated the reason therefor, the respondent stated:
""I guess it is about the logs"". He had lived for about twenty-five
years in the vicinity and, while the evidence does not disclose how long he had
been beachcombing, Patterson says he had purchased logs from him during the
""last year and a half anyway I believe"". Apart altogether from the
pamphlet, which does not support the respondent, a person in his position would
know that as a beachcomber he would not be entitled to take these logs out of a
private booming ground. In the ordinary circumstance the logs there would be
the property of the lessee, as, in fact, they were in this case. A beachcomber,
therefore, in collecting them would do so for the purpose of having the lessee
pay him for

[Page 613]

finding and collecting the logs
in his own (the lessee's) booming ground. There is really, in such
circumstances, no ""finding"" and no ""collecting"" in the
sense that these words would be understood in the business of beachcombing.

In these circumstances it cannot
be said that one in the position of the respondent, who collected logs in the
booming ground, could justify his doing so by stating that they were drifting.
They were drifting in one sense, but they were not drifting in an area that
would permit of one engaged in the business of beachcombing taking them into
his possession.

In Brend v. Wood[7],
the accused had been absent from the country on service with the Navy. He was
given a forged motor vehicle fuel coupon and later was charged with having that
coupon in his possession with intent to deceive. It was established that he did
not know it was forged and he satisfied the court that he had acted in good
faith. In the present case the accused had lived in the vicinity for a period
of twenty-five years and was himself, at least to some extent, engaged in the
business of beachcombing and, therefore, is not in a position at all analagous
to that of the accused in Brend v. Wood.

The beachcomber collects logs
which are lost to the owner in the sense that they are out of his control and,
in so far as his position is similar to that of one who finds lost articles,
the observations of Baron Parke in Regina v. Wm. Thurburn[8],
are pertinent. There the accused found a note which had been accidentally
dropped on the highway with no name or mark thereon to indicate the owner, nor
were there any circumstances which would enable the finder to discover to whom
the note belonged when he picked it up, nor had he any reason to believe that
the owner knew where to find it again. At p. 393 Baron Parke states:

To prevent, however, the
taking of goods from being larceny, it is essential that they should be
presumably lost, that is that they should be taken in such a place and under
such circumstances, as that the owner would be reasonably presumed by the
taker, to have abandoned them, or at least not to know where to find them.
Therefore if a horse is found feeding on an open common or on the side of a public
road, or a watch found apparently hidden in a hay stack, the taking of these

[Page 614]

would be larceny, because
the taker had no right to presume that the owner did not know where to find
them; and consequently had no right to treat them as lost goods.

The respondent did not collect
these logs ""in such a place or under such circumstances"" that he
could reasonably presume that they had been abandoned, or that he might take
them out of the possession of the party in control of the booming ground.

Bank of New South Wales v. Piper[9]
was an action for malicious prosecution arising out of a charge laid by a bank
manager against a mortgagor who had mortgaged his sheep to the bank as
security. Under s. 7 of the relevant statute (11 Vict. No. 4) the mortgagor
could not sell any of his sheep without the written consent of the mortgagee.
The mortgagor, with the oral consent of the mortgagee, sold the sheep and when
a charge was laid by the bank the Attorney General refused to proceed with it.
In the action for malicious prosecution the jury found that, while the
mortgagor did not have the written consent, he had the oral consent of the
manager of the bank and judgment was directed for the plaintiff. In the Privy
Council this was reversed. It was there held that the legislature intended to
make a sale by the mortgagor without the written consent of the mortgagee a
criminal offence and with respect to mens rea it was stated: ""…the absence
of mens rea really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by
the accused of the existence of facts which, if true, would make the act
charged against him innocent"". A written consent would have made the
accused innocent of the charge. He did not claim such and, therefore, never had
""an honest and reasonable belief …of the existence of"" a written
consent ""which, if true, would make the act charged against him
innocent"". Therefore, in the opinion of the Judicial Committee, he
possessed mens rea.

In the present case the
respondent knew he was taking logs out of a booming ground under the control
and direction of the company. The fact that the logs were floating outside of a
boom does not alter or qualify the fact that while they were within the limits
of the booming ground they were in the possession of the company. Had these
logs been outside the booming ground and floating in a

[Page 615]

position and manner that one
might reasonably conclude they were out of the control of, or, in effect, lost
to the party entitled to their possession, then the beachcomber might collect
them and cause the party entitled to them to pay for his work. The respondent
did not have present to his mind any such facts. His belief was analagous to
that of Piper in the New South Wales case who thought the verbal permission sufficient.
The respondent, in taking these logs out of the possession of the company,
could not be said to have an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of
facts which, if true, would have constituted a defence and, therefore, within
the foregoing authority, he possessed mens rea.

The respondent made no effort to
see if the logs were marked. Even if he had found a mark, it is doubtful if he
would have known they were the property of the company. That, however, is not a
material circumstance. What he did know, and which is material, is that these
logs were in the company's booming ground. In this connection the language of
Lord Goddard C.J. in Hibbert v. McKiernan[10]
is pertinent. There the accused went upon a golf course and picked up certain
golf balls which had been abandoned by their owners. It was held that the golf
club had sufficient property and interest in these balls to support an
indictment for larceny. Lord Goddard C.J., in the course of his judgment,
stated:

Every householder or
occupier of land means or intends to exclude thieves and wrongdoers from the
property occupied by him, and this confers on him a special property in goods
found on his land sufficient to support an indictment if the goods are taken
therefrom, not under a claim of right, but with a felonious intent.

These cases illustrate what is
stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Ed., Vol. 11, p. 497:

To prevent the taking from
being felonious the claim of right must be an honest one, though it may be
unfounded in law or in fact.

See also Kenny's Outlines of
Criminal Law, 1952 Ed., p. 241; Stephen's History of the Criminal Law of
England, Vol. 3, p. 124.

A reading of this record in the
light of the authorities, and I say this with the greatest possible respect to
the learned judges who hold a contrary view, leads to the conclusion,

[Page 616]

when regard is had to the area in
which the logs were floating, the knowledge of the respondent in respect to
that area and the rights of the company therein, that the respondent trespassed
upon the booming ground, took the logs fraudulently and without colour of
right, with the intent of disposing of them in a manner that deprived the
company temporarily of its property or interest therein. I am, therefore, of
the opinion that the respondent committed the offence of theft as charged and
would impose a fine of $25.

I am, therefore, of the opinion
that the appeal should be allowed.

LOCKE, J. (dissenting):—This is
an appeal by the Crown taken pursuant to leave granted by Rand J. from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[11]
which dismissed the appeal of the Crown from the acquittal of Shymkowich by His
Honour Judge Grimmett after a trial held in the County Court Judge's Criminal
Court of the County of Westminster.

Two charges were laid against the
respondent but the leave granted restricts the matter to be considered to the
acquittal upon the second of these, which was in the following words:—

For that the said Andrew
Shymkowich on or about the 15th day of February A.D. 1953 at South Westminster
in the County of Westminster and Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did
steal two saw logs bearing timber mark 8 over 697 within a triangle and valued
at over $25.00 and being the property of McKay and Flanagan Brothers Lumber
Mill Limited, contrary to the form of the Statute made and provided and against
the Peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

The facts disclosed by the
evidence, in so far as it is necessary to consider them, are as follows:—On the
south bank of the Fraser River, a short distance east of the City of New
Westminster, the lumber company referred to operates a lumber mill. For the
purpose of carrying on its operations, the company obtained in the year 1938
the right, granted under the provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection
Act  (c. 140, R.S.C. 1927), to place a line of six dolphins at equal
distance between the easterly and westerly boundary of a 7.41 acre portion of
the Fraser River immediately adjacent their mill property to the north, a log
haulup, a line of piles fifty feet in length on the southerly

[Page 617]

boundary of the log haul-up
produced north westwardly and any other dolphins, piling or construction which
might be necessary for the more efficient operation of a saw mill. For these
privileges the lumber company paid an annual sum to the New Westminster Harbour
Commissioners. In pursuance of the rights thus granted to them by Order-in-Council,
the dolphins were installed along the northerly boundary of the booming ground
and piling was driven along the easterly or up river end of the area to which
boom sticks were attached, forming what was referred to as a standing boom
extending from the shore line approximately 135 ft. to the north, designed
apparently to prevent logs being carried out of the booming ground to the east
by the tide, and similarly to prevent logs being carried into the booming
ground by the current from the east. The booming ground was not enclosed in any
way along its northerly boundary other than by the dolphins placed there and,
while the evidence is not clear on the point, it apparently was not enclosed in
any way at its westerly extremity.

On the day in question, a boom of
logs which the lumber company had bought from the Scheller Logging Company was
tied up to the piling which had been driven in a line parallel to the southern
shore of the river and some 50 feet north of the water line between the log
haul-up and the easterly limits of the booming ground.

The respondent is a fisherman and
apparently supplements his income by beachcombing logs on the Fraser River
and, on the day in question which was a Sunday, proceeded in company with a
fifteen year old boy, Albert Hamilton, in his fishing boat up the river,
apparently in search of logs drifting on the river which he might salvage.
According to the respondent, on Saturday,
 February 14, 1953, there had been a
very heavy wind on the Fraser and there were quite a few logs drifting around
but the waves were so high they could not be salvaged. He described his actions
on the following day as follows:—

I decide I would go up river
and have a look for some logs. Going up river and passing Flanagan's booming
ground I noticed two logs drifting down and I circled the boat and came up
against the tide, it was just about slack tide by that time. By the time I got
the boat turned around the logs landed on top of the boom, at the head end of
their boom. 

[Page 618]

Circling around, coming in
against the tide, I reversed into the top of the boom and I got Ab Hamilton to
drive a couple of dogs in the logs and after I got the logs dogged up, I came
out past the boom and went down the river and tied up alongside of my float
there.

Nothing was said by the
respondent in giving his evidence in chief as justification for his actions in
going in the booming ground and taking away logs which presumably were the
property of the lumber company but, when cross-examined, he said that when he
saw the logs they were ""floating down river"". He then said that they
were floating down from the standing boom and that, at that time, the tide was
just starting to change and as he circled the boat around the tide carried them
up against the top of the boom, referring to the purchased boom above
mentioned. After saying that he knew that the logs were in a booming ground,
when asked why he went in and took possession of them, he said:—

Well, it has been the
practice, any log floating, any fisherman picks up any log that has been
floating.

He then said that:—

I couldn't tell that they
were McKay and Flanagan's logs.

In answer to further questions, he
gave the following evidence:—

Q. Did you realize that you
were taking quite a risk in picking up logs indiscriminately?

A. Not to my knowledge, I
didn't figure it was a risk picking up logs at all, because they were loose and
floating and drifting.

Q. Do you know the
difference between a floating log and a drifting log?

A. Yes.

Q. What is it?

A. Well, a floating log is
in a boom and a drift log is drifting down the river, floating loose say out of
the boomsticks.

Q. Referring to your own
statement, you saw two logs floating within a booming ground of McKay &
Flanagan Mill, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. You think those are drift
logs, do you?

A. Well, in a boom I regard
it—but actually this wasn't in a boom.

Q. We are talking about logs
within this booming ground.

A. Well, they could have
drifted down there.

Q. They weren't drifting,
were they?

A. Yes, they were drifting.

Q. Where were they drifting?

A. They were drifting down
the river.

[Page 619]

Q. Did you see those logs
being blown in there?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. So you don't know how
they got there?

A. No, I don't.

When asked by the learned trial
Judge as to whether he thought he was entitled to go in to the booming ground
and take the two logs, he said he thought that he was. Asked by counsel for the
Crown where he got this information, he said it was contained in a pamphlet
issued by the Forest Branch of the B.C. Government. Whether he had seen this
before the date in question does not appear. However, the document referred to,
which had been received in evidence though objected to by counsel for the
Crown, was apparently issued for the information of beachcombers and expressed
certain views as to their civil rights and informed them that any log found by
them which did not bear a registered timber-mark was deemed to be the property
of the Crown: if the log bore a registered mark it was prima facie evidence
that it was the property of the registered owner of the mark. Certain parts of
section 394  of the Criminal Code  were referred to and information as to
the necessity of paying stumpage or royalty on such logs was given.

At the request of the
respondent's counsel, the following passage was read into the evidence:—

The Forest Service grants no
authority to any person either by licence or permit to engage in the beachcombing
of logs but does not attempt to prohibit or restrict such ventures providing
that logs are not stolen or obtained by other unlawful methods.

Following this, the respondent
was asked if he understood what stealing was and he said that he understood
that if you take a log out of a boom that is stealing and said finally:—

I was acting on the
knowledge that probably the tide or wind blew them logs in there.

Hamilton, who was called as a
witness by the Crown, said that, as the respondent's fishing boat was passing
the booming ground, they saw the two logs starting to drift down from the
standing boom and, by the time they got in to the booming ground, they had been
carried, apparently by the current, to the most easterly end of the purchased
boom which, he said, was tied up some 30 or 40 feet from 

[Page 620]

the shore and indicated the place
at which the logs came to rest against it as a point some 50 feet from the
shore. This, as shown upon a sketch showing the dimensions of the booming
grounds, would be some 90 to 100 feet to the south of the line of dolphins
along the northerly limit of the booming grounds.

Persons logging on Crown lands in
the Province of British Columbia are required by the provisions of the Part IX
of the Forest Act (c. 128, R.S.B.C. 1948) to mark each log with a timber-mark
issued by the Forest Service in such a manner that it is readily discernible
when the log is floated. The logs in the purchased boom and the two logs in
question had been cut on a timber sale in the Chilliwack River Valley by
the Collins Macken Lumber Company of Chilliwack who had registered a timbermark 8/697 within a
triangle for that timber sale. It was shown that the two logs in question were
stamped with this mark but the respondent does not appear to have examined them
to ascertain whether they bore a timber-mark.

The respondent had apparently
previously accumulated a number of logs presumably found adrift in the river
and on February 16, 1953, he purported to sell these or his interest in
them, with the two taken from the lumber company's booming ground, to Richard
Patterson, a fisherman who also dealt in beachcombed logs. Patterson was
familiar with the instructions given in the circular issued by the Forest
Branch above referred to. On the 17th of February he had the logs scaled by an
official scaler of the Forest Branch and paid to the Department timber
royalties upon such of the logs as bore a timber-mark and stumpage upon those
where no such mark was visible. The Scale and Royalty Account for this sum does
not show any logs bearing the mark 8/697, the scaler apparently not observing
the mark upon these logs. According to Patterson, the practice established by
the Forest Branch is that, when logs bearing a registered mark are found adrift
and beach-combed, the person finding or having possession of the logs reports
the fact to the local office of the B.C.
 Forest Service and the registered owner of the mark is notified of the fact.
As between dealers such as Patterson and loggers or lumber mill operators who
are either registered as owners of a timber-mark or have purchased logs so
marked, the usual 

[Page 621]

practice is to pay the dealers
fifty per cent of the market value of the logs as salvage. As to logs upon
which there is no visible timber-mark, the dealer, after paying stumpage to the
Forest Branch, proceeds to sell them on the footing, apparently, that they have
been purchased from the Crown. I think it is sufficiently clear from the
evidence of this witness that a person such as Shymkowich finding a log adrift
in the river bearing a timber-mark might expect, after paying the timber
royalty, that the owner would deal with him in the same manner as with
Patterson.

It was on February 19 that the
two logs in question and three other logs similarly marked were found by the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Patterson's boom. While there was no evidence
that the three logs so marked were taken from the booming grounds of the McKay
and Flanagan Lumber Company or that they had purchased all of the logs so marked
by the Collins and Macken Lumber Company, it was apparently assumed that they
were their property and they were returned to them, Patterson delivering the
logs and making no claim for salvage.

In delivering judgment, the
learned County Court Judge, after referring to certain of the evidence which
had been given before him, said in part:—

The accused says he did not
know he was doing anything wrong in picking up the floating logs which were not
contained in a boom. It is interesting to note that in the Regina vs Watts and
Gaunt case beach-combed logs are described there as 'any logs which are
separated from the booms and floating or resting on the shore.' The only
complication in this particular case is that the accused actually entered a
recognized booming ground to retrieve the floating logs which he thought were
drift logs.

I think that mens rea, that
is an intent to do wrong, is an integral part of this offence and must be
proved, and in this connection, I feel that the story and the actions of the
accused have created more than a reasonable doubt in my mind as to there being
any intent on his part to do anything wrong, and it is of course well
established practice that the accused shall be entitled to any reasonable
doubt. In view of this, I feel I must dismiss the charge.

The reasons for the judgment of
the Court of Appeal were delivered by the Chief Justice of British Columbia.
They refer only to the first of the two charges which had been laid under
section 394(a) (1) of the Code. It is, however, quite clear that the
remarks of the learned Chief Justice were intended equally to apply to the
second charge, with which alone we are concerned. Agreeing with the learned
trial 

[Page 622]

Judge that mens rea was an
essential element of the offence and finding that there was evidence to support
his conclusion that there was no mens rea on the part of the respondent,
the learned Chief Justice found that there was no error in law. He further
expressed the opinion that the evidence disclosed that the respondent was under
the honest impression that he had the right to take possession of the logs in
order to recover some portion of their value from the owners.

The relevant part of the
definition of theft contained in section 347  of the Criminal Code  reads:—

Theft or stealing is the act
of fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converting to the use of any person, anything capable of being
stolen, with intent,

(a) to deprive the
owner, or any person having any special property or interest therein,
temporarily or absolutely of such thing or of such property or interest.

This portion of the definition
appeared in the same terms when the Criminal Code  was first enacted in
1892 as section 305 . The definition does not appear to have been taken from the
English Statutes enacted up to that time dealing with the offence of larceny
under that name (c. 96, 24-25 Vict. and c. 116, 31-32 Vict.), but rather to
embody the accepted definition of the offence of larceny at common law. To
constitute the offence, the act must be done fraudulently and without colour of
right. In Stephen's History of the Criminal Law, Vol. 3, p. 124, the learned
author says:—

The expression 'fraudulent
misappropriation of property' obviously involves three elements: fraud,
property capable of being misappropriated, and misappropriation in its various
forms. Fraud, as I have observed elsewhere, involves, speaking generally, the
idea of injury wilfully effected or intended to be effected by deceit or secretly,
though it is not inconsistent with open force. It is, however, essential to
fraud that the fraudulent person's conduct should not merely be wrongful, but
should be intentionally and knowingly wrongful. Fraud is inconsistent with a
claim of right made in good faith to do the act complained of. A man who takes
possession of property which he really believes to be his own does not take it
fraudulently, however unfounded his claim may be. This, if not the only, is
nearly the only case in which ignorance of the law affects the legal character
of acts done under its influence.

In East's Pleas of the Crown,
Vol. 2, p. 659, in dealing with the offence of larceny, it is
said:—

And here it may be proper to
remark, that in any case if there be any fair pretence of property or right in
the prisoner, or if it be brought into doubt at all, the court will direct an
acquittal.

[Page 623]

In Reg. v. Reed[12],
where the accused person had found a five-pound note and appropriated it, the
Court directed the jury to consider the state of the finder's mind and ruled
that if the jury thought the person really believed the note to be her own by
right of finding they should not bring in a verdict of guilty on the indictment
for larceny. Coleridge, J. said in part (p. 308):—

Ignorance of the law cannot
excuse any person; but, at the same time, when the question is, with what
intent a person takes, we cannot help looking into their state of mind; as, if
a person take what he believes to be his own, it is impossible to say that he
is guilty of felony.

In Reg. v. Farnborough[13],
Lord Russell of Killowen, delivering the judgment of a Court consisting of
himself, Pollock B., Grantham, Lawrence and Wright, JJ. said that to shown an
animus furandi on the part of the prisoner was an essential ingredient of the
crime of larceny and was a matter to be decided by the jury, a statement
referred to and adopted by the Court of Appeal in Rex v. Bernhard[14].

These statements of the law are
supported by the statement of Blackburn, J. to the jury in Reg. v. Wade[15],
referred to by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, and the result of
the authorities is, in my opinion, correctly stated in the passage from Kenny's
Outlines of Criminal Law, at p. 241, quoted by him.

The evidence as to the extent of
the rights of the lumber company to the booming ground in question is not
entirely clear. The Order-in-Council relied upon as evidence as to such rights
simply permitted the installation of the dolphins and other works to which I
have above referred, but did not purport to give to the company the exclusive
right of possession and expressly stipulated that the works should be
constructed so as not to interfere with navigation in any way. It is, however,
unnecessary, in my opinion, to decide whether in entering the booming ground
the respondent was committing a trespass. The accused had sworn that he thought
that probably the tide or wind carried the two logs into the enclosure, a
statement which apparently the learned County Court Judge understood as meaning
that they had theretofore been adrift in the main stream, where the

[Page 624]

respondent thought he would have
been entitled to take them into possession for the purpose of obtaining
salvage, and had simply floated into the booming ground and were not the property
of the lumber company. I do not think the question to be determined is affected
by section 22  of the Criminal Code  stating that ignorance of the law is
not an excuse for any offence committed, since the question to be determined is
whether or not the respondent committed any offence. Other than to construe the
language of the Code defining theft, I see no question of law in this
matter other than as to whether there was any evidence upon which the learned
County Court Judge could find that the respondent took possession of the logs
believing that he was entitled to do so with the intention not of stealing them
but of profiting by obtaining salvage from the owners if they were found, or
which left him in such doubt as to require him to acquit him. I respectfully
agree with the Chief Justice of British Columbia that there was evidence upon
which the trial Judge could so find.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conspiracy to
commit indictable offence—Gist of offence—Whether necessary to have intention
to commit the indictable offence—Criminal Code , s. 573 .

It is misdirection for a trial
judge to tell the jury, at the trial of a person charged of having conspired
with another person to commit the indictable offence of kidnapping, that the
offence of conspiracy was complete by the making of the agreement to kidnap
even though the other alleged conspirator never at any time had had any
intention of carrying the agreement into effect. The mere agreement, without
the intention of both parties to carry into effect the common design, is not
sufficient. There must exist an intention not only to agree but also an intention
to put the common design into effect.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): The
gist of the offence of conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to
commit any indictable offence, and the mens rea is to be found in the intention
to offend against the penal provisions of an act. Therefore, the agreement
entered here between the two conspirators to commit the offence of kidnapping
was a conspiracy within the meaning of s. 573  of the Criminal Code . There was
an agreement in the eyes of the law and the fact that one of the parties in the
agreement did not intend to carry out his part of the bargain could not affect
the legal nature of the arrangement.

The portion of the judgment of
Willes J. in Mulcahy v. The Queen ((1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 306),
purporting to define criminal conspiracy, was never intended as such, but
rather was it a statement of the offence covered by the statute under which
that case was tried.

R. S. Wright's The Law of
Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements (1873 ed.); Poulterers Case
(1611) 9 Co. Rep. 55b; Reg. v. Best (1705) 1 Salk. 174; O'Connell
v. Reg. (1844) 11 Cl. & F. 155; Reg. v. Aspinall
(1876) L.R. 2 Q.B.D. 48; Brodie v. The King [1936] S.C.R. 188 and
Bank of New South Wales v. Piper [1897] A.C. 383 referred to.

Per Fauteux J. (dissenting): In
the circumstances of this case, the exchange of promises could not be treated
as having never existed because of the alleged mental reservation on the part
of one of the two parties. Mental reservations are not apt to defeat the
natural consequences of words accompanied by deeds. In this case, the common
intention was assented to and encouraged by word and by deeds, and that was
sufficient to constitute the conspiracy even though one of the parties did not
intend to go through with the execution of the agreement.

[Page 667]

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing, Robertson J. dissenting, the appeal of
the respondent from his conviction on a charge of having conspired to kidnap
and ordering a new trial.

T. G. Norris Q.C. for the
appellant.

J. Stanton and G. M.
Bleakney for the respondent.

TASCHEREAU, J.:—The Attorney
General of British Columbia appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[2]
which ordered a new trial. It held that there had been misdirection.

The charge for which the
respondent was convicted was that, in the City of Vancouver, British Columbia,
between the 30th day of November, 1952, and the 14th day of January, 1953, the
respondent unlawfully conspired with one Walter John Tulley and others, to commit
a certain indictable offence, namely, kidnapping.

Tulley, the alleged co-conspirator,
was not charged, but at the trial, being called as a Crown witness, he gave an
account of various meetings he had with the respondent, and explained that both
had agreed, at the request of the latter, to kidnap one Joan Margaret
Pritchard. He said in his evidence that he never had any intention of going
through with this plan, but was just fooling the respondent, or hoaxing him. He
also explained that he denounced the whole scheme to the police authorities,
and the respondent was arrested.

The learned trial Judge in his
charge said:—

Counsel for the accused has
suggested that the offence is not complete, because Tulley, in his own
evidence, said that he had had at no time any intention of carrying out that
agreement. I tell you as a matter of law, gentlemen, that the offence was
complete, if, in point of fact, the accused and Tulley did make the
agreement which is charged against him, even though Tulley never at any time
had any intention of carrying the agreement into effect.

The Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice
Robertson dissenting, held that this constituted misdirection, and therefore,
ordered a new trial.

The contention of the respondent
which was accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeal, is that Tulley, not
having any intention to carry through the common design,

[Page 668]

could not be a party to the
conspiracy, and that therefore, O'Brien the respondent, could not alone be
found guilty of the crime. It is common ground that no others were involved in
the conspiracy. The mere agreement, without any intention to carry into effect
the common design would, according to the submission of the appellant, be
sufficient.

I think there has been some
confusion as to the element of intention which is necessary to constitute the
offence. It is, of course, essential that the conspirators have the intention
to agree, and this agreement must be complete. There must also be a common
design to do something unlawful, or something lawful by illegal means. Although
it is not necessary that there should be an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy, to complete the crime, I have no doubt that there must exist an
intention to put the common design into effect. A common design necessarily
involves an intention. Both are synonymous. The intention cannot be anything
else but the will to attain the object of the agreement. I cannot imagine
several conspirators agreeing to defraud, to restrain trade, or to commit any
indictable offence, without having the intention to reach the common goal.

I fully agree with some of the
statements that have been made by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in Rex
v. Kotyszyn[3].
The head note reads:—

There was no common design
between the accused and the policewoman, and there was no agreement between
them since the policewoman had no intention of undergoing the operation.
Consequently there was neither a conspiracy nor an attempt to
conspire.

In the same case, at page 269,
Mr. Justice MacKinnon said:—

There can be no conspiracy
when one wants to do a thing and the other does not want to do it.

Stephen (Commentaries on the laws
of England, 21st Ed., Vol. 4) says at page 166:—

The object of the agreement
may be the accomplishment of an unlawful act, or of a lawful act by unlawful
means. In other words it must be unlawful either in its aims or in its
methods.

The two elements of agreement and
of common design are specifically stated to be essential ingredients of
the crime of conspiracy. Willes, J. in Mulcahy v. The Queen[4]:

[Page 669]

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry
it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties… punishable if for a criminal object…

Vide also Rex v. McCutcheon[5].

This is not the case of the
conspirator, who after having completed the crime, withdraws from the
conspiracy. If a person, with one or several others, agrees to commit an
unlawful act, and later, after having had the intention to carry it through,
refuses to put the plan into effect, that person is nevertheless guilty,
because all the ingredients of conspiracy can be found in the accused's
conduct. But, when the conspiracy has never existed, there can be no
withdrawal.

The definition of conspiracy
itself supposes an aim. People do not conspire unless they have an object in
view. The law punishes conspiracy so that the unlawful object is not attained.
It considers that several persons who agree together to commit an unlawful act,
are a menace to society, and even if they do nothing in furtherance of their
common design, the state intervenes to exercise a repressive action, so that
the intention is not materialized, and does not become harmful to any one. The
intention must necessarily be present because it is the unlawful act
necessarily flowing from the intention, that the state wishes to prevent.

In the case at bar, there is
evidence that although he made an agreement with the respondent, Tulley never
intended to carry the plan through and kidnap Mrs. Pritchard. On the other
hand, there is also evidence that may indicate that he intended to attain the
object of the agreement. Did Tulley have this intention or not? This is a
question for the jury, and I would invade a domain which is not mine, if I
attempted to answer it.

It has been said that if the
submission of the respondent were the law, it would be impossible to obtain a
conviction on a charge of conspiracy, because the mental state of an accused
very often remains in the sphere of uncertainty. All crimes where intention is
an essential element would then become impossible to prove. Various factors
have to

[Page 670]

come into play, and with their
help it is then possible to determine what the intention was. There is a
presumption for instance, that a person who does an act intends to do it. As
well, numerous circumstances will indicate if an alleged thief intended to rob,
or if a killer intended to murder. Conspiracy is not in a different class. It
is within the exclusive province of the jury, to weigh all the evidence and to
determine all these questions of fact, and to say whether the intentional
element is revealed by the evidence.

But I do think that the jury were
not properly instructed when they were told that, even without the intention to
commit the kipnapping, which was necessarily the common design, the conspiracy
was complete by the agreement. The jury were not free to weigh the evidence
because, being improperly instructed, they had to disregard what is in my view
one of the most important elements of the crime for which the accused was
charged.

I agree with the Court of Appeal that
there was misdirection, and that consequently there must be a new trial. It has
been suggested that the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal, on
the ground that although there was misdirection, a properly instructed jury
would have necessarily come to the same conclusion. (Cr. Code 1014). With this
proposition, I entirely disagree. There is evidence that would justify a
properly instructed jury to acquit or to convict, and I do not think in either
alternative, that the verdict would be set aside as unreasonable.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RAND J.:—I agree that a conspiracy requires an actual
intention in both parties at the moment of exchanging the words of agreement to
participate in the act proposed; mere words purporting agreement without an
assenting mind to the act proposed are not sufficient. The point of difference
between the judgments below is the meaning to be given the word
""agreement"". In the opinion of Robertson J.A.[6]
there was an agreement when Tulley in effect said ""I will"" even
though at that moment his mind was ""I won't"". The mens rea here
appears to lie in the intent to utter the words ""I will""; but this
severance of the intention to speak the words from that of carrying out the
action they signify

[Page 671]

is a refinement that seems to me
to be out of place in a common law crime. Modern statutes have introduced
offences in which the objective or physical acts themselves are struck at but
they are irrelevant to the unwritten offences. Bishop's Criminal Law, 9th Ed.
Vol. II, p. 131 puts it thus:—

Obviously there must be,
between the conspirators, a concert of will and endeavor, not a mere knowledge,
acquiescence or approval or a mere several attempt to accomplish the particular
wrong…. Where there are only two, and one simply joins in appearance to draw
the other on, neither is a conspirator.

and at p. 132:—

As soon as this union of
will is perfected, the offence of conspiracy is complete,—no act beyond is
required…. It is sufficient if the minds of the parties meet understandingly so
as to bring about an intelligent and deliberate agreement to do the acts and
commit the offence charged, although such agreement be not manifested by any
formal words.

The question raised is, in my
opinion, concluded by the judgment of the House of Lords in Mulcahy v. The
Queen[7].
In that case a prosecution had been brought under The Crown and Government
Security Act, 11 Vict., c. 12. The indictment following the language of the
statute alleged that the accused with five other persons ""did feloniously
and wickedly compass, imagine, invent, devise, and intend to deprive and depose
Our Lady the Queen from the style, honour, and royal name of the Imperial Crown
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"" and proceeded to
declare that the accused did ""express, utter, and declare by divers overt
acts and deeds hereinafter mentioned, that is to say"". The overt acts were
then alleged:—

In order to fulfill, perfect
and bring to effect this felonious compassing, imagination, invention, devise
and intention aforesaid, they… feloniously and wickedly did combine, conspire,
confederate, and agree with (19 other persons all named) and with divers other
evilly disposed persons, to the jurors aforesaid unknown to raise, make, and
levy insurrection and rebellion against Our said Lady the Queen within this
realm.

The statute required the
expression of compassing and intending by overt acts and it was necessary,
therefore, to allege them. The question raised was whether a conspiracy was
such an act.

[Page 672]

The House held that it was. This
means that the act of conspiracy was sufficient to establish both the
compassing and the intention to do the forbidden act, or to put it in another
form, that in conspiracy there is not only agreement to do the act proposed signified
by words or other means of communication, but also the coexistent intent in
each to do it. If that were not so, conspiracy would not have evidenced the intention
of those charged ""to deprive and depose, etc."" The language of Willes
J. at p. 317 of the report bears out that view. In the course of considering
the argument that conspiracy rests in intention only and that an overt act must
consist in some external manifestation or deed, he says:—

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry
it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means.

In that language he distinguishes
between the intention of each person severally and the communicated assent
between them to carry out the intention. In stressing the necessity for
agreement he assumes the existence of intent.

The same view is expressed in Rex
v. Dowling[8].
It appears that one of the witnesses had in appearance been involved in the
conspiracy and it had been urged that being an accomplice his evidence required
corroboration. Erle J., in directing the jury on this, said:—

He was not an accomplice,
for he did not enter the conspiracy with the mind of a co-conspirator,
but with the intention of betraying it to the police, with whom he was in
communication.

In The Queen v. Aspinall[9],
Brett J.A., dealing with one of the counts in the indictment for conspiracy to
defraud, expressed himself thus:—

If the second count in this
indictment contains averments sufficiently stated which are enough to shew
sufficiently that the defendants unlawfully, i.e. with minds intending to do
wrong, agreed by false pretences to cheat and defraud… it sufficiently
alleges a criminal conspiracy within the last rule above enunciated.

[Page 673]

That rule was,

An agreement made with a
fraudulent or wicked mind to do that which, if done, would give to the
prosecutor a right of suit founded on fraud, or on violence exercised on or
towards him, is a criminal conspiracy.

On the contrary view, even if
both parties had been without the intent to carry out the scheme, each seeking
to incriminate the other, they would have drawn guilt upon themselves.

Assuming, then, the truth of the
evidence of Tulley that at no time did he ever intend to go along with the
proposal made to him, there was no conspiracy.

I would, therefore, dismiss the
appeal.

ESTEY, J.:—The respondent was
found guilty before a jury upon an indictment that charged that he conspired with
Tulley and others to kidnap Mrs. P. The learned judges in the Court of Appeal[10],
Mr. Justice Robertson dissenting, were of the opinion that there had been
misdirection and directed a new trial. The passage held to constitute
misdirection reads as follows:

Counsel for the accused has
suggested that the offence is not complete, because Tully, in his own evidence,
said that he had had at no time any intention of carrying out that agreement. I
tell you as a matter of law, gentlemen, that the offence was complete, if, in
point of fact, the accused and Tully did make the agreement which is charged
against him, even though Tully never at any time had any intention of carrying
the agreement into effect.

The contention is that the
learned trial judge was in error in stating that even though Tulley never, at
any time, had any intention of carrying the agreement into effect, the offence
was completed. Tulley was not charged, but was called as a witness on behalf of
the Crown. O'Brien gave evidence on his own behalf. These parties, upon all
essential points, are in complete disagreement. It is clear, however, that no
others were involved and, therefore, if there was a conspiracy, it existed only
between O'Brien and Tulley.

In view of the objection to the
charge, it will be necessary to summarize only Tulley's evidence. Early in
December O'Brien approached him and suggested, and it was agreed, that he would
assist O'Brien to kidnap Mrs. P. for the sum

[Page 674]

of $500. During one of the first
conversations he received $10. O'Brien also showed him where Mrs. P. lived and,
as Mrs. P. was standing in the window, he pointed her out as the lady he
desired to kidnap. He accompanied O'Brien to White Rock to find a house where
they might take Mrs. P., but none was found. Before Christmas he received $190.
In January he received $40 to pay for the rent of a house that he led O'Brien
to believe was available for rent. He did not, however, spend this $40, but
retained it, making a total of $240 that he had received from O'Brien and which
he kept. In January, though a day was not fixed for the kidnapping, O'Brien was
pressing that it ought to be done as quickly as possible. On January 12 Tulley
told Mrs. P. of O'Brien's intentions, which led to the arrest and prosecution
of O'Brien. Tulley deposed to the foregoing and stated that though he had
entered into an agreement with O'Brien to kidnap Mrs. P. that never, at any
time, had he intended to carry out the agreement. O'Brien denies that at any
time he entered into an agreement to kidnap Mrs. P. He admits the payment of
the three sums of money—$10, $190 and $40—but explains these in a manner that
has no relation to the kidnapping, and likewise the trips looking for the
houses.

Though dealt with in several
sections of the Criminal Code , the result is that conspiracy to commit
any indictable offence is itself an indictable offence. Nowhere, however, does
the Code define a conspiracy. The definition, therefore, must be found
in the common law. Since 1868 the accepted definition has been that of Mr.
Justice Willes in delivering the opinion of the judges in Mulcahy v. The
Queen[11]:

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry
it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means.

Mulcahy was indicted under An
Act for the better Security of the Crown and Government of the United Kingdom (11 & 12 Vict., c. 12). This statute, in part, provides that

[Page 675]

If any Person… shall, …
compass, … or intend to deprive or depose our most Gracious Lady the Queen, …
and such Compassings, … Intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or
declare, … by any overt Act or Deed, every Person so offending shall be guilty
of Felony, …

It was the contention of the
prosecution in the Mulcahy case that his conspiracy with nineteen others to
stir up and incite insurrection and rebellion constituted an overt act within
the meaning of the statute.

Mulcahy was convicted and his
conviction affirmed in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland. Upon
a further proceeding by way of writ of error his conviction came before the
House of Lords. Their Lordships solicited the opinion of the judges and this
was delivered by the Honourable Mr. Justice Willes, in the course of which he
gave expression to the definition of a conspiracy above quoted and which, as I
have said, has been accepted since 1868.

The point material to this
discussion was stated by Mr. Justice Willes at p. 316:

The main point of this
question is, whether a conspiracy to do an unlawful act in promotion of a
felonious design can be a sufficient ""overt act"" to express that
design within the 11 Vict. c. 12. The first count and the first overt act
sufficiently raise that question.

This point, particularly as it
was contended on behalf of Mulcahy that, as conspiracy rested in intention
only, it could not be an overt act within the meaning of the statute, required
a consideration of what constituted a conspiracy and, where it existed, would
it be accepted as an overt act and, if so, was it an overt act within the
meaning of the statute. The statute under which Mulcahy was indicted did not
contain a definition of conspiracy and it would appear that Mr. Justice Willes
and the learned judges on whose behalf he was writing were setting forth their
conception of conspiracy under the common law. Under this definition a
conspiracy does not exist in the mere intention to commit an unlawful act, but
when two or more entertain that intention and embody their common design in an
agreement the conspiracy is complete. It is the concluding of the agreement
which constitutes the overt act. Then, specificially referring to whether the
conspiracy constituted an overt act within the meaning of the statute, Mr.
Justice Willes stated at p. 317:

[Page 676]

The history of the statute
also points clearly to the conclusion that a conspiracy is a sufficient overt
act, and, indeed, seems to shew that the language of the Act, following that of
36 Geo. 3, c. 7, was framed to confirm, and even extend, the decisions upon the
construction of Statute of Treasons, and to preclude all such questions for the
future.

The opinion of the learned judges
expressed by Mr. Justice Willes was approved by all of their Lordships sitting
in the House of Lords. Lord Chelmsford, while approving of Mr. Justice Willes's
opinion, stated the grounds upon which he arrived at the same conclusion. At p.
328 he stated:

It is a mistake to say that
conspiracy rests in intention only. It cannot exist without the consent of two
or more persons, and their agreement is an act in advancement of the intention
which each of them has conceived in his mind. The argument confounds the secret
arrangement of the conspirators amongst themselves with the secret intention
which each must have previously had in his own mind, and which did not issue in
act until it displayed itself by mutual consultation and agreement.

Though the precise point with
which we are here concerned was not before the court in the Mulcahy case, the
language of both Mr. Justice Willes and Lord Chelmsford, it seems to me,
indicates the answer. In that case, as in all cases of felony, or, under the Code,
indictable offences, unless otherwise provided, the requisite mens rea must be
found. This can only be found, when conspiracy is charged, if the mental
attitude of the parties is such that each possesses a common design or
intention to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means. Lord
Chelmsford gives expression to the same view in the passage already quoted. In
this passage he emphasizes that it is the agreement to carry out the intention
which each has conceived in his mind. If, therefore, where only two parties are
involved, one has not ""conceived in his mind"" that intention, there
can be no agreement evidencing a common design and, therefore, the offence of
conspiracy is not completed. In this case, as it is so often throughout the
criminal law, the nature and character of the act is determined by the
intention of the party committing it.

Again in Russell on Crime, 10th
Ed., at p. 1798, it is stated:

The external or overt act of
the crime is concert by which mutual consent to a common purpose is exchanged.

[Page 677]

This further emphasizes that
there must be ""mutual consent to a common purpose"". Tulley's conduct
was undoubtedly reprehensible, whether he intended to conspire, or to obtain
money wrongfully from respondent, or to accomplish some other wrongful purpose.
We are here only concerned with whether he possessed an intention to conspire
with the respondent to kidnap Mrs. P. If he had such an intention at the time
of the agreement and subsequently withdrew, he is none the less guilty. If,
however, he never possessed a common design or intention with respondent to
kidnap Mrs. P., then there was no conspiracy.

I am, therefore, in respectful
agreement with the learned judges who have held that there was misdirection.
While there was evidence to support the verdict, it cannot be said that a jury,
properly directed, would have necessarily reached the same conclusion. I would,
therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial.

The appeal should be dismissed.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—This is an
appeal by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[12] by which the appeal of Daniel O'Brien from his
conviction of conspiracy to kidnap Joan Margaret Pritchard was allowed and a
new trial directed. Mr. Justice Bird, with whom the Chief Justice of British
Columbia agreed, delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court. Mr.
Justice Robertson dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.

O'Brien was charged in that he,
at the City of Vancouver, between November 30, 1952 and January 14, 1953:—

Did unlawfully conspire,
combine, confederate and agree together with Walter John Tulley, and together
with divers other persons unknown, to commit a certain indictable offence,
namely kidnapping, by then and there conspiring, combining, confederating and
agreeing together to unlawfully kidnap Joan Margaret Pritchard with intent to
cause her to be secretly confined within Canada against her will, against the
form of the Statute in such case made and provided.

On this charge he was tried
before Davey J. and a jury at Vancouver, found guilty and thereafter sentenced to five
years' penal servitude.

[Page 678]

O'Brien appealed to the Court of
Appeal on the ground of misdirection in the charge to the jury and it was upon
this ground that the majority of the Court considered there should be a new
trial.

It is necessary for the
determination of the matter to examine closely the evidence given on behalf of
the Crown at the trial. Tulley, referred to in the indictment, had apparently
known O'Brien for several years. On December 11, 1952, Tulley was unemployed
and apparently penniless. His evidence was that that day he met the accused in Vancouver,
when the latter asked him to go with him to a club where they had some drinks
together. At this time O'Brien told him, without mentioning her name, that he
had been going with a young woman for two years, that she had left him and that
he was trying to get her back. During the time that they were together, Tulley
said that O'Brien told him that the only way he could figure out to do this was
to kidnap her. At the same time, he said that O'Brien, learning that he was
""broke"", gave him $10. Two or three days later, the two men met by
arrangement and discussed plans for kidnapping the woman and Tulley said that
O'Brien then said that if he would ""stick with him and see him through
this thing he would do right by me in regard to money"" and mentioned the
sum of $500. According to Tulley, what O'Brien proposed was that they would
kidnap the woman and conceal her in a house and Tulley said that he thought it
would be possible to get a satisfactory place for this purpose at White Rock, a
village near the American border on the coast south of Vancouver. On
December 18, 1952, Tulley hired a U-Drive car and drove with O'Brien
to White Rock. The search there for a suitable house in which to conceal the
woman was unsuccessful and the two returned to Vancouver. Tulley told O'Brien
that he knew a fisherman in Vancouver from whom he thought they could get a
house. This statement, he admitted, was untrue and the fisherman an imaginary
person. On the day following, the two men met and Tulley asked O'Brien if he
would loan him a couple of hundred dollars. O'Brien agreed and the amount was
paid but not as a loan but rather as a payment on account of the promised sum
of $500 to assist in the 

[Page 679]

kidnapping. In spite of this
fact, Tulley said that he offered O'Brien an I.O.U. for the money but this the
latter refused, saying that he:—

Would trust me and if I
would stick with him he would stick by me, he would keep his promise.

Tulley, according to his story,
continuing the deception of O'Brien told him that he did not think he would be
able to get the fisherman's house before some time in January. Thereafter they
met several times and discussed the manner in which they were to carry out the
proposed kidnapping. O'Brien's plans according to Tulley, were that they would
go together to Mrs. Pritchard's house when Tulley was to knock on the door and
when she came seize her, put tape over her mouth, put her in the back seat of a
car and take her to the house selected.

Around New Year's Tulley says
that he borrowed a car and drove out to East
 52nd Street in Vancouver
with O'Brien and pointed out a house which, he said, he had in mind as the
place to conceal the woman and that O'Brien approved of it. Tulley said that
his statements as to this house were also false, that he had merely picked it
at random and had made no arrangements to rent it. At the same time, the two of
them discussed how they were going to get food into the house while the woman
was concealed there and, according to Tulley, O'Brien then stated that he was
going to either make her come with him or she would go back a very sorry woman.
Later that day, Tulley said that he told O'Brien that the rent of the house
would be $40 and the latter gave him the money. No arrangements had been made
to rent the place and Tulley apparently appropriated the money to his own use.
About January 12, O'Brien who had, according to Tulley, been trying to speak to
the woman on the telephone, said that they must carry out their plan at once,
whereupon Tulley decided to inform Mrs. Pritchard and her husband of what
O'Brien proposed and he was then taken in charge by the Police.

During the cross-examination of
Tulley at the trial, the statements were made which gave rise to the claim of
misdirection. The relevant portion of the evidence reads:—

Q. Now isn't it a fact that
you at no time did any more than pretend to O'Brien that you would assist him
in this kidnapping? 

A. I didn't get the
question.

[Page 680]

Q. Perhaps I can assist you.
I am going to read to you something that you said at the Preliminary Hearing. I
would direct your attention to page 39, my lord, about the fifth line from the
top of the page:

Q. You had no intention of
going through with this scheme you are telling us about, did you?

A. This kidnapping? 

Q. Yes. 

A. No.

Q. Were you asked that
question on the Preliminary Hearing and did you make the answer which I have
read to you on oath?

A. I did. 

Q. Is it true? 

A. It is. 

Q. I will proceed:

Q. No, no of course not. And
you didn't agree in any way with O'Brien that you would do such a thing, did
you?

A. Yes.

Q. You mean ""yes""
you did make such an agreement?

A. With him, yes.

Q. But you had no intention
of carrying it out?

A. No.

Q. You were just fooling
him, eh?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you asked those
questions at the preliminary hearing and did you make those answers on oath?

A. I did.

Q. Are they true?

A. They are.

Q. In other words, witness,
you were just hoaxing him, weren't you?

A. I was.

In charging the jury, the learned
trial Judge instructed them that, as a matter of law, the offence of conspiracy
was complete if in point of fact the accused and Tulley did make the agreement,
even though Tulley never at any time had any intention of carrying his part of
it into effect.

Bird J.A. considered that the
charge was in this respect inaccurate, since the burden was upon the Crown to
prove that each of the participants had the intent that the agreement should be
carried into effect by one or both of them and that since, if the quoted
portion of Tulley's evidence should be believed by the Jury, the intent was
that of O'Brien alone, he could not be found guilty of conspiracy. As the
question as to whether Tulley did in fact intend to carry out his agreement at
the time he made it had not been left to the jury, he considered there should
be a new trial.

[Page 681]

Robertson J.A. was of a contrary
opinion, considering that the gist of the offence was the agreement itself and
that as Tulley, on his own statement, had intended to make the agreement,
whether or not he intended to carry it into effect, the conspiracy was proved
if the evidence were to be believed. Agreeing with the opinion of the majority
that mens rea must be shown, he said in part:—

I think in this case mens
rea was proved by the mere entering into the agreement. If one person does the
act of agreeing with another person to commit an indictable offence, intending
to do that act (that is to say the act of agreeing) his mind is rea whether he
intends to commit that indictable offence or not. It is not of the essence
whether he has, or has not, a mental reservation as to its completion. Mens rea
is in such a case merely a condition of mind which is evidenced by the act of
agreeing itself. The guilty intent which is important is the intent to enter
into the agreement.

The charge was aid under section
573  of the Criminal Code  which reads:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not
hereinbefore provided for, conspires with any person to commit any indictable
offence.

In the same terms, this was
enacted as section 527  of the Criminal Code  when first enacted in 1892
(c. 29). Kidnapping is made an indictable offence by section 297 of the Code.

The Code does not define
either the word conspire or the offence of conspiracy. In some of the text
books and in some of the reported cases, a passage from the judgment of Willes
J. in the opinion expressed by him on behalf of the judges in Mulcahy v.
The Queen[13],
is accepted as a definition of a criminal conspiracy. In the 10th edition of
Russell on Crimes, at p. 1797, the following appears:—

The generally accepted
definition of the offence is that given by Wilkes (sic.) J. on behalf of all
the judges in Mulcahy v. R., and accepted by the House of Lords
in that and subsequent cases:—

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it
into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means.

[Page 682]

It has been said that in Quinn
v. Leatham[14],
this was accepted as a definition of the offence (R. v. Brailsford[15],
Alverstone C.J. at 746). With respect, I think this to be inaccurate since Lord
Brampton alone, of the Law Lords who considered Quinn v. Leatham,
mentioned Mulcahy's case or the extract from the judgment of Willes J.
quoted by Russell.

In my opinion, the portion of the
judgment of Willes J. above quoted was never intended as a definition of a
criminal conspiracy, rather was it a statement of the offence which was
punishable under the statute under which Mulcahy was charged. That Act
was chapter 12 of 11 Vict. being An Act for the better security of the Crown
and Government of the United
 Kingdom and amended earlier
statutes passed in the reign of Geo. III directed to the punishment of treason.
The language of the indictment followed that of the statute and charged that
the accused

Did feloniously and wickedly
compass, imagine, invent, devise and intend to deprive and depose Our
Lady the Queen.

and thereafter alleged various
overt acts. It was of the offences so charged that Willes J. employed the
language quoted by Lord Brampton in Quinn v. Leatham (and
repeated in Russell as aforesaid), but part of his remarks were omitted which
preceded and appear to me to explain the part quoted. The omitted passage reads
(p. 317):—

The argument was that a
conspiracy rests in intention only, that the law distinguishes between acts
intended and acts done; and that an overt act, to satisfy the statute, must
consist in either publishing or printing some writing, or in some bodily act or
deed, such as procuring arms.

So far as this question
depends upon the bare construction of the statute, it appears to admit of no
doubt.

It has been said that the opinion
of the judges in Mulcahy's case was approved by the House but it seems
quite clear that all that the Law Lords approved was that this part of the
opinion of Willes J. was a correct statement of the offence created by the
statute, cap. 12 of 11 Vict.

It is to be noted that in Regina v.
Dowling[16],
a prosecution under the statute under which Mulcahy and others had been
charged, Erle J. in charging the jury said (p. 514):—

[Page 683]

The indictment is divisible
into two distinct parts: first, the criminal intent: secondly, the overt acts,
by means of which such intent was carried out. The law requires proof, to the satisfaction
of the jury, that such intent existed, and that such overt acts were committed.

In the Law of Criminal
Conspiracies by R. S. Wright published in 1873, five years after the judgment
of Willes J. and that of the House of Lords in Mulcahy's case had been
delivered, the learned author said (p. 14) that no intelligible definition of
conspiracy had yet been established and an examination of the earlier
authorities supports this statement, in my opinion. After referring to the
expression used by Willes J. in Mulcahy's case above referred to, Wright
said (p. 66):—

An expression cannot be the
definition of conspiracy, the defining part of which is itself so devoid of
definiteness for the purposes for which a definition is required.

I have referred to the language
employed in the judgment in Mulcahy's case since, in the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Appeal, the part of the passage from the judgment of
Willes J. quoted by Lord Brampton in Quinn v. Leatham is given as
authority for the proposition that the intention to commit the offence of
kidnapping is of the essence of the offence charged in this case under Code
section 573. I am unable, with respect, to agree with that opinion.

It is unnecessary in disposing of
the present matter to attempt to formulate a general definition of the offence
of criminal conspiracy as it was prior to the enactment of the Criminal Code 
in 1892. In Quinn v. Leatham, before quoting the passage from the
judgment of Willes J. in Mulcahy's case, Lord Brampton said (p. 528)
that a conspiracy consists of an unlawful combination of two or more persons to
do that which is contrary to law, or to do that which is wrongful and harmful
towards another person. It is sufficient for me to say that, in my opinion, the
agreement between Tulley and O'Brien to commit the offence of kidnapping was a
conspiracy, within the meaning of this section of the Code. In agreement
with the opinion of Mr. Justice Robertson, it is my view that the gist of the
offence referred to is the agreement of two or more persons to commit any
indictable offence.

[Page 684]

This construction of the section
appears to me consistent not only with the earlier cases in England but
with the decisions of this Court in which the matter has been considered. Thus,
in the Poulterers Case[17],
it is said that a false conspiracy between divers persons shall be punished although
nothing be put in execution and that ""a man shall have a writ of
conspiracy though they do nothing but conspire together and he shall recover
damages and they may also be indicted thereof."" In Reg. v. Best[18],
it was said that the conspiracy is the gist of the indictment:—

And that though nothing be
done in prosecution of it, it is a complete and consummate offence of itself.

In O'Connell v. Reg.[19],
Tindal C.J. said in part (p. 233) :—

The crime of conspiracy is
complete if two, or more than two, should agree to do an illegal thing; that
is, to effect something in itself unlawful, or to effect, by unlawful means,
something which in itself may be indifferent or even lawful. That it was an
offence known to the common law, and not first created by the statute 33 Edw.
1, is manifest. That statute speaks of conspiracy as a term at that time well
known to the law, and professes only to be ""a definition of
conspirators"". It has accordingly been always held to be the law that the
gist of the offence of conspiracy is the bare engagement and association to
break the law, whether any act be done in pursuance thereof by the conspirators
or not.

In Reg. v. Aspinall[20],
Brett J.A. said (p. 58):—

Now, first, the crime of
conspiracy is completely committed, if it is committed at all, the moment two
or more have agreed that they will do, at once or at some future time, certain
things. It is not necessary in order to complete the offence that any one thing
should be done beyond the agreement. The conspirators may repent and stop, or
may have no opportunity, or may be prevented, or may fail. Nevertheless the
crime is complete; it was completed when they agreed.

In Brodie v. The King[21],
Rinfret J. (as he then was), in delivering the judgment of the Court said in
part (p 198):—

On a charge of conspiracy,
the agreement is itself the gist of the offence (Paradis v. The King,
1934 S.C.R. 165 at 168). The mere agreement to commit the crime is regarded by
the law sufficient to render the parties to it guilty at once of a crime
(Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th ed., p. 81).

And we need only recall the
often cited passage of Lord Chelmsford in Mulcahy v. The Queen:—

It cannot exist without the
consent of two or more persons; and their agreement is an act in advancement of
the intention which each of them has conceived in his mind.

[Page 685]

In other words, to borrow
the expression of Mr. Justice Willes (Mulcahy v. The Queen at p.
317):—""The very plot is an act in itself"". It follows that a person
may be convicted of conspiracy as soon as it has been formed and before any
overt act has been committed. The offence is complete as soon as the parties
have agreed as to their unlawful purpose (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th
ed., p. 289; Belyea v. The King, 1932 S.C.R. 279).

The contention of the Crown is
that the offence of conspiracy in this matter was complete when O'Brien and
Tulley agreed to commit the offence. Conceding that mens rea must be
shown, the Crown contends, rightly in my opinion, that an intention to offend
against the penal provisions of an Act (in this case to agree to commit an
indictable offence) constitutes mens rea (Bank of New South Wales v. Piper[22]).

It is however, said for the
respondent that if it be the case that to agree to commit an indictable offence
is punishable under section 573 of the Code, here there was no agreement since,
on Tulley's own showing, he did not intend to carry out his undertaking. Thus,
while the parties exchanged promises, to adopt the above quoted language of
Willes J., ""capable of being enforced if lawful, punishable if for a
criminal object or for the use of criminal means"", it is said there was no
agreement within the legal meaning of that expression, since Tulley never
intended to go through with the plan.

Some support for this contention
is to be found in a case of Woodworth v. State[23].
That case is relied upon to support a statement in Bishop on Criminal Law, 9th
ed. vol. 2, p. 131, that where there are only two parties and one simply joins
in appearance to draw the other on, neither is a conspirator. That statement is
followed by some further expressions of opinion as to what is necessary to
constitute an agreement to support a charge of conspiracy founded on other
American cases. In Woodworth's case, the Texas Court of Appeal considered
an appeal from a conviction under certain articles of the Penal Code of the
State of Texas. According to Willson, J. that Code defines the
offence of conspiracy to be a positive agreement entered into between two or
more persons to commit one of certain named offences. That learned judge then
proceeded to express his view as to what was the meaning to be assigned

[Page 686]

to the word ""agreement""
in the Penal Code and apparently accepted as a definition of the word one given
in Webster's Dictionary and one of several definitions given in Bouvier's Law
Dictionary. The latter publication said, inter alia, that agreement
""consists of two persons being of the same mind, intention, or meaning,
concerning the matter agreed upon"". Since the evidence supported the view
that the principal witness for the State, one Hunt, who was the only party to
the conspiracy alleged, at no time intended to commit the offence but proposed
rather to prevent its commission and was merely trying to entrap the accused,
Willson, J. considered that there was no such agreement as was contemplated by
the statute. It would appear that this decision has been followed in a case in Tennessee and
other cases in the State of Texas.

Whatever is to be said as to what
constitutes a ""positive agreement"" under the Penal Code of the State
of Texas, it is (in the absence of a statutory definition) to the common law of
this country that we must look to determine what amounts to an agreement to
commit an indictable offence. Where two or more persons declare their consent
as to any act or thing to be done or foreborne by some or one of them, it is an
agreement in the eyes of the law and the fact that one of the parties agreeing
does not intend to carry out his part of the bargain cannot affect the legal nature
of the arrangement. On the question as to whether or not an agreement has been
made, the intention of either party to carry it out is an irrelevant
consideration. If the contention of the respondent on this aspect of the matter
be analysed, it amounts simply to this that when two parties exchange promises
to do any act it is an agreement if the act to be done be lawful, but it is not
an agreement if it is unlawful and one of the parties does not intend to carry
out his part of it. This argument appears to be wholly untenable.

The cases which decide that the
evidence of police spies or agents provocateurs who, in pursuance of their duty
to suppress crime, become parties to criminal conspiracies do not, in my
opinion, assist the respondent in the present matter.

It is to be remembered that these
cases deal with the law of evidence and do not assume to deal with the legal
position of such persons endeavouring to discharge the duties 

[Page 687]

imposed upon them by their
calling who enter into agreements with others for the commission of criminal
offences. They are collected in the standard works on the law of evidence
(Phipson, 9th ed. 510: Roscoe, 16th ed. 145: Wigmore, 3rd ed. art. 2060).

The principal cases in England
dealing with the question are: R. v. Despard[24]:
Reg. v. Dowling[25]:
Reg. v. Mullins[26]:
R. v. Bickley[27].
Such persons are variously described as police spies, informers or accomplices,
though in Despard's case Lord Ellenborough said they could not be
considered as accomplices. The rule as to the corroboration of the evidence of
accomplices generally is stated in Reg. v. Stubbs[28].

That the rule does not apply to
persons who have joined in, or even provoked, the crime as police spies was
decided by this Court in Vigeant v. The King[29].
The reason that it does not apply is explained in the judgment of Lord Reading,
L.C.J. in R. v. Baskerville[30].

The question as to whether an
agent provocateur entering into an agreement such as that made between Tulley
and O'Brien would be guilty of the offence referred to in section 573 has not
been decided by any court whose decisions are binding upon us and does not
arise in this case. Robertson, J. A. expressed the view that a person so acting
on the instruction of the authorities would be excused on grounds of public policy.
In Stroud on Mens Rea, p. 14, the learned author suggests that, since whenever
the law imposes a duty it necessarily confers a right to carry out that duty,
this might afford justification.

In none of these cases is the
question considered as to whether such an arrangement made between an agent of
the police and a third person, with the design on the part of such agent merely
to entrap the other person, would in the eyes of the law be an agreement of the
nature necessary to support a charge of criminal conspiracy. The cases,
therefore, afford no support for the contention made here that

[Page 688]

what transpired between Tulley
and O'Brien was any the less such an agreement if Tulley did not intend to
carry out his part of the bargain.

In my opinion, the learned trial
judge did not misdirect the jury and I would allow this appeal and set aside
the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—The
material facts of this case appear in the reasons for judgment of my brother
Locke. In substance, the appellant O'Brien, having formed the project of
kidnapping one Mrs. X, confided it to one Tulley, with whom he was acquainted.
The two had then several meetings during which they discussed and plotted with
finality the means by which the criminal design of the appellant could be
achieved. In brief, by words, Tulley declared his consent and, thereafter, by
deeds, continued to manifest his agreement and encouragement to O'Brien as to
both means and aim. Indeed he actually pocketed money which, he admitted,
O'Brien gave him as part of the consideration agreed to between them for his
guilty participation in the execution of this criminal purpose. At trial,
Tulley admitted all these facts and more specially his corrupt participation in
the plotting of the crime, his agreement to commit it and his acceptance of the
money and he also testified that he hired a cab which he said he used with
O'Brien for the purpose of locating a house convenient for the sequestration of
the woman. He testified, however, that he never had the intention ""of
going through with this scheme"" or ""of carrying it out"". On the
basis that some credence could be given by a reasonable jury to the existence
of this alleged mental reservation as to the execution of the agreement—negatived
by his overt acts—it is contended that the trial Judge misdirected the jury in
instructing them that, in law, the offence of conspiracy was complete if, in
point of fact, the accused and Tulley did make the agreement even though the
latter ""never at any time had any intention of carrying the agreement into
effect.""

The question of law which then
falls to be determined is whether there was an indictable conspiracy if Tulley,
one of the two parties to the agreement who—motivated by a desire to extort
money from O'Brien—admittedly had the 

[Page 689]

intention and the will to and did
actually plot the commission of the crime and openly agreed to and encouraged
its commission, but had no intention to satisfy his own part of the exchanged
promises and engagements.

It is recognized in jurisprudence
and in text books that no complete and exhaustive definition of conspiracy has
yet been formulated. Generally, it is said that conspiracy is an agreement of
two or more persons to effect an unlawful purpose whether as their ultimate aim
or only as a means to it. But that the legal concept of criminal conspiracy and
the legal concept of criminal agreement are not to be confused is, I think,
sufficiently suggested by s. 266  of the Criminal Code  enacting that:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to 14 years imprisonment who conspires or
agrees with any person to murder or to cause to be murdered, any other person…

The modern law of conspiracy
stems from what is referred to as the 17th century rule. The principle is thus
formulated by Coke:—

Quando aliquid prohibetur,
prohibetur et id quod pervenitur ad illud: et affectus punitur licet non
sequatur effectus; and in these cases the common law is a law of mercy, for it
prevents the malignant from doing mischief, and the innocent from suffering it.
Coke's Reports, Vol. V, New Edition, page 101.

A similar principle underlies
these provisions of s. 69  of the Criminal Code  prescribing that he who
counsels the commission of a crime is guilty of a substantive offence even if
the offence he counselled is not committed, such substantive crime being
completed once counselling has taken place. Brousseau v. The King[31].
Furthermore, if the offence counselled is committed, the person who counselled
it is also guilty of the latter unless he has, before its commission, given a
timely, express and actual countermand or revocation of the counselling. Croft
v. The King[32].
An unmanifested change of heart on behalf of a person who has counselled is not
sufficient. In the Croft case, it may be added, there was a mutual
agreement to commit suicide, consequential to which one of the parties died.
Croft, the other party to the agreement—who could undoubtedly have been
successfully charged with criminal conspiracy, for

[Page 690]

suicide is a common law crime,
(Kenny, Outlines of criminal law, 13th edition, page 289)—was actually charged
and found guilty of the major offence of murder and this on the basis that the
agreement itself amounted to such counselling, procuring, inducing, advising or
abetting of murder as constituted the survivor an accessory before the fact if
he was not present when the other party to the agreement committed suicide.
There was no suggestion that Croft's agreement was affected by any mental
reservation with respect to the execution of the criminal purpose. But whether
or not it was leaves untouched the proposition that his participation in the
plotting of the crime and his signified agreement, his promise or engagement to
execute it were tantamount to counselling, inducing, advising the other party
to commit it. Hence, in the face of these promises and engagements amounting to
counselling, inducing, etc., mental reservation could have been no defence to
the charge of murder. And to say that, assuming the existence of such mental
reservation there would have been no conspiracy, would be tantamount to a
denial of the existence of the very ultimate foundation upon which the same
party was found guilty of the partially executed agreement.

That two or hundreds of persons
may confederate and plot in advance the commission of a crime or crimes against
another person or group of persons, or even the State, though agreeing, at the
same time, to defer to a later date the question whether such criminal plans
should at all be executed, is not an extravagant hypothesis. That such a secret
combination against the peace, though for the time being denuded of the actual
intention to commit the plotted crime or crimes, would not come within the
meaning of those which, under the principle enunciated by Coke, are indictable,
I am not ready and do not have to say for the determination of this appeal.

To the narrower proposition,
i.e., that, in the circumstances of this case, the external manifestation of
intention, this exchange of promises, of engagements and encouragements between
the parties must be treated as having never existed because of the alleged
mental reservation on the part of Tulley as to the ""going through with the
scheme"", I am unable to subscribe. An agreement is an act in the law
whereby two or more persons declare their consent as to 

[Page 691]

any act or thing to be done. Such
a declaration takes place by the concurrence of the parties in a spoken or
written form of words as expressing their common intention. Mental acts or acts
of the will, it has been said, are not the material out of which promises are
made. Hence the law, in civil matters at least, does not allow one party to
show that his intention was not in truth such as he made it or suffered it to
appear to the other party. That a different view should be adopted because of
the criminal nature of the object of the agreement in this case where Tulley,
willingly and with full appreciation of the matter, signified his agreement,
promised and took the engagement, and thus encouraged the criminal design, is
not only inconsistent with the economy of our criminal law but, in my
respectful view, unwarranted under the authorities.

Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.
9, 2nd edition, page 44:—

The gist of the offence lies
in the bare engagement and association to do an unlawful thing (i.e., a
thing contrary to or forbidden by law), whether such thing be criminal or not,
and whether any act other than the engagement or association be done by
the conspirators or not.

Russell on Crime, Tenth edition,
Vol. 2, p. 1798:—

The gist of the offence of
conspiracy then lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the purpose for which
the conspiracy is formed, nor in attempting to do them, nor in inciting others
to do them, but in the forming of the scheme or agreement between the
parties. The external or overt act of the crime is concert by which
mutual consent to a common purpose is exchanged. In an indictment, it
suffices if the combination exists and is unlawful, because it is the
combination itself which is mischievous, and which is considered to give
the public an interest to interfere by indictment.

Harris and Wilshere's Criminal
Law, 17th edition, page 45:—

The offence consists in
the combining.

In Quinn v. Leatham[33],
Lord Brampton, at page 528, said:—

The essential elements,
whether of a criminal or of an actionable conspiracy, are, in my opinion, the
same, though to sustain an action special damage must be proved.

and the learned Lord then
proceeds to quote ""as a very instructive definition of a conspiracy"",
the words of Willes J., in Mulcahy v. R.[34],
who, in delivering the unanimous

[Page 692]

opinion of himself, Blackburn J.,
Bramwell B., Keating J., and Pigott B., subsequently adopted by the House of
Lords, said:—

A conspiracy consists not
merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to
do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a
design rests in intention only it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it
into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the
parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of
criminal means… The number and the compact give weight and cause danger.

It is true these words were
uttered touching a criminal case, but they are none the less applicable to
conspiracies made the subject of civil actions like the present.

Dealing with and giving the
reasoning out of which emerged the 17th century rule and its subsequent
extension, Harrison in Law of Conspiracy, page 14, says:—

For it was a general rule of
criminal law that the gist of a crime was in the criminal intent, although it
could not be punished until the intent was manifested by some act done in
furtherance of it. Thus it was argued that in conspiracy the criminal intent
was the intent to combine to indict falsely, and this intent was
sufficiently manifested by the act of combination, that is, by the
agreement, without any carrying out of the objects of the agreement.

The case of Rex v. Kotyszyn[35],
quoted in support of respondent's contention, does not, in my respectful view,
support the proposition that the alleged mental reservation of Tulley as to the
commission of the crime of kidnapping renders the agreement, his promises and
his engagements, non-existent and without jural consequences in criminal law.
Indeed Bissonnette J., at page 202, quotes with approval the following passage
of Marchand J. in Deur v. The King:—

The principal element of the
offence of conspiracy is the plotting or agreement of two or more persons to
commit an act that is criminal in its design, or to accomplish a legitimate
purpose by criminal means, and the complete offence is committed by the
participants in the conspiracy as soon as there is an agreement between them to
commit a crime. It is not necessary that the crime, the object of the plotting,
be committed by one or the other of the conspirators. Each of them is guilty of
conspiracy as soon as he has signified his adherence to, or promised his
collaboration in, the common criminal design.

[Page 693]

In the same case, Mackinnon J.,
having also, at page 268, quoted with approval the above statement of Marchand
J., adds at page 269:—

The dealings between Mary Elm
and the respondent had advanced far past an attempt to commit a conspiracy, the
conspiracy itself having actually been accomplished.

And then he quotes what was said
by Willes J. in Mulcahy v. R.

Finally, Gagné J., at page 264,
says:—

I do not know that it is
necessary to scrutinize the intimate intention of each one of the persons. The
expression of the desire to conspire communicated to another person who
consents thereto, ought to be sufficient to incriminate the latter, even
when it might later appear that the former did not really have the intention of
doing an unlawful act. The object that she pursued in her own conscience
cannot be said to be an excuse for another. It seems to me that that is simply
good sense.

The case of Rex v. Kotyszyn
stands, besides, in quite a different category than the present. Furthermore,
the fact that, on grounds of public policy, a peace officer, for instance,
might be excused, or immuned of prosecution, for agreeing to buy drugs from a
drug pedlar agreeing to sell them, in order that the latter be successfully
brought to justice on the statutory charge of selling drugs, has not yet
authoritatively permitted the statement that, because of the honest motives of
the officer or his lack of criminal intent, there was, in criminal law, no
agreement to sell and no sale.

For the dismissal of the present
appeal, it is also said that if Tulley was charged with conspiracy and the jury
would attach credence to his story, he should in law be acquitted and that, in
such event, even if O'Brien had been previously convicted, O'Brien should be
discharged according to the practice based on the rule that one cannot conspire
alone. In this argument, I cannot find any assistance, for whether or not
Tulley should in law be acquitted on the basis of his mental reservation is a
question involved in the determination of this appeal. The question is one
which according to Kenny, Outlines of criminal law, 15th edition, page 336, in
a foot-note—has been raised, but whether as a pure academic question or in the
consideration of an actual case, the learned author does not say. Indeed, no
case in point, either in England or in Canada, has been quoted at bar nor was it possible to find
any. Hence, furthermore, whether, assuming a defence resting on mental 

[Page 694]

reservation should, contrary to
the views I hold, obtain in favour of Tulley, O'Brien—who, as implied by the
verdict of the jury, had undoubtedly not only the intention to conspire but
also the will to kidnap,—should legally benefit of the mental reservation of
Tulley with whom he had agreed, is a question which has not then been
considered in the cases where one convicted party was discharged because of the
acquittal of the other party to the conspiracy, and is moreover a question
which does not arise here in view of the conclusion I have reached as to
Tulley's legal position in the premises.

In brief, Tulley, by lending a
receptive ear to O'Brien's criminal proposition, by plotting along with him the
unlawful means by which the crime was to be committed, by promising to O'Brien
to actually join with him in its commission, by accepting money given to him by
the latter as part of the price agreed for his participation in the matter, by
hiring a cab and using it with O'Brien for the purpose of locating a house
convenient for the sequestration of the woman, has, by deeds and by words,
assented to and encouraged the design, and this whether he intended or not to
go through with it. Mental reservations are not apt to defeat the natural
consequences of words accompanied by deeds. Undoubtedly, O'Brien believed in
and was encouraged by the manifested sincerity of Tulley. In Tulley's own
words, O'Brien ""believed something he had planned himself along with
me."" Indeed and when the moment came to actually kidnap the woman, Tulley
thought it advisable, for motives of his own, to inform her husband of the plot
against her. In the Law of Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements by R. S. Wright
(London, 1873) at page 70, it is stated:—

For the rest, there seems to
be no reason to suppose that, unless perhaps in some forms of treason, the kind
of conduct necessary for making a man a party to a conspiracy differs in any
respect from that which would be necessary for making a man a party to any
other sort of criminal design. If he procures, counsels, commands or abets a
design of felony, he is involved in the guilt of the principal felon, though in
a lower degree, if the felony is not actually committed. If he procures,
counsels, commands or abets a misdemeanor, he is guilty of a misdemeanor at
common law. So there can be no doubt but that a person may involve himself in
the guilt of a conspiracy by his mere assent to and encouragement of the
design, although nothing may have been assigned or intended to be executed
by him personally.

[Page 695]

In the circumstances of this
case, I agree with Robertson J.A. of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and with my brother Locke, that the verdict of the jury should not be
disturbed and that the present appeal should be maintained.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Alleged misdirection on
doctrine of reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence—Alleged inflammatory
language by Crown counsel to jury—Criminal
Code , ss. 1014(2) , 1025 .

The appellant was found
guilty of murder. His appeal to the Court of appeal was unanimously dismissed.
He now appeals to this Court, by special leave, on grounds of misdirection with
reference to reasonable doubt, circumstantial evidence and inflammatory
language used by Crown counsel in his address to the jury.

Held (Taschereau and Abbott
JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and
a new trial ordered.

1. There was no misdirection
in the trial judge's charge with respect to the doctrine of reasonable doubt.

Per Kerwin ,C.J., Kellock,
Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: Difficulties would be avoided if
trial judges would use the well known and approved adjective
""reasonable"" or ""raisonnable"" when describing that doubt
which is sufficient to require the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.

[Page 17]

2. There was misdirection by
the trial judge with reference to the rule as to circumstantial evidence.
Neither the language of Rex v. Hodge ((1838) 2 Lewin C.C. 227) nor
anything remotely approaching it was used.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Estey J.:
Even though expressions other than the ones used in the Hodge case are
permissible, a trial judge should use the well settled formula and so obviate
questions arising as to what is its equivalent.

3. Crown counsel exceeded
his duty when he expressed in his address by inflammatory and vindictive
language his personal opinion that the accused was guilty and left with the
jury the impression that the investigation made before the trial by the Crown
officers was such that it had brought them to the conclusion that the accused
was guilty.

It is improper for counsel
for the Crown or the defence to express his own opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused. The right of the accused to have his guilt or
innocence decided upon the sworn evidence alone uninfluenced by statements of
fact by the Crown prosecutor, is one of the most deeply rooted and jealously
guarded principles of our law.

4. Per Kerwin C.J., Rand,
Kellock, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: It could not be safely affirmed
that had such errors not occurred the verdict would necessarily have been the
same.

Per Locke J.: There was a
substantial wrong and consequently s. 1014(2) of the Code had no
application.








Per Taschereau and Abbott JJ.
(dissenting) : As the verdict would have necessarily been the same there had
been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the appellant's conviction
on a 'charge .of murder.

A. E. M. Maloney, Q.C. and F. de B.
Gravel for the accused.

P. Miquelon and P. Flynn for the
respondent.



The judgment of
Kerwin C.J. and Estey J. was delivered by:—



THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—The first question of law upon which
leave to appeal to this Court was granted is:—



(1) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the doctrine of
reasonable doubt?



The trial judge,
in my view, did not misdirect the jury, but the difficulties occasioned by what
he did say would not arise if trial judges would use the well-known and

[Page 18]



approved word
""reasonable"" or ""raisonnable"" when describing that doubt
which is sufficient to enable a jury to return a verdict of not guilty.



There was clear
misdirection by the trial judge with respect to the second question of law
which the appellant was permitted to raise:—



(2) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the rule as to
circumstantial evidence?










The evidence
against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. ""In such cases"",
as this Court pointed out in The King v. Comba[2],
""by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law
in Canada, the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must
be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion
that the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are
such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the
accused is the guilty person"". This, of course, is based upon the decision
in Rex v. Hodge[3]; and,
while we stated in McLean v. The King[4], ""There
is no single exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to
employ. As a rule he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron
Alderson or its equivalent."", in this case neither that language, nor
anything remotely approaching it was used. Even though, according to the
judgment in McLean, other expressions might be permitted, the experience
of the Courts in Canada in the last few years justifies a further warning that a
trial judge should use the well settled formula and so obviate questions
arising as to what is its equivalent. Because of the misdirection in this case,
the conviction cannot stand, unless the Court, exercising the power conferred
upon it by s.s. 2 of s. 1014  of the Criminal Code , considers that there
has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.



Before dealing
with that problem, it is well to set out the third question of law which the
appellant was allowed to argue:—



(3) Was
the appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the fact that
the crown counsel used inflammatory language in his address to the jury?

[Page 19]



It is the duty of
crown counsel to bring before the Court the material witnesses, as explained in
Lemay v. The King[5]. In
his address he is entitled to examine all the evidence and ask the jury to come
to the conclusion that the accused is guilty as charged. In all this he has a
duty to assist the jury, but he exceeds that duty when he expresses by
inflammatory or vindictive language his own personal opinion that the accused
is guilty, or when his remarks tend to leave with the jury an impression that
the investigation made by the Crown is such that they should find the accused
guilty. In the present case counsel's address infringed both of these rules.










I now turn to s.s.
2 of s. 1014 of the Code. The test to be applied was laid down in Schmidt
v. The King[6]:
""that the .onus rests on the crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same"". While I am inclined to the view
that that test has been met, I understand that several members of the Court
think other-wise and, therefore, under the circumstances of this case, I will
not record a dissent.



The judgment of
Taschereau and Abbott JJ. (dissenting)
was delivered by:‑



TASCHEREAU,
J.:‑L'appelant a été accusé d'avoir assassiné un nommé Georges Jabour
Jarjour, à St-Henri, comté de Lévis, le 3 juin 1951, et a été trouvé coupable
de meurtre à la suite d'un procès devant le jury, présidé par l'honorable Juge
Albert Sévigny. La Cour du Banc de la Reine[7] a unanimement confirmé ce
verdict. Après avoir obtenu la permission de l'honorable Juge Kellock de la
Cour Suprême du Canada, l'appelant a inscrit la présente cause devant cette
Cour. Ses griefs d'appel sont les suivants:‑



1.
Le juge dans son adresse aux jurés, ne les a pas légalement instruits sur la
doctrine du doute raisonnable.



2.
La règle qui doit être suivie dans le cas de preuve circonstantielle [sic] n'a
pas été suffisamment expliquée.



3.
L'accusé n'a pas obtenu un procès équitable eu égard aux faits de la cause,
étant donné que l'avocat de la Couronne, dans son adresse aux jurés, a fait
usage d'un langage enflammé.

[Page 20]



Je suis
d'opinion que le premier motif d'appel n'est pas fondé. Un résumé de ce que le
président du tribunal a exprimé à maintes reprises sur le doute que peuvent
entretenir les jurés, se trouve dans l'extrait suivant de son adresse : ‑



Si
la Couronne ne prouve pas le fait, le crime, de façon à établir une certitude
morale, une certitude qui donne la conviction à l'intelligence, une certitude
qui satisfait la raison et dirige le jugement à rendre, et que les jurés ont un
doute sérieux sur la culpabilité de l'accusé, c'est leur devoir et ils sont
obligés de donner le bénéfice de ce doute à l'accusé et de le déclarer
non coupable.



Évidemment,
le jury a nécessairement compris par ces mots, qu'il devait être satisfait de
la culpabilité de l'accusé, au delà d'un doute raisonnable. Sinon, ce dernier
devait en avoir le bénéfice et être déclaré non coupable.










Le
second grief est plus sérieux. Depuis au delà de cent ans, la règle concernant
la, direction qui doit être donnée aux jurés lorsqu'il s'agit de preuve
circonstantielle, a été posée clans la cause de Hodge[8]. S'adressant aux jurés, le
Baron Alderson s'est exprimé ainsi:



That before
they could find the prisoner guilty they must be satisfied, not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must
also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.



Cette
jurisprudence a depuis été suivie, et il suffit de référer aux causes suivantes
pour se convaincre qu'elle a été constante:-(Wills on Circumstantial
Evidence (7th ed. pp. 320 and 321) Rex. v. Natanson[9], Rex. v. Francis and
Barber[10], Rex. v. Petrisor[11], MacLean v. The King[12].



Malgré
que les tribunaux se sont montrés très sévères sur la nécessité qu'il y a
d'instruire le jury clans le sens indiqué dans la cause de Hodge, il ne
s'ensuit pas que la formule soit sacramentelle, et que l'accusé aura droit à un
nouveau procès si les termes exacts ne sont pas employés. (MacLean v. The
King supra) 'Ce serait exiger un trap grand formalisme, et le droit
criminel ne va pas jusque là. Il faut cependant retrouver dans les paroles du
juge au procès, au moins l'équivalent, qui fera comprendre aux jurés que dans

[Page 21]



une cause
comme celle qui nous occupe, où la preuve est circonstantielle, pour trouver un
accusé coupable, ils doivent être satisfaits non seulement que les
circonstances sont compatibles avec sa culpabilité, mais qu'elles sont
aussi, incompatibles avec toute autre conclusion rationnelle.



Malheureusement,
l'équivalent de cette directive qui doit être nécessairement donnée, ne l'a pas
été. Le savant président du tribunal a bien attiré l'attention du jury sur la
preuve circonstantielle; il leur a bien dit qu'elle devait être forte et
convaincante, mais il n'a pas, à mon sens, expliqué la véritable doctrine que
j'ai citée plus haut et qu'exige la loi.










L'appelant
prétend enfin que la procureur de la 'Couronne, au cours de son adresse au
jury, a fait usage d'un langage enflammé en faisant appel à leurs passions,
avec le résultat qu'ils auraient été entraînés à ne pas juger cette cause comme
des hommes raisonnables.



La
situation qu'occupe l'avocat de la Couronne n'est pas celle de l'avocat en
matière civile. Ses fonctions sont quasi-judiciaires. Il ne doit pas tant
chercher à obtenir un verdict de culpabilité qu'à assister le juge 'et le jury
pour que la justice. la plus complète soit rendue. La modération et
l'impartialité doivent toujours être les caractéristiques de sa conduite devant
le tribunal. Il aura en effet honnêtement rempli son devoir et sera à l'épreuve
de tout reproche si, mettant de côté tout appel aux passions, d'une façon digne
qui convient à son rôle, il expose la preuve au jury sans aller au delà de ce
qu'elle a révélé.



Je suis
donc 'd'opinion qu'en ce qui concerne les directives du président du tribunal,
relatives à la preuve circonstantielle, il y a eu erreur 'de droit. Je crois
également, après avoir analysé l'adresse au jury du procureur de la Couronne,
qu'il y a eu exagérration de langage. Mais je ne crois pas que ces deux motifs
soient suffisants pour ordonner un nouveau procès. L'article 1014  du Code
Criminel  est ainsi rédigé, et je pense que dans les circonstances de cette
cause, il doit trouver toute son application :



1014.
A l'audition d'un pareil appel d'un' jugement de culpabilité, la cour d'appel
doit autoriser le pourvoi, si elle est d'avis



a)
Qu'il y a lieu d'infirmer le verdict du jury pour le motif qu'il est injuste ou
non justifié par la preuve; ou



b)
Qu'il y a lieu d'annuler le jugement du tribunal à cause d'une décision erronée
sur un point de droit; ou

[Page 22]



c)
Que, pour un motif quelconque, il y a eu déni de justice; et (d) Dans
tout autre cas, la cour doit renvoyer l'appel.



2.
La cour peut aussi renvoyer l'appel si, malgré son avis que l'appel pourrait
être décidé en faveur de l'appelant, pour l'un des motifs susmentionnés, elle
est aussi d'avis qu'il ne s'est produit aucun tort réel ou déni de justice.










Il ne
me paraît pas utile d'analyser les faits que la preuve a révélés au cours du
procès. Il sera suffisant de dire qu'à sa lecture, je me suis convaincu que
même si la directive du juge eut été conforme à la loi, et si le procureur de
la Couronne eut fait usage d'un langage plus modéré, le verdict aurait été nécessairement
le même. Je suis satisfait qu'il n'y a eu aucun déni de justice et que
l'accusé n'a subi aucun tort réel. Gouin
v. The King[13];
Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions[14];
Schmidt v. The King[15].



Je
rejetterais l'appel.



RAND
J.:‑Three grounds of appeal were taken : an error in the charge as it
dealt with the burden of proof on the Crown; a failure to give an instruction
on the test required for circumstantial evidence; and certain statements of
Crown counsel in his address to the jury.



The
first ground can be disposed of shortly. The words objected to were ""hors
de tout doute sérieux"". Whatever difference there is between this and the
usual formula was swept away by subsequent language with which the jurors were
at least more familiar: they must have ""une absolue certitude de la vérité
de l'accusation qu'ils ont à juger""; other expressions were to the same
effect. The instruction, as a whole, was more favourable to the accused than is
customary.



The
rule as to the sufficiency of proof by circumstances is that the facts relied
on must be 'compatible only with guilt and admittedly no instruction of that
nature expressly or in substance was given. The purpose of the rule is that the
jury should be made alive to the possibility that the material facts might be
given a rational explanation other than that of items plotting the course of
guilty action. I think it should have been given, and I cannot say that the
charge as a whole supplied its omission.

[Page 23]



There
are finally the statements of counsel, which I confine to those dealing with
the investigation by the Crown of the circumstances of a crime:



C'est
le devoir de la Couronne, quand une affaire comme celle-là arrive, n'importe
quelle affaire, et encore plus dans une affaire grave, de faire toutes les
recherches possibles, et si au cours de ces recherches avec nos experts on en
vient à la conclusion que l'accusé n'est pas coupable ou qu'il y a un doute
raisonnable, c'est le devoir de la Couronne, messieurs, de le dire ou si on en
vient à la conclusion qu'il n'est pas coupable, de ne pas faire d'arrestation. Ici, c'est ce qu'on a fait.



Quand
la Couronne a fait faire cette preuve-là, ce n'est pas avec l'intention
d'accabler l'accusé, c'était avec l'intention de lui rendre justice.










Many,
if not the majority of, jurors acting, it may be, for the first time,
unacquainted with the language and proceedings of courts, and with no precise
appreciation of the role of the prosecution other than as being associated with
government, would be extremely susceptible to the implications of such remarks.
So to emphasize a neutral attitude on the part of Crown representatives in the
investigation of the facts of a crime is to put the matter to unsophisticated
minds as if there had already been an impartial determination of guilt by
persons in authority. Little more likely to colour the consideration of the
evidence by jurors could be suggested. It is the antithesis of the impression
that should be given to them: they only are to pass on the issue and to do so
only on what has been properly exhibited to them in the course of the
proceedings.



It is
difficult to reconstruct in mind and feeling the court room scene when a human
life is at stake; the tensions, the invisible forces, subtle and unpredictable,
the significance that a word may take on, are sensed at best imperfectly. It is
not, then, possible to say that this reference to the Crown's action did not
have a persuasive influence on the jury in reaching their verdict. The
irregularity touches on( of the oldest principles of our law, the rule that
protects the subject from the pressures of the executive and has it safeguard
in the independence of our courts. It goes to the foundation of the security of
the individual under the rule of law.



It
cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to
obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be
credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. Counsel

[Page 24]



have a
duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented: it should
be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done
fairly. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion 'of winning or losing; his
function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none
charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed
with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of
judicial proceedings.



The
answer of the Crown is that notwithstanding these objectionable features, there
has been no substantial miscarriage of justice; that the proof of guilt is
overwhelming and that the jury, acting judicially, must necessarily have come
to the same verdict.










Sec.
1014(2)  of the Criminal Code  provides that the Court



may
also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any
of the grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.



By sec.
1024 this Court, on an appeal, shall



make
such rule or order thereon in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a
new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the
justice of the case requires .. .



It will
be seen that under the former section the Court is to exercise its discretion
in the light of all the circumstances. Appreciating to the full the
undesirability, for many reasons, of another trial, I find myself driven to
conclude that nothing short of that will vindicate the fundamental safe-guards
to which the accused in this case was entitled.



The
conviction, therefore, must be set aside and a new trial directed.



LOCKE
J.:‑I have had the advantage of reading the reasons to be delivered in
this matter by my brother Cartwright. I agree with what he has said in regard
to the first and second questions of law. The failure to direct the jury upon
what may be called the rule in Hodge's case appears to me to be directly
contrary to the unanimous decision of this Court in Lizotte v. The King[16].

[Page 25]



Upon the third
question, I have this to say. It has always been accepted in this country that
the duty of per-sons entrusted by the Crown with prosecutions in criminal
matters does not differ from that which has long been recognized in England.



In Regina v.
Thursfield[17], counsel
for the Crown stated what he considered to be his ,duty in the following terms:



that he
should state to the jury the whole of what appeared on the depositions to be
the facts of the case, as well those which made in favour of the prisoner as
those which made against her, as he apprehended his duty, as counsel for the
prosecution, to be, to examine the witnesses who would detail the facts o the
jury, after having narrated the circumstances in. such way as to make the
evidence, when given, intelligible to the jury, not considering himself as
counsel for any particular side or party.










Baron Gurney, who
presided, then said:



The learned
counsel for the prosecution has most accurately conceived his duty, which is to
be assistant o the Court in the furtherance of justice, and not to act as
counsel for any particular person or party.



In Regina v.
Ruddick[18], decided
just after the passage of Denman's Act, Crompton J. said (p. 499):



I hope that
in the exercise of the privilege granted by the new Act to counsel for the
prosecution of summing up the evidence, they will not cease to remember that
counsel for the prosecution in such cases are to regard themselves as ministers
of justice, and not to struggle for a conviction, as in a case at Nisi Prius‑nor
be betrayed by feelings of professional rivalry‑to regard the question at
issue as one of professional superiority, and a contest for skill and
preeminence.



An article entitled
""The Ethics of Advocacy"", written by Mr. Showell Rogers, appears in
Vol. XV of the Law Quarterly Review at p. 259, in which the cases upon this
subject are reviewed and discussed. Speaking of the principles above referred
to, the author says:



Any one who
has watched the administration of the criminal law in this country knows how
loyally-one might almost say how religiously-this principle is observed in
practice. Counsel for the Crown appears o be anything rather than the advocate
of the particular private prosecutor who happens to be proceeding in the name
of the Crown. When there is no private prosecutor, and the proceedings are in
the most literal sense instituted by the Crown itself, the duty of prosecuting
counsel in this respect is even more strictly to be performed.



These are the
principles which have been accepted as defining the duty of counsel for the
Crown in this country.

[Page 26]



In Rex v.
Chamandy[19], Mr.
Justice Riddell, speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, put it this way (p.
227):



It cannot be
made too clear, that in our law, a criminal prosecution is not a contest
between individuals, nor is it a contest between the Crown endeavouring to
convict and the accused endeavouring to be acquitted; but it is an
investigation that should be conducted without feeling or animus on the part of
the prosecution, with the single view of determining the truth.










In the last
Edition of Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, p. 194, the
learned author says that prosecuting counsel should regard themselves rather as
ministers of justice assisting in its administration than as advocates.



It is improper, in
my opinion, for counsel for the Crown to express his opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused. In the article to which I have referred it is said
that it is because the character or eminence of a counsel is to be wholly
disregarded in determining the justice or other-wise of his client's cause that
it is an inflexible rule of forensic pleading that an advocate shall not, as
such, express his personal opinion of or his belief in his client's case.



In an address by
the late Mr. Justice Rose, which is reported in Vol. XX of the Canadian Law
Times at p. 59, that learned Judge, referring to Mr. Rogers' article, pointed
out a further objection to any such practice in the following terms:‑



Your duty to
your client does not call for any expression of your belief in the justice of
his cause ... The counsel's opinion may be right or wrong, but it is not
evidence. If one counsel may assert his belief, the opposing counsel is put at
a disadvantage if he does not state that in his belief his client's cause or
defence is just. If one counsel is well known and of high standing, his client
would have a decided advantage over his opponent if represented by a younger,
weaker, or less well known man.



In my opinion,
these statements accurately define the duty ,of Crown counsel in these matters.



An extract from
one of the passages taken from the address of counsel for the Crown by my
brother Cartwright reads:‑



C'est
le devoir de la Couronne, quand une affaire comme celle-là arrive, n'importe
quelle affaire, et encore plus dans une affaire grave, de faire toutes les
recherches possibles, et si au cours de ces recherches avec nos experts on en
vient à la conclusion que l'accusé n'est pas coupable ou

[Page 27]



qu'il
y a un doute raisonnable, c'est le devoir de la
Couronne, messieurs, de le dire ou si on en vient à la conclusion qu'il n'est
pas coupable, de ne pas faire d'arrestation. Ici, c'est ce qu'on a fait.



These
are statements of fact and not argument and, in making them, counsel for the
Crown was giving evidence. The matters stated were wholly irrelevant and, had
the counsel in question elected to go into the witness box to make these
statements on oath, the proposed evidence would not have been heard. In this
manner, however, these facts were submitted to the jury for their
consideration.










The
statements were calculated to impress upon the jury the asserted fact that,
before the accused had been arrested, the Crown, with its experts, had made a
thorough investigation and was satisfied that he was guilty beyond a
reason-able doubt. Introduced into the record in this manner, there could be no
cross-examination to test their accuracy.



The
address of Crown counsel to the jury ended in this manner:‑



On
voit tous les jours des crimes encore plus nombreux que jamais, des vols et
bien d'autre chose, au moins celui qui vole à main armée ne fait pas souffrir
sa victime comme Boucher a fait souffrir Jabour. C'est un crime révoltant d'un
homme dans toute la force de l'âge, d'un athlète contre un vieillard de 77 ans
qui n'est pas capable de se défendre. J'ai un peu respect pour ceux qui volent
quand au moins ils ont donné une chance à leur victime de se défendre, mais
j'ai aucune sympathie, aucune et je vous demande de n'en pas avoir, aucune
sympathie pour ces lèches qui frappent des hommes, des amis. Jabour n'était
peut-être pas un ami, mais c'était un voisin, du moins ils se connaissaient.



Lâchement,
à coups d'hache.‑Et, si vous rapportez un verdict de coupable, pour une
fois ça me ferait presque plaisir de demander la peine de mort contre lui.



The
Crown prosecutor, having improperly informed the jury that there had been an
investigation by the Crown which satisfied the authorities that the accused was
guilty, thus assured them on his own belief in his guilt and employed language
calculated to inflame their feelings against him.



In
Nathan House[20], where a conviction was quashed on the three grounds of
misreception of evidence, misdirection and the conduct of counsel, Trevethin,
L.C.J., referring to the fact that counsel for the Crown had made an appeal to
religious prejudice in his address to the jury, said that

[Page 28]



the language
complained of was highly improper and that it was impossible to. say that it
could not have influenced the jury.



In 'delivering the
judgment of the House of Lords in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions[21],
Lord Sankey, L.C. said in part (p. 176) :‑










... it must
be remembered that the whole policy of English criminal law has been to see
that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed and that no
rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of the jury fairly trying the true
issues.



The right of the
accused in this matter to have his guilt or innocence decided upon the sworn
evidence alone, uninfluenced by statements of fact by the Crown prosecutor
bearing directly upon the question of his guilt, and to have the case against
him stated in accordance with the fore-going principles, were rights which may
be properly described, to adopt the language of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell's
case, as being two ""of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded
principles of our criminal law.""



The infringement
of these rights was, in my opinion, a substantial wrong, within the meaning of
section 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code , and accordingly that provision
has no application to this case: Makin v. Attorney General for New South
Wales[22];
Allen v. The King[23];
Northey v. The King[24].



I would allow this
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict at the
trial and direct that there be a new trial.



The judgment of
Kellock, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by



CARTWRIGHT
J.:-This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
Appeal Side[25],
pronounced on the 15th day of June, 1954, dismissing the appeal of the
appellant from his conviction on a charge of murder at his trial before Sevigny
C.J. and a jury on the 15th of January, 1954.

[Page 29]



The appeal is
brought pursuant to leave granted by my brother Kellock. The questions of law
upon which leave to appeal was granted are as follows:



(i) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the doctrine of
reasonable doubt? -



(ii) Were the
jury misdirected by the learned trial judge with reference to the rule as to
circumstantial evidence?










(iii) Was the
appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the fact that the
crown counsel used inflammatory language in his address to the jury?



As to the first
question, I am of opinion that when all that was said by the learned Chief
Justice in his charge to the jury as to the onus resting upon the Crown and as
to the accused being entitled to the benefit of the doubt is considered as a
whole it cannot be said that there was misdirection on this point. I do,
however, venture to make the respectiful suggestion that it would be well if
trial judges when describing to the jury the doubt the existence of which
prevents them from returning a verdict of guilt would refrain from substituting
other adjectives for the adjective ""reasonable"" which has been so
long established as the proper term to employ in this connection.



As to the second
question of law on which leave to appeal was granted, it is common ground that
the evidence against the appellant was wholly circumstantial. It is clear that
throughout his charge the learned Chief Justice failed to direct the jury that
before they could find the appellant guilty on such evidence they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances proved were consistent with his having
committed the crime but also that they were inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the appellant was the guilty person. The rule
requiring the giving of such a direction to the jury, usually referred to as
the rule in Hodge's Case[26], has
been long established and it is necessary to refer only to the following
authorities. In McLean v. The King[27], the
following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court appears at page 690:



It is of last
importance, we do not doubt, where the evidence adduced by the Crown is solely
or mainly of what is commonly described as circumstantial, that the jury should
be brought to realize that they ought not to find a verdict against the accused
unless convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the
only reasonable explanation of the facts established by the evidence. But there is no

[Page 30]



single
exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule
he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron Alder-son or its
equivalent.



In The
King v. Comba[28], Duff C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court said
at page 397:










It is
admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a
basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of
the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a
prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the
circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was
committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the
guilty person.



It is however
desirable to point out, as was done by Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Comba[29],
that the rule in Hodge's case is quite distinct from the rule
requiring a direction on the question of reasonable doubt.



On this point I do
not find it necessary to quote from the charge of the learned Chief Justice in
the case at bar as I understand that all members of the 'Court agree that there
was a failure to give the necessary direction.



As to the third
question of law on which leave to appeal was granted, it appears that in the
course of his address to the jury counsel for the Crown said:



Le
docteur nous dit au sujet du sang,-on nous a fait un reproche messieurs parce
que nous avons fait faire une analyse du sang. Mais la Couronne n'est pas ici
pour le plaisir de faire condamner des innocents.



C'est
le devoir de la Couronne, quand une affaire comme celle-là arrive, n'importe
quelle affaire, et encore plus dans une affaire grave, de faire toutes les
recherches possibles, et si au cours de ces recherches avec nos experts on en
vient à la conclusion que l'accusé n'est pas coupable ou qu'il y a un doute
raisonable, c'est le devoir de la Couronne, messieurs, de le dire ou si on en
vient à la conclusion qu'il n'est pas coupable, de ne pas faire d'arrestation.
Ici, c'est ce qu'on a fait.



Counsel for the
Crown concluded his address to the jury as follows:



On
voit tous les jours des crimes encore plus nombreux que jamais, des vols et
bien d'autre chose, au moins celui qui vole à main armée ne fait pas souffrir
sa victime comme Boucher a fait souffrir Jabour. C'est un crime révoltant d'un
homme dans toute la force de l'âge, d'un athlète contre un vieillard de 77 ans
qui n'est pas capable de se défendre. J'ai un peu respect pour ceux qui volent
quand au moins ils ont donné une chance à leur victime de se défendre, mais
j'ai aucune sympathie, aucune et je vous demande de n'en pas avoir, aucune
sympathie pour ces lâches qui frappent des hommes, des amis. Jabour n'était
peut-être pas un ami, mais c'était un voisin, du moins ils se connaissaient.

[Page 31]



Lâchement,
à coups d'hache.-Et, si vous rapportez un verdict de coupable, pour une fois ça
me ferait presque plaisir de demander la peine de mort contre lui.










There
are a number of other passages in the address of this counsel to the jury which
I do not find it necessary to quote as I think they can be fairly summarized by
saying that counsel made it clear to the jury not only that he was submitting
to them that the conclusion which they should reach on the evidence was that
the accused was guilty, a submission which it was of course proper for him to
make, but also that he personally entertained the opinion that the accused was
guilty.



There
is no doubt that it is improper for counsel, whether for the Crown or the
defence to express his own opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.



The
grave objection to what was said by counsel is that the jury would naturally
and reasonably understand from his words first quoted above that he, with the
assistance of other qualified persons, had made a careful examination into the
facts of the case prior to the trial and that if as a result of such
investigation he entertained any reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt a
duty rested upon him as Crown counsel to so inform the Court. As, far from
expressing or suggesting the existence of any such doubt in his mind, he made
it clear to the jury that he personally believed the accused to be guilty, the
jury would reasonably take from what he had said that as the result of his
investigation outside the court room Crown counsel had satisfied himself of the
guilt of the accused. The making of such a statement to the jury was clearly
unlawful and its damaging effect would, in my view, be even greater than the
admission of illegal evidence or a statement by Crown counsel to the jury
either in his opening address or in his closing address of facts as to which
there was no evidence.



I conclude
that in regard to both the second and third questions on which leave to appeal
was granted there was error in law at the trial and that accordingly the appeal
should be allowed unless this is a case in which the Court should apply the
provisions of section 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 32]



The
subsection mentioned has often been considered in this Court and, in the view
that I take of the evidence, it is sufficient to refer to the judgment of
Kerwin J., as he then was, in Schmidt v. The King[30]:










The meaning
of these words has been considered in this Court in several cases, one of which
is Gouin v. The King, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests
on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been
the same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly
admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set
forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director of
Public Prosecutions, i.e., that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may
dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice
has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a
reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly
admissible, with-out doubt convict.



As there is to be
a new trial, I will, in accordance with the established practice of the Court,
refrain from discussing the evidence and will simply state my opinion that it
cannot be safely affirmed that the jury, had they been properly directed as to
the rule in Hodge's case and had the improper remarks of Crown counsel
not been made, would necessarily have convicted the appellant. This makes it
unnecessary for me to consider the submission of counsel for the appellant,
that even if the Court should be of opinion that had the trial been free from
the errors in law dealt with above the jury would necessarily have convicted
the appellant the 'conviction should nonetheless be quashed because these
errors were of so fundamental a character that the appellant was deprived of
his right to the verdict of a jury following a trial according to law and such
deprivation is of necessity 'a substantial wrong, an argument which would have
required a 'careful examination of the judgments in such cases as Allen v.
The King[31] and
Northey v. The King[32].



Having concluded
that there was error in law at the trial in regard to both the second and third
questions on which leave to appeal was granted and that this is not a case in
which it can be said that had such errors not occurred the verdict would necessarily
have been the same it follows that the conviction must be quashed.



I would allow the
appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal
allowed; conviction quashed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT
OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Murder—Charge to jury—Plea of insanity—Possible verdicts—Alleged illegal
cross-examination of accused—Whether miscarriage of justice—Criminal Code , ss.
1014(2) , 1025 .

The appellant was
convicted of murder. His appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of
Appeal. He now appeals to this Court, by leave granted under s. 1025  of the Criminal
Code -, on grounds that the trial judge erred (a) in his instructions
as to the possible verdicts and in omitting to mention the possibility of a
disagreement, and (b) in his instructions as to the plea of insanity and
in his statement of the evidence in support thereof. Subsequently, of its own
motion, the Court ordered a new hearing on a point dealing with an alleged
improper cross-examination of the accused as to statements made to the police
but not proved to have been voluntarily made.

Held (Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. dissenting),
that the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Abbott
JJ.: There is no obligation upon a trial judge to explain to the jury that they
may disagree.

The trial judge had adequately
presented the issue of insanity and the evidence in support thereof.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Abbott JJ. : Assuming
that the cross-examination was improper, there was no duty on the trial judge
in the circumstances to point out to the jury that this was not evidence. There
had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, even if the trial
judge should have gone into the matter.

Per Rand J.: Assuming that the statements were
inadmissible, there had been no miscarriage of justice since the remaining
evidence was so overwhelming and conclusive.

Per Kellock J.: Such a statement could not be used
even in cross-examination until its voluntary nature had been established.
However, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred since the
cross-examination simply brought out in more detail what was involved in the
evidence not objected to.

Per Estey J.: Assuming that the cross-examination was
improper, there had been no miscarriage of justice since any of the suggestions
made in the course of the cross-examination were either contained in or
directly implied in statements already in evidence.

Per Locke and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting): The right to
disagree was not excluded in the trial judge's charge.

[Page 121]

The trial judge had adequately
presented the issue of insanity, but not the medical theory of the defence.

Per Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting) :
The trial judge should not have permitted the statements to be used in
cross-examination without first having decided as to their free and voluntary
character. The avowed purpose of the cross-examination was to destroy the
factual basis, i.e. the lack of memory of the accused, upon which the medical
expert for the defence mainly rested his opinion as to the insanity of the
accused. It is impossible to affirm that had this illegal cross-examination not
taken place, the jury would necessarily have convicted the appellant.

APPEAL from the
judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of murder.

L. Corriveau for the appellant.

N. Dorion
Q.C., P. Miquelon Q.C. and P.
Flynn for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Abbott JJ. was
delivered by :

The Chief Justice:—The appellant was
convicted of having murdered one of his children and his appeal to the Court of
Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec 2 was dismissed unanimously. By leave granted by
Mr. Justice Estey under s. 1025  of the Criminal Code  he was given
permission to appeal to this Court on the following points of law:—

(a) Did the learned
trial judge err in his instructions relative to the possible verdicts the jury
might render and, in particular, in omitting to mention the possibility of
their disagreeing?

(b) Did the learned trial judge err in his
instructions relative to the plea of insanity and his statement of the evidence
in support thereof?

There appears to be no doubt that he killed not only the one
child referred to, but his other three children. The defence was insanity and
the accused gave evidence on his own behalf and also called Dr. Moffatt.

[Page 122]

As to the first
point,—The learned trial judge in a careful charge explained that any verdict
had to be unanimous and also that there were four possible verdicts:—

(1) Coupable;

(2) Coupable
d'homicide involontaire;

(3) Non coupable;

(4) Non coupable
pour cause de folie.

Reliance was placed upon what was said in this Court in Latour
v. The King 3.
In that case a new trial was directed for certain reasons and then the judgment
continued with the following obiter dictum at p. 30:

The other matter in
which comments may be added, although the point was not raised by the
appellant, is related to the following direction given to the jury:

This is an important
case and you must agree upon a verdict. This means that you must be unanimous.

This is all that was
said on the subject. If one of the jurors could have reasonably understood from
this direction—and it may be open to such construction—that there was an
obligation to agree upon a verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it
is not only the right but the duty of a juror ""to disagree if, after full
and sincere consideration of the facts of the case, in the light of the
directions received on the law, he is unable conscientiously to accept, after
honest discussion with his colleagues, the views of the latter. To render a
verdict, the jurors must be unanimous but this does not mean that they are
obliged to agree, but that only a unanimity of views shall constitute a verdict
bringing the case to an end. The obligation is not to agree but to co-operate
honestly in the study of the facts of a case for its proper determination
according to law.

The terse manner in
which the trial judge in that case had referred to the matter is to be noted.
In the present instance the trial judge made it quite clear to the jury what
were their duties. He stated, more than once, that they must be unanimous and
again, more than once, explained the various conclusions at which they could
unanimously arrive. These conclusions are the verdicts enumerated above. To
give effect to the appellant's argument would mean that a trial judge should
invite a jury to disagree. This is a far different matter from an intimation,
veiled or otherwise, that, notwithstanding the views of one or more jurors, it
was necessary that one of certain defined conclusions be arrived at, or
verdicts returned. After going over the trial judge's charge in its entirety, I
am satisfied that there is no basis for the argument on the first point.

[Page 123]

The second ground of
appeal is divisible into two parts, the first of which is: Did the trial judge
err in his instructions relative to the plea of insanity? Our attention was
called to what was said in the charge at p. 617 of the record,—

Et, ici encore, la defense doit apporter une preuve qui vous
satisfasse raisonnablement par sa prépondérance, que l'accusé était en somme
dans cet état d'esprit exigé par l'article 19.

and objection is raised to the words ""par sa
prépondérance"". As to this, reliance was placed upon the following
statement of Anglin J. in Clark v. The King 4:

No doubt, however,
""proved"" in subsecticon 3 of section 19 of our Code must mean
""proved to the satisfaction of the jury"", which, in turn, means to
its reasonable satisfaction.

and to this extract
from the reasons of Mignault J. at p. 632:

I would therefore think
that a proper direction would be to call the attention of the jury to the legal
presumption of sanity and to inform them, the onus being on the accused, that
insanity must be proved by him to their satisfaction. Further than that I would
not go.

However, at p. 626,
Anglin J. stated that he found nothing ""to warrant requiring evidence of
greater weight than would ordinarily satisfy a jury in a civil case that a
burden of proof had been discharged—that, balancing the probabilities upon the
whole case, there was such a preponderance of evidence as would warrant them as
reasonable men in concluding that it had been established that the accused when
he committed the act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality,
or if he did know it, did not know that he was doing what was wrong."" And
earlier on the same page of his reasons (632), Mignault J. had stated that proof
in ordinary matters did not suppose that the evidence removed all doubt;
""it is the result"", he continued, ""of a preponderance of
evidence, or of the acceptance on reasonable grounds of one probability in
preference to another, and, in the case of insanity, the evidence generally is
largely a matter or expert opinion"". Duff J., with the concurrence of Brodeur J., referred to the burden of proof resting upon a party to establish a
given allegation of fact in civil proceedings as being merely to produce such a
preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion he

[Page 124]

seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the
possible views of the facts, (referring to Cooper v. Slade 5). We were also
referred to the commencement of the reasons for judgment in Smythe v. The
King 6,
delivered by Sir Lyman Duff on behalf of the Court :

It was settled by the decision of this Court in Clark v.
The King (1921) 61 S.C.R. 608, that where a plea of insanity is advanced
on a trial for murder the law does not require the accused, in order to succeed
upon that issue, to satisfy the jury that insanity has been proved beyond all
reasonable doubt; it is sufficient in point of law if insanity is proved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the jury.

However, it is to be noted that Sir Lyman later referred to
Best on Evidence as to a mere preponderance of probability in civil proceedings
being sufficient and then continued:

It is the rule that prevails generally in civil cases, as
this Court decided in the case above mentioned (the Clark case).

I am satisfied that the objection 'taken to the judge's
charge in this case on the first part of the second ground is without
foundation.

The next part of the second ground was whether the trial
judge erred in his charge to the jury in his statement of the evidence in
support of the plea of insanity. Upon this branch of his argument counsel for
the accused quite properly pointed out that what was sought to be shown was
that the appellant was insane at the time of the killing of the children. Two
doctors gave evidence on behalf of the Crown and counsel for the accused
admitted that one of these, Dr. Larue, did distinctly state that, in his
opinion, the accused at that time was not insane. It is contended, however,
that the other doctor called by the Crown, Dr. Martin, related his opinion not
to that event but to the time, or times, when he examined the accused some days
later. This might appear to be so if one looks only at that part of the
latter's evidence referred to by counsel, but a reading of what immediately
precedes, and other parts of Dr. Martin's evidence, makes it quite clear that
he had not so confined his opinion and, therefore, the trial judge was not in
error when, in his resume of the evidence of the two Crown doctors, he stated
that they (meaning both Crown

[Page 125]

doctors) had testified that Hébert knew
what he was doing at the moment of the crime and was able to distinguish right
from wrong.

The final part of the second ground of appeal is that the
trial judge incorrectly stated the evidence of Dr. Moffatt, called on behalf of
the accused. For the trial judge to have charged the jury in the manner
suggested by counsel for the appellant would have entailed his repeating a
great part not only of the examination in chief, but also of the
cross-examination of the doctor, since it was apparently difficult to determine
exactly what Dr. Moffatt's conclusions were. Undoubtedly they were based upon
the presumption that the story of the accused as told in the witness box (and
which Dr. Moffatt said was the same as the accused had previously told him) was
a true version of what had actually occurred. The questions put by jurors to
the doctor showed that they were alive to the nature of the problem they were
to decide and, of course, as the trial judge told them, they were not bound to
accept the evidence of any witness, either in whole or in part. The evidence
included that of the accused and there was put in a letter, or note, by him,
although it was uncertain when it had been written. It was made clear to the
jury that they were the judges of the facts and that they were not bound in any
way by the judge's recollection of the testimony. After reading Dr. Moffatt's
evidence and the judge's charge, I conclude that the appellant has failed to
substantiate this final branch of the second ground of appeal.

What has been said was
sufficient to dispose of the only questions raised before us on the original
argument when judgment was reserved. During consideration of the matter a point
arose and later we heard whatever Counsel had to say with respect to it, which
is whether Crown Counsel improperly cross-examined the appellant as to the
statements allegedly made by him to Captain Matte, or other police officers,
and whether the trial judge's charge was proper in relation thereto. In order
to avoid any difficulty Mr. Justice Estey granted leave to appeal on this
point.

The particular statement
emphasized is one allegedly made by the accused to Captain Matte and put down
in writing. This was not referred to in the evidence given on the voir dire,
although oral statements made by the accused

[Page 126]

to Captain Matte and
Officers Pettigrew and Fontaine were put in evidence. In the presence of the
jury the accused was cross-examined as to what is supposed to be in the writing
made by or at the instance of Captain Matte. For the purposes of this appeal I
assume that this cross-examination was not proper.

It is said that in three
respects the alleged written statement goes beyond what was said orally by the
accused to the other two officers: (1) There was no mention of the drinking of
beer by the accused; (2) there was no statement that the accused started his
operations in the first room of his house; (3) there was no statement that he
killed René first. It is then said that the trial judge
should have explicitly pointed out to the jury that nothing suggested by Crown
Counsel in that part of his cross-examination was evidence, and that they
should bear in mind that the three matters mentioned were not included in the
oral statements made by the accused. In my opinion, having told the jury that
they were to be bound by the evidence given at the trial, and having placed the
issues in relation to that evidence before them, there was no obligation on the
trial judge under all the circumstances to refer to the matter in the manner
suggested.

As to the cross-examination itself, I am of opinion that
there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and that even if the
trial judge, contrary to my opinion, should have gone into the other matter as
suggested, that defect, if any, also would come under the saving provisions of
s-s. (2) of s. 1014  of the Criminal Code .

The appeal should be dismissed.

Rand J.:—The
harrowing facts of this case cannot be permitted to becloud the issue. What is
urged is that the defence was not adequately placed before the jury. That
defence was this. The circumstances of the life of the accused, aggravated
latterly by those of his marriage, had gradually generated emotional pressures
of such despair and frustration that they finally overwhelmed the will in an
orgy of killing and contemplated suicide. In the throes of the paroxysm a
temporary blackout of the mind made it impossible for the accused to appreciate
the nature of what he was doing or that it was morally or legally wrong. No

[Page 127]

attempt was made to analyse or portray his mental state
during this physical convulsion, that is, the nature of the intellectual,
volitional or sense activity which directed the actions, or whether there was
no such direction and the actions were, in some manner, involuntary.

The fact that men sometimes yield to such tensions is as old
as humanity and nothing is added by dignifying its manifestation as a theory or
describing it as a ""réaction dépressive accompagnée par un
état de confusion, ou de panique"". But treating it as it was
advanced and describing it as specifically as its nebulous and elusive nature
could be gathered from the evidence of the expert called by the defence, it was
fairly and fully transmitted to the jury by the trial judge From the record of
the proceedings, it is obvious that they were keenly alive to what was being
suggested. With this on the one side and the mass of factual evidence against
it, largely given by the accused himself, on the other, carefully placed in
juxtaposition in the course of the charge, they had before them every
significant factor to the determination they were called upon to make.

On the renewed argument the further ground was stressed that
in cross-examination of the accused he was questioned on statements he had made
to a police officer on the day following his arrest which were apparently
reduced to writing. If they were inadmissible because of a presumed influence
of favour or fear arising from the circumstances in which they were made, then
I agree that neither s. 10 nor 11 of The Canada Evidence Act  permits
cross-examination on them. For the purposes of evidence they are tainted with
untrustworthiness and the reasons that exclude them from direct introduction
prevent their being slipped in the back way by cross-examination: Rex v.
Treacy 7:
Rex v. Scory 8.
I am by no means satisfied that they were not admissible, but it is unnecessary
to decide that and I will assume that they were, and that the trial judge
should have directed the jury to dismiss from their minds any implication from
the questions asked or the answers given.

A confession had been
made before there was any suspicion even that a crime had been committed. The
accused was obviously tortured in mind and conscience and

[Page 128]

he sought relief by not
only volunteering all of the essential facts of the tragedy but by going to his
home and there giving a graphic confirmation of them while the officers
seemingly were still somewhat incredulous. The statements could have done
little, if anythting, more than to supply a few minor details of the circumstances
or the order or course of the events. Up to this time there had been no
suggestion by the accused that he could not remember any detail and no question
on cross-examination of any of the officers went to such a point. Only when the
defence was being adduced was the so-called blackout brought up. But there was
before the jury a writing found on the table in the house and admittedly made
by the accused which, whether written immediately before or after the crime,
was conclusive against the existence of this phenomenon.

The only other ground
urged calling for an observation is based on the reference in the judgment of
this Court in Rex v. Latour 9 to the unanimity of a verdict. But the language
used there must be read in relation to the facts of that case. There was
obviously no intention of suggesting that a verdict was obligatory or that a
trial judge must bring to the minds of the jury the fact that they could
disagree.

Notwithstanding what I
assume to have been improper cross-examination, the remaining evidence before
the jury was so overwhelming and conclusive that, acting judicially, they must
have brought in the verdict they did.

I would, therefore,
dismiss the appeal.

Kellock
J. :—I do not find it necessary to
refer to any of the points originally raised on behalf of the appellant. After
reserving judgment however, the court, of its own motion, raised a question not
argued by counsel for the appellant, and leave being given to argue the point,
the argument has now been heard.

According to evidence
not in any way objected to, it appears that the killing occurred some time
during the night of Tuesday, April 21, 1953. The appellant says that following
the killing, he remained at home until Thursday, the 23rd, when, having
invented a story that his children had met death in a railway accident, he went
to the morgue to

[Page 129]

make burial
arrangements. After the appellant had left, the police were notified of the
visit and the witnesses Pettigrew and Fontaine were despatched
from police head-quarters to investigate.

From the description
they had received of the appellant they were able to identify him on the street
and he agreed to go with them to the police station. During the course of this
trip, he told them voluntarily that he had had trouble with his wife, that he
was tired of life, that he had killed his four children, that if they did not
believe him they could come to his home and see for themselves and that he knew
he would be hung but that he had done it just the same. He added that he had
intended to take the lives of three other people. The appellant repeated the
substance of these statements to Police Captain Matte at the station and then
accompanied the three police officers to his home.

On arrival, he opened
the door for them and showed them throughout, conducting Captain Matte to the
bathroom where he produced an axe saying to Captain Matte ""c'est avec ca"".

In the kitchen Matte found on the table a note which the
appellant admitted he had written. This speaks of the difficulty he had with
his wife, that she had desired separation and custody of the children, but that
he had promised she would never get them. It includes the statement : ""moi sest féni je vas êtres pandu mais je vas
maurire avec mais anfant"". Whether the appellant wrote the note
before or after the deaths of the children is not established.

The three police officers were duly called by the Crown and
deposed as above. The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf, testifying
that he did not remember the killing having fallen asleep and wakened up after
the event, when he attempted suicide. There was some evidence of bleeding at
the neck when the police first met him. During cross-examination, Crown counsel
proceeded to examine the appellant with relation to a statement made to Captain
Matte on the morning of April 24 after he had been arrested. Although objected
to, the cross-examination was allowed by the learned trial judge in the view
that it was proper with relation to credibility. In my view, this ruling

[Page 130]

was erroneous, the law being well settled that a statement
of this character cannot be used even in cross-examination until its voluntary
nature has been established.

The question is, therefore, as to whether or not a new trial
ought to be directed or whether, in the circumstances, it can properly be said
that notwithstanding this error and the failure of the learned judge to refer
to the matter at all in his charge, ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice has actually occurred""; s. 1014(2)  of the Criminal Code . In
my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, the subsection ought to be
applied.

It is to be observed that at no time during April 23 did the
appellant suggest that he had suffered from any failure of memory. How long
afterwards this suggestion was put forward does not appear. On the contrary,
the appellant had no difficulty whatsoever in telling what had occurred as
above. He himself produced the axe and, unlike his evidence at the trial when
he said that he had concluded from the presence of the axe beside him he must
have committed the deed, he told the police that it was with it he had done the
killing.

Again, whether the note of the appellant was written by him
before or after the killing is immaterial. If before, it would evidence a clear
intention to commit the deed; if after, it indicates clearly that the deed had
been knowingly done. In these circumstances, the jury, in my opinion, must
necessarily have come to the conclusion that the defence of loss of memory was
an afterthought. I am fortified in this view by the circumstance that this must
also have been the view of the professional advisers of the appellant as they
did not raise the point but argued it only after it had been raised proprio
motu by the court. The cross-examination simply brought out in more detail
what was involved in the evidence not objected to. While, as I have said, the
course followed by Crown counsel was wrong, I feel obliged in the circumstances
to say that the subsection should be applied and that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Estey J.:—The
appellant submits that the learned trial judge erred, when instructing the jury
as to the possible verdicts they might render, in that he failed to mention the
possibility of their disagreeing. This submission is founded

[Page 131]

upon a dictum in Latour v. The King 10, to the effect that a judge
ought not to tell the jury they must agree upon a verdict in a manner that
precludes disagreement. The observations in that case were prompted by the
imperative and unqualified language used in directing the jury. It does not suggest
that a trial judge must point out to the jury that they may disagree. A juror
is bound by his oath to decide according to the evidence and if, after a
careful and complete consideration of all the facts and circumstances, his
conclusion is different from that of the other jurors it is his duty to
disagree. The learned trial judge in the present case discussed the issues, the
relevant law and facts and pointed out that there were four possible
verdicts—murder, manslaughter, not guilty, or not guilty because of insanity.
He then discussed the difference between 'murder and manslaughter and, if they
concluded the appellant had committed murder or manslaughter, they might find
him not guilty because of insanity. Then, after referring to certain matters relative
to the verdict not material to this discussion, the learned trial judge stated:

Vous devrez maintenant, messieurs, vous
rappeler que le verdict que vous rapporterez, quel qu'il soit, doit être un
verdict unanime, c'est-à-dire que tous les douze, vous devez être de la même
opinion et rapporter le même verdict.

The learned trial judge, throughout this portion
of his charge, was discussing the possible verdicts that the jury might
render and impressed upon them that in order to arrive at a verdict they must
be unanimous. A verdict, as stated in the Oxford Dictionary, is ""the
decision of a jury in a civil or criminal cause upon an issue which has been
submitted to their judgment."" A disagreement is not a verdict. It exists
only because of the inability of the jury to arrive at a decision and,
therefore, a verdict. In this context the jury would understand that he was
discussing a verdict as a decision and not in any way referring to the
possibility of a disagreement or denying their right to disagree. There is no
obligation upon a judge to explain to a jury they may disagree. In fact, a
trial judge does not accept a disagreement until he is satisfied that there is
no reasonable possibility of the jury arriving at a unanimous decision.

[Page 132]

The second submission is
in relation to the learned trial judge's instructions relative to the plea of
insanity and his statements of the evidence in support thereof. In the course
of his charge the learned trial judge explained the law relative to insanity as
a defence in a manner that no exception has been taken thereto. The burden of
proving this plea rests upon the defence, but is not, as he explained, a burden
such as the Crown must discharge before a jury would be justified in finding an
accused guilty of the offence as charged, but that it was sufficient if, upon
the evidence, they were reasonably satisfied that the appellant was insane,
they would find him not guilty because of insanity. Counsel for the appellant
objected to the word ""prépondérance""
as used by the learned trial judge
on several occasions and more particularly because, as the Crown had called two
experts and the defence but one, the jury might, because of the use of this
word, be led to give greater weight to the evidence of two rather than one. In
addressing juries learned judges have often stated that a jury may be
reasonably satisfied if the weight or preponderance of, or if upon a balance of
probabilities, the evidence directs them to a certain conclusion or decision.
It would appear that the learned trial judge was using the word ""prépondérance in this sense and that it would be so understood
by the members of the jury, who would not be led to give effect to the number
of witnesses rather than the evidence. This conclusion is supported by the learned
trial judge's pointing out:

Vous n'êtes pas tenus de croire ou d'accepter
ces témoignages ou leurs opinions, pas plus qu'il s'agissait des autres
témoins. Vous pouvez les rejeter en bloc, vous pouvez vous en servir pour
juger. Le rôle de l'expert consiste à éclairer, à vous guider, mais leurs dires
et leurs opinions ne vous lient pas, et vous devez considérer non seulement
leurs témoignages, vous en tenez compte si vous voulez, non seulement leurs
témoignages, mais l'ensemble de la preuve, pour vous former une opinion quant à
l'état d'esprit de l'accusé. Vous avez votre bon sens, vous avez votre
jugement, alors les faits qui ont été rapportés par d'autres témoins dans la
preuve, la conduite de l'accusé, son comportement, ses écrits, ses déclarations,
son attitude dans la boîte aux témoins, tout cela, messieurs, ça constitue de
la preuve et ça doit servir à vous guider pour vous demander si c'est l'accusé
qui a fait ce qu'on lui reproche et si c'est lui qui l'a fait, savait-il,
pouvait-il savoir à ce moment-là ce qu'il faisait.

Moreover, counsel for
the accused contended the learned trial judge had dealt more fully with the
evidence of the experts for the Crown than he had with that of the expert

[Page 133]

called on behalf of the
defence. It is the duty of a trial judge to define the issues and discuss the
evidence in relation thereto. He need not, however, review the evidence in
detail. In the course of his charge he stated:

L'expert de la
défense a eu des entrevues avec Hébert. Il a étudié les renseignements qu'il a
obtenus, relatifs à son passé, sa vie conjugale et, en supposant que ce que
Hébert a dit était vrai, il a diagnostiqué chez l'accusé, ce qu'il a appelé
""une réaction dépressive accompagnée par un état de confusion ou de
panique."" Il en conclut qu'au moment où Hébert aurait fait ce qu'on lui
reproche, que c'est lui qui l'a fait, il ne pouvait connaître à ce moment-là la
différence entre le bien et le mal.

Later the learned trial judge returned to the early life of the accused, his marital difficulties
and their possible effect upon his mentality and again impressed upon the jury
that it was their duty to give such effect thereto as they, in their judgment,
might see fit. The learned trial judge did not, as the jury would no doubt
understand, attempt to review in detail the evidence for either the Crown or
the defence. In my view it cannot be said that the learned judge has not fully
presented the issue of insanity or that he has emphasized the evidence for the
Crown more than that for the defence.

The third submission on behalf of the accused is that Crown
counsel, in cross-examination of the appellant, referred to a statement, that
appellant had made to the police and which had not been proved to have been
voluntarily made, in a manner that constituted error in law. The appellant made
statements to Lieutenant Pettigrew and Constable Fontaine on his way to the
police station and immediately upon his arrival made a further statement to
Captain Matte. These were all proved to have been voluntarily made and placed
in evidence by the Crown. It appears that later Captain Matte, upon a number of
occasions, had him brought to his office where at least one statement made by
the appellant was recorded by a stenographer. No effort was made in the course
of the Crown's case to place this statement in evidence, nor was it proved to
have been voluntarily made. Counsel for the Crown, however, in the course of
his cross-examination of the appellant, while not showing to him the statement,
did ask questions as to a portion of its contents and in the course thereof
suggested that the appellant had consumed liquor on the night of, and prior to,
the murder of his children;

[Page 134]

that he had started at the first room and that René was the first to have died; further, that he had reflected
upon his position of having four children without money to buy the necessities
of life and his wife's mode of living and decided to murder his children. The
appellant replied throughout this portion of his examination that Captain Matte
had, upon these occasions, asked him questions, but that he did not remember
his replies, as he had not cared what he then said because he had made up his
mind to die with his children.

A cross-examination upon such a statement, by the great
weight of authority in our provincial courts, as well as in the court of
criminal appeal in England, has been condemned. However, it is unnecessary to
determine this point here, as, upon the assumption that this was an improper
examination, it would appear that, having regard to the facts and the
circumstances of this case, there has been no miscarriage of justice within the
meaning of s. 1014(2)  of the Criminal Code .

Tuesday night, when the appellant and his four infant
children were the only persons in his house, the latter were all put to death.
Thereafter appellant remained in the house with the doors locked and the
curtains drawn until Thursday afternoon, when he went to Marceau's undertaking
parlour, where the manager, Pouliot, was the first person to whom he had spoken
since the death of the children.

Some time before leaving
for Marceau's the appellant wrote, in his own handwriting, a statement which
reads:

Ma femme est
partie et je lui ai ôté mes enfants et j'ai promis qu'elle aurait jamais les
enfants à elle, ça dépend de ma belle-mère et ma belle-sœur qui garde ma femme,
moi j'aime mieux mourir tout de suite avec mes enfants que rester sur la terre
et toujours pâtir. J'ai eu un téléphone qu'elle voulait une séparation et
garder les enfants, mais c'est fini, j'aime mieux être pendu, moi je vais
mourir avec mes enfants; ma femme est partie dépenser l'argent des enfants,
elle est venue chercher le chèque, nous autres nous avons pas d'argent, elle va
se rappeler leur avoir ôté le manger dans la bouche des enfants; tout ça dépend
de ma belle-mère et me belle-sœur de garder ma femme.

The first portion of this statement, as filed in court, would seem to read as follows:

Ma femme est partie et veut m'ôter mes enfants
et j'ai promis qu'elle n'aurait jamais les enfants.

[Page 135]

It was so read to Dr. Moffatt in the course of his
cross-examination.

At Mareeau's undertaking parlour appellant explained to
Pouliot that the four children had been killed in a railway accident and that
he desired to make arrangements for their funeral. Pouliot immediately
communicated with the police and it was shortly thereafter that the appellant
was asked by Lieutenant Pettigrew and Constable Fontaine to accompany them to
Captain Matte's office. As they proceeded in the police automobile 'the accused
made a number of voluntary statements which were placed in evidence. As to
these statements Lieutenant Pettigrew stated, in part:

C'est tout ce qu'il a dit, qu'il était tanné
de la vie que sa femme faisait et que c'était pour cette raison qu'il avait tué
ses quatre enfants.

........

Il a dit qu'il avait tué ses enfants, qu'il
savait qu'il était pour être pendu et qu'il le faisait pareil. A part ça.
. . . .

........

Alors, il aurait
dit: ""Vous m'arrêtez en temps parce que j'en avais trois autres à
tuer.""

Constable Fontaine stated :

Il a dit que c'était parce que ça allait pas
bien avec sa femme et qu'il aimait ses enfants.

They proceeded to Captain Matte's office and there the
appellant repeated much of what he had said in the automobile and that if they
did not believe him he could show to them the four bodies. Captain Matte, with
others and the appellant, proceeded to the latter's home. There appellant
unlocked the door, showed the four infant bodies to the police, then went into
the bathroom, where he picked up an axe, handed it to the police and said : ""C'est avec ca."" It was during this visit that the
above statement, written by the accused, was found upon the kitchen table, as
to which Captain Matte deposed:

Alors que j'accompagnais l'accusé, nous sommes
arrivés à la table, il a fait un geste pour s'emparer de ce papier là et d'un
crayon qui était avec, le crayon ici.

The appellant, at the trial, stated his wife had been away since Saturday night and, as a consequence,
he had been forced to remain at home and, therefore, not to go to his work on
Monday and Tuesday; that on the Tuesday night, after preparing the children for
bed and while they were playing, he had informed them that he would have to place

[Page 136]

them in homes. The two older protested. When they had gone
to bed he had reflected upon the conduct of his wife, his financial position
and his responsibility to his children; that he wept and went to deep. Later he
woke up and found an axe beside him, his children all dead and a scratch about
three inches long on his own throat.

The real issue at the trial was whether the appellant had no
knowledge of what he was doing as he put his children to death. The two experts
called on behalf of the Crown, who had submitted the appellant to a physical
examination and had conversed with and questioned him upon four occasions
between April 25 and November 6 inclusive, were of the opinion that the
appellant did, at the time his children died, know what he was doing and
understood the nature and quality of the act which he had committed. These experts
were of the opinion that there are only two types of individuals who may be
unconscious for a short time and recover, as the appellant did after the death
of his children. First, a person who receives a blow upon the head or suffers a
shock in an accident may be unconscious for a time and recover. The second is a
person who suffers from epilepsy.

The expert called on behalf of the appellant deposed that he
had conversed with and questioned the appellant upon three occasions between
November 3 and 6, and, having regard to his history and his conduct on the
night in question, he stated:

… j'ai porté le diagnostic de réaction dépressive, qui était accompagnée par un état de confusion,
un état de panique.

Dr. Moffatt did not describe nor did he explain the symptoms
of ""réaction dépressive."" He was questioned at
length with regard to the effect of being depressed. After explaining that ""dépression"" was not of itself a mental illness, he
stated it was a symptom and might lead to a mental illness. He was asked:

Q. Vous donnez le symptôme le plus
caractéristique?

R. Chez d'aucun oui, chez d'autres, non.
Peut-être l'anxiété aurait causé un état dépressif quelconque. Quand le
dépression est assez avancée, elle cause une psychose, une maladie mentale, le
refus de manger, l'incapacité de dormir le soir.

[Page 137]

There was no evidence
suggesting that he had ever refused to eat, or suffered difficulty with respect
to his appetite or his ability to sleep.

That the jury fully
appreciated this issue is evidenced by the questions which their members asked
the experts. It is significant that, when a juryman asked if it was possible
that one who puts others to death and remains living himself may be able to
forget completely all that he did in putting the others to death, Dr. Moffatt
replied:

Certainement,
tout dépend de l'état où il était au moment où il a commis son meurtre. S'il
est dans une confusion, dans un état de confusion mentale, de choc émotionnel,
une confusion de panique, c'est possible. J'ai moi-même vu, au cours
d'accident, sortir quelqu'un d'une machine, quelqu'un qui n'avait aucune
blessure, absolument rien, mais dont l'état d'émotion était tellement aggravé,
tellement évident, qu'on leur demandait leurs noms, leurs adresses et qu'ils ne
s'en rappelaient pas.

Dr. Moffatt here
illustrates his point of view by referring to a person who suffers a
shock much like that described by the psychiatrists called for the Crown.

The burden of. establishing, to the reasonable satisfaction
of the jury, that the accused was insane, as that term is applied and
understood in McNaghten's Case 11,
at the time he put the children to death rested upon the defence. The
appellant's written statement, his false version at the undertaking parlour,
his verbal and voluntary statements to the police, as well as his conduct when
he and the police were present at his house, were all, in effect, contrary to
the contention that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or what
he was doing upon the night in question. Moreover, when analyzed, the evidence
of the experts for the Crown, who examined the appellant as to both his
physical and mental condition, supports their conclusions with reasons that
could not but impress the jury.

While Dr. Moffatt, called on behalf of the defence, refers
to the life of and his interviews with the appellant, he does not indicate, in
a direct and specific manner, what it was in the conduct or conversation that
led him to conclude that the appellant, in committing the acts we are here
concerned with, did not appreciate the nature and quality of his acts

[Page 138]

and was unable to distinguish between right and wrong. In
this regard the language of Lord Chief Justice Reading is appropriate :

The tests in McNaghten's case must be observed, and it is
not enough for a medical expert to come to the Court and say generally that in
his opinion the criminal is insane. There must be some evidence of insanity
within the meaning of the rule in McNaghten's case. Holt v. The King 12.

Then as to the possible effect upon the jury of any of the
suggestions made by counsel for the Crown in the course of the
cross-examination here objected to, it should be observed that they were either
contained in or directly implied in statements already in evidence. It is not,
therefore, a case in which entirely new facts were so introduced, but, rather,
circumstances which, in relation to the whole of the evidence, would be but a
repetition of that which would already be present to the minds of the jury.

When all of the evidence is considered, this becomes a case
in which it may well be said, in the language of my Lord the Chief Justice
(then Kerwin J.) in Schmidt v. The King 13, ""that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same"" even had the cross-examination here
objected to not taken place. This case is quite distinguishable from Allen v.
The King 14, where counsel for the Crown
sought, through cross-examination, to place in evidence that given by a witness
at the preliminary who was not called at the trial. In the course of his
reasons for judgment Fitzpatrick C.J., as well as Mr. Justice Anglin (later
C.J.), referred to the fact that there was other sufficient evidence to support
the 'conviction. In the case at bar the evidence is such, apart from the
cross-examination objected to, as would leave no doubt in the minds of a
reasonable jury that the appellant was, at the time he committed the crime, not
insane as that word is applied and understood in law.

It is also distinguishable from Markadonis v. The
King 15, where a young man of eighteen
was charged with the murder of his sister. No motive was established and the
revolver used to commit the crime was not produced and apparently was never
found. Evidence was given at the trial to the effect that in the middle of the
second night after the murder the accused was taken from his cell and,

[Page 139]

along with three police officers, taken out to a road to
search for the revolver. The accused was cross-examined upon the incidents of
that trip and his answers were made the basis for rebuttal evidence. Mr.
Justice Davis, at p. 664, stated:

The whole course of conduct and conversation of the accused
on that trip was clearly inadmissible in the absence of any proof that the
statements made were voluntary and upon proper warning.

In the circumstances of that case, as reported, such
evidence added to the facts already in evidence and could not but be
prejudicial to the defence.

The facts and circumstances of this case are so very
conclusive that the language in Stirland v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions 16 is appropriate. When referring
to a proviso in the English statute similar to that of s. 1014(2) of our Criminal
Code , it is stated:

… if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation
where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence
properly admissible, without doubt convict.

This passage is quoted with approvel in Schmidt v.
The King, supra.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

Locke J.
(dissenting) :—I agree with my brothers Cartwright and Fauteux and would quash
the conviction in this matter and direct that there be a new trial.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting) :—In this case I find it necessary to deal with only one of the
questions which were argued before us, i.e., whether Crown counsel improperly
cross-examined the appellant as to certain statements allegedly made by him to
Captain Matte.

It is not necessary to go into the facts at any length. The
appellant was convicted of the murder of one of his children. At the trial it
was not seriously questioned that he had killed this child and his three other
young children. The. main issue was as to whether or not he was insane at the
time of such acts.

Doctor Moffatt, called as a witness for the defence,
testified that in his opinion the appellant at the time of the killing was by
reason of mental illness unable to appreciate

[Page 140]

the nature and quality of his acts or to know that they were
wrong. Doctor Martin and Doctor Larue called as witnesses by the Crown
testified that they were of the contrary opinion.

It is clear that Doctor Moffatt founded his opinion in part
on the assumption that the accused had in fact no memory as to what occurred at
the time of the killing, and, as Mr. Miquelon very properly stated, the
question whether or not the accused did have such memory was of vital
importance on the issue of insanity.

In giving his evidence in chief the appellant deposed that
he had no memory as to what happened during the critical period. In
cross-examination he was asked a number of questions by Crown counsel who then
held in his hands what purported to be a transcript of a number of questions
put to the accused by Captain Matte and of the answers given by the accused to
such questions. This interrogation was said to have taken place at about eleven
p.m. on the Thursday following the killing, some hours after the appellant had
told the police officers that he had killed his children and had been taken
into custody on a charge of murder. The answers which the accused was said to
have given during this interrogation indicated that he was able at that time to
recall the details of the killing of his children and so tended to discredit
his evidence given at the trial as to his having no memory of that occurrence.

Counsel for the appellant objected to the use of the
transcript and to any cross-examination in regard to it but the learned trial
judge overruled the objection. I think it clear that the learned trial judge
should not have permitted any use to be made of the transcript in question
without first hearing evidence in the absence of the jury with a view to
determining whether or not the appellant's answers had been given voluntarily.
The learned judge appears to have been of opinion that although not admissible
as part of the Crown's case the questions said to have been put to the accused
and the answers said to have been made by him could be put to him in
cross-examination. In this, in my respectful opinion, he was in error.

[Page 141]

In Rex v. Wilmot 17, Ford J.A. with whom
MacGillivray J.A. agreed said :—

It is conceded that the statements, if made at all, were
made to a . person in authority and that the Crown could not prove their
voluntary character so as to make them admissible. This being so, in my opinion
C not only should the Crown be not permitted to prove them in rebuttal any more
than in chief, but that it is improper to permit cross-examination as to them.
Indeed they should, in my opinion, be treated for all purposes as non-existent
or as having no probative value of any kind, either as going to the credit of
the accused as a witness or otherwise.

This view of the law was adopted by the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia in Rex v. Byers 18 and by the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 19.
A similar view was expressed by Langlais J. in Rex v. Heroux 20.

In Rex v. Scory (supra) Mackenzie J.A., who
gave the unanimous judgment of the Court, after referring to Rex v. Wilmot,
Rex v. Byers and Rex v. Heroux continued, at page
323:—

In a still more recent case involving the same question, R.
v. Treacy (1944) 60 T.L.R. 544, the Court of Criminal Appeal in
England rendered the same view. Thus in delivering the judgment of the Court,
Humphreys J., said (p. 545) : ""In our view, a statement made by a prisoner
under arrest is either admissible or not. If it is admissible, the proper
course for the prosecution is to prove it, and give it in evidence, and to let
the statement, if it is in writing, be made an exhibit, so that everybody knows
what it is and everybody can inquire into it and do what they think right about
it. If it is not admissible, nothing more ought to be heard of it, and it is
wrong to think that a document can be made admissible in evidence which is
otherwise inadmissible simply because it is put to a person on
cross-examination.""

Having regard to the protection which our criminal law in
accordance with its well-known policy in javorem vitae casts about every
accused person to protect him on his trial against the introduction of his own
involuntary statements, the above decisions on counsel's last contention
should, in my opinion, be followed not only because of their obvious authority
but also because they are logically sound.

I have carefully considered the reasons of Campbell C.J. who
expressed a contrary opinion in Rex v. Jones 21 and in Rex v. Essery
22 and the reasons of Harvey C.J.
who dissented in Rex v. Wilmot (supra) but, with
the greatest respect for these views, I am of opinion that the passage quoted
above from the judgment of Mackenzie J.A. correctly states the law.

[Page 142]

It is argued for the respondent that even if this
cross-examination was illegal no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred and the appeal should be dismissed. With the greatest respect for
all those who hold the contrary view, I find it impossible to affirm that had
this illegal cross-examination not taken place the jury would necessarily have
convicted the appellant.

It was open to the jury to believe the appellant's evidence
as to his having no memory of the period in which the killings occurred and, if
they did believe it, it was for them to say whether they accepted Doctor
Moffatt's opinion in preference to that of the two medical witnesses called by
the Crown. All three of these doctors were men of high standing in their
profession and it is scarcely necessary to observe that a jury may act upon the
evidence of one witness although it is in conflict with the evidence of two or
more other witnesses. But the opinion of Doctor Moffatt depended in large
measure upon the assumption that the appellant had in fact no memory of the
period in which the children were killed. The reason that the jury did not act
upon Doctor Moffatt's opinion may well have been that they did not find that
the appellant was without memory of the critical period and their failure to so
find may well have been the result of the illegal cross-examination.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
new trial.

Fauteux J.
(dissenting) :—Suivant des admissions extrajudiciaires,
jugées libres et volontaires, l'appelant a reconnu, sans toutefois en donner
aucune circonstance, avoir, dans le cours du mois d'avril 1953, tué ses quatre jeunes enfants pour lesquels, cependant, il
n'entretenait, suivant la preuve, que des sentiments d'affection. Accusé du
meurtre de l'un d'eux, il plaida qu'au moment de ces actes, il était incapable
d'en juger la nature et la gravité et de se rendre compte qu'ils étaient mal.
Le bien-fondé de ce plaidoyer fut affirmé par un expert de la défense et nié
par deux experts de la poursuite. Trouvé coupable, il logea un appel devant la
Cour du Banc de la Reine 23, lequel fut
rejeté par jugement unanime. Hébert obtint alors, en vertu de l'article

[Page 143]

1025 du Code Criminel , l'autorisation
d'en appeler devant cette Cour sur des questions de droit formulées comme suit:—

(a) Did the learned trial Judge err in his instructions relative to the possible
verdict the jury might render and in particular in omitting to mention the
possibility of their disagreeing?

(b) Did the learned trial Judge err in his
instructions relative to the plea of insanity and in his statement of the
evidence in support thereof?

Au soutien du premier moyen
(a), on a invoqué, de la décision de cette Cour dans Latour v.
The King 24, un passage
apparaissant à la page 30 où l'on exprime l'opinion que,
des instructions du Juge au procès, les jurés pouvaient raisonnablement déduire
que le droit à un désaccord était
exclu dans la cause. Dans Frank Frederick Creasey 25, Lord Goddard,
Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel d'Angleterre, signale bien que de similaires
directives ont déjà, dans le passé, reçu la désapprobation des tribunaux
d'appel, telle, par exemple, la suivante: ""It is essential that you
should give a verdict"". C'est, cependant, en regard de toute l'adresse du Juge que la question doit être appréciée. Ainsi
considérée, je ne crois pas qu'on puisse, en l'espèce, dire que le droit à un
désaccord ait été exclu.

Au second moyen (b), il y a deux
griefs. J'écarterais le premier, ayant trait aux directives sur le plaidoyer de
folie, et ce, pour les raisons données par l'honorable Juge en chef. Je
retiens, cependant, le second, savoir:—

Did the learned trial Judge err … in
his statement of the evidence in support thereof? (i.e., au
soutien du plaidoyer de folie).

grief dans la considération duquel il
convient d'inclure un point soulevé lors du délibéré et subséquemment discuté
au cours d'une réaudition, après que, au cas où nécessaire, permission
d'appeler ait été donnée, savoir:—

Whether Crown counsel improperly cross-examined the appellant as to the statements
allegedly made by him to Captain Matte or other police officers and whether or
not the trial Judge's charge was proper in relation thereto.

La véritable—pour ne pas
dire l'unique—question qui se posait devant le jury était
de savoir si, au moment où l'accusé tuait ses quatre jeunes enfants, il était
dans un état mental le rendant incapable de juger la nature et la gravité de
ses actes et de se rendre compte qu'ils étaient mal. Il était donc de capital
importance que l'exposé de la preuve

[Page 144]

sur ce point
soit fait adéquatement; c'était toute la cause. Cette preuve soumise aux jurés
et qu'il nous faut maintenant considérer pour juger du mérite de ce grief,
portait sur deux points:—(i) la théorie médicale soumise par le
docteur Moffatt, l'expert de la défense, et (ii) les faits, gestes et declarations de l'accusé, surtout celles dont la véracité—assumée par le docteur Moffatt pour fins de son opinion—fut mise en
question par la Couronne et ses experts.

La théorie médicale de la défense. Le docteur
Moffatt a conclu qu'au moment de l'acte, rappelant était incapable de
distinguer le bien du mal parce qu'il était alors affecté d'un trouble mental
qu'il désigne techniquement comme ""une réaction dépressive accompagnée par
un état de confusion ou de panique"". Cette conclusion, il la motive comme
suit:—A raison d'événements particuliers qui se sont
produits au cours de l'enfance, aussi bien qu'au cours de l'adolescence et,
ensuite, de la vie conjugale de l'appelant, ce dernier souffrait de mélancolie,
mais non dans le sens précis qu'on donne en psychiatrie à la maladie mentale
classifiée sous ce nom; il avait ainsi développé une instabilité émotionnelle
affectant sa résistance et l'empêchant d'avoir, sur ses facultés
intellectuelles, un contrôle normal, offrant en conséquence, et à l'occasion
d'une crise émotionnelle, un terrain propice à la naissance et l'action d'un
trouble mental. De plus, l'accusé ayant affirmé, au cours d'examens par le
docteur Moffatt, et juré, dans son témoignage à l'audition, qu'il n'avait
aucune mémoire des circonstances dans lesquelles les actes reprochés avaient
été commis, l'expert de la défense déduisit du fait de cette carence de mémoire
qu'au moment où l'accusé tuait ses quatre jeunes enfants, il était dans un état
de confusion mentale et de panique. Le docteur Moffatt a bien précisé qu'il ne
prétendait pas que l'accusé souffrait de cette maladie mentale classifiée en
psychiatrie comme mélancolie et que l'état de confusion dont il parlait était
un trouble mental reconnu par les auteurs anglais, américains et allemands et,
comme tel, différent de la confusion mentale, résultant d'une cause organique,
dont parlent les auteurs français. En somme, mise en contraste avec l'opinion
des experts de la Couronne, celle du docteur Moffatt s'inspire d'une théorie
médicale différente dans sa conception et son

[Page 145]

expression de
celle exposée par les experts de la Couronne et se fonde, en l'espèce,
principalement sur l'hypothèse de la véracité des affirmations de l'accusé
quant à cette carence de mémoire. Nous n'avons pas à départager les médecins et
à décider d'une préférence pour l'une ou l'autre des théories par eux exposées;
ceci était du ressort exclusif des jurés et la difficulté qu'ils pouvaient
avoir à ce faire rendait encore plus imperative
l'obligation d'une adéquate
exposition de ces théories et, particulièrement, de celle de la défense. A la
vérité, et au cours de l'audition de la preuve médicale, l'un des jurés
manifesta ouvertement son inquiétude à rencontrer l'obligation que lui et ses
collègues avaient de départager les experts. Pour dissiper cet état d'esprit,
on les rassura en les informant que des directives appropriées leur seraient
données au cours de l'adresse du Juge. En tout respect, cependant, je dois dire
qu'en ce qui concerne la théorie médicale de la défense, on s'est contenté,
dans l'adresse, d'indiquer uniquement la conclusion précitée du docteur Moffatt
sans signaler ce qui divisait les experts dans la conception et l'expression de
leurs théories médicales respectives et sans aucunement rappeler les motifs sur
lesquels s'appuyait la théorie exposée en défense. L'opinion d'un expert n'a
que la valeur des motifs sur lesquels elle se fonde. Je suis d'avis que la
théorie médicale de la défense au soutien du plaidoyer de folie n'a pas été
exposée comme elle aurait dû l'être et que, pour cette première raison, ce
grief de l'appelant est bien fondé.

Outre la théorie médicale de l'expert de la
défense, la preuve apportée au soutien du plaidoyer de folie et qui devait être
exposée aux jurés comportait, entre autres faits, les déclarations de l'accusé
et, particulièrement, son affirmation sous serment relative à son absence de
mémoire, affirmation dont la véracité, comme déjà indiqué, fut assumée par le docteur
Moffatt pour les fins de son expertise, mais mise en question par la Couronne
et ses experts. D'où l'on voit que dans l'exposé de cet aspect particulier de
la preuve, il était de singulière importance, pour permettre aux jurés de se
prononcer justement sur le point, de ne pas les inviter virtuellement, comme il
a été fait, à décider de la véracité de cette affirmation, en la considérant
avec les déclarations ci-après qui la contredisent, lesquelles furent—ainsi qu'il appert ci-après—illégalement admises
au

[Page 146]

dossier, à l'initiative de la Couronne, et ce,
tel que déclaré par les deux procureurs la représentant à la réaudition, dans
le but d'attaquer la crédibilité de l'accusé et, plus précisément, de détruire,
en démontrant le contraire de l'affirmation ci-dessus, le véritable fondement
de l'opinion émise par le docteur Moffatt.

Le dossier révèle que le capitaine Matte,
officier de la Sûreté en charge de la cause, a plusieurs fois au
cours de la détention de l'appelant, questionné ce dernier afin d'en obtenir
une relation des circonstances dans lesquelles il avait tué ses enfants,
circonstances que ne comportaient aucunement ses aveux extrajudiciaires jugés
libres et volontaires et admis au dossier. Il appert, de plus, que les
questions et réponses, faites au cours de ces examens conduits par cet officier
de police, avaient été sténographiées et qu'au procès, un document les
rapportant était entre les mains du procureur de la Couronne et utilisé par lui
pour le contre-interrogatoire de l'accusé. Dès la première tentative de la
Couronne d'introduire une telle preuve au dossier, le procureur de la défense
s'objecta comme suit:—

Objecté:—

D'abord, je
voudrais savoir si réellement cet aveu-là a eu lieu et dans quelles conditions
cet aveu-là a eu lieu et quel était également l'état mental de cet homme-là à
ce moment-là.

Ce à quoi
la Couronne répondit:—

On est aussi bien de vider le problème, j'ai
bien l'intention d'entrer dans les déclarations qu'il a faites pour le
contredire.

L'objection de la défense fut renvoyée et
c'est alors qu'entre autres questions et, en substance, on a demandé à l'accusé
s'il n'était pas vrai:—qu'il avait déclaré au capitaine Matte
avoir consommé quatre ou cinq bouteilles de bière avant de tuer
ses enfants (p. 259) ; qu'il lui avait raconté en détails
ce qui s'était passé chez lui (p. 284) ; qu'il lui avait
raconté qu'il s'était assis sur une chaise, s'était bercé un peu, avait pensé à
tout et que c'est alors qu'il s'était décidé à faire les actes reprochés (p. 290)
; qu'il avait commencé par la chambre d'en avant, qu'il avait
commencé par tuer René, (p. 291). A la vérité, non
seulement on lui a posé ces questions, mais, en les formulant, on a indiqué les
réponses incriminantes que l'accusé était supposé avoir données au détective Matte.
Enfin, par ce procédé, on a réussi à faire entrer au dossier des
déclarations dont la substance allait à

[Page 147]

contredire le témoignage de l'appelant
et, particulièrement, sa déclaration dont la véracité avait été assumée par le
docteur Moffatt pour les fins de son expertise.

Dans quelles conditions furent conduits ces
interrogatoires et furent données ces réponses que le capitaine Matte, d'une part, trouva nécessaire de faire consigner par un sténographe et
que la Couronne, d'autre part, jugea essentiel au succès de sa cause de porter
à la connaissance des jurés, le dossier est silencieux. Aucun voir dire, aucun
examen de tous les témoins qui, suivant les exigences de la jurisprudence de
cette Cour (Sankey v. The King 26; Tiffault v.
The King 27), devaient être
entendus pour permettre au Juge de décider si, oui ou non, ces déclarations
pouvaient, à la lumière des principes reconnus en la matière, être admises
devant les jurés. Dans Gach v. The King 28, cette Cour, à la page 255, approuvait la
proposition suivante formulée par le Juge Sankey, tel qu'il était alors, dans Rex
v. Crowe and Myerscough 29:

If a police officer has
determined to effect an arrest or if the person is in custody, then he should
ask no questions which will in any way tend to prove the guilt of such person
from his own mouth.

Aussi bien, la
Couronne, au procès comme devant cette Cour, n'a-t-elle cherché à justifier
l'introduction de cette preuve au dossier que par les dispositions des articles
10 et 11 de la Loi de la preuve, lesquelles
autorisent d'attaquer la crédibilité d'un témoin en le contre-interrogeant sur
ses déclarations antérieures incompatibles avec son témoignage. Le point de
savoir si dans le contre-interrogatoire d'un accusé entendu comme témoin, il
est loisible à la Couronne de référer à des déclarations faites par lui à la
police alors que le caractère libre et volontaire de ces déclarations n'a pas
été décidé, a été considéré dans plusieurs causes. Dans ses notes, mon collègue
le Juge Cartwright réfère à ces décisions et, comme lui, je suis d'opinion que
la Couronne ne peut davantage, sur cette base, justifier, en l'espèce, la
position prise par elle au procès et devant cette Cour. L'introduction de cette
preuve était donc totalement illégale et d'une illégalité qui, je crois, aurait
justifié, sinon commandé, la mise à fin du procès comme mistrial. Aussi bien, et le procès s'étant continué, était-il
impératif que

[Page 148]

dans l'exposé de cet aspect de la preuve faite
au soutien du plaidoyer de folie, les jurés, au lieu d'être invités, comme ils
l'ont été, à considérer toutes les déclarations de l'accusé, sans distinguer
celles qui avaient été prouvées légalement de celles illégalement introduites
au dossier, reçoivent la direction la plus claire et la plus solennelle
d'écarter totalement de leur considération les dernières pour juger de la
véracité de l'affirmation relative à la perte de mémoire. Ce n'était pas
satisfaire à l'obligation qu'il y avait de faire un exposé légal de la preuve,
faite en défense au soutien du plaidoyer de folie, que d'inviter les jurés,
pour en juger, à faire entrer dans leur considération des preuves illégalement
admises. Pour cette seconde raison, je crois donc que le grief de l'appelant
est fondé.

Sur la loi relative à l'obligation d'exposer
adéquatement la théorie de la défense, il suffit, je crois, de référer à
quelques passages des deux dernières décisions de cette Cour sur le point. Dans
Kelsey v. The Queen 30, on a rappelé comme suit, à la page 227,
le principe d'où découle cette obligation:—

The rule is simple and implements the
fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to a fair trial, to make a
full answer and defence to the charge, and to these ends, the jury must be
adequately instructed as to what his defence is by the trial Judge.

De la décision d'Azoulay v.
The Queen 31, la considération des passages suivants est
pertinente:—

The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must be
clearly presented to the jury's mind. (p. 498).

Three experts, two of
which were called by the appellant, gave very elaborate explanations on medical
matters, and their respective opinions on the result
of the autopsy that was performed on the body of the deceased woman. It was, I
think, the duty of the trial judge, in summing up this highly technical and
conflicting evidence, to strip it of the nonessentials, and as O'Halloran, J.A.
said in Rex v. Hughes 78 Can. C.C. 1, to present to the jury the
evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual decision, and
direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and the answer of the
defence, or such answer as the evidence permitted. Unfortunately, this has not
been done, and the explanations and grounds of defence have not adequately been
put before the jury. (p. 499).

The authorities contemplate that in the course of his charge
a trial judge should as a general rule, explain the relevant law and so relate
it to the evidence that the jury may appreciate the issues or questions they
must pass upon in order to render a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Where, as
here, the evidence is technical and somewhat involved, it is particularly

[Page 149]

important that he should do so in a manner that will assist
the jury in determining its relevancy and what weight or value they will
attribute to the respective portions, (p. 503).

Reste à considérer la suggestion de la
Couronne d'appliquer, en l'espèce, les dispositions de l'article 1014
(2)  édictant que même si les griefs soulevés par l'accusé sont
bien fondés, la Cour peut renvoyer l'appel s'il n'y a pas eu de tort réel ni de
déni de justice. A raison de la gravité des violations ci-dessus relatées, il me
paraît impossible d'accéder à cette demande. Rendant le jugement pour le Comité
Judiciaire du Conseil Privé dans Makin 32, Lord Herschell,
à la page 70, dit:—

The evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly
influenced the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence
which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction might have
been reasonably disbelieved by the jury. Their Lordships do not think it can
properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the
jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider in
arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to
them. In Their Lordships' opinion substantial wrong would be done to the
accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by
legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence.

Dans Maxwell v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 33, Lord Sankey, L.C., parlant pour lui-même, Lord Blanesburgh, Lord Atkin, Lord Thankerton et Lord Wright, dit à la
page 176:—

But it must be remembered that the whole policy of English
criminal law has been to see that as against the prisoner every rule in his
favour is observed and that no rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of
the jury fairly trying the true issues. The sanction for the observance of the
rules of evidence in criminal cases is that, if they are broken in any case,
the conviction may be quashed. Hence the great care which has always been shown
by the Court in applying the proviso to section 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act,
1907, and refusing to quash a conviction. It is often better that one guilty
man should escape than that the general rules evolved by the dictates of
justice for the conduct of criminal prosecutions should be disregarded and
discredited.

Ces
principes exprimés par la Chambre des Lords se passent de commentaires et leur
application, au Canada, est d'autant plus justifiée que la loi canadienne,
contrairement à la loi anglaise, autorise la tenue d'un nouveau procès au lieu
d'un acquittement.

[Page 150]

Ajoutons que,
pour bénéficier des dispositions de l'article 1014 (2) , la Couronne
doit établir que, sans cette preuve illégale au dossier, le verdict eut été le
même. Et c'est là la position qu'elle prend. Devant les jurés, cependant, elle
considéra l'affaire bien autrement, puisqu'alors, elle jugea essentiel à
l'avancement de sa cause de porter à leur connaissance cette preuve illégale.
Et même devant nous, en cherchant à se justifier de l'avoir introduite, ses
deux procureurs ont plaidé avec vigueur les propositions suivantes que l'un
d'eux avait couchées par écrit, avant d'en donner communication verbale à cette
Oour, à la fin de l'argument de la Couronne:—

1. The issue was whether the accused
was telling the truth when he testified that he did not remember the
circumstances.

2. The object of this evidence was to show that he could not
be believed.

3. This evidence was most relevant to the issue, in view of
what Doctor Moffatt had said.

La Couronne a bien raison d'affirmer que la
crédibilité de l'accusé constituait le principal problème soumis aux jurés.
Mais, précisément pour cette raison, la Couronne ne peut maintenant demander de
considérer comme négligeable cette preuve illégale qu'elle a jugé essentiel
d'introduire sur cette question cruciale que les jurés avaient à déterminer.
Les deux positions sont manifestement irréconciliables. Aussi bien m'est-il
impossible de conclure que l'intimée a établi, comme elle en avait le fardeau,
que, sans la présence de cette preuve, le verdict eut été le même.

Je maintiendrais l'appel, annulerais le
verdict et ordonnerais un nouveau procès.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Jury trial—Non-capital
murder—Murder committed by accomplice during robbery—Prosecution of common
purpose—Charge to jury—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 202, 21(2).

The respondent and a companion, who that day
had purchased a hunting knife in the presence of the respondent, drove a woman
to a lonely spot with the intention to rob her. The companion and the woman got
out of the car and the respondent turned the car around and stopped it but left
the engine running. Some distance from the car, the companion inflicted
multiple stab wounds on the woman, from which she died. Her purse which was
found nearby contained no money. The respondent and his companion were charged
with non-capital murder and were granted separate trials. The respondent was
convicted by a jury. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a
new trial. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as
to whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the trial judge was wrong
in failing to direct the jury that before they could find the respondent guilty
of non-capital murder they must find that he knew or ought to have known that
the death of the victim would be a probable consequence of carrying out the
robbery. The submission of the Crown was that the respondent was guilty of
non-capital murder by virtue of the combined effect of s. 202  and
s. 21  of the Criminal Code .

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

The trial judge rightly interpreted and
applied ss. 202 and 21(2) of the Code and his charge to

[Page 639]

the jury was correct in law. On the true
construction of these two sections as applied to the circumstances of this
case it was necessary to support a verdict of guilty against the respondent
that the Crown should establish (i) that it was in fact a probable consequence
of the prosecution of the common purpose of the respondent and his companion to
rob the victim that the companion for the purpose of facilitating the
commission of the robbery would intentionally cause bodily harm to the victim;
(ii) that it was kown or ought to have been known to the respondent that such
consequence was probable and (iii) that in fact the victim’s death ensued from
the bodily harm. There is nothing in the words of s. 21(2) to support the
view that foresight of the victim’s death as a probable consequence of the
robbery should have to be found to exist before the respondent could be convicted
of such murder by the application of the section. The jury was accurately
instructed on this vital issue and there was ample evidence to support their
verdict.

The other grounds of appeal put forward by
counsel for the respondent in the course of his oral argument should be
rejected.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
quashing the conviction of the respondent on a charge of non-capital murder.
Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

T.G. Bowen-Colthurst, Q.C., for the
appellant.

R.V. Storrow, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to leave granted by this Court on December 15, 1969, from an unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 pronounced on
November 20, 1969, quashing the conviction of the respondent before Ruttan J.
and a jury on February 26, 1969, on the charge that on December 19, 1967, he

[Page 640]

together with Isaac Darryl Frank did commit the
non-capital murder of Rosie Vollet.

A brief summary of the facts will be sufficient
for an understanding of the points raised before us.

The respondent and another youth by the name of
Isaac Darryl Frank were in the east part of Vancouver, B.C., early in the
morning of December 19, 1967, having spent the night out together. Later that
morning, a hunting knife, the blade of which was five or six inches long, was
purchased by Frank in the presence of the respondent. Following this, Frank
told the respondent “that he needed money to get back down to the States and
that he was going to rob somebody.”

At approximately 9.30 that morning, the
respondent and Frank went over to a gas station a few blocks from the store
where the knife had been purchased and they were seen by an attendant talking
to a woman who had driven in for some gas. This woman was Rosie Vollet, a
forty-year old married woman, who later that day died from knife wounds
inflicted by Frank. The attendant noticed the hunting knife in the hand of one
of the youths but was unable to say which one.

Both Frank and the respondent got into
Mrs. Vollet’s car with her and after it was filled with gas the three left
in the car with Mrs. Vollet driving. Mrs. Vollet had paid for the gas
with a twenty-dollar bill and had other bills in her purse. After travelling a
short distance, Frank “pulled a knife on her and told her that if she wouldn’t
say nothing, she wouldn’t get hurt.” Mrs. Vollet was then directed to pull
over, following which the respondent took over the driving. He drove some
distance out of Vancouver and eventually turned up a side road to a small
clearing which was a lonely spot approximately thirty-six miles from the gas
station. Frank and Mrs. Vollet got out of the car and the respondent
turned the car around and stopped it but left the engine running. Some distance

[Page 641]

from the car, Frank inflicted multiple stab
wounds on Mrs. Vollet, from which she died at least twenty minutes and
possibly two hours later. The respondent helped Frank move Mrs. Vollet
from the road and the two then returned together to Vancouver in the Vollet car
with the respondent driving. There, they picked up the respondent’s “girl
friend” and the three proceeded in the Vollet car to Corvallis in the State of
Oregon where they were arrested.

Mrs. Vollet’s body was later found by the
police and nearby was her purse which contained no bills.

The respondent and Frank were charged with the
non-capital murder of Mrs. Vollet and were granted separate trials. No
witnesses testified directly at the respondent’s trial as to the events which
occurred from the time the car left the gas station until after it started back
to Vancouver. The above facts were disclosed in statements made by the
respondent and admitted in evidence at his trial.

The defence called no evidence.

Leave was granted to appeal to this Court on the
following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that
the learned trial Judge was wrong in failing to direct the jury that before
they could find the respondent guilty of non-capital murder they must find that
the respondent knew or ought to have known that the death of Rosie Vollet would
be a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery?

The submission of the Crown at the trial and
before us was that the respondent was guilty of non-capital murder by virtue of
the combined effect of s. 202  and s. 21  of the Criminal Code  which
so far as applicable to the facts of this case read as follows:

202. Culpable homicide is murder where a
person causes the death of a human being while com-

[Page 642]

mitting or attempting to commit… robbery…
whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and whether
or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

(a) he means to cause bodily harm
for the purpose of

therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

In his charge to the jury, the learned trial
Judge reviewed the sections of the Criminal Code  dealing with
homicide, culpable homicide, manslaughter and murder and then dealt with
ss. 202  and 21(2) . In effect he told the jury that before they could find the
respondent guilty it was necessary that they should find that he knew or ought
to have known that in carrying out the robbery Frank would cause bodily harm to
the deceased for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the robbery or
flight after its commission but that it was not necessary that

[Page 643]

they should find that the respondent knew or
ought to have known that the death of the deceased was likely to be caused.

In summarizing this portion of his charge, the
learned trial Judge used these words:

Now, let us return once again on my
instructions on the law of murder that apply here. Remember that I said to you
that the Crown must establish that the crime of murder as defined in Section
202 (a) and (d) of the Criminal Code  has been committed on
the part of the accused person; that is, the Crown must relate the accused
person to that crime of murder by showing that the accused was a joint
participant in a crime of robbery, that he was associated throughout in the
planning and carrying out of that robbery with the other accused Frank, that
during the course of that robbery and as part of the robbery and while the
robbery was still in effect, or while the accuseds were seeking to escape from
that robbery and as a result thereof Mrs. Vollet was injured, bodily
injury was done to her as a result of which she died; and finally, and most
importantly, that the accused knew or should have known that in the course of
carrying out this robbery the other accused Frank would probably cause injury
to this lady of the nature that was applied to her and that injury was caused
to her either for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the robbery or
facilitating flight after committing it.

The reasons given in the Court of Appeal make it
clear that that Court was unanimously of opinion that the learned trial Judge
should have told the jury that they could not find the respondent guilty unless
they found that the respondent knew or ought to have known that the deceased’s
death would be a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery. The reasons
state this to be the effect of the decisions in Cathro v. The Queen[2]; Chow Bew v. The Queen[3]; R. v. Eng. Git Lee[4]; R. v. Guay & Guay[5]; R. v.

[Page 644]

Black & Mackie[6] and an unreported
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in R. v. Calli &
Shoemaker decided on July 27, 1966, a copy of which was supplied to us by
counsel.

Before referring to these cases I think it
desirable to consider the words of s. 202  and s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code , which have been quoted above. In my opinion the learned trial Judge
rightly interpreted and applied those sections and his charge to the jury
was correct in law. He made it clear to the jury that before they could convict
the respondent of murder they must find that he and Frank formed an intention
in common to rob the deceased, that in carrying out that common purpose Frank
committed the murder of the deceased as defined in s. 202 (a)
and/or (d) (my italics) and that the respondent knew or ought
to have known that the commission of murder as so defined (my italics)
would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose. The offence
of murder which Frank committed and the commission of which the respondent
ought to have foreseen as probable was complete when, while committing the
robbery, Frank intentionally caused bodily harm to the deceased and her death
in fact resulted therefrom. With respect, the construction of the
sections adopted by the Court of Appeal appears to me to fail to give
effect to the words in s. 202  “whether or not the person means to cause
death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be
caused to any human being”.

If the respondent ought to have known that it
was probable that bodily harm would be inflicted on the deceased to facilitate
the carrying out of the robbery, then it was unnecessary for the Crown to
establish that he ought to have foreseen that her death was likely to result.
The offence contemplated by s. 21(2)  (that is murder as defined in s. 202 
(a) and/or (d)) was committed when Frank inflicted the bodily

[Page 645]

harm on the deceased for the purpose of
facilitating the robbery or flight. Its character was determined when her death
ensued.

I can find nothing in the words of s. 21(2) 
to support the view that foresight of the victim’s death as a probable
consequence of the robbery, an element expressly excluded in the definition of
the offence of murder in s. 202 , should have to be found to exist before
the respondent could be convicted of such murder by the application of
s. 21(2) .

In my opinion in neither of the cases of Cathro
v. The Queen or Chow Bew v. The Queen did this Court enunciate an
interpretation of the predecessors of s. 202  and s. 21(2)  different
from that I have set out above. I think some confusion has arisen in the
application of those decisions because of the frequent use in the reaons of the
word “murder” without making it clear that the word as used meant murder as
defined in s. 260, the predecessor of s. 202 .

The case of R. v. Guay & Guay is
complicated by the circumstance that on the evidence it was open to the jury to
find that the common unlawful purpose under s. 21(2)  was either theft or
robbery, and theft is not one of the offences mentioned in s. 202 . If this
case or the other decisions relied on by the Court of Appeal in the case at bar
which I have listed above, hold that a person, A, who forms a common intention
with another person, B, to rob and to assist in the robbery cannot be convicted
of murder if B in carrying out the robbery commits a murder as defined in
s. 202 (a) and/or (d) unless it is established that A
knew or ought to have known that the death of the victim was a probable
consequence of carrying out the robbery, then in my opinion, they were wrongly
decided and ought not to be followed.

At the risk of repetition, it is my opinion that
on the true construction of s. 202  and s. 21(2)  as applied to the
circumstances of this case it was necessary to support a verdict of

[Page 646]

guilty againt the respondent that the Crown
should establish (i) that it was in fact a probable consequence of the
prosecution of the common purpose of the respondent and Frank to rob
Mrs. Vollet that Frank for the purpose of facilitating the commission of
the robbery would intentionally cause bodily harm to Mrs. Vollet, (ii)
that it was known or ought to have been known to the respondent that such
consequence was probable and (iii) that in fact Mrs. Vollet’s death ensued
from the bodily harm. It was not necessary for the Crown to establish that the
respondent knew or ought to have known that it was probable that
Mrs. Vollet’s death would ensue. In my opinion the jury were accurately
instructed on this vital issue and there was ample evidence to support their
verdict.

It appears from what I have said above that, if
the only ground of appeal from the verdict of guilty had been that on which the
Court of Appeal proceeded, I would allow the appeal but in the course of their
reasons the Court of Appeal stated that they did not find it necessary to deal
with the other grounds of appeal which were argued before them.

These other grounds are not set out in the
Appeal Case or in the factums but counsel for the respondent in the course of
his oral argument put forward the following:

First:—When the jury returned for further
instruction the learned trial Juge said to them:

As far as Trinneer is concerned to fix him
with responsibility for murder the Crown must satisfy you that Trinneer knew or
should have known, first of all the Crown must satisfy you that Trinneer was a
party to the robbery too, that he was committing the robbery jointly with
Frank. And then the Crown must satisfy you that Trinneer knew or should have
known that while Frank was carrying out the robbery or was escaping after the
robbery was committed that Frank would probably cause injury to somebody, the
victim of the robbery in this case, for the purpose of carrying out the robbery
or for getting away, escaping, and if

[Page 647]

Trinneer knew or should have known that
Frank would use violence under those circumstances or should have known that
Frank would probably use violence under those circumstances, then Trinneer is
just as guilty of murder as Frank is.

For the respondent it is submitted that in the
three places where the phrase “satisfy you” is used in this passage the learned
trial Judge should have added the words “beyond a reasonable doubht”. I would
reject this ground. The learned trial Judge had repeatedly and accurately
charged the jury as to the onus on the Crown to prove the guilt of the
respondent beyond a reasonable doubt. I quote only one passage which is as
follows:

So, the burden rests upon the Crown to
prove these three separate things to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable
doubt before there can be a conviction for murder in this case:—

First the Crown must prove that the accused
was a party to the robbery of Mrs. Vollet. Secondly, in carrying out that
robbery Mrs. Vollet came to her death under such circumstances as to
amount to murder as defined in Section 202  of the Criminal Code . And thirdly,
that this accused knew or ought to have known that murder in that form would
probably result from carrying out the robbery.

If the Crown has failed in the proof of any
of these three things the accused must be acquitted.

It is not incumbent on a trial judge to repeat
again and again a rule of law which he has put before the jury clearly and
accurately.

Second:—It is said that some of the statements
made by the accused and admitted by the learned trial Judge should have been
excluded as inadmissible. I have reached the conclusion that the learned trial
Judge did not err in law in deciding that the challenged statements were
voluntary and should be admitted. Had it been otherwise it would have been
necessry to con-

[Page 648]

sider whether there was real substance in this
ground, since every material statement of fact contained in the challenged
statements which was relied on by the Crown appears to have been contained in
other statements of the respondent the admission of which in evidence was not
challenged and could not have been objected to successfully.

Third:—It was argued that the learned trial
Judge erred in not permitting a Crown witness to be cross-examined as to
whether he was a user of marijuana. In my view the learned trial Judge did not
err in law in exercising his discretion to limit the cross-examination of this
witness.

Finally it was submitted that the learned trial
Judge should have directed an acquittal. I have already indicated my view that
there was ample evidence to support the verdict of the jury and that they were
properly directed.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Peace officer assaulted—Officer
investigating earlier occurrence—Execution of his duty—Trespasser—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s.
232(2).

The respondent was charged with assaulting a
police officer contrary to s. 232(2)  of the Criminal Code . Two
constables arrived at the premises of an automobile dealer to investigate a
disturbance. They found a man outside the building who appeared to have been
badly beaten. This man was employed by the dealer and resided with his family
in an apartment at the rear of the building. The officers found

[Page 632]

out that a firearm had been discharged. One
of the constables noticed someone moving inside the office part of the
building. He and another constable who had been dispatched to aid him, called
through an open window and identified themselves as police officers, but
received no response. They finally entered and saw the respondent and another man,
both pretending to be asleep. The respondent was sitting in front of a desk
with his head down on the desk. One of the constables, who was in uniform, told
the respondent that he would be arrested if he did not disclose his identity.
The respondent suddenly arose from his chair and struck the constable in the
face, breaking his nose and injuring his eye. It was subsequently determined
that the respondent was the son of the owner of the building and that the shots
had been fired by the injured man. The trial judge acquitted the respondent on
the ground that the police officers were not in the course of their duty at the
time they broke into the building. The acquittal was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a verdict of guilty substituted.

The constable was on the premises to
investigate an occurrence which had happened earlier in the evening, which
involved the firing of a rifle. He was on duty. Whether on the facts of this
case the constable was, technically, a trespasser or not, he was engaged in the
execution of his duties at the time when he was assaulted by the respondent,
and at that time there had been no unlawful interference with either the
liberty or the property of the respondent.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario,
affirming the appellant’s acquittal. Appeal allowed.

M. Manning, for the appellant.

John O’Driscoll, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The respondent was charged with
assaulting a police officer contrary to

[Page 633]

s. 232(2)  of the Criminal Code . He was
acquitted at trial. The Crown’s appeal was dismissed, without recorded reasons,
by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appellant appeals, with leave of this Court.

The charge arose out of an incident that
occurred at Quality Motors, an automobile dealership in London, Ontario, on the evening of October 11, 1968. Constables Parker and Krux
arrived at this location at approximately 9:10 p.m. to investigate a
disturbance. They found a man outside the building who appeared to have been
badly beaten and was bleeding about the face. It was also evident that he had
been drinking. There was a strong smell of intoxicant on his breath.

This man was Robert Monk, who was employed by
Quality Motors and resided with his wife and a child in an apartment at the
rear of the building. Although his wife was not at home when the officers first
arrived, she did come home later. Monk did not give the officers any
explanation for his condition. The officers did, however, find out at this time
from someone that a firearm had been discharged. Monk was taken back to his
apartment, where he was placed under the supervision of Constable Krux.

At this time Constable Parker noticed someone
moving inside the office part of Quality Motors. This person immediately moved
back into the rear of the office and out of sight. The constable also saw that
there was a light on inside the building and that a side window was open about
two inches. He knocked on the door, which was locked, and called through the
open window, but he received no answer from whoever was inside.

He became apprehensive that someone had broken
into the building. Because of his knowledge that there had been a shooting
earlier, he decided to seek assistance before making any further investigation.
As a result, Constable Wilkinson was dispatched to the scene and arrived
shortly thereafter. Constable Parker waited for him in the rear apartment with
Constable Krux and Monk

[Page 634]

Constables Wilkinson and Parker then attempted
to gain entrance into the building. They tried the rear door leading from
Monk’s apartment, but it was locked. They called through the open window and
identified themselves as police officers, but received no response. By this
time Mrs. Monk had returned and she brought them a chair from her
apartment which Constable Wilkinson used to go through the window. He then let
Constable Parker in through the front door.

There was no evidence that either Mr. or
Mrs. Monk knew who was inside the building. If either of them did know,
the information was not disclosed to the police officers.

Once inside, the two officers searched the first
room and found traces of fresh blood on the floor. They went into the second
room and saw the respondent and another man, Askew. Both were pretending to be
asleep. The respondent was sitting in front of a desk with his head down on the
desk.

According to the respondent’s evidence, he and
Askew had been drinking very heavily at the office over a period of some two
hours, or less. During that time the respondent’s father had returned to the
office. He and the respondent got into an argument and “there were a couple of
light punches thrown and he left.”

Constable Wilkinson shook the respondent and
asked him three or four times what business he had in the office. The
respondent refused to answer. His only reply was: “It is none of your
business.” The trial judge found that at this time the respondent attempted to
use the telephone, but was prevented from doing so by Constable Wilkinson. The
respondent denied that he ever tried to telephone anyone.

Constable Wilkinson then told the respondent
that he would be arrested if he did not disclose his identity. The respondent
suddenly arose from his chair and struck Constable Wilkinson in the face,
breaking his nose and injuring his eye. To stop this attack Constable Wilkinson
hit the respondent with his night stick and Constable Parker hit him in the
face with his fist.

[Page 635]

Subsequently, it was determined that the
respondent was the son of the owner of the building. It was also ascertained
that in the disturbance earlier that evening it was only Monk who had fired any
shots.

The trial judge acquitted the respondent
because, he said, the police officers were not in the course of their duty at
the time they broke into the building. This statement is based upon the
following finding:

…I am satisfied that at that point in time,
they were, in law, trespassers upon the premises and that, in law, neither
Askew or Stenning were obliged to co-operate with them.

But he also made the following finding of fact:

I am satisfied that Wilkinson was on the
premises for the purpose of investigating some occurrence which had happened
earlier in the evening. That he was in uniform, that he had reason to believe
that the two persons that were inside the premises—that is Stenning and
Askew—were in some manner involved in connection with the disturbance which he
had been called there to attend or investigate. I am also satisfied that both
Wilkinson and Parker had attempted to get inside the building or to attract the
attention of the person or persons they thought were inside the building by
calling to them, and I am satisfied that when Parker and Wilkinson got inside
the building that they went into the inner office and found Stenning and Askew
where they said they were located. This evidence would appear to be
uncontroverted.

The offence with which the respondent was
charged is defined in s. 232(2) (a) of the Criminal Code , as
follows:

(2) Every one who

(a) assaults
a public officer or peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty, or a
person acting in aid of such an officer;

…

is guilty of an indictable office and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

Wilkinson was a peace officer, in uniform, and
he was assaulted by the respondent. The only

[Page 636]

issue, in law, is as to whether Wilkinson, in
view of the finding as to the reason why he was on the premises, could be held
not to have been engaged in the execution of his duty at the time he was
assaulted by the respondent. In reaching his conclusion that Wilkinson was not
engaged in that duty, the trial judge appears to base it on the ground that
Wilkinson was a trespasser when he entered the building. Argument was submitted
to us as to whether, on the facts, he was or was not a trespasser. But even if
he was a trespasser, he was not trespassing on the respondent’s premises. The
respondent may have been entitled to be on those premises, but there is no
evidence that, prior to his assault on Wilkinson, he advised Wilkinson as to
this, that he questioned Wilkinson’s right to be there, or that he asked him to
leave. There had been no interference by Wilkinson with the person or the
property of the respondent prior to the assault.

Assuming that Wilkinson did, technically,
trespass on the premises, the fact remains that he was there to investigate an
occurrence which had happened earlier in the evening, which involved the firing
of a rifle. He had been sent out for that purpose. He was charged, under s. 47
of The Police Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 298, with the duty of preserving the
peace, preventing robberies and other crimes, and apprehending offenders. He
was in the course of making an investigation, in the carrying out of that duty,
when he was assaulted by the respondent.

We were referred to a number of English
authorities and some Canadian cases, all of which turned upon facts which
differed from the facts found in this case. Their effect is stated in the
judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Waterfield[1]:

In the judgment of this court it would be
difficult, and in the present case it is unnecessary, to reduce within specific
limits the general terms in which the duties of police constables have been
expressed.

[Page 637]

In most cases it is probably more convenient to
consider what the police constable was actually doing and in particular whether
such conduct was prima facie an unlawful interference with a person’s liberty
or property. If so, it is then relevant to consider whether (a) such
conduct falls within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute or
recognised at common law and (b) whether such conduct, albeit within the
general scope of such a duty, involved an unjustifiable use of powers
associated with the duty.

On the facts of this case, as found by the trial
judge, whether Wilkinson was, technically, a trespasser, or not, he was engaged
in the execution of his duties at the time when he was assaulted by the respondent,
and at that time there had been no unlawful interference with either the
liberty or the property of the respondent.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the verdict
of acquittal, and substitute therefor a verdict of guilty in respect of the
offence charged. In view of the fact that the Crown did not press for any
sentence of imprisonment, I would impose a fine of one hundred dollars. In
default of payment of such fine I would sentence the respondent to imprisonment
for a term of seven days.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiring to evade payment of
tax—Suppression of profits—Allocation of appellant’s transactions to
company—Duty of determining whether transactions resulted in taxable income or
capital gain—Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 132.

Appeal—Criminal law—Jurisdiction—Appeal by
Crown to Court of Appeal—Question of law alone—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 584(1)(a), 597(2)(a).

The appellant was acquitted at trial on a
charge of conspiring to wilfully evade payment of taxes by suppressing taxable
income, contrary to s. 132(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 148. The reasonable doubt which the trial judge expressed as giving rise
to his acquittal of the appellant was based on three questions: (1) his view as
to the proper definition of the word “suppressing” appearing in the indictment;
(2) that the Minister had not made any decision fixing the character of the
profits as being income and that unless such decision has been made the accused
could not be convicted of conspiracy to evade the payment of tax on income; and
(3) on his view of the auditors’ reports. On appeal by the Crown, the Court of
Appeal directed a conviction of the appellant. He appealed to this Court and
submitted that the Court of Appeal had gone beyond its jurisdiction.

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The trial judge erred in law in his
interpretation of the meaning of the word “suppression” when

[Page 805]

he held that a falsification of the true
facts, by attributing transactions which were the appellant’s to a company
would not be sufficient; only a total failure to account would be enough. He
also erred in law in holding that the determination as to whether the profits
were income or capital gains was for the Minister, and beyond the purview of
the Court. While the judge has stated that he was unable to establish, by
inference from the evidence, an agreement to conspire as charged in the
indictment, he has, in his own reasons, shown that what he considered to be
necessary to establish such an agreement was based upon an erroneous conception
of the law. This was an error of law and therefore subject to appeal by the
Crown.

Per Ritchie
and Pigeon JJ.: The trial judge’s finding of reasonable doubt was founded in
error at law and on a misapplication of the law to the evidence. His judgment
was therefore the proper subject of an appeal under s. 584(1)  (a) of the
Criminal Code .

Per Spence J.:
The Court of Appeal, in considering the three questions upon which the trial
judge had professed to have based his reasonable doubt, were considering
questions of law alone and they had jurisdiction to come to their own decision
on those questions of law and to differ from the trial judge, using alone his
findings of fact. The meaning in law to be given to a word which appears in an
indictment or in a section of the Code is purely a question of law and the
Court of Appeal had the jurisdiction to differ from the opinion of the trial
judge as to the meaning in law of the word “suppressing”. To hold that the
decision that the payments received by the appellant were income was a decision
necessary for the trial judge himself to make and was not a decision to be made
by the Minister is certainly a decision upon a question of pure law. Again the
Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to come to such a decision in law. The
Court of Appeal found that the reports upon which the trial judge based his
finding of reasonable. doubt could not, in evidence, supply a reasonable doubt.
This was a finding on pure law and was within the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeal.

One may not rely on such vague words as “for
these and other reasons” to determine that the trial judge relied on any
general presumption of innocence

[Page 806]

which favoured the accused. The trial judge
found that general presumption of innocence had been rebutted apart from the
three reasons in law for which he, in error, assigned his reasonable doubt.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall J., dissenting: The judgment of the trial judge was based
on one or more distinct grounds that do not involve questions of law alone. The
Court of Appeal should have dismissed the Crown’s appeal. A ground which is ex
facie one of fact or mixed fact and law may prove to be vitiated by an
error in law in the strict sense, for example, if the trial judge acquits
because the evidence does not satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt and he has
mistakenly excluded a piece of vital and legally admissible evidence duly
tendered by the Crown. In such a case the Court of Appeal would have
jurisdiction to set aside the judgment of acquittal.

In the case at bar, it was essential for the
prosecution to prove that the moneys were taxable income. The trial judge did
not base his finding that he was not satisfied that the moneys in question were
taxable income on the failure of the Minister to assess the profits as income
but on the view which he took of the evidence as a whole. The question whether
his conclusion was right or wrong is not one of law alone.

It appears from the reasons of the trial
judge read as a whole that he based his decision on the following two grounds
amongst others (i) that he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
appellant acted with a guilty mind and (ii) that he was not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the moneys were taxable income. These were distinct
grounds for his decision and in neither was the question whether his view was
right or wrong a question of law alone.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal

was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The
wording of the indictment charging the appellant and Morris Black and the
course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my
brother Spence, which I have had the advantage of reading, and as far as
possible I will refrain from repetition.

On December 26, 1966, at the end of a trial
before His Honour Judge Rogers without a jury which lasted 115 days judgment
was reserved. On February 28, 1967, His Honour delivered oral judgment as follows:

In the matter of Samuel Ciglen and Morris
Black, as set out in my Reasons for Judgment, which consist of one hundred and
seventeen pages, and which are available at the Judges’ Secretary’s office, I
am unable to establish, by inference from the conduct of the accused and the cumulative
effect of the evidence, any agreement to conspire as charged in the indictment.
The accused Ciglen and Black are acquitted.

Early in his reasons the learned Judge
summarized the Crown’s case as follows:

The charge is against Ciglen and Black, they
are the only persons charged in the indictment and the charge is a single
conspiracy to commit one offence, that is to evade the payment of income tax
for the year 1956 by suppressing taxable income of the said Samuel Ciglen and
Morris Black. The Crown alleges that the accused made substantial profits in
the sale of Great Sweet Grass and Kroy shares as a result of obtaining shares
in the following deals:

(a) The Pitt Deal.

(b) The Depositors Mutual Deal.

(c) The Kroy-Fulton Deal.

(d) The Kroy-Coronet Deal.

The basis of the Crown’s case is that the
profits made in the sale of the shares belonged to the ac-

[Page 808]

cused and that to evade payment of taxes
thereon, they designated the corporations and the trusts as the persons
entitled to the bulk of the profits, and then contrived to retain the profits
for themselves and any profits not so designated were suppressed.

The phrase “the corporations and the trusts”
refers to some of those named as co‑conspirators in the indictment or in
the particulars given by the Crown.

The Court of Appeal[2] upheld the acquittal of Black and found
itself unable to reverse the conclusions arrived at by the learned trial Judge
in regard to the Pitt Deal, the Depositors Mutual Deal and the Kroy-Coronet
Deal. It based its allowance of the Crown’s appeal and the entering of a
verdict of guilty against Ciglen on the findings of the learned trial Judge in
regard to the transactions involved in the Kroy-Fulton Deal and the disposition
of the profits arising therefrom. In the view of the Court of Appeal the
reasons of the learned trial Judge dealing with this phase of the matter
contained serious errors in law and when these errors were corrected the facts
as found by him led inevitably to the conclusion that Ciglen was guilty as
charged.

This Court in The Queen v. Warner[3] decided that when a judgment of acquittal
is based on distinct grounds, one of which involves a question which is not one
of law alone, an appellate court whose jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from
an acquittal is limited to grounds of appeal that involve a question of law
alone is powerless to interfere with the judgment of acquittal although other
of the distinct grounds on which that judgment was based do involve questions
of law alone. In applying this rule it must be borne in mind that a ground
which is ex facie one of fact or mixed fact and law may prove to be
vitiated by an error in law in the strict sense. To give a simple example, a
decision worded “I acquit the accused because the evidence does not satisfy me
of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt” may be successfully

[Page 809]

attacked on the ground that the trial Court had
mistakenly excluded a piece of vital and legally admissible evidence duly
tendered by the Crown. In such a case no doubt the Court of Appeal would have
jurisdiction to set aside the judgment of acquittal and direct a new trial. The
differences of opinion in this Court in The Queen v. Warner were not as
to the scope of the rule but as to the interpretation of the judgment of the
Court below.

In the case at bar counsel for the appellant
contends that the decision of the learned trial Judge was based on several
distinct grounds of fact or of mixed fact and law and that for this reason the
Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal. Whether or not this
contention is well founded is, of course, a question of law on which an appeal
to this Court lies under s. 597 (2)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

In view of the wording of the charge, to
establish the guilt of the accused it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt (i) that the profits from the sale of shares of Great
Sweet Grass Oils Limited and Kroy Oils Limited for the taxation year 1956 were
properly attributable to the accused, (ii) that such profits were taxable income,
(iii) that Ciglen conspired to suppress this taxable income and (iv) that he
did so to evade payment of taxes imposed in respect of such income by the Income
Tax Act.

If it were proved that Ciglen agreed with
another or others to wilfully evade payment of such taxes the offence charged
would be complete even though the carrying out of the agreement was thwarted;
but to support a conviction it was necessary for the Crown to establish that
the agreement if carried out would have resulted in the commission of the
offence created by s. 132(1) (d) of the Income Tax Act. As
is often the case in the trial of a charge of conspiracy, there is no direct
evidence of the making of the agreement charged

[Page 810]

in the indictment. The Crown asks that its
making be inferred from the fact that, as it alleges, the offence contemplated
was actually committed.

At p. 106 of his reasons the learned trial Judge
makes the following statement:

…If I am to look at this case in its
broadest terms from the standpoint of a conspiracy to do an illegal act, in my
view, it would be incumbent upon the Crown to demonstrate that there would be
an evasion of a tax liability. On the evidence I am unable to say whether the
moneys are subject to tax.

He expresses the same conclusion elsewhere in
his reasons; at p. 102:

…Under the circumstances, this Court is
unable, on the evidence before it, and taking the case for the Crown at its
highest, to determine whether the profits so derived are, beyond a reasonable
doubt, income in the hands of the two accused as opposed to capital gains.

and at p. 114:

…It seems to this Court that it would be
incumbent upon the Crown to demonstrate that there would be an evasion of tax
liability by suppression. I am, however, unable to determine on all of the
evidence whether the moneys are subject to tax and for this reason, amongst
others, I can draw no conclusive inference.

As has been pointed out above it was essential
for the prosecution to prove that the moneys in question were taxable income
and the finding of the learned trial Judge that the evidence does not satisfy
him of this is on its face fatal to the Crown’s case.

In the view of the Court of Appeal, however,
this finding was vitiated by an error of law in that the learned trial Judge in
effect directed himself that it was necessary that there should be a
determination by the Minister of National Revenue as to whether the profits
were capital gains or income subject to tax before a prosecution could proceed
successfully. Had the learned trial Judge so directed himself it would clearly
have been an error in law, but, as I read his reasons, he did not

[Page 811]

do so. He does seem to say that had there been
an assessment by the Minister treating the profits as taxable income the onus
of proving the contrary would have fallen upon the accused. While that would be
true in civil proceedings it would not be true in a criminal prosecution but
since there was in fact no assessment the question need not be pursued.

In my opinion the following passage at pp. 82
and 83 in the reasons of the learned trial Judge makes it clear that he
rejected the submission of counsel for the accused that it was necessary for
the Crown to show that an assessment had been made:

Counsel for the accused Ciglen advanced an
argument that there could be no offence under Section 132(1)(d) of
the Income Tax Act of wilfully evading the payment of taxes imposed by the Act
unless an assessment had been made, i.e. that the only crime envisioned by the
Income Tax Act was one of evading payment of taxes which had been actually
assessed. The two words ‘taxes imposed’ are not defined in the Income Tax Act
and consequently their meaning must be found elsewhere. Section 139(1)(ba)
defines the term “tax payable by taxpayer” as meaning the tax payable by him as
fixed by assessment or re-assessment subject to variation on objection or on
appeal, if any, in accordance with the relevant appeal provisions of the Act.

The facts in this case are that at no time
were Ciglen and Black assessed for the profits from the sale of Kroy and Great
Sweet Grass shares in issue herein and, in my view, the ordinary meaning of
“imposed” does not necessarily carry with it the connotation or ingredient of
“assessment” or calculation of amount. It is simply the liability to taxation.

It is obvious that if the learned trial Judge
had accepted the submission of counsel for Ciglen on this point he would have
dismissed the charge and reasons of over one hundred pages would have become
unnecessary. As I read his reasons, the learned trial Judge did not base his
finding that he was not satisfied that the moneys in question were taxable
income on the failure of the Minister to assess but on the view which he took
of the evi-

[Page 812]

dence as a whole. The question whether his
conclusion was right or wrong is not one of law alone.

Another ground on which the learned trial Judge
based his decision to acquit appears in his reasons at p. 114, where he says:

Having dealt with the P.O.G.N. reports,
which in law are evidence both for and against the accused Ciglen, I am of the
opinion that these reports have raised a reasonable doubt in my mind as to the
guilt of the accused Ciglen for the offence of conspiracy as charged.

The Court of Appeal criticized this finding on
the ground that having found that Ciglen had a beneficial interest in the
shares from which the profits realized in the Kroy-Fulton deal were derived and
had used those shares as his own property, the learned trial Judge could not
rely on the POGN reports allocating such profits to Torny Financial Corporation
Ltd. as raising a doubt as to the guilt of the accused. If it be agreed that
the POGN reports could not be relied on to raise a doubt as to Ciglen’s
beneficial interest in the shares in question they might yet raise a doubt as to
Ciglen’s guilty intention to evade payment of tax. In the view of the learned
trial Judge the allocation of the profits to Torny was not necessarily
inconsistent with the existence of a noncriminal intention on the part of
Ciglen and was as consistent with an intention to avoid tax, that is lawfully
to so arrange matters as not to attract tax, as with an intention to evade tax.
Once again the question whether this view was erroneous is not a question of
law alone. The “well known and very important distinction between avoidance and
evasion in relation to the law of taxation” has recently been emphasized in the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Yukon Territory, delivered by
MacFarlane J.A., in The Queen v. Regehr[4],
in which it was held that a count charging that the accused “did wilfully avoid
a payment of taxes imposed by the Income Tax Act in that he failed to
report all of his income contrary to para. (d) of Subsection (1)

[Page 813]

of Section 132 of the said Act” did not
charge an offence known to the law, and leave to amend by changing the word
“avoid” to “evade” was refused.

The Court of Appeal was further of opinion that
the learned trial Judge erred in law in defining “suppression” as a total
failure to account. The passage criticized appears at pp. 109 and 110 of the
reasons of the learned trial Judge. It is as follows:

…The Crown has clearly made out a prima
facie case of an agreement betwen Samuel Ciglen and Torny Financial Corporation
Limited to treat these matters as having been Torny transactions. Whether such
an allocation can be equated with an intention to evade tax payable through
suppression or in the light of its disclosure in the P.O.G.N. reports albeit as
a Torny transaction as an attempt to attract no tax is open to serious doubt.
In my view, suppression denotes something more than an allocation and is a
total failure to account. It is for this reason that the explanations put forth
in the P.O.G.N. reports by way of adjusting entries must be shown as false.

Proof that an accused allocated income of his
own to a third party if shown to be done with the intention of evading payment
of income tax imposed upon him by the Income Tax Act would support a
finding that he was guilty of a breach of s. 132(1)(d); but when the
passage quoted is read in the light of the reasons as a whole it appears that
the learned trial Judge in distinguishing between “allocation” and “total
failure to account” was pointing out that the former is more consistent with an
innocent intention than is the latter. I cannot find in the passage quoted an
error of law which vitiates the judgment of acquittal.

[Page 814]

It is clear that mens rea is an essential
element of an offence against s. 132(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act; the
use of the word “wilfully” in the clause puts this beyond question. It is trite
law that a taxpayer is free to so arrange his affairs as to attract as little
liability to tax as possible provided that in so doing he does not employ
unlawful means. Of course guilty intent may be inferred from the actions of an
accused but the question whether or not the guilty intent exists is one of
fact. This is expressly stated in the judgment of this Court in Lampard v.
The Queen[5].

The learned trial Judge ended his reasons as
follows:

Since a taxpayer is entitled to adopt a
position that will not attract any tax as opposed to wilfully evading payment
of tax imposed by the Act, and if such a course of conduct is open to a
taxpayer, it has a direct bearing on the issue of a guilty mind.

I am unable to establish by inference from
the conduct of the accused and the cumulative effect of the evidence herein,
any agreement to conspire as charged in the indictment, the accused Samuel
Ciglen is acquitted.

It appears from the reasons of the learned trial
Judge read as a whole that he based his decision on the following two grounds
amongst others (i) that he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
Ciglen acted with a guilty mind and (ii) that he was not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the moneys in question were taxable income. In my opinion
these were distinct grounds for his decision and in neither was the question
whether his view was right or wrong a question of law alone.

The right of appeal given by s. 584(1)  (a)
of the Criminal Code  to the Attorney General or counsel instructed by
him, was unknown to the Common Law. No similar right exists in England although it does exist in some
other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth. It is the creature of statute and is
strictly limited in scope. The power of the Court of Appeal to set aside a
judgment of a

[Page 815]

court of competent jurisdiction acquitting an
accused of an indictable offence extends only to grounds of appeal that involve
questions of law alone. It is, I suggest, of the utmost importance that the
Courts should guard against extending this power by judicial decision to cases,
not falling strictly within the terms of the statute creating it, in which the
Court of Appeal is satisfied that the judgment of acquittal is clearly wrong.
When an appeal is brought from a conviction of an indictable offence the Court
of Appeal has power to allow the appeal if “it is of the opinion that the
verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence”; but that Court has no corresponding power in an
appeal from an acquittal; such a power could be conferred only by Parliament;
its creation would be without precedent in the Commonwealth.

For the reasons set out above it is my opinion
that the judgment of the learned trial Judge acquitting the appellant was based
on one or more distinct grounds that do not involve questions of law alone and
that this case is governed by our decisions in The Queen v. Warner, supra, and
Lampard v. The Queen, supra. It follows from this that the Court of
Appeal should have dismissed the Crown’s appeal.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial acquitting the
appellant.

The judgment of FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND and
JUDSON J.J. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—I am in agreement with the view
expressed by Aylesworth J.A., who delivered the reasons for judgment of the
Court of Appeal[6], that
the trial judge erred in law in his interpretation of the meaning of the word
“suppression”, which appeared in the indictment in the phrase “by suppressing
taxable income of the said Samuel Ciglen.” I agree with him, also, that there
was error in law in attributing to the Minister the duty of determining whether
the impugned transactions resulted in taxable income or capital gain.

[Page 816]

The trial judge found as a fact, in connection
with the “Kroy-Fulton deal”:

At this point, however, I would find as a
fact that, at the time of the delivery of the shares to the Bank of Nova
Scotia, March 19th, 1956, Ciglen exercised such control over the said shares
that it is a reasonable inference he had a beneficial interest in the same. He
used the shares as if they were his own property. I would also find as a fact
that the rewritten General Ledger of Torny was a falsification of the facts as
they occurred at the time of the Fulton deal.

Later in his reasons he said this:

…the Crown has clearly made out a prima
facie case of an agreement between Samuel Ciglen and Torny Financial
Corporation Limited to treat these matters as having been Torny transactions.
Whether such an allocation can be equated with an intention to evade tax
payable through suppression or in the light of its disclosure in the P.O.G.N.
reports albeit as a Torny transaction as an attempt to attract no tax is open
to serious doubt. In my view, suppression denotes something more than an
allocation and is a total failure to account. It is for this reason that the
explanations put forth in the P.O.G.N. reports by way of adjusting entries must
be shown as false.

This is a statement of the understanding of the
trial judge as to what evidence was necessary to establish a suppressing of
taxable income. A falsification of the true facts, by attributing transactions
which were his own, to Torny, would not be sufficient. Only a total failure to
account would be enough.

This was an error in law, and his conclusion as
to the guilt of the appellant has to be considered in the light of that error.
That conclusion is expressed later, as follows:

Having dealt with the P.O.G.N. reports,
which in law are evidence both for and against the accused Ciglen, I am of the
opinion that these reports have raised a reasonable doubt in my mind as to the
guilt of the accused Ciglen for the offence of conspiracy as charged.

[Page 817]

As Aylesworth J.A. has pointed out, the P.O.G.N.
reports, which were auditors’ reports, were based, and had to be based, on
Torny’s ledger, which, the trial judge had already found, had been rewritten
and was a falsification of the facts of the Kroy-Fulton deal.

They did disclose an allocation of income to
Torny. The trial judge, even though they disclosed an allocation which he
himself had found to be false, felt that they created a reasonable doubt as to
the appellant’s guilt. But in so holding he was applying an erroneous concept
as to what evidence was necessary to establish suppression.

The trial judge also erred in law when
considering whether the impugned transaction resulted in taxable income to the
appellant. I cite the following passages from his judgment:

Traditionally, profits derived from the
sale of stocks and bonds have not been treated as income by the Department of
National Revenue even though it is conceded that this is an anomaly under the
law relating to the distinction between capital gains and income. It does not
appear to me to be within the purview of this Court to determine whether the
profits received here are income as proceeds of a business or a capital gain.

It is in the discretion of the Minister of
National Revenue and he has not seen fit to make such a designation in this
case. Were he to do so, this issue would be subject to review by the Income Tax
Appeal Board and/or the Exchequer Court in the manner provided for in the Income Tax Act. Under the
circumstances, this Court is unable, on the evidence before it, and taking the
case for the Crown at its highest, to determine whether the profits so derived
are, beyond a reasonable doubt, income in the hands of the two accused as
opposed to capital gains.

* * *

If I am to look at this case in its broadest
terms from the standpoint of a conspiracy to do an illegal act, in my view, it
would be incumbent upon the Crown to demonstrate that there would be an evasion
of a tax liability. On the evidence I am unable to say whether the moneys are
subject to tax.

* * *

[Page 818]

However, I am of the view that, unless there is
a statutory onus, and there is none in the Income Tax Act, nothing displaces
the ordinary law in relation to a criminal case, which is that the Crown must
establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and whether these
transactions are capital gain or not are matters that should be determined by
the Minister, and are not facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused.
Had the Minister made an assessment, then the duty of explanation would arise.

The trial judge erred in law in holding that the
determination as to whether the profits were income or capital gains was for
the Minister, and beyond the purview of the Court, and that he was unable to
make a decision on the evidence before him.

As Aylesworth J.A. points out, the trial judge
had actually made a finding of fact on this point, when he said:

There does not seem to be much doubt on the
evidence that both Ciglen and Black, through the assistance of various
individuals and companies, actively engaged in the promotion and sale and thus
in the trading of shares of Great Sweet Grass and Kroy.

In the penultimate paragraph of his judgment,
the trial judge, dealing with the issue of a guilty mind, said this:

Since a taxpayer is entitled to adopt a
position that will not attract any tax as opposed to wilfully evading payment
of tax imposed by the Act, and if such a course of conduct is open to a
taxpayer, it has a direct bearing on the issue of a guilty mind.

He approaches that issue by relying upon the
proposition which was stated by Lord Tomlin in The Commissioners of Inland
Revenue v. The Duke of Westminster[7]:

Every man is entitled if he can to order
his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less
than it otherwise would be.

But in relation to the Kroy-Fulton deal, that
can have no relevance, when, on the trial judge’s

[Page 819]

own finding, records were deliberately falsified
in order to allocate profits accruing to the appellant to Torny.

The trial judge concluded his reasons by saying,
immediately after the paragraph above quoted:

I am unable to establish by inference from
the conduct of the accused and the cumulative effect of the evidence herein,
any agreement to conspire as charged in the indictment, the accused Samuel
Ciglen is acquitted.

For the appellant it is urged that this is a
finding of fact or of mixed fact and law, and, therefore, not subject to appeal
by the Crown. But when the trial judge reached that conclusion, for the reasons
already outlined, he was considering the evidence under a misconception of law
as to what was necessary to be proved in order to establish the Crown’s case.
The error in this case was as to the legal effect of facts which he had found,
and that is an error of law. Chief Justice Anglin, in Belyea v. R.[8], said this:

The right of appeal by the
Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013 (4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11,
s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to “questions of
law.” That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can be no attack by
him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot
regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court,
where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of
the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain
findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire
into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything
else but a question of law,—especially where, as here, it is a clear result of
misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.

I do not regard the judgment of this Court in Warner
v. R.[9], as
affecting the application of that

[Page 820]

principle to the circumstances of this case. In
that case, on an appeal by the accused from a conviction of murder, the Chief
Justice of Alberta, delivering the unanimous reasons of the Appellate Division,
on appeal, said:

I am strongly of the opinion that the
verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go
further, and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction.

The majority of this Court, on a five to four
division, dismissed the Crown’s appeal from this judgment.

Chief Justice Kerwin said, at p. 147:

I read the first sentence as meaning that
the Chief Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a
conviction,—which is a question of fact.

Cartwright J., as he then was, delivering the
reasons of himself and two other members of the Court, held that this first
ground of decision was a distinct ground, upon which the judgment was based,
and was a ground raising no question of law in the strict sense.

Under s. 592 (1) of the Criminal Code  the
Appellate Division, on an appeal against conviction, was empowered to allow the
appeal where the verdict could not be supported by the evidence, as well as
where the verdict, at trial, involved a wrong decision on a question of law.
Under s. 597, on appeal from the Appellate Division, this Court was only
empowered to allow an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division on a
question of law.

Cartwright J. said, at p. 149:

So far as the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to
interfere with it. The question whether the Appellate Division was right in
proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a
question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a
mixed question of fact and law.

At p. 152 he said:

I conclude that the Appellate Division
quashed the conviction on the ground inter alia that it can-

[Page 821]

not be supported by the evidence, that this
was a distinct ground on which its judgment was based, that it is a ground
raising no question of law in the strict sense and that it is nihil ad rem that
the judgment was based also on other grounds raising such points of law.

No opinion was expressed by the majority of the
Court as to what the situation would have been if the decision expressed by the
Appellate Division that the verdict could not be supported by the evidence had
been based upon a mistaken view as to the law applicable. That issue did,
however, arise in R. v. Lemire[10], a
case in which, on an appeal from conviction, the appellate court had held that
certain evidence created a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. At
p. 192, the view of the majority of this Court on that issue was expressed as
follows:

In my opinion, on an appeal from a
conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that certain
specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused,
when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any
doubt as to his guilt, there is an error in law.

In the present case, the situation is that,
while the trial judge has stated that he was unable to establish, by inference
from the evidence, an agreement to conspire as charged in the indictment, he
has, in his own reasons, shown that what he considered to be necessary to
establish an agreement to conspire, as charged in the indictment, was based
upon an erroneous conception of the law.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Ritchie and Pigeon J.J. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I share the opinion, as expressed in
the reasons for judgment of my brothers Martland and Spence, that the learned
trial judge’s finding of reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant was
founded in error at law and on a misapplication of the law to the evidence; his
judgment was therefore in my view the proper

[Page 822]

subject of an appeal by the Attorney General of
Canada under the provisions of s. 584 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[11] pronounced on January 7, 1969. By that judgment, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario allowed an
appeal from the judgment of Rogers, Co. Ct. J., pronounced on February 28, 1967, in which he acquitted the
appellant and his co-accused Morris Black, and directed a conviction of Ciglen
in lieu thereof.

The Attorney General for Canada had appealed to the Court of Appeal
from the acquittal of both accused. The Court of Appeal, in its judgment,
confirmed the acquittal as to the accused Black and there is no further appeal
as to that accused.

The appellant and his co-accused, Morris Black,
were charged in the indictment as follows:

That during the years 1955, 1956 and 1957,
at the said Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, and at other divers places,
did, unlawfully, conspire together, the one with the other and with Torny
Financial Corporation Ltd., Compania de Inversiones Amcub, S.A., otherwise
known as Amcub Investment Company Incorporated, Ontario Cobalt Mines Limited,
Glenrich Uranium Mines Limited, Albontec Development Company Limited and
Americana Trading Company Limited and with persons unknown or with someone or
more of them, to wilfully evade payment of taxes imposed on the said Samuel
Ciglen and the said Morris Black by the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, by
suppressing taxable income of the said Samuel Ciglen and the said Morris Black
from the sale of common shares of Great Sweet Grass Oils Limited and Kroy Oils
Limited for the taxation year 1956, in violation of Section 132(1) (d)
of the said Act, contrary to Section 132(1) (e) of the said Act.

The charges were based upon an exceedingly
complicated series of transactions in reference to the shares in two
corporations, Great Sweet Grass

[Page 823]

Oils Limited et Kroy Oils Limited. A la suite
abortive trial, lasting 68 days and terminated by the unfortunate death of the
first trial court judge, the second trial took 115 days before His Honour Judge
Rogers in the County Court of the County of York. The accused called no evidence. At
the first trial, in response to a demand for particulars of the “persons
unknown” referred to in the indictment, the Crown named 32 co-conspirators. At
the new trial, 14 additional co-conspirators were named. The argument on appeal
required 24 days. The material is most voluminous—over 1500 exhibits, several
of them consisting of many documents, were filed.

At trial, four different so-called deals or
series of transactions were examined. Those deals were known as the Pitt deal,
the Depositors Mutual Deal, the Kroy-Fulton Deal, and the Kroy‑Coronet
Deal. As I have said, the learned trial judge acquitted both accused in
reference to all four deals. The judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario was given by Aylesworth J.A. in a
very detailed and carefully worked out set of reasons which cover 39 printed
pages. In those reasons, Aylesworth J.A. affirmed the acquittal of the accused
Black and accepted the trial judge’s acquittal of the accused Ciglen as to the
Pitt deal, the Depositors Mutual deal, and the Kroy-Coronet deal, although the
learned justice in appeal was very puzzled by the learned trial judge’s
findings of fact involved in the acquittal of the accused Ciglen as to any one
of those three deals. Aylesworth J.A. said:

There remains for consideration the effect
of the evidence and findings made by the trial Judge with respect to the
Kroy-Fulton deal so far as they affect Ciglen and the position in law of the
respondent Black in the appeal as a whole.

I have quoted earlier the finding of the
trial Judge that the Kroy-Fulton deal was Ciglen’s own deal and that ex post
facto by falsification of records an attempt was made in agreement with Torny
to treat the deal as a Torny deal. Moreover, as the trial Judge found, Ciglen,
in his personal amended income tax return for 1956, claimed as a deduction bank
inter-

[Page 824]

est on an overdraft he had been allowed by
his bank in connection with his financing of the deal. The trial Judge found
that—

Insofar as the back-dating is concerned, I
have already dealt with this and it is not a piece of evidence from which I can
infer the guilt of the accused as inconsistent with his innocence and that such
is not an unusual practice in any office when the purpose of it is to document
what in fact has occurred so that back-dating in itself is a neutral piece of
evidence.

I should not like to think that in these
observations the trial Judge was directing his mind to the falsification of
documents which he found to have occurred with respect to the Kroy-Fulton deal.
Falsification of documents for one’s own benefit surely is the most cogent
evidence of the existence of the benefit itself—in this case, the existence of
profits and profits in “trading in shares” as found by the trial Judge—and the
suppression of those profits as personal to the accused Ciglen.

Again, I find it difficult in the extreme
to follow the trial Judge’s reasoning in acquitting Ciglen. Given the finding
he made, what possible inference can be drawn other than Ciglen’s guilt as
charged? He is shown to have been engaged in the business of trading in the
Great Sweet Grass and Kroy shares, to have made a profit, to have conspired
with Torny wilfully to evade payment of taxes for which he personally became
liable by depicting the profits as those of Torny; the profits as profits of
Torny would be subject to different rates and tax considerations than would be
the case relative to taxation of Ciglen’s personal profits. He “suppressed” his
taxable income in conspiracy with Torny by falsely attributing that income to
Torny. The trial judge expressed his views in part thus:

Whether such an allocation can be equated
with an intention to evade tax payable through suppression or in the light of
its disclosure in the P.O.G.N. reports albeit as a Torny transaction, as an
attempt to attract no tax is open to serious doubt. In my view, suppression
denotes something more than an allocation and is a total failure

[Page 825]

to account. It is for this reason that the
explanation put forth in the P.O.G.N. reports by way of adjusting entries must
be shown as false.

He also declared:

However, I am of the view that, unless
there is a statutory onus, and there is none in the Income Tax Act, nothing
displaces the ordinary law in relation to a criminal case, which is that the
Crown must establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and
whether these transactions are capital gain or not, are matters that should be
determined by the Minister, and are not facts peculiarly within the knowledge
of the accused. Had the Minister made an assessment then the duty of
explanation would arise.

And finally:

It seems to this Court that it would be
incumbent upon the Crown to demonstrate that there would be an evasion of tax
liability by suppression. I am, however, unable to determine on all of the
evidence whether the moneys are subject to tax and for this reason, amongst
others, I can draw no conclusive inference.

Having dealt with the P.O.G.N. reports,
which in law are evidence both for and against the accused Ciglen, I am of the
opinion that these reports have raised a reasonable doubt in my mind as to the
guilt of the accused Ciglen for the offence of conspiracy as charged.

The finding of fact made by the trial judge as
to the Kroy-Fulton deal, which Aylesworth J.A. refers to in the portion of the
judgment I quoted above, was also quoted by Aylesworth J.A. in his reasons for
judgment and is as follows:

I think it necessary to indicate that if
certain shares were alleged by Ciglen to have been purchased by various
individuals from Torny, then one would expect the purchaser would be entitled
to the difference between the cost and the sale. However, the evidence does not
bear this out with respect to some of the purchasers who as mentioned were very
vague, and in some instances, the purchasers did not seem to know what it was
all about. In my view this is evidence of an agreement between S. Ciglen and
Torny to treat the Fulton deal
as being a Torny deal, which agreement was made after December,

[Page 826]

1956 and before November 5th, 1957, and
while it is cogent evidence of an attempt to allocate the proceeds of a deal to
diminish the incidents of tax liability as it is to evade tax, since it is set
forth in the P.O.G.N. reports I shall deal with it in relation to these reports
as evidence for and against the accused Ciglen. At this point, however, I would
find signé ce fait, je le traiterai à la lumière de ces rapas a fact that, at
the time of the delivery of the shares to the Bank of Nova Scotia, March 19,
1956, Ciglen exercised such control over the said shares that it is a
reasonable inference that he had a beneficial interest in the same. He used the
shares as if they were his own property. I would also find as a fact that the
re-written general ledger of Torny was a falsification of the facts as they
occurred at the time of the Fulton deal.

It will be seen therefore that the reasonable
doubt which the learned trial judge expressed as giving rise to his acquittal
of the accused Ciglen was based on three different questions. The first of
those questions dealt with the learned trial judge’s view as to the proper
definition of the word “suppressing” appearing in the indictment. It was the
view of Aylesworth J.A., with which I agree, that there could be no such
limitation on the allocation of income to another person, in the present case,
one of those associated, to avoid the payment of income tax by attributing
income which the taxpayer has received merely as receipts by a trustee or agent
for another person. When that attribution is false, it is a suppression of the
taxpayer’s income for the purpose of evading tax.

The second reason for expressing reasonable
doubt was that the Minister had not made any decision fixing the character of
the profits on these shares as being income and that unless such decision has
been made the accused could not be convicted of a conspiracy to evade the
payment of tax on income. As to that view, Aylesworth J.A. said, and again,
with respect, I agree with him:

Likewise, he erred in law in attributing to
the Minister the duty of determining whether the impugned transactions resulted
in taxable income or capital

[Page 827]

gain. This was for the trial Judge himself
and he does not seem to realize that he did determine it when he found as a
fact—

There does not seem to be much doubt on the
evidence that Ciglen and Black, through the assistance of various individuals
and companies, actively engaged in the promotion and sale and thus in the
trading of shares of Great Sweet Grass and Kroy.

The third question upon which the learned trial
judge based his finding of a reasonable doubt was the position of the auditors’
report filed by the accused with the Department in the year 1960, that is, many
months after the end of the conspiracy charged. Those reports were known
throughout the trial as P.O.G.N. reports. The trial judge had already found
that the Crown bad proved that Ciglen had conspired with the Torny Financial
Corporation Limited to show that Ciglen’s Kroy-Fulton profits were those of the
Torny Corporation and had done so even by falsification of the books of the
Torny Corporation. That falsification of books by reason of such a conspiracy
then provided the working material on which the auditors drew up the auditors’
reports, i.e., the P.O.G.N. reports. As Aylesworth J.A. notes, “under such
circumstances those reports merely echo the result of the conspiracy as found
and, in law, could not be relied upon to raise a reasonable doubt”. (The
underlining is my own.) Aylesworth J.A. concluded his consideration of the
guilt of the accused in reference to the Kroy-Fulton deal in these words:

When the serious errors in law to which
reference has been made are corrected, the facts as found by the trial Judge
in the Kroy-Fulton deal lead inevitably to one conclusion—the guilt of the
accused Ciglen as charged.

(The underlining is my own.)

All the members of the Court of Appeal concurred
in the reasons given by Aylesworth J.A., McLennan J.A. having expressed his
concurrence in conference although his unfortunate death oc-

[Page 828]

curred prior to the delivery of the reasons. It
is submitted on behalf of the appellant in this court that in making the
finding of guilt as to the accused Ciglen in reference to the Kroy‑Fulton
deal the Court of Appeal for Ontario went beyond the jurisdiction conferred upon it. The appellant cites
the two recent decisions in this court: Regina v. Sunbeam Corporation of
Canada Limited[12] and Lampard
v. The Queen[13].

The appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal
for Ontario is governed by the
provisions of s. 584 (1)  of the Criminal Code . Subsection (1)(a)
of that section provides:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the Court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

It will be seen, therefore, that the right of
appeal given to the Crown is limited to a question of “law alone”. I am of the
opinion that the three questions which the Court of Appeal was called upon to
consider as to the guilt of the accused in reference to the Kroy-Fulton deal
were all questions of law and that, therefore, when Aylesworth J.A. said, “when
the serious errors in law to which reference has been made are corrected, the
facts as found by the trial Judge in the Kroy-Fulton deal lead inevitably to
one conclusion—the guilt of the accused as charged” he was giving a conclusion
on questions of law. The first of those three questions was as to the meaning
of the word “suppressing” as it appeared in the indictment. Surely the meaning
in law to be given to a word which appears in an indictment or in a
section of the Code is purely a question of law and the Court of Appeal
had the jurisdiction to differ from the opinion of the learned trial judge as
to the meaning in law of the word “suppressing”. The second question considered
by the Court of Appeal for Ontario was the argument that it was impossible to convict the accused of
an attempt to evade the payment of income tax without demon-

[Page 829]

strating that income tax was due by having the
Minister declare that the payments received by the accused on the profits from
trading in these shares were income. The view that such a decision was a
decision necessary for the trial judge himself to make and was not a decision
to be made by the Minister is certainly a decision upon a question of pure law
and again the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to differ from the opinion
of the learned trial judge thereon.

In Belyea & Weinraub v. The King[14], this court considered an appeal by an
accused person from a conviction rendered in the appellate division of the
Supreme Court of Ontario after an acquittal at trial. The appellants and others
had been charged with conspiracy contrary to the provisions of the then s. 498,
subs. (1) (a), (b) and (e) of the Criminal Code , and
the trial judge had found that the conspiracy existed but he had refused to
convict these two appellants on the ground that no overt acts following the
making of the agreement had been proved against them. The Appellate Division
and this Court were both of the opinion that the Crown need not prove such
overt acts. Anglin C.J.C. said at p. 296:

But we cannot regard that provision as
excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of
mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends,
as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact, made by the
judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that
conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of
law,—especially where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself
in law by the learned trial judge.

I am of the opinion that the statement of the
Chief Justice in that case applies exactly to the question as to the necessity
of first obtaining a

[Page 830]

declaration from the Minister that the profits
accruing to the accused on the trading in these shares were, in law, income.

The third question considered by the Court of
Appeal was the professing to find a reasonable doubt based on the P.O.G.N.
reports. These reports, as pointed out by Aylesworth J.A., were simply the echo
of the conspiracy which the learned trial judge had found and, therefore, those
reports could not, in evidence, supply a reasonable doubt. Again, I am of the
opinion that this was a finding on pure law and was within the jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeal under s. 584(1) (a) of the Code.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the
Court of Appeal, in considering the three questions upon which the learned
trial judge had professed to have based his reasonable doubt, were considering
questions of law alone and that they had jurisdiction to come to their own
decision on those questions of law and to differ from the learned trial judge,
using, of course, alone his findings of fact.

One other problem arises which does not seem to
have been considered in the Court of Appeal. In The Queen v. Warner[15], this court considered an appeal by the
Crown. The accused had been found guilty of murder at trial, but the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed that conviction and
substituted therefor a conviction for manslaughter. In coming to this
conclusion, the Appellate Division had assigned two reasons for allowing an
appeal: firstly, that the verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on
the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence; and, secondly, that
there had been errors in law in the charge of the learned trial judge. This
court, by a majority judgment, refused to consider the appeal holding that the
Appellate Division had the power to make the first finding, which is
undoubtedly a finding of fact, by virtue of s. 592(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code  but that no such power existed in this Court and, therefore, were this
Court to have found that the errors in

[Page 831]

law in the charge of the learned trial judge,
which had been found by the Appellate Division, did not, in fact, exist, the
result would still have been the dismissal of the Crown’s appeal. It was, of
course, sufficient to justify the decision of the Appellate Division reducing
the conviction to one for manslaughter to have found the first ground of appeal
alone.

So, in the present case, it is submitted that
the learned trial judge had expressed a reasonable doubt not only on the three
propositions of law, with which I have dealt, but for other reasons and that
reasonable doubt was not within the consideration of the Court of Appeal, it
not being a question of law alone.

It is true that the learned trial judge said in
one portion of his judgment:

It seems to this Court that it would be
incumbent upon the Crown to demonstrate that there would be an evasion of tax
liability by suppression. I am, however, unable to determine on all of the
evidence whether the moneys are subject to tax and for this reason, amongst
others, I can draw no conclusive inference.

(The underlining is my own.)

It is also true that on the immediately
preceding page of his reasons for judgment the learned trial judge said:

That the burden of proof rests and remains
upon the Crown and never shifts is trite law yet if the Crown produces evidence
which, if unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to raise a prima facie case,
the Crown has discharged its burden and the accused may be convicted unless he
counteracts the effect of that evidence, and the presumption of innocence
cannot be displaced by evidence which merely tends or inclines in the direction
of guilt. The making out of a prima facie case against the accused does cast a
burden upon him to the extent that, if no further evidence is given, the jury
will be entitled to convict him but the extent of that burden is not to prove
his innocence but merely to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.

Therefore, in my view, the learned trial judge
has recognized the general presumption of evidence

[Page 832]

of innocence in favour of the accused but he
did, in fact, deal with it when he made the finding of fact that the evidence
showed that there was an agreement between the accused and Torny Financial
Corporation Limited to treat the Fulton deal as being a Torny deal although it
was a deal solely for the benefit of the accused and the profits therefrom were
the property of the accused. In short, the learned trial judge did find there
was a prima facie case adduced by the Crown which rebutted the general
presumption of innocence in favour of an accused. Since no evidence was given
on behalf of the defence, there was nothing to discharge the burden which, as
the learned trial judge pointed out, was, under such circumstances, put on the
defence. I, therefore, have concluded that one may not rely on such vague words
as “for these and other reasons” to determine that the learned trial judge
relied on any general presumption of innocence which favoured the accused. On
the other hand, I am of the opinion that he found that general presumption of
innocence had been rebutted apart from the three reasons in law for which he,
in error, assigned his reasonable doubt.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Trafficking in
narcotics—Certificate of analyst as to contents of
substance—Admissibility—Narcotic Control Act, 1960-61 (Can.), c. 85, s. 9.

At the trial of the appellants on a charge of
trafficking in a narcotic, the Crown tendered in evidence, under s. 9 of
the Narcotic Control Act, 1960-61 (Can.), c. 35, the certificate of an
analyst as to the contents of the substance in question. The certificate
identified the package containing the substance, indicated the time and place
and from whom the analyst had received it, and gave a description of the
contents of the package with its analysis. The magistrate held that part of the
certificate was inadmissible and dismissed the charge for lack of proof. The
Court of Appeal held that all the statements contained in the certificate were
admissible and ordered a new trial. An appeal to this Court was launched by the
appellants.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

le temps et l’endroit et de qui l’analyste l’avait reçu, et donnait une
description de ce que le paquet contenait ainsi que le résultat de son analyse.
Le magistrat a jugé qu’une partie du certificat n’était pas admissible et a

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Preliminary inquiry—Intent to
procure a miscarriage—Written statement to police given by
complainant—Magistrate refused production of statement—Whether ruling
correct—Whether ruling reviewable on certiorari—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51, ss. 237(1), 453(1)(a)—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307,
s. 10(1).

The appellant was charged under
s. 237(1)  of the Criminal Code  with using an instrument with intent
to procure a miscarriage. During the cross-examination, at the preliminary
hearing, of the woman mentioned in the charge, it appeared that she had given a
written statement to the police. The Crown refused the production of that
statement and the magistrate ruled that he could not order it to be produced.
Defence counsel then closed his cross-examination of the witness. The same
course was followed with another witness. The appellant did not make a
statement nor call evidence, and he was committed for trial. On a motion by way
of certiorari, it was ordered that the preliminary inquiry and the
committal for trial be quashed. By a majority judgment, the Appellate Division
restored the committal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this
Court.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: Production of the statements could
not be compelled at that stage of the proceedings and the refusal was not
reviewable on certiorari. Lack of jurisdiction is the only ground on
which a committal for trial can be reviewed. The refusal by the magistrate did
not go to the question of jurisdiction. The power given explicitly by
s. 10(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  to a judge “at any time during
the trial” to require the production of a statement in writing given by a
witness, is not given to a magistrate

[Page 410]

during the conduct of a preliminary hearing.
The preliminary inquiry is not a trial and should not be allowed to become a
trial.

Even if the magistrate was in error, there
was no jurisdictional defect. It would be no more than error in the exercise of
jurisdiction.

Per Hall J.:
On the record, it does not appear that counsel for the appellant was actually
deprived of his lawful right to cross-examine the two witnesses given by
s. 453(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . If production of a
statement made by a witness then under cross-examination at a preliminary
hearing is shown to be essential to the full exercise of the right to cross‑examine,
then a refusal to order production could result in a denial of natural justice,
and such a denial would be a failure in the observance of the law in the course
of exercising jurisdiction. But that was not the situation here.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: Failure to permit the right of cross-examination conferred
by s. 453(1)(a) of the Code is a failure to accord the accused an
important right granted him by the Criminal Code  and a denial of
jurisdiction by the magistrate. Certiorari should be granted to bring
the record before the Supreme Court and to quash the preliminary hearing. Certiorari
does lie to quash a magistrate’s committal for trial when he has exceeded
his jurisdiction or when he has refused to exercise his jurisdiction. When the
magistrate refused to require the production of the statements so the counsel
for the accused could use it in cross-examination, he not merely made an error
in the exercise of his jurisdiction but he declined jurisdiction.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division[1],
restoring the committal for trial which had been quashed on a motion by way of certiorari.
Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.

M.I. Shannon, Q.C., for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.—The issues in this appeal are, first,
whether, at a preliminary hearing, counsel for

[Page 411]

the defence may require production of a
statement given to the police by a witness for the prosecution, and second,
whether a ruling on this point adverse to the defence is reviewable on certiorari.
My opinion is that production of such a statement cannot be compelled at
this stage of the proceedings and that a refusal of production is not
reviewable on certiorari.

The accused was charged under s. 237(1)  of
the Criminal Code  with using an instrument with intent to procure a
miscarriage. During the cross-examination of the woman mentioned in the charge,
it appeared that she had given a written statement to the police. There was an
immediate request for its production. It was refused and the magistrate said
that he could not order it to be produced “at this time.” Defence counsel then
closed his cross-examination of this witness. The same course was followed with
another witness. After the Crown witnesses had given their evidence, the
accused did not make a statement nor call evidence. The magistrate then
committed him for trial. He did not in any way limit or restrict the cross‑examination.
Counsel made no attempt to cross-examine on the contents of the two statements
or the recollection of the witness of those contents. He simply said that he
had no further questions.

On a motion by way of certiorari, Milvain
J. ordered that the preliminary inquiry and committal for trial be quashed. The
Appellate Division[2], by a
majority, reversed this order and restored the committal. The appeal is here
with leave of this Court.

I intend to confine these reasons within the
very narrow issues raised by the case and to repeat what has been emphasized so
often that if it is sought to review a committal for trial, there is only one
ground for action by the reviewing Court and that is lack of jurisdiction. The
refusal by the magistrate, on this hearing, to order production of these
statements does not

[Page 412]

go to the question of jurisdiction. In the first
place, I think that his ruling was correct and, further, even if it was in
error that there would still be no problem of jurisdiction.

The reason for the quashing of the committal by
Mailvain J. was that the refusal to order production constituted a denial of
the right “of full cross-examination and consequently of natural justice.” The
right to cross-examine is given by s. 453(1)  of the Criminal Code  in
these terms:

453. (1) When the accused is before a
justice holding a preliminary inquiry, the justice shall

(a) take the evidence under oath, in
the presence of the accused, of the witnesses called on the part of the
prosecution and allow the accused or his counsel to cross‑examine them.

By s. 10(1) of the Canada Evidence Act , the
judge, “at any time during the trial”, may require the production of a
statement in writing given by a witness. The section reads:

10. (1) Upon any trial a witness may be
cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing, or reduced to
writing, relative to the subject-matter of the case, without such writing being
shown to him; but, if it is intended to contradict the witness by the writing,
his attention must, before such contradictory proof can be given, be called to
those parts of the writing that are to be used for the purpose of so
contradicting him; the judge, at any time during the trial, may require the
production of the writing for his inspection, and thereupon make such use of it
for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit.

This power is given explicitly to a judge “at
any time during the trial.” It is not given to a magistrate during the conduct
of a preliminary hearing. There is a real distinction here. The purpose of a
preliminary inquiry is clearly defined by the Criminal Code —to determine
whether there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial. It is not a
trial and should not be allowed to become a trial. We are not concerned here
with the power of a trial judge to compel production during the trial nor with
the extent to which the prosecution, in fairness to an accused person, ought to
make production after the preliminary hearing and before trial.

[Page 413]

This is a subject which received some comment in
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Reg. v Lantos[3], and Archbold, Criminal Pleading, Evidence
and Practice, 37th ed., para. 1393.

Even if the magistrate, on a preliminary
inquiry, had the power to order production and failed to exercise it on request
in a case where an appellate tribunal thinks that he ought to have exercised
it, I would still hold that there was no jurisdictional defect. It would be no
more than error in the exercise of jurisdiction.

I would dismiss the appeal.

HALL J.—The definitive statement relating to certiorari
was made by Lord Sumner in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Limited[4], where at p. 156 he said:

That the superior Court should be bound by
the record is inherent in the nature of the case. Its jurisdiction is to see
that the inferior Court has not exceeded its own, and for that very reason it
is bound not to interfere in what has been done within that jurisdiction, for
in so doing it would itself, in turn, transgress the limits within which its
own jurisdiction of supervision, not of review, is confined. That supervision
goes on two points: one is the area of the inferior jurisdiction and the
qualifications and conditions of its exercise; the other is the observance of
the law in the course of its exercise. (Emphasis added)

Applying this statement to the instant case
requires a consideration of whether on the record it appears that learned
counsel for the appellant was actually deprived of his lawful right to
cross-examine the two witnesses in question given by s. 453(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code . If that was what happened, I would agree with my
brother Spence that the committal for trial should be quashed. However, on the
record I am unable to come to such a conclusion. What the record shows is as
stated by my brother Judson that when the magistrate said he could not order
production of the statement which counsel had asked for, counsel closed his
cross‑examination

[Page 414]

of the first witness. The same procedure was
followed with the second witness. Counsel made no attempt to elicit from the
witnesses what the statements given by them contained or whether the evidence
then being given was at variance with what was contained in the statements. Had
counsel pursued the cross-examinations further he might well have made out a
case for the immediate production of the statements.

I am unable to accede to the view that an
accused or counsel for an accused at a preliminary hearing is under no
circumstances entitled to production of statements given by witnesses for the
prosecution who are then being cross-examined. It is my view that if production
of a statement made by a witness then under cross-examination at a preliminary
hearing is shown to be essential to the full exercise of the right to
cross-examine, then a refusal to order production could result in a denial of natural
justice, and such a denial would, within the language of Lord Sumner quoted
above, be a failure in the observance of the law in the course of exercising
jurisdiction, but that was not the situation here.

I agree with my brother Judson that
s. 10(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  has no application to the
situation under review here. It has nothing to do with the right to production
generally or as to the time when a witness’ statement in the hands of the
prosection should be made available to the defence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[5] pronounced on February 14, 1969. In that
judgment the Appellate Division, by a majority, granted an appeal from the
order of Mr. Justice Milvain (as he then was) pronounced on December 3,
1968. By the latter order, Milvain J. had quashed the committal for trial of
the appellant. I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of
my brother, Mr. Justice Judson, and I therefore shall not repeat
references to the facts except where some extension is required

[Page 415]

for the purpose of these reasons. With all
deference, I must, however, differ from his opinion that the appeal should be
dismissed.

It is not my intention to consider the effect of
s. 10(1) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, as that
section is, by its express words, confined to a trial, and what is here in
issue is the conduct of the preliminary hearing. Nor am I concerned with the
provisions of s. 512  of the Criminal Code  dealing with material
which the accused is entitled to inspect after he has been committed for trial.
In my opinion, the appellant’s case is based solely on the provisions of
s. 453(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which reads:

453. (1) When the accused is before a
justice holding a preliminary inquiry, the justice shall

(a) take the evidence under oath, in
the presence of the accused, of the witnesses called on the part of the
prosecution and allow the accused or his counsel to cross‑examine
them.

(The underlining is my own.)

Mahadeo v. R.[6] is concerned with
the conduct of the trial but the pronouncement made by Sir Sidney Rowlatt at
pp. 816 and 817 in reference to the right of cross-examination and the
production of documents for that purpose are relevant. There the learned Law
Lord said:

There is no question but that they ought to
have been produced, and their Lordships can find no impropriety in the letter
asking for their production. It is true that upon cross‑examination
without the statements Sukraj admitted that he had at first put forward a story
of suicide. But it is obvious that counsel defending the appellant was entitled
to the benefit of whatever points he could make out of a comparison of the two
documents in extenso with the oral evidence given and an examination of
the circumstances under which the statements of the witnesses changed their
purport.

Again, in Regina v. Churchman and Durham[7], Label J. at p. 93, said:

At a preliminary hearing an accused person
is always entitled to cross-examine for the purpose of

[Page 416]

demolishing the Crown’s case then and there
if he can, or, as more frequently happens, for the purpose of demolishing it
later at the trial, and where the defence is misidentification he is entitled
to the widest latitude in delving into the circumstances of the alleged
identification.

I should point out that the issue of
identification is an issue in the prosecution of this appellant.

I take it as firmly established and need cite no
further authority that the right of cross‑examination conferred by
s. 453(1) (a) is a right to full, detailed and careful cross‑examination,
and, as pointed out in the two cases which I have cited, a failure to permit
that cross-examination is a failure to accord the accused an important right
granted him by the provisions of the Criminal Code  and, as I wish to
extend hereafter, a denial of jurisdiction by the magistrate. That right could
not be exercised when the Crown refused to permit counsel for the accused to
peruse and use in his cross-examination of the complainant and the second
witness the statements in writing which they had previously signed.

The question, therefore, in my view is resolved
into whether or not certiorari should be granted to bring the record
before the Supreme Court and to quash the preliminary hearing. Preliminary
hearings, despite the authorities to which I shall refer hereafter, have been
quashed in Canada. Regina v. Churchman and Durham, supra, is only one
example. In Re Shumiatcher[8], the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal were called upon to consider an application for certiorari
to quash not only the committal for trial but the indictment of an accused
person. Culliton J.A., giving reasons for the Court, refused to quash an
indictment holding that the Court of Queen’s Bench, before whom the indictment
had been laid, was a Court of co‑ordinate jurisdiction and that,
therefore, certiorari did not lie to that court. But in his reasons he
made it quite plain that if the application had been taken immediately after
the committal for trial by the magistrate where the court would have been

[Page 417]

concerned with the committal only and not with
an indictment, the court would have considered such an application, and,
further, that the court upon such a consideration would have had a right to
consider the evidence given upon a preliminary hearing.

In the present case the application for certiorari
was made by virtue of Rule 865 of the Consolidated Rules of Court of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, which provides in subs. (1):

Upon receiving the notice so endorsed the
magistrate, justice or justices, coroner, officer or clerk, shall return
forthwith to the office mentioned therein the conviction, order, warrant, or
inquisition, together with the information and evidence, if any, and all
things touching the matter and the notice served upon him…

(The underlining is my own.)

Culliton J.A., in so deciding, quoted and
accepted the judgment of Williams C.J.Q.B., in R. v. Schellenberg[9], where the learned Chief Justice said at
p. 134:

I have examined all the cases that were
cited to me, together with a great many others, and I have come to the
conclusion that this is a case in which certiorari will lie and that I
have a right and indeed, a duty, to look at the evidence taken before the
committing Magistrate.

The view that certiorari should not be
granted to quash a committal for trial relies on the authority of the Queen
v. The Justices of the County of Roscommon[10],
and particularly on the judgments of Sir Peter O’Brien C.J., at p. 173:

The granting of the writ now sought for
would, in my opinion, be fraught with inconvenience and mischief. It would
cause great delay and embarrassment in the administration of the law…
considerations of hardship are far more than counterbalanced by consideration
of convenience. The decision of the magistrate is not in such cases final.

[Page 418]

And of O’Brien J. at p. 176:

It is perfectly alarming to think of the
consequence, if in the common tendency, out of a desire to meet a case of
flagrant wrong or injustice, to push the law into new and unknown applications,
such a fatal invasion of it were allowed. The precedent, as the learned
Attorney-General could not but foresee, would be applied to other and different
cases. Other people would come here. It is needless, in a law-abiding country,
to specify a class who would be frequent in their attention to the Queen’s
Bench. But in the case of a powerful or wealthy offender he would have a
thousand chances against justice. All that money and influence, and power and
false art could do under the urgency of the strongest of human motives—the
desperation of a struggle for reputation, liberty, or life—would be brought to
bear, to the last extremity, to avert, or postpone, or prejudice prosecutions,
until, in fact, the criminal law was choked in the fountain.

I am doubtful of the persuasive effect of a
judgment given in Ireland in the troubled times of 1894 to guide the
administration of the criminal law in Canada in 1968-69, but, in addition,
would point out that Ruttan J. in Re Popoff[11], regarded the statements therein only as
dicta and that view was quoted with approval by Culliton J.A., in Re
Shumiatcher, supra, at p. 117. Harvey C.J.A., in Rex v. Solloway
and Mills[12], spoke
of the importance to the accused of a complete preliminary inquiry:

It is true that a preliminary inquiry is
not a trial and the outcome not being necessarily final is not as serious as a
trial but it may be a final disposition if no case is made out and the defence
ought to be given a fair chance by cross-examination of Crown witnesses or
production of evidence to show, if it can, that what might otherwise appear to
be a prima facie case of guilt should have an innocent construction
placed upon it. As Mr. McGillivray has said, under our system of
jurisprudence guilt is never presumed but the Crown authorities after months of
investigation of the defendants’ records have found something, which to them,
furnishes evidence of guilt and which, without explanation,

[Page 419]

might justify the sending of the defendants
to a higher Court. If upon a trial later, they were found “not guilty” they
would have suffered, for which they would have no redress, not merely the great
expense involved in their defence, and perhaps other financial loss and the
injury to their reputation temporary, if not even permanent, but also the
mental anxiety of which there can be no monetary measure.

I agree that certiorari will not lie
merely to correct errors made by a magistrate in the performance of his duties,
nor to permit a review of the exercise of the magistrate’s discretion as to
whether or not the accused should be committed for trial. I am, however, of the
view that certiorari does lie to quash a magistrate’s committal for
trial when he has exceeded his jurisdiction or when he has refused to exercise
his jurisdiction. In the Queen v. Marsham[13], Lord Halsbury said, at p. 375:

The Divisional Court refused to grant a
rule for a mandamus upon the ground that, whether the magistrate was right or
wrong, all he did (upon the hypothesis of his being wrong) was improperly to
reject evidence, and that the proper remedy being by appeal, the Court could
not interfere by mandamus. No doubt a magistrate may improperly reject
evidence, and the Court may be unable to set him right, and the question is,
whether this case comes within that category. I think that it does not; the act
of the magistrate was not a mere rejection of evidence, but amounted to a
declining to enter upon an inquiry on which he was bound to enter; he has not
merely rejected evidence, but has declined jurisdiction, and, therefore, the
right of the applicants to call upon him to exercise his jurisdiction is
enforceable by mandamus.

In that case the magistrate had refused to hear
defence evidence that part of the sum which the Lewisham District Board of
Works claimed from the defendant as a proportionate part of the expenses for
paving a new street were not in fact such expenses. Lord Esher, M.R., said at
p. 378:

Now, the form in which he is said to have
declined jurisdiction is, that he refused to hear certain evidence which was
tendered before him, and it is suggested on behalf of the board that such
refusal,

[Page 420]

at the most, only amounted to a wrongful
refusal to receive evidence, and not to a declining of jurisdiction. The
distinction between the two is sometimes rather nice; but it is plain that a
judge may wrongly refuse to hear evidence upon either of two grounds: one, that
even if received the evidence would not prove the subject-matter which the
judge was bound to inquire into; the other, that whether the evidence would
prove the subject-matter or not, the subject-matter itself was one into which
he had no jurisdiction to inquire. In the former case the judge would be
wrongly refusing to receive evidence, but would not be refusing jurisdiction,
as he would in the latter. Here the magistrate does not say that the evidence
tendered would not prove the fact that the claim of the board included matters
outside the statute; he has refused to hear the evidence, even though it would
prove that fact; he has, therefore declined jurisdiction.

Those statements were accepted in this Court in Toronto
Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Company[14].
Applying them to the present case I am of the opinion that when the magistrate
refused to require the production of the statements made by the complainant and
her witness so the counsel for the accused, the present appellant, could use
them in cross-examination of such witnesses, he not merely made an error in the
exercise of his jurisdiction but he declined jurisdiction. The present Chief
Justice in this Court said in Smith v. The Queen[15]:

As to the suggestion that the writ of certiorari
should be refused in this case as a matter of discretion, in my opinion the
rule by which the Court should be guided is accurately stated in the following
passage in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 11, p. 140:

Although the order is not of course it will
though discretionary nevertheless be granted ex debito justitiae, to
quash proceedings which the Court has power to quash, where it is shown that
the Court below has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, if
the application is made by an aggrieved party and not merely by one of the
public and if the conduct of the party applying has not been such as to
disentitle him to relief;…

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal law—Dangerous driving—Passenger turned police
cruiser into path of oncoming car—Whether within ambit of s. 221(4)  of the
Criminal Code —Whether dangerous driving under s. 221(4)  an included
offence on the facts—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 192,
221(4), 569(4).

The appellant was charged with criminal negligence, contrary
to s. 192  of the Criminal Code . The jury found him guilty of
dangerous driving. The appellant, whose vehicle had been in an accident in
which no other vehicle was involved, was being driven home in a police cruiser.
He grabbed the steering wheel with both hands and turned it to the left,
causing the cruiser to veer sharply to the left where it immediately collided
head-on with an oncoming car, causing the death of one of its occupants. The
conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant was granted leave
to appeal to this Court on the grounds that there was no evidence upon which
the jury could find that he was driving

[Page 568]

and that the Court of Appeal erred in failing to hold that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury that dangerous driving under
s. 221(4)  was an included offence on the facts in the case.

Held (Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ.
dissenting: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and
Pigeon JJ.: For the few moments while the cruiser was being driven from its own
right hand lane directly into the lane which was reserved for the traffic
approaching from the opposite direction, it was being driven by someone in a
manner dangerous to the public. Any person who has created the danger by
consciously assuming physical control over the direction of the vehicle is within
the ambit of s. 221(4)  as being a person whose act caused the vehicle to
be driven dangerously. For those few moments, the appellant was “one who drives
a motor vehicle on a … highway … in a manner that is dangerous to the public …”
within the natural and ordinary meaning of those words as they occur in
s. 221(4) . There was no error on the part of the trial judge in charging
that dangerous driving under s. 221(4)  was an included offence on the
facts.

Per Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: It is not possible by the ordinary usage of the English
language, giving to the words “who drives a motor vehicle” in s. 221 (4) 
their meaning in the speech of plain men, to say that the appellant was driving
the cruiser.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
affirming the appellant’s conviction for dangerous driving. Appeal dismissed,
Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.

John O’Driscoll, Q.C., and R.V. Donohue, for the
appellant.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

[Page 569]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This
appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario delivered, without recorded
reasons, on October 23, 1969, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his
conviction at his trial before Grant J. and a jury at Sarnia on April 3, 1969.

The charge against the appellant was as follows:

At the Township of Moore, in the County of Lambton, on or
about the 19th day of January, 1969, ALFRED BÉLANGER did unlawfully cause the
death of Viola Momney, by Criminal Negligence, in that he did deliberately grab
the steering wheel of a police cruiser in which he was a passenger, from the control
of Constable J.W. Bateman, and did recklessly and wantonly turn the said
cruiser into the path of an oncoming car with which it collided, contrary to
Section 192  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

The verdict of the jury as announced by the foreman was:

The jury finds the prisoner not guilty of the charge of
criminal negligence but guilty of the lesser charge of dangerous driving.

The learned trial Judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment in the
Ontario Reformatory for six months definite and two months indeterminate and
made an order prohibiting the appellant from driving a motor vehicle on the
highway in Canada for a period of one year from his release from the
Reformatory.

The grounds on which leave to appeal to this Court was granted
are:

(1) That there was no evidence upon which the jury could
find that the appellant was driving.

(2) That the Court of Appeal erred in failing to hold that
the learned trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that ‘dangerous driving’
under Section 221(4)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada was an included
offence on the facts in the case.

[Page 570]

While there was a sharp conflict of evidence at the trial it is
clear, from their verdict considered in the light of the charge of the learned
trial Judge, that the jury must have accepted the evidence of the Crown
witness, Constable Bateman, and the appeal was argued by both counsel on the
basis that the relevant facts were as follows.

On the evening of January 19, 1969, at about 8.30 p.m., Constable
Bateman at a point on Highway No. 40 about 0.6 miles north of its
intersection with Lambton County Road No. 2, found that the appellant’s
vehicle had been in an accident in which no other vehicle was involved. The
appellant identified himself as the driver of the vehicle; he had with him a
passenger named Gary Anderson. At that time, no arrests were made. The
appellant’s vehicle, because of the damage it had suffered, could not be
operated and Bateman called a tow-truck and then offered to drive the appellant
and Anderson back to their homes in Corunna, Ont. This journey commenced at
about 9:15 p.m.; Bateman was sitting in the driver’s seat and was driving the
police cruiser, the appellant was seated to his right and to the appellant’s
right sat Anderson. Almost immediately Bateman told the appellant that he would
be charged with careless driving as the result of the accident; Anderson and
the appellant argued with Bateman regarding the proposed charge of careless
driving, but after a short time, this argument ceased.

As Bateman was proceeding north he had his left hand on the
steering-wheel and in his right hand he was holding the two-way police radio
and resting this hand on the steering-wheel as he awaited a chance to complete
a radio call to the dispatcher at Chatham. At this time neither the appellant
nor Anderson said anything; as the police crusier was entering an “S” curve to
the north of the Hydro Plant on Highway No. 40, at a speed of about forty miles
an hour, the appellant reached over quickly, grabbed the steering-wheel with both
hands and turned it to the left, causing the cruiser to veer sharply to the
left where it immediately collided head-on with a southbound vehicle; as a
result the death of Viola Momney was caused.

[Page 571]

The appellant’s defence was a flat denial of having touched the
steering-wheel; it is obvious that this was rejected by the jury.

It seems clear that, in the absence of excuse or explanation, the
conduct of the appellant would have warranted a verdict of guilty of criminal
negligence; the question of law which we have to decide is whether it fell
within the terms of s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code  which reads as
follows:

(4) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road,
highway or other public place in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having
regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of such
place and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be
expected to be on such place, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

The two grounds on which leave to appeal was granted really raise
a single question. That what the appellant did was dangerous is unquestionable;
but can it be said that he drove the police cruiser? I have reached the
conclusion that it cannot.

In the course of the argument reference was made to a large
number of reported decisions but none of these are directly in point. The
closest case on the facts is the decision of my brother Spence, then sitting in
the High Court of Justice for Ontario, in McKenzie v. The Western Assurance
Company[1], in
which it was held that the intoxicated owner of an automobile, which was being
driven for him by a competent driver, who suddenly grasped the steering-wheel
and thereby caused a collision was not driving the automobile. However, that
case is distinguishable from the case at bar in that it was held that the
owner’s action in grasping the wheel was unintentional.

The case at bar appears to me to depend on the true construction
of the words of s. 221(4) , and particularly the words “who drives a motor

[Page 572]

vehicle”. The well-settled rule of
construction has recently been re-stated by Lord Reid in Pinner v. Everett[2]:

In determining the meaning of any word or phrase in a
statute the first question to ask always is what is the natural or ordinary
meaning of that word or phrase in its context in the statute? It is only when
that meaning leads to some result which cannot reasonably be supposed to have
been the intention of the legislature, that it is proper to look for some other
possible meaning of the word or phrase. We have been warned again and again
that it is wrong and dangerous to proceed by substituting some other words for
the words of the statute.

Lord Reid went on, at p. 259, to state the task of the Court
as follows:

I must therefore consider in what circumstances a person
can, by the ordinary usage of the English language, properly be said to be
driving a car.

Suppose that after the collision another Police Officer had
arrived at the scene and questioned Bateman as to who was driving the cruiser
at the time of the crash, can it be doubted that he would have answered: “I
was; but this man, Bélanger, caused the collision by grasping the wheel”, or words
to the same effect? If the conduct with which the appellant is reproached is to
be described in plain English it is not driving the automobile but interfering
with the driving of Bateman.

I do not find it possible by the ordinary usage of the English language,
giving to the words “who drives a motor vehicle” their meaning in the speech of
plain men, to say that the appellant was driving the cruiser.

If the matter were doubtful, which I do not think, I would apply
the following passages from the reasons of McRuer J.A., as he then was, giving
the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rex v. Wright[3]:

In this, as in all criminal cases, the onus is on the Crown
to make out a case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt in law as well
as in fact.

7th ed. 1929, p. 244, relied upon by Lord Hewart C.J. in Rex v.
Chapman, (1931) 2 K.B. 606 at 609, is directly applicable to this case:

Where an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a
reasonable doubt of its meaning which the canons of interpretation fail to
solve, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the subject and against the
Legislature which has failed to explain itself.

* * *

I think it is of first importance in interpreting words used
in a statute passed for the purpose of regulating the conduct of individuals
and imposing penalties, to give to them the meaning that would ordinarily be
given by the ordinary individuals whose conduct it is sought to regulate.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
verdict of acquittal to be entered.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and
Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment of the Chief Justice in which he reviews the facts giving rise to this
appeal and I will endeavour not to repeat those facts except insofar as appears
necessary for the understanding of my own reasons.

As the Chief Justice has pointed out, the appellant was originally
charged under s. 192  of the Criminal Code  with criminal negligence
in that he “did recklessly and wantonly turn the said cruiser into the path of
an oncoming car with which it collided …”.

By its verdict the jury found that the appellant was “not guilty
of criminal negligence but guilty of the lesser offence of dangerous driving.”
This constituted a finding that the appellant was in breach of the provisions
of s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code , which gives rise to the question
that lies at the heart of this appeal, of whether it can be said that, at the
time and place in question, the appellant was “one who drives a motor vehicle
on a … highway … in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to
all the circumstances.”

[Page 574]

It seems to me important in construing s. 221(4)  to consider
the context in which the words are used and to have in mind the fact that the
section was enacted for the protection of lawful users of the highway
against motor vehicles which are being driven to the public danger. In this
regard there cannot, I think, be any doubt that for the few moments while the
police cruiser was being driven from its own right-hand lane of the highway
directly into the lane which was reserved for traffic approaching from the
opposite direction, it was being driven by someone “in a manner… dangerous to
the public,” and it cannot be said that there was at any time anything
“dangerous to the public” in the conduct of the police constable or in his
manner of driving.

If a motor vehicle is being driven carefully and lawfully on the
public highway and it is suddenly diverted so as to be driven in such a manner
as to be dangerous to the public, any person who has created the danger by
consciously assuming physical control over the direction of the vehicle is, in
my opinion, within the ambit of s. 221(4)  as being a person whose act
caused the vehicle to be driven dangerously.

The fact is that the police cruiser was driven from its own lane
directly into the lane reserved for approaching traffic because the appellant
had deliberately grabbed the steering wheel and taken control from the hands of
the constable. Under these circumstances, with the greatest respect for those
who hold a different view, I am of opinion that for the brief period during which
the appellant assumed control, he was solely responsible for the dangerous
driving of the cruiser and he was for those few moments “one who drives a motor
vehicle on a … highway … in a manner that is dangerous to the public…” within
the natural and ordinary meaning of those words as they occur in the context of
s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code .

I have given careful consideration to the reasons for judgment
rendered by Mr. Justice Spence at trial in McKenzie v. The Western
Assurance Co.[4], and
like the Chief Justice, I see a clear distinction between the unintentional act

[Page 575]

of McKenzie in grabbing the wheel when he slipped from the seat
and the deliberate action of the appellant in grabbing the wheel of the police
cruiser and taking control from the constable.

It appears to me to be clear that the charge of criminal
negligence under s. 192  was a charge “arising out of the operation of a
motor vehicle” and having regard to the provisions of s. 569(4)  of the Criminal
Code , there was, in my opinion, no error on the part of the learned trial
judge in charging the jury that “dangerous driving under s. 221(4)  was an
included offence on the facts of the case.” The relevant portions of
s. 569(4)  read as follows:

Where a count charges an offence under section 192  …
arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle … and the evidence does not
prove such offence but does prove an offence under subsection (4)  of
section 221 … the accused may be convicted of an offence under
subsection (4)  of section 221 …

For all these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

Subsequently to his conviction on a charge of

sentence of preventive detention was imposed. In an oral judgment, the Court of
Appeal found that there was ample evidence to justify the finding that the
appellant was an habitual criminal and agreed with the magistrate’s opinion
that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Reasonable
doubt—Criminal negligence causing death—Motor vehicle—Acquittal at trial
because of doubt as to identity of driver—Question of fact or question of
law—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 221(1), 584(1).

After consuming a large quantity of beer and
liquor, the appellant got in his car with three friends. He says that he was
then drunk, and that from that time he remembers nothing until he awoke in
hospital the next morning. The evidence establishes that the car proceeded on a
wild ride at a speed of 70 to 80 miles an hour and finally struck a metal power
pole. The right side of the car was almost demolished. The car swung around, clockwise,
through an arc of about 180 degrees. All the occupants were killed other than
the appellant who was found behind the steering wheel, which was badly bent.
His left leg was to the left of the steering column and pinned between the
dashboard and the floor so completely that he could only be released by the use
of an hydraulic jack. One of the occupants was found lying in the back seat and
the other two, in the right front portion of the car, one on top of the other.
The appellant was charged with criminal negligence causing death, under
s. 221(1)  of the Criminal Code . After a trial without a jury, the
trial judge acquitted the appellant on the ground that he was not satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was driving the car. The Court of
Appeal set aside the acquittal. On appeal to this Court, the appellant
contended that the decision of the trial judge was on a question of fact, and
did not involve a question of law, so that the Court of Appeal was not acting
within its jurisdiction as defined in s. 584(1)  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 102]

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The trial judge failed properly to apply the
rule in Hodge’s case, to the facts before him in that he acquitted the
appellant not because he found that there was a rational conclusion on the
facts inconsistent with his guilt, but because there was, in his opinion, a
conjectural conclusion which he considered might be inconsistent with his
guilt. This involved an error on a question of law alone. The trial judge, in
considering the facts to which he referred, failed to appreciate their proper
effect in law, in that he did not distinguish between a conjectural possibility,
arising from those facts, and a rational conclusion arising from the whole of
the evidence. No other conclusion could be reached on the evidence than that
the appellant was driving at the material time.

Per Ritchie
J.: The trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s case as restated in
this Court in The Queen v. Mitchell,  [1964] S.C.R. 471, in that instead
of seeking to determine whether the circumstantial evidence disclosed “any
other rational conclusion” inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt, he based
his decision on “a matter of conjecture”. In so doing he erred in law and his
decision was accordingly properly reviewable under s. 584  of the Criminal
Code .

Per Pigeon J.:
This case was correctly decided in the Court of Appeal. This is in accordance
with the ratio of the judgment in Belyea et al. v. R., [1932]
S.C.R. 279.

Per Cartwright
C.J., dissenting: The only ground stated in the notice of appeal was
that the trial judge misdirected himself in law in ordering an acquittal as
there was no evidence on the basis of which a reasonable doubt could arise as
to the appellant’s guilt. An appeal based on a ground so stated is foredoomed
to failure unless the decision in Lampard v. R., [1969] S.C.R. 373, is
disregarded. It appears too clear for argument that the decision of the trial
judge proceeded on a ground of fact and certainly not a ground of law alone in
the strict sense. The question whether from certain proved primary facts the
inference should be drawn that the appellant was driving the automobile which
caused the fatality was a pure question of fact.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
This appeal by the Crown did not involve a question of law alone as
required

[Page 103]

by s. 584(1) (a) of the Code. The
inference to be drawn from the proven facts was a pure question of fact.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: If there is evidence upon which a trial judge may find that
there could be another rational conclusion then whether or not that evidence
would have been sufficient to cause a Court of Appeal to reach a like conclusion
is irrelevant. The task of determining the rationality of another conclusion if
evidence exists is for the trial Court judge, and any weighing of that evidence
in a Court of Appeal is engaging in consideration of something other than a
question of “law alone”. In the present case, there was a considerable body of
evidence which the trial judge could have and should have considered in
determining whether there might have been any other rational conclusion than
that the accused drove the vehicle. That evidence shows that it was possible,
time after time, for there to have been a change in the identity of the
operator of the vehicle. Once there is evidence it is the trial judge’s duty
and his duty alone to determine whether another conclusion is a rational one.
The judgment of the Appellate Division could only have been reached by a
weighing of the evidence in order to determine whether other conclusions were
rational, and such a course is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate
Division as provided in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This
appeal is brought, pursuant to s. 597(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code , from a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta1 which allowed an appeal from the judgment of
acquittal of the present appellant on a charge of criminal negligence causing
death pronounced by Dechene J. after trial without a jury.

[Page 104]

The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of
my brothers Martland and Spence, which I have had the advantage of reading, and
do not require repetition.

At the conclusion of his oral judgment, the
learned trial Judge summarized the ground on which he acquitted the appellant
as follows:

What can happen to the occupants of a vehicle
which comes to such a sudden stop, is, I think, a matter for conjecture.
Mr. Stainton invites me to apply whatever little knowledge I have of the
laws of physics and the principle of inertia, to find that the accused could
not have been in the back seat immediately before. I must consider the fact
that there were two people in that back seat immediately before, the position
of the back of the seat on the driver’s side, particularly to the smashed condition
of the steering wheel and the fact that there is no evidence of injury to the
accused’s head, face or chest. The first doctor, Dr. McCurry after looking
at the three other men, only glanced at the accused for thirty seconds or so
and decided that he did not require medical treatment. Those facts do not
enable me to say that I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
was driving the car because there are certain things, while it is probable he
was driving, there are these factors which make it, although not likely, but
possible that someone else was at the wheel. The accused is, therefore,
entitled to the benefit of that doubt which I entertain.

Counsel instructed by the Attorney General
appealed to the Appellate Division pursuant to s. 584(1)  of the Criminal
Code  which reads as follows:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

The only ground stated in the notice of appeal
was as follows:

The learned trial Judge misdirected himself
in law in ordering an acquittal as there was no evidence

[Page 105]

on the basis of which a reasonable doubt
could arise as to the respondent’s guilt.

It appears to me that unless we are to disregard
what has recently been said by this Court in Lampard v. The Queen[2], an appeal based on a ground so stated was
foredoomed to failure. I refer particularly to the following passage in the
reasons concurred in by a majority of the Court at pages 380 and 381:

It has often been pointed out that where a
trial judge makes findings of primary facts and draws an inference therefrom an
appellate tribunal is in as good a position as was the trial judge to decide
what inference should be drawn, but in drawing the inference the Court is
making a finding of fact. In the case of an appeal at large the Court of Appeal
has, of course, power to substitute its view, as to what inference should be
drawn, for that of the trial judge, but where, as in the case at bar, the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is limited to questions of law in the
strict sense it has no such power.

When the onus of establishing a certain
fact lies upon a party it may be a question of law whether there is any
evidence (as distinguished from sufficient evidence) to prove that fact. In the
case at bar the onus was, of course, upon the Crown to prove that the appellant
did the acts complained of with the guilty intention specified in the section.
If the learned trial Judge erred in finding that that onus had not been
satisfied, his error was one of fact, certainly not one of law in the strict
sense. The applicable principles are clearly set out in the reasons of my
brother Ritchie giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in the Sunbeam
case, supra, and it is not necessary to repeat them.

In a criminal case (except in the rare
cases in which a statutory provision places an onus upon the accused) it can
sometimes be said as a matter of law that there is no evidence on which the
Court can convict but never that there is no evidence on which it can acquit;
there is always the rebuttable presumption of innocence.

[Page 106]

I find nothing in the reasons of my brother
Judson in the Lampard case, which were concurred in by my brother
Spence, to throw any doubt on the accuracy of the passage just quoted. Lampard
was a case where all the evidence of guilty intent was circumstantial; it
pointed very clearly to the existence of the intent alleged by the Crown and
there was no evidence in the record to suggest any other intent. My brother
Judson dealt with the matter as follows at page 382:

The appellant here submits that if there
was error in the judgment at trial, which he does not admit, it is error in
fact.

The basis of the judgment of the learned
trial judge, who was sitting without a jury, was that the trading activities of
the appellant did not indicate to him beyond a reasonable doubt that they were
carried out ‘with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active
public trading in a security’. On the other hand, a unanimous Court of Appeal
thought that the inference that there was such intent was irresistible.

I agree with this conclusion of the Court
of Appeal but we are still left with the question whether the error was one of
fact or law. I am compelled by the majority judgment of this Court delivered in
Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen to hold that the
error—and I am sure that it was error—was one of fact. The appeal therefore
succeeds.

In the case at bar the learned trial judge
instructed himself accurately as to the rule in Hodge’s case[3], which is after all only an example of the
application of the rule that an accused can be convicted of a criminal offence
only if the tribunal is satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and
then found that he was not so satisfied. I agree with my brother Spence that
there was in the case before us evidence to raise a doubt as to whether the
appellant was driving the car at the time of the fatality, notably the
condition of the steering wheel and the absence of injuries to the appellant’s
chest, but I regard that as irrelevant. With the greatest respect to those who
entertain a contrary view it appears to me to be too clear for argument that
the

[Page 107]

decision of the learned trial judge proceeded on
a ground of fact and certainly not a ground of law alone in the strict sense.

When an appeal from a conviction of an
indictable offence is taken to a provincial Court of Appeal that Court has
power, under s. 592 (1) (a) (i), to allow the appeal if it is of
opinion that “the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”; but that Court has no
corresponding power in an appeal from an acquittal. In such an appeal it is
limited to questions of law in the strict sense.

The question whether from certain proved primary
facts the inference should be drawn that the appellant was driving the
automobile which caused the fatality was, in my view, a pure question of fact.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Appellate Division and restore that of the learned trial judge
acquitting the appellant.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Judson JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the unanimous
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[4] which allowed an appeal by the Crown from
the decision of the learned trial judge to acquit the appellant on a charge of
criminal negligence, causing death.

The facts are not in dispute. On May 28, 1968,
the appellant, with three friends, proceeded in his car to the Corona Hotel, in
Edmonton, at about 7:45 p.m., and each consumed 16 glasses of beer. They
proceeded from there to a bar, known as the Beachcomber, where the appellant
consumed more beer, and the others drank liquor. They left the bar at about
11:30 p.m. The appellant says that he was then drunk.

They proceeded to the appellant’s car and got
in. The appellant says that from that time

[Page 108]

he remembers nothing until he awoke in hospital
at about 5 a.m. on May 29.

The evidence establishes that the car proceeded
on a wild ride around some portions of the City. During the course of this, the
driver of the appellant’s car became annoyed at the driver of another car,
threatened him, and later swerved into that car. Subsequent to this encounter,
the appellant’s car proceeded east on 112 Avenue, at a speed, estimated by one
witness, of 70 to 80 miles an hour. The car then, at least partially, mounted
the curb, proceeded a distance of 42 feet 4 inches with its right wheels over
the curb and its left-hand wheels on the highway, when the right front end
violently struck a solid metal power pole, bending it substantially. It left a
“side skid mark” on the highway, not a braking skid mark, of 44 feet. The right
side of the car was almost demolished. In the collision, the car swung around,
clockwise, through an arc of about 180 degrees.

All of the occupants of the car were killed, as
a result of the collision, other than the appellant. He was found behind the
steering wheel, which was badly bent. His face was covered with blood. His left
leg, which was to the left of the steering column, was pinned between the
dashboard and the floor to such a degree that he could not be freed until a
fireman had used an hydraulic jack unit to raise up the dashboard.

One of the other occupants of the car was found
lying in the back seat. The other two were found in the right front portion of
the car, hanging from the vehicle on to the pavement, one on top of the other.

The learned trial judge said that he had no
difficulty in finding that the driver of the appellant’s vehicle was guilty of
criminal negligence. He acquitted the appellant because he said he was not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was driving the car at
the time of the collision because, while it was probable that he was the
driver, certain factors made it “although not likely, but possible that someone
else was at the wheel.”

[Page 109]

It is desirable to cite that part of his
judgment which deals with this issue:

The difficulty I have is regarding the
identity of the driver, his identification. It is well established and we know
that it was his car that was involved; we know that he was driving it earlier
that evening, and we know that he was found behind the steering wheel on the
driver’s side with his left leg pinned under the dashboard. Usually that would
be sufficient. However, we have here a situation where a number of people have
seen this car immediately or in a few minutes before the accident and not one
of them can identify the driver. The driver himself does not remember what
happened from the time he got into the car after leaving the Beachcomber
Restaurant on the last fatal trip of that motor vehicle. It is probable that
the accused was the driver.

The circumstances and the findings which I
have just made, are circumstantial and I can only find that he was the driver if
those circumstances are not only consistent with his guilt but inconsistent
with any other reasonable explanation. Is there another reasonable explanation?
The evidence is not very complete.

With relation to the altercation between
Greenough and the accused on 107th Avenue when the driver of the motor vehicle
got out while the vehicle was stopped for a red light, spoke to Greenough and
then returned to his car, it is my view that at that point there was an
opportunity to change drivers. There had been one, of course, earlier on when
they left the Beachcomber Restaurant.

The impact which followed the crash, the
collision with the power pole, was such that as we look at the photographs, the
car was demolished. We also know that the car turned on itself in a clockwise
fashion so that it was facing southwest, practically in the same direction from
which it had come.

What can happen to the occupants of a
vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop, is, I think, a matter for
conjecture.

Mr. Stainton invites me to apply
whatever little knowledge I have of the laws of physics and the principle of
inertia, to find that the accused could not have been in the back seat
immediately before. I must consider the fact that there were two people in that
back seat immediately before, the position of the back of the seat on the
driver’s side, particularly to the smashed condition of the steering wheel and
the fact that there is no evidence of injury to

[Page 110]

the accused’s head, face or chest. The
first doctor, Dr. McCurry after looking at the three other men, only
glanced at the accused for thirty seconds or so and decided that he did not
require medical treatment. Those facts do not enable me to say that I am
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving the car
because there are certain things, while it is probable he was driving, there
are these factors which make it, although not likely, but possible that someone
else was at the wheel.

Dealing with this conclusion, and after
reviewing the evidence on which the learned trial judge had relied in forming
an opinion that it was possible that the appellant had not been driving, at the
time of the accident, the judgment of the Appellate Division reads as follows:

…In my view the evidence referred to
amounts to no more than conjecture or surmise that this was the course of
events. It seems clear to me that the trial judge’s doubt as to whether the
Respondent was the driver has “no evidence to support it” and “lacks factual
support” just as much as the contention in Regina v. Torrie, 50 C.R.
300, that the tire of Torrie’s car may have been cut by a sharp object thrown
against it by some other traffic was found to be without any evidence to
support it. See also The Queen v. Lemire (1965) S.C.R. 174, Martland J.,
concurred in by Fauteux, Abbott, and Ritchie JJ. at pp. 191, 192.

I agree with and consider that the
following statement of Evans J.A. for the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina
v. Torrie (supra) at page 303 is applicable to the case at bar. That
statement is as follows:

“With the greatest respect, I am of the
opinion that the learned trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s Case
(1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, as to circumstantial evidence in that he
based his finding of reasonable doubt on nonexistent evidence. In Regina v.
Mclver, (1965) 1 O.R. 306 at 309, (1965) 1 C.C.C. 210, McRuer C.J.H.C.
said:

‘The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it clear
that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is,

[Page 111]

the facts proved in evidence and the
conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be rational
conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion can be a
rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion would be
a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.’

This statement was approved on appeal to
this Court, (1965) 2 O.R. 475, 45 C.R. 401 (1965) 4 C.C.C. 182 and an
appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed (1966) S.C.R.
254, 48 C.R. 4, (1966) 2 C.C.C. 289.

I recognize that the onus of proof must
rest with the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, but I do not understand this proposition to mean that the Crown must
negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused.”

In my view the contention that the
Respondent may not have been driving at the time of the accident is, to borrow
the words of Evans J.A. in Regina v. Torrie (supra) “conjecture” and is
“fanciful”. In my opinion no other conclusion could be reached on the evidence
than that the Respondent was driving at the material time.

The issue before this Court is as to whether the
Appellate Division, in reaching this conclusion, was acting within its jurisdiction
as defined in s. 584(1)  of the Criminal Code , which permits an
appeal by the Attorney General against a judgment of acquittal “on any ground
of appeal that involves a question of law alone.” The contention of the
appellant is that the decision of the learned trial judge was on a question of
fact, and does not involve a question of law.

In the Lemire case[5], to which reference was made in the reasons
of the Appellate Division, quoted above, it was stated, in this Court, that on
an appeal from a conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the
ground that certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not
capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt, there is an error

[Page 112]

of law. In my opinion, that proposition applies
equally in a case in which a trial judge, in his reasons, finds that certain
specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused,
when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any
doubt as to his guilt.

In my opinion the ground of appeal to the
Appellate Division did involve a question of law alone. That question is as
follows:

Did the learned trial judge err in law in his application
of the rule in Hodge’s Case, (1838) 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, to the
facts of this case?

The learned trial judge summarized the effect of
the rule. Stated in full the rule in Hodge’s case[6] is as follows:

Alderson B., told the jury, that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, “not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.”

Unlike a jury trial, we have the advantage here
of knowing, from the judge’s own words, whether he properly applied the rule in
the circumstances of the present case. He clearly found that the circumstances
were such as to be consistent with the appellant’s having been the driver of
the car. He said that it was probable that the appellant was the driver. The
other issue which he was required to determine was whether the facts were
consistent with any rational conclusion other than that the appellant was the
driver.

The vital circumstance in this case, which is
barely mentioned by the learned trial judge, is that the person who was found
behind the wheel of the car after the accident was pinned in that position so
completely that he could only be released by the use of an hydraulic jack. The
pinning in that position must have occurred immediately

[Page 113]

upon the violent impact which occurred when the
car struck the power pole. The theory propounded on behalf of the appellant
involved the proposition that, following that violent impact, with the car
turning in a clockwise direction (which would result in the passengers’ being
subject to a force carrying them toward their right, as illustrated by the
position of two of the bodies after the accident), the appellant was hurled out
of the back seat into the driver’s position on the left-hand side of the front
seat, that he landed there in a sitting position, with his left leg to the left
of the steering column, and that then, and only then, he was pinned into
position.

In his reasons, the learned trial judge says
that:

What can happen to the occupants of a
vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop, is, I think, a matter for
conjecture.

On the facts of this case, however, the issue to
be determined was whether, in the light of the appellant’s having been pinned
behind the wheel, there was any rational conclusion, on the evidence, other
than that the appellant was the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
He did not find that there was such a rational conclusion. What he did was to
conjecture that the appellant might have been riding as a passenger in the back
seat and, if so, might have been thrown into the front seat on impact.

The learned trial judge referred to the fact
that, after the accident, it appeared that the back of the front seat was bent
backwards, that the steering wheel was substantially bent, and that there was
no evidence of injury to the appellant’s chest or face. These facts are
reviewed in the judgment of the Appellate Division, as follows:

It should be pointed out, however, that the
Respondent’s face had blood upon it to the extent that any visible injury would
not be seen, that the Respondent was unconscious behind the wheel with his head
bent forward on to his chest and hanging either on or near the steering wheel.
Shortly after the accident the Respondent was held up by a fireman and a
policeman in a position where it appeared he was suffering the least pain
because if there was any movement he would let out a very loud scream. There
was no other evidence as to the nature and extent of the Respondent’s injuries.

[Page 114]

It might further be pointed out that the finding
of lack of injury to the appellant’s face, head and chest was made only as a
result of visual observation of the appellant by the trial judge at the trial,
which did not take place until December 17, 1968.

In the result, it is my opinion that the learned
trial judge failed properly to apply the rule in Hodge’s case to the
facts before him in that he acquitted the appellant, not because he found that
there was a rational conclusion on the facts inconsistent with his guilt, but
because there was, in his opinion, a conjectural conclusion which he considered
might be inconsistent with his guilt.

In reaching the conclusion that, in this case,
the learned trial judge erred on a question of law, it is necessary to consider
whether this is inconsistent with the judgment of this Court in the case of Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen[7].
The issue in that case, on an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, was as to
whether there had been an error on a question of law alone so as to entitle the
Court of Appeal to interfere with the decision at trial.

That case involved two charges against a
manufacturer of electrical appliances of breaches of s. 34(2) (b) of
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, in attempting to
induce retail dealers to resell its products at prices not less than minimum
prices specified by it. The evidence was mainly documentary, and the Crown was
able to take the benefit of s. 41(2) of that Act, which provided that
documents, such as certain letters in question, should be admitted in evidence
and should constitute prima facie evidence that the accused had
knowledge of the documents and their contents and that anything recorded in
them as having been done, said, or agreed upon by the accused or its agent was
done, said or agreed upon.

[Page 115]

Notwithstanding the documentary evidence
adduced, and the impact of s. 41(2), the learned trial judge held, as to
one charge, that:

…The evidence as to inducement on this
count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case
of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.

As to the other charge, he said:

There is here neither sufficient evidence
of inducement on the part of the accused nor that the alleged offence took
place within the time charged. This charge must therefore be dismissed.

In the Court of Appeal, in dealing with the
letters, applying s. 41(2), the Court said that the statements made by the
company’s salesman “constitute direct proof by way of admissions of the
attempts charged” and went on to say:

That evidence is not only sufficient to get
the case past the judge to the jury, but there being no issue as to the weight
or credit to be given to it, it is sufficient to counterbalance the general
presumption of innocence and require affirmative action by the court in
convicting the accused where, as here, it is not countered or controlled by
evidence tending to contradict it or render it improbable, or to prove facts
inconsistent with it.

Dealing with this proposition, Ritchie J.,
delivering the judgment of the majority of this Court, said, at p. 229:

With the greatest respect I cannot agree
with Mr. Justice Schroeder that the provisions of s. 41(2) in any way
preclude a judge or jury from considering the weight to be attached to
the evidence contained in the letters in question in determining the issue of
whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Section 41(2)(c) simply provides
that documents, such as these letters, which were in the possession of the
accused “shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall
be prima facie evidence” that the accused had knowledge of the documents
and their contents and that anything recorded in them as having been done, said
or agreed upon by the accused or its agent, was done, said or agreed upon. This
does not mean that the trial judge, having accepted the letters as prima
facie evidence of their contents, is precluded from assess-

[Page 116]

ing the weight to be attached to that
evidence in considering the issue of the accused’s guilt or innocence.

The conclusion of the majority is expressed by
Ritchie J., at p. 231, as follows:

In the quotations which I have taken from
the judgment of the trial judge and of Mr. Justice Schroeder, I have
italicized the words “sufficient” and “sufficiently” wherever they occur, as it
appears to me that the fundamental difference between the trial judge and the
majority of the Court of Appeal was that the Court of Appeal was of opinion
that the evidence on the 3rd and 4th counts was sufficient to require a
verdict of guilty, whereas the trial judge did not consider it to be sufficient
to support such a verdict. It is well-settled that the sufficiency of
evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law…

In essence, therefore, the Sunbeam case was
one in which, applying s. 41(2), the Crown had made a prima facie case,
which had not been answered by the accused by way of defence. The trial judge
held that, notwithstanding this, it was still open to him to consider the
sufficiency of that evidence to warrant a conviction in a criminal case. The
Court of Appeal held that the evidence was sufficient to require a verdict of
guilty. This Court held that the matter of sufficiency of proof was a question
of fact for the trial judge and not a question of law.

In Lampard v. The Queen[8], in which the Sunbeam case was
followed, the finding of the trial judge was as to guilty intent, and it was
held that an inquiry as to whether certain acts were committed with a certain
intent involved a question of fact.

In the present case there is no issue as to the
sufficiency of the evidence to establish that an offence, as charged, had been
committed and there is no issue as to any question of intent. The only issue
was as to identity, and involved the proper application of the rule in Hodge’s
case. For the reasons given, it is my opinion

[Page 117]

that the learned trial judge failed properly to
apply the rule to the facts of this case. This involves error on a question of
law.

In Belyea and Weinraub v. The King[9], Chief Justice Anglin said, at p. 296:

The right of appeal by the
Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11,
s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to
“questions of law.” That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can
be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any
of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the
right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact,
such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here,
upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the
jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion,
since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially
where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the
learned trial judge.

In the present case the learned trial judge, in
considering the facts to which he referred, failed to appreciate their proper
effect, in law, in that he did not distinguish between a conjectural
possibility, arising from those facts, and a rational conclusion arising from
the whole of the evidence.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

RITCHIE J.—I have had the benefit of reading the
reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hall,
Mr. Justice Spence and Mr. Justice Martland and although I am in full
agreement with the reasons and conclusion of the latter, I find it necessary to
add a brief comment of my own.

This appeal raises the issue as to whether,
under the circumstances of the present case, the appeal to the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was limited to a “ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone” so as to give that Court jurisdiction
under s. 584  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 118]

The vital question which the learned trial judge
was required to determine was the identity of the driver at the moment when the
motor vehicle struck the power pole. The evidence in this regard is in my
opinion entirely circumstantial and is afforded by the positions of the
occupants of the vehicle immediately after the accident. The rule which the
learned trial judge was required to apply in assessing this evidence has been
recently restated in this Court by Spence J. in The Queen v. Mitchell[10], where he said of the statement made to
the jury by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case[11]:

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, ‘not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.’

It is quite clear that this direction was
concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person who
had committed the crime.

In the Mitchell case, Cartwright J. (as
he then was) speaking for himself alone, observed: “The key word in the rule in
Hodge’s case is ‘rational’.”

In the tragic circumstances of this case, the
circumstance of the accused’s body being pinned behind the steering wheel so
that it required the use of a hydraulic jack to release it, is not only
consistent with the accused having been the driver, but is so compelling as to
make that conclusion almost self-evident. The question however remains as to
whether any of the other evidence concerning the positions of the various occupants
of the car after the accident affords a “rational conclusion” which is
inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt. In considering this question the
learned trial judge himself said:

What can happen to the occupants of a
vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop is, I think, a matter of conjecture.

[Page 119]

In my opinion the learned trial judge misapplied
the rule as stated by my brother Spence in the Mitchell case, supra, in
that instead of seeking to determine whether the circumstantial evidence disclosed
“any other rational conclusion” inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt, he
based his decision on “a matter of conjecture”. In so doing, in my opinion, he
erred in law and his decision was accordingly properly reviewable under
s. 584  of the Criminal Code .

As I have indicated, I would dispose of this
matter as proposed by my brother Martland.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
Chief Justice and with my brother Spence that this appeal by the Crown does not
involve a question of law alone as required by s. 584(1)  (a) of the
Criminal Code . I question, if I had been the trial judge, that I would
have found that there was a basis for a reasonable doubt in the instant case,
but I was not the trial judge and I have no right to usurp his function as
such, and by reviewing the evidence come to the conclusion that he could not in
law have had a reasonable doubt. The inference to be drawn from the proven
facts was a pure question of fact.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the
Chief Justice.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[12] pronounced on May 14, 1969. By that
judgment, the Appellate Division allowed an appeal by the Crown from the
judgment of Déchène J. pronounced on December 18, 1968, after trial without a
jury. In the latter judgment, the learned trial judge acquitted the accused of
three charges of criminal negligence causing death and one charge of failing to
remain at the scene of an accident.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
of my brother Martland and I shall not repeat his statement of the facts except
where I find it neces-

[Page 120]

sary to extend the reference thereto. I must,
however, differ from my learned brother’s conclusion.

As pointed out in the reasons rendered for the
Appellate Division by the Chief Justice of Alberta, there is no issue as to
negligence and the sole issue upon this appeal is whether the appellant should
have been convicted as the driver of the automobile involved in the accident.
All of the evidence in reference to the question of identification was
circumstantial. Therefore, the consideration of that evidence must be governed
by the rule in Hodge’s case[13].

Cartwright J., as he then was, referring to the
application of that rule, said in Lizotte v. The King[14]:

However that may be, it is my opinion that
where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon
circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.

My brother Martland, in his reasons, has quoted
the direction given by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case, supra, and
I repeat it here:

Alderson B. told the jury, that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, “not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person”.

Although there is a certain degree of
intermixture of the doctrine of “reasonable doubt” and of the rule in Hodge’s
case, I am of the opinion that both the learned trial judge and the
Appellate Division did consider the latter rule. The learned trial judge, upon
consideration of the circumstances, came to the conclusion that he had no doubt
that under the circumstances of the case whoever had been the driver of the red
Rambler automobile involved in the accident had been guilty of criminal
negligence which caused death.

[Page 121]

As I have said, no further issue arises upon
that topic. The learned trial judge, however, came to the conclusion that
although the circumstantial evidence was consistent with the conclusion that
the accused had been that person who so drove that vehicle there was reasonable
doubt that there might have existed other rational conclusions. Therefore,
applying exactly the rule in Hodge’s case, the learned trial judge
refused to convict.

With respect, the Chief Justice of Alberta in
his reasons in the Appellate Division and my brother Martland in his reasons in
this Court have both proceeded to weigh the evidence in order to determine
whether such other rational conclusion was possible. I am of the opinion that
that is not within the function of either the Appellate Division or of this
Court upon appeal by the Crown from an acquittal of an accused person.

The jurisdiction of an Appellate Court under
such circumstances is set out in s. 584  of the Criminal Code  which
in subs. (1) (a) provides:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

(The underlining is my own.)

I need not repeat the decisions of this Court in
reference to the application of that section. It is sufficient to say that it
has been determined that it does not include a ground of appeal which is one of
mixed law and fact.

In his reasons, the Chief Justice of Alberta
cites The Queen v. Lemire[15] upon
the proposition that the Appellate Division could proceed to examine the
evidence and determine that it “amounts to no more than conjecture or surmise
that this was the course of events”. The majority judgment of this Court in The
Queen

[Page 122]

v. Lemire was
given by my brother Martland and at p. 192 of the report he stated:

With the exception of those counts on which
Lemire was acquitted, in my opinion, there was no evidence on the basis of
which, as to each and every expense account submitted by him, any doubt,
let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to Lemire’s having incorporated,
to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expense which were fictitious and
false.

(The underlining is my own.)

Therefore, that was a case where both this Court
and the Court of Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) in the Province of Quebec were of
the opinion that there was no evidence upon which to base the acquittal of the
accused.

Again, in Sunbeam v. The Queen[16], Ritchie J. in this Court gave judgment
for the majority allowing an appeal from a conviction by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario on the ground, as Martland J. points out in his reasons upon this
appeal, that the Court of Appeal was considering the sufficiency of the
evidence and that in so doing they were engaging in the consideration of a
question of fact and not a question of law as they alone were entitled to
consider under the provisions of s. 584(1) (a)of the Code.

Chief Justice Smith also quotes the decision of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Torrie[17]. There, a County Court Judge had acquitted
the driver of a vehicle who had been accused of criminal negligence contra s.
192  of the Criminal Code , as was the present appellant. In so
acquitting, the trial judge expressed himself as having a reasonable doubt that
the accident might have been caused by a sharp object being tossed from the
road against the left front tire of the accused’s vehicle causing the tire to
deflate and throwing the vehicle over to the left side of the road thereby
resulting in the fatal impact. The evidence had shown that there was a cut or
puncture in the sidewall of the tire close to the rim flange and that the
flange imme-

[Page 123]

diately in line with this puncture had been
damaged. There was no evidence of the presence of any sharp object on the
roadway in the vicinity. The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal by
the Crown. At p. 303, Evans J.A. said:

With the greatest respect, I am of the
opinion that the learned trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, as to circumstantial evidence in that he based his
finding of reasonable doubt on non-existent evidence.

There was no appeal to this Court and therefore
whether or not there was any evidence upon which the learned trial judge could
have based his finding can only be determined upon the acceptance of Evans
J.A.’s statement. I stress, however, that the appeal was allowed and the
accused was convicted on the basis that there was no evidence upon which
the learned trial judge could find that there was another rational conclusion
than the guilt of the accused, not by the weighing of the evidence to determine
whether the learned trial judge should have found such evidence could support
another rational conclusion. I am of the opinion that if there is evidence upon
which a learned trial judge may find that there could be another rational
conclusion then whether or not that evidence would have been sufficient to
cause a Court of Appeal to reach a like conclusion is irrelevant. The task of
determining the rationality of another conclusion if evidence exists is for the
trial court judge and any weighing of that evidence in a Court of Appeal is
engaging is considerations of something other than a question of “law alone”,
to repeat again the words of s. 584(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

Therefore, in the present case, the question
must be determined whether there was evidence which the learned trial judge
could have and should have considered in determining whether there might have
been any other rational conclusion than that the accused drove the vehicle. I
am of the opinion that there was a considerable body of evidence which the
learned trial judge could have and should have so considered. It is plain that
the appellant was the owner of the

[Page 124]

automobile in question. The appellant gave
evidence on his own behalf and he admitted that he was driving that automobile
at 7:45 p.m. on the evening in question when he met his three companions who
were killed in the accident and that he drove from that meeting place to a beer
parlour known as the Corona where the four sat consuming beer until 10:50 p.m.,
that the four then left the Corona and drove a few blocks to another place,
known as the Beachcomber, where liquor was served, and they there consumed a
small amount of hard liquor each and that they left there at or about 11:30
p.m. The appellant in answer swore that his last recollection was that he and
his companions were walking toward his automobile which was parked on Jasper
Avenue on the same side of the street as the Beachcomber Restaurant. As I have
said, that was at about 11:30 p.m.

A Mr. Greenough was driving his automobile
at 101st Street and 102nd Avenue when he made a manoeuvre in traffic which
seemed to annoy whoever was the driver of a following vehicle which was, no
doubt, the vehicle owned by the appellant, and thereafter that vehicle followed
him, driving in a most erratic fashion for some distance. At the corner of
107th Avenue and 96th Street, when stopped because of a traffic light,
Greenough noticed that the light in the interior of that automobile which stood
behind his had come on indicating that the door had been opened and that there
was no one sitting behind the steering wheel, although he did observe there
were three other persons sitting in the automobile. In a moment, a person
appeared immediately outside the door to Greenough’s left and that person
rapped on the glass with his hand and said, “You’re going to get it”, then
immediately returned to his vehicle. Thereafter, the two vehicules proceeded
and eventually got on 112th Avenue, the street on which the fatal accident
later occurred, and there at about 71st Street whoever was driving the red
Rambler appeared to intentionally cause it to swerve into Greenough’s
automobile, then accelerated away continuing easterly on 112th Avenue to 69th
Street where the red Rambler turned to the right. Mr. Greenough continued
on 112th Avenue to 65th Street where two

[Page 125]

other persons who had witnessed this occurrence
and who gave evidence both informed him of the licence number of the red
Rambler and he telephoned to the police. The constable on the desk informed
Mr. Greenough that the time was then 11:59 p.m., i.e., it was almost
exactly half an hour after the red Rambler had left Jasper Avenue in the
vicinity of the Beachcomber. In my opinion, it is significant that this event
occurred on 112th Avenue, which was the scene of the accident, and that the red
Rambler then turned off 112th Avenue to the south at 69th Street, which would
appear to be between six and seven blocks east of, i.e., beyond, the scene of
the fatal accident. I think it is also significant that in his examination‑in‑chief
at the trial Mr. Greenough was not even asked whether he could identify
the person who stood only a foot or so away from him and threatened him with
the words “You’re going to get it”. Mr. Greenough was not cross-examined.

We are left quite uninformed as to whether this
motorist who had an excellent opportunity to observe closely the driver of this
red Rambler on the same street on which the accident occurred only twenty
minutes before it occurred could identify the accused or even describe the
driver of the vehicle. There was, in addition, that approximately twenty-minute
interval during it would appear that the red Rambler car was some place south
of 112th Avenue when a change of drivers might have occurred. Had either the
appellant or his companions been in a condition to be able to think
intelligently, the quality of driving and temper of the driver, which were
indicated by the events prior to 11:59 p.m. and which I have just outlined,
might well have persuaded them that such a change of driver was required.

One of the witnesses to the slight impact
between the red Rambler and Mr. Greenough’s automobile was
Mr. Alexander Stewart who was unable to say how many persons were riding
in the Rambler automobile and therefore he could add nothing as to the identity
of the driver.

[Page 126]

Mr. Walter Yachimec was another person who
witnessed the impact with the Greenough car and who also confirmed that
thereafter the red Rambler had turned right from 112th Avenue and headed south.
Mr. Yachimec’s evidence was:

No, the only thing I know there was two
people in the back and one of them had glasses on, that’s all I know, they were
both passengers in the car.

He testified that he could not tell whether
there were two or three or how many people there were in the front seat.

The next event in time seemed to be the arrival
of the red Rambler with its passengers at a drive-in restaurant known as the
Burger-King on 112th Avenue. A Mr. Romaine, another patron in another
automobile, testified that at the time there were four people in the red
Rambler and he saw only two get out of the car, that the persons who got out of
the car seemed to be staggering and that the driver did not get out of the car.
It would appear that there had been some loud shouting between Romaine and
these two persons but that Mr. Romaine made no observation of the driver
whatever, stating:

Oh, I didn’t see him or anything, didn’t
have any, talk to him or anything at all, because I think he was getting the
order at the time.

Another patron of the Burger-King Drive-in
Restaurant who testified was one Gordon Botsford. The red Rambler had evidently
pulled in ahead of Mr. Romaine and alongside the automobile driven by
Mr. Botsford. The latter saw only one person getting out of the back of
the car and then re-entering the car on the passenger side of the rear seat,
i.e., the right hand side of the rear seat. He testified that there were four
persons in the car but he did not pay any attention to the driver, and that the
vehicle left the drive-in restaurant in what he described as “a rather jerky
fashion” at about 12:00 o’clock. In cross-examination, Mr. Botsford
testified that there were two persons in the front and two in the rear, and

[Page 127]

that very evidently the man who sat on the
passenger side in the front was drunk and was falling forward and then sitting
back in the vehicle. Mr. Botsford continued his testimony that the vehicle
left the restaurant, headed east on 112th Avenue and he next saw it “maybe four
or five minutes away” afterwards and that it had then been involved in the
accident.

To summarize, it would appear that there was not
the slightest evidence given by Mr. Romaine or by Mr. Botsford to
assist in the identification of the driver of the red Rambler as late as
midnight or perhaps a few minutes after.

Mr. Albert Yagos was driving east on 112th
Avenue at about the bend where the fatal accident occurred when the red Rambler
automobile passed him on his right side, i.e., between his car and the curb, at
a very high rate of speed, a speed which Mr. Yagos estimated, he admitted
very roughly, at 70 to 80 miles an hour, and that the red Rambler hit the curb,
fishtailed and then kept on going until it hit a power pole. At that moment,
Mr. Yagos must have been some little distance to the rear of the red Rambler
as he was not the first to arrive at the scene of the accident. A Detective
Boyd was also driving eastward on 112th Avenue and was evidently between the
red Rambler automobile and that driven by Mr. Yagos when the accident
occurred. Mr. Yagos could only describe the passengers of the automobile
when they passed him as being three in number—two in the front and one in the
rear, and gave no description whatsoever of those three occupants whom he had
seen.

Detective Boyd, who timed the accident very accurately
at 12:20 a.m., said he was at approximately 78th Street when he noticed a flash
of light ahead of him. That flash had indicated the point and time of the
impact. The place of the impact was definitely determined to be midway between
76th Street and 75th Street, so that it occurred about two and a half blocks
ahead of Detective Boyd. When he arrived at the scene of the accident which, of
course, was only a moment after it occurred, Detective Boyd observed one person
behind the wheel in an unconscious condition with

[Page 128]

his head forward on his chest “hanging on or
near the steering wheel”. A young man was unconscious in the back seat of the
car “his chest would be lying on the back seat with his legs on the floor in a
face down mariner”, and on the right hand side of the vehicle there were two
persons lying just outside the right front door. One of the persons was lying
under the other. The twisted debris of the automobile had pinned one of the
ankles of the person on top of the two. The photograph exhibits revealed that
the automobile was well-nigh totally demolished. Subsequent expert evidence
given showed that the impact had occurred on the right front corner, about a
foot and a half from that corner, and the whole right front of the automobile had
been pushed back toward the driver’s side. The right centre doorpost was
twisted so that the door was well inside the vehicle. The right front wheel had
been torn off and was found a very considerable distance away. Police evidence
showed that there had been a skid mark which was described as not like a brake
and which had run for forty-four feet until it met the south curb of 112th
Avenue, that is, the right-hand curb, for a person eastbound, and then a mark
continued on top of the curb from that point for a further forty-two feet four
inches to a heavy steel power pole which power pole had been bent three feet
further in an easterly direction. The impact, therefore, had been terrific, and
the marks showed that the vehicle, upon the impact, had slewed in a clockwise
fashion so that it faced, after it came to rest, southwest with its left front
wheel only a foot and a half north of the curb and its left rear wheel about
three feet north of the curb. The vehicle, therefore, would appear to have
slewed through almost 180 degrees. As I have said, the automobile was well-nigh
demolished. The windshield had been thrown some distance away from the impact
and the steering wheel was bent and broken so that it is almost unrecognizable
in the photographs, particularly in Exhibit 11. The left front seat was broken
so that the back thereof instead of standing at 90 degrees to the east was
driven back to almost a 45 degree angle. The appellant lay on this broken seat
in the fashion which Detective Boyd described. Firemen who were called as an
emergency crew and who arrived almost immediately

[Page 129]

found that his left leg, which was between the
steering column and the left front door frame, was pinned between the dashboard
and the floor boards of the car. Firemen had to use a power jack to separate
these two components of the automobile in order to free the appellant.

All four occupants of the car were removed to a
hospital by ambulance. Dr. McCurry testified that two of them, Morris
Stevenson and Allan Neil Finlayson, were dead on arrival, and the third, Arthur
Daniel Boulay, died forty minutes after admission. Dr. McCurry testified
that he saw the appellant for approximately thirty seconds, only long enough to
form the opinion that he did not need immediate treatment and that he could
wait for another doctor to arrive. According to other police evidence, the
appellant was in such a condition as prevented him from being interviewed that
early morning in the hospital.

The learned trial judge, in his reasons for
judgment, remarked: “There is no evidence of injury to the accused’s head, face
or chest”.

Those who first saw the accused sitting in the
seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, after the impact, testified that there
was blood over his face but that is all the evidence as to injuries which he
received. The appellant was, as I have said, taken to the hospital and there he
was examined by some of the personnel after Dr. McCurry had seen him. It
was within the Crown’s ability to call evidence to establish exactly the injuries
which the appellant suffered at this impact. I am of the opinion that the
learned trial judge was correct in referring to this lack of evidence as being
an important consideration in arriving at the opinion that there might have
been other rational conclusions than that the appellant was the driver. It is
very difficult to imagine how anyone could have been in the driver’s seat of a
vehicle at the moment of its terrific impact with the power pole and not have
received more serious

[Page 130]

injuries. The bent and broken steering wheel
alone could not have failed to crush his chest.

I have recited this evidence with this degree of
detail to show that it was possible, time after time, for there to have been a
change in the identity of the operator of the vehicle. One of the other three
persons might have taken over the driving of the red Rambler at the
Beachcomber; one of the other three persons might have taken over the driving
of the vehicle after the irrational driving thereof culminating in the impact
with Greenough’s automobile; one of the other three persons might have taken
over the driving of the automobile at the Burger‑King Drive-in
Restaurant. None of these suggestions are probabilities, all are possibilities.
All are possibilities which would have given a basis in evidence for the
learned trial judge to determine that other rational conclusions existed. I do
not say that had I been the trial judge I would have determined that there were
other rational conclusions but I do say that his finding that such other
rational conclusions existed was based on a consideration of the evidence and
once there is evidence it is his duty and his duty alone to determine whether
such other conclusion is a rational one. I am, therefore, of the opinion that
the judgment of the Appellate Division could only have been reached by a
weighing of the evidence in order to determine whether other conclusions were
rational and that such a course is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate
Court as provided in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal.

PIGEON J.—I agree with Martland J. that this
case was correctly decided in the Court of Appeal for the reasons stated in the
part of the judgment that he quotes.

I also agree that this is in accordance with the
ratio of the judgment in Belyea[18],
the first case in this Court in which the scope of the right of appeal by the
Crown from an acquittal was considered, after its introduction, and was found

[Page 131]

available against a conclusion of mixed law and
fact, when such conclusion is the result of misdirection in law.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Capital murder—Insanity—Planned
and deliberate—Evidence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 16, 202A,
597A.

The appellant was convicted by a jury of the
capital murder of his wife. He related to the police officers, who testified to
these facts, that on December 16, 1965, he killed his wife of three months by
firing at her with a rifle. The shot was fired about one hour after his arrival
from work and shortly after they both had supper. He stated that it was during
supper that he had decided to kill his wife. He contended that at the time he
committed the act, he was the victim of a mental disease which deprived him of
the ability to appreciate the nature of the act he was committing and which
caused him to act under an irresistible impulsion and without reflexion. He
alleged also that, at any rate, the act had been committed without prior
planning and without deliberation or premeditation. The verdict of the jury was
affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. The accused appealed to
this Court.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The Court of Appeal has rightly held that the
instructions given on the law by the presiding judge were according to the law
and that, in view of the evidence, the jury could validly dismiss as not proven
the contention that, at the time of the act, the appellant was insane, within
the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal Code . Upon the facts that the
accused himself voluntarily and freely disclosed, it was open to the jury to
find all the elements of capital murder. On the question that he was the victim
of a mental disease which deprived him of the ability to distinguish the nature
of his act and which caused him to act under an irresistible impulse and
without reflexion, it was the jury’s exclusive responsibility to

[Page 918]

assess each witness, each testimony heard,
and to judge on the whole. The defence’s contention was dismissed by the jury.
The Court should not attempt to substitute its opinion for that of the jury.

Per Hall and
Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The jury was entitled to find on the evidence
that the appellant was not insane within the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code  when he killed his wife. On the question as to whether the killing was
planned and deliberate within the meaning of s. 202A(2)(a) of the
Code, the evidence does not support a verdict of capital murder. The appellant
was not a normal person. The circumstances as given in evidence all negative
planning and deliberation and constitute an almost classic case of an impulsive
and senseless killing. Any other view of the evidence merely equates planning
and deliberation with intention. However, the evidence supports a charge of
non-capital murder and a verdict for that offence should be entered.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The evidence both as to the circumstances which occurred and
as to the mental condition of the accused given by the psychiatrists failed to
provide a basis on which the jury could find the additional ingredient of
deliberation had been present. There was no evidence that the jury could act
upon to find that the act of the accused in the homicide was a planned and deliberate
act and that therefore he was guilty of capital murder. The evidence including
the psychiatric evidence has not the degree of probative force that is required
to satisfy the burden upon the Crown to prove that the act of the accused was a
deliberate act. A verdict of non capital murder should be substituted.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court
of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a conviction of capital murder.
Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

Paul Martineau, Q.C., for the appellant.

Charles Letellier de St-Just, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.—Appellant was charged with committing
the offence of capital murder on the

[Page 919]

person of Rita Boivin, his wife, on December 16,
1965, in the city of Hull, Province of Quebec.

On that charge, it was contended by the accused,
firstly, that at the time he committed the act, [TRANSLATION] “he was the
victim of a mental disease which deprived him of the ability to appreciate the
nature of the act he was committing and which caused him to act under an
irresistible impulse and without reflection”. He alleged also that, at any
rate, the act had been committed without prior planning and without
deliberation or premeditation.

On January 28, 1967, a jury, presided over by
Mr. Justice Paul Ste-Marie, dismissed these contentions and found the
accused guilty of capital murder. On the same day, Boivin was sentenced to
death, as required by the law applicable at that time. However, as has happened
in other cases involving the death penalty, his sentence was commuted to life
imprisonment.

On the appeal prescribed by law, the verdict of
the jury was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench
(Appeal Side)[2],
composed of Hyde, Rinfret, Taschereau, Owen and Brossard JJ. Rinfret and
Brossard JJ., dissenting, would have substituted for the jury’s verdict,
affirmed by their colleagues, a verdict of non-capital murder. Hence the appeal
to this Court.

The evidence shows that, on December 16, 1965,
in the city of Hull, appellant killed his wife, Rita Boivin, by firing at her
with a rifle. Appellant admitted it, the same day, first to his landlord and
neighbour, Henri Pagé, and then to officers of the Hull city police. This fact,
which is not in question, occurred in the following circumstances according, in
particular, to the details given by the appellant to the police officers.

The Boivin couple, three months married, lived
in a small apartment in a house owned and occupied by Henri Pagé. On that day,
December 16, 1965, appellant went to work as usual at the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, where he was employed as a clerk. Towards the

[Page 920]

end of the afternoon, at 4:45 p.m., he returned
to his home. The shot was fired an hour and fifteen minutes after his arrival,
that is at 6:00 p.m., according to the evidence of Henri Pagé who heard the
shot and to whom Boivin applied for help a few minutes later. Meanwhile,
between 4:45 and 6:00 p.m., the Boivins, who were going out that evening to
play “sand bags” with a friend, had supper. After the meal, Rita Boivin cleared
the table, washed the dishes, and went to her room to get dressed for the
planned outing. During that time, Boivin took a handful of cartridges from a
box in a small bookcase placed in the kitchen, near the bedroom door, then went
to the living room, took down his rifle from the wall and loaded it. He then
sat on a chair in the living room, facing the door of the kitchen, and waited
for his wife to come out of the bedroom. As soon as she did, he shot her. The
bullet entered the victim’s back. Boivin stated subsequently that it was during
supper that he had decided to kill his wife.

The accused did not testify before the jury. The
facts related by him to the police officers, who testified to them, are not
disputed. On the basis of these facts, it was open to and rested with the jury
to decide whether in shooting his wife Boivin had deliberately committed an act
planned during supper. The jury obviously had the duty of considering, in
conjunction with the above facts, all the evidence adduced in support of the
allegation that, when he fired at Rita Boivin, the accused was the victim of a
mental disease which deprived him of the ability to appreciate the nature of
the act he was committing, and which caused him to act under an irresistible
impulse and without reflection.

On the matter, the jury heard, amongst others,
three experts on mental illness: Dr. Roger Pelletier, on behalf of the
defence, and Doctors Paul Larivière and Louis Charles D’Aoust, on behalf of the
Crown.

Dr. Pelletier saw Boivin for the first time
in October 1963, at the request of his father, Rodolphe-Charles Boivin, who was
worried

[Page 921]

about the depressive moods and behaviour of his
son and who gave evidence to that effect at the trial. From then on,
Dr. Pelletier followed appellant’s case, seeing him at various intervals.
In May 1964, he had him hospitalized a few weeks for psychiatric treatment. Thereafter,
he stopped seeing him for some time and saw him briefly for the last time with
his wife, Rita Boivin, some three weeks before the events of December 16, 1965.
He saw him again two days after that date. According to Dr. Pelletier’s
diagnosis, Boivin was suffering from schizophrenia, a mental state which, he
said, had reached psychotic proportions at the time of the killing of his wife,
and which prevented him from appreciating the nature of the act he committed
under an irresistible impulse. In short, and in the opinion of
Dr. Pelletier, Boivin was then insane and incapable of premeditation.

Seven months after the deed, Boivin was examined
by Dr. Larivière, at the psychiatric ward of Bordeaux Jail where he was
detained. According to Dr. Larivière, Boivin was calm and cooperative, a
man of superior intellect and presenting no mental disease in progress and no
psychosis. At that time, he was not insane. Dealing with the question at the
time of the act, Dr. Larivière relied on what he was told by the accused
concerning what happened on December 16, as well as on reports made by
Dr. Pelletier, Dr. D’Aoust and hospital staff; that enabled him, as
he stated, to make [TRANSLATION] “an approximate and retrospective diagnosis”
as of December 16, 1965. In his opinion, at the time of the act, Boivin
[TRANSLATION] “distinguished right from wrong, and he knew that killing was
wrong, that one must not kill”. The doctor rejected the diagnosis of
schizophrenia. According to him, Boivin presented schizoid personality patterns.
He was depressive and, at one point, his emotional balance was upset. It is
then, he stated, that the impulsive act of December 16 took place. On the other
hand, it was stated by the witness that where a person decides to do something
a half hour before doing it, premeditation exists. In his opinion, Boivin’s
action [TRANSLATION] “could be more or less deliberate” because he was in a

[Page 922]

state of emotional unbalance and had been tense
for several weeks or several months, and that this condition seemed to increase
with time. In short, Dr. Larivière expressed the opinion that, at the time
he shot his wife, Boivin was not insane; as to the question of his being
capable of planning and committing deliberately the act of which he is accused,
the testimony of the doctor, considered as a whole, is perplexing and, in my
view, scarcely allows one to ascertain his exact opinion.

Dr. D’Aoust was a Montreal Juvenile Court
consultant in psychiatry, from 1957 to 1959. From 1959 to 1962, he was assigned
to the psychiatric ward of Bordeaux Jail. Since 1962, his work with the Justice
Department of the Province of Quebec consists in making expert psychiatric
assessments, at the jail’s observation centre, for the Courts. He makes about
60 to 80 such expert assessments per month, usually at the request of the
Department of the Attorney General. It is possible that, because of the
evidence of these various professional activities, the jury, although not
failing to recognize Dr. Pelletier’s qualifications, may have found that
Dr. D’Aoust had more experience in cases involving offences or criminal
acts. It is perhaps fitting to observe here that in his evidence Doctor
Pelletier stated:

[TRANSLATION] … I am not pretending to be
an authority in forensic psychiatry. Probably Doctor D’Aoust would be better
qualified than I in forensic psychiatry.

Dr. D’Aoust had Boivin under his
responsibility for over a year at the observation centre of the jail where the
latter was held pending trial. During this period, he interviewed Boivin many
times, had him under observation and kept himself informed of the daily reports
made by officers of his department. Moreover, he considered the file prepared
by Dr. Pelletier on the case, as well as all the evidence given in court.
The first examination made by Dr. D’Aoust took place six days after the
December 16, 1965 events, and the last about twenty days before the trial which
began at the end of January, 1967.

[Page 923]

Dr. D’Aoust disclaimed the diagnosis of
schizophrenia which, in his opinion, is a serious psychosis. Had the accused
suffered from schizophrenia on December 16, 1965, he would still show signs of
it, and the doctor did not detect any, no more than he detected persecution
delirium in Boivin. According to him, Boivin shows schizoid personality
patterns which, he states, is not insanity, but a kind of personality
presenting neurotic but not psychotic symptoms and not adding up to insanity
symptoms. In short, in the doctor’s opinion, Boivin is not an insane person and
was not one when he shot his wife. He added that, although some psychiatrists
think otherwise, he is one of those who believe that, in the case of a person
who is not insane, the irresistible impulse does not exist and that there is
always free will, that is to say, the choice of doing or not doing a thing. He
adds that, obviously there are things which are done mechanically, but always
under control of the will and intelligence.

Taking into account the facts and opinions they
had to consider to comply with the directions on law given to them by the
presiding Judge, could the jury validly reach the conclusion they arrived at,
namely, that the contention of the defence should be dismissed and that the
indictment was well founded.

It should be rioted first that all the Court of
Appeal judges were unanimous in holding (i) that the instructions given on the
law by the presiding judge were according to the law and (ii) that, in view of
the evidence, the jury could validly dismiss as not proven the contention that,
at the time of the act appellant was insane, within the meaning of s. 16 
of the Criminal Code . With these views I respectfully agree.

The true issue in this appeal is precisely the
question of fact on which the judges were divided in the Court of Appeal.
Although the dissenting judges agreed with their colleagues that the presiding
judge gave the jury “clear and precise” instructions on the difference between
non‑capital murder and capital murder, they were nevertheless of the
opinion that, in appreciating the facts, the jury should have concluded that
appellant suffered from characterized neurosis, which

[Page 924]

prevented him [TRANSLATION] “from committing his
crime deliberately”, as Rinfret J. expressed it, or, as Brossard J. expressed
it, from relating the commission of his crime [TRANSLATION] “to a plan and a
resolution wittingly formed, removing therefrom any element of impulsiveness
and spontaneity”. For these reasons, the dissenting judges would have
substituted a verdict of non-capital murder to that of capital murder, which
implies that, in their opinion, as in that of their colleagues of the majority,
the jury could validly set aside, as without basis, the defense of insanity at
the time of the act. The point on which the dissenting opinion is based is
precisely one of the points particularly considered by the jury. In fact, after
deliberating for nearly two hours, they returned to ask the presiding judge for
a direction as to their duty, should they be of the opinion that, without being
insane, the accused suffered from neurosis at the time of the crime. The
presiding judge then told them clearly that, if the accused suffered from
neurosis, they should ask themselves and decide whether he had committed the
act with which he was charged willingly and deliberately and that, if they had
a reasonable doubt on that point, they had to give the benefit of the doubt to
the accused. Then the judge asked them if this explanation answered their
question and the jury replied affirmatively. A few moments later, they returned
to the courtroom to deliver their verdict.

Upon the facts that the accused himself
voluntarily and freely disclosed to police officers, who testified thereto
before the jury, it was open to the latter to find all the elements of capital
murder. Appellant contended that at the time when he fired the shot at Rita
Boivin, [TRANSLATION] “he was the victim of a mental disease which deprived him
of the ability to distinguish the nature of his act and which caused him to act
under an irresistible impulse and without reflection”. Of course, the accused
was not bound to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the merits of
this contention, and the onus of satisfying the jury beyond all reasonable
doubt that the charge against appellant was well-founded rested on the Crown at
all times. But it was the jury’s exclusive responsibility to assess

[Page 925]

each witness, each testimony heard on the
matter, and to judge on the whole. The defence’s contention was dismissed by
the jury.

The guiding principle in this matter is not
altered by the fact that questions of mixed law and fact and questions of fact,
as well as questions of law, are within the jurisdiction of this Court in cases
such as the one now before us. The principle is similar to that which governs
on questions of fact in a court of appeal and which is explained and expressed,
inter alia in Rex v. Dobchuk[3]. In that case, Mr. Justice
Richards, delivering the judgment of the Court, stated, at page 320:

We have come to the unanimous view that
there is evidence upon which the jury could make the finding of guilty; that
the verdict cannot be considered unreasonable; and that it can be supported
upon the evidence. It is not then the duty or right of a Court of Appeal to
reverse the verdict, even if the members of a Court think there is doubt as to
the guilt of the accused. The Court should not attempt to substitute its
opinion for that of the jury and we cannot do so in this case.

The accused has had a fair trial. The
duties of the jury were explained at length by the presiding Judge and there
was no misdirection.

After anxious consideration, I have reached the
conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Hall and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J.—I have had the opportunity of reading
the reasons of my brother Fauteux and I agree with him and with the judges of
appeal that the jury was entitled to find on the evidence that the appellant
was not insane within the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal Code  when
he killed his wife. The question of importance in this appeal is whether the
killing was planned and deliberate within the meaning of s. 202A(2) (a)
as that section read at the time the crime was committed (December 16,
1965) so as to make the crime capital murder if planned and deliber-

[Page 926]

ate, or non-capital murder, and on this
question, with respect, I cannot agree that the evidence supports a verdict of
capital murder.

While the appellant was found not insane within
s. 16 , he was, on any view of the evidence, not a normal person. He had suffered
mental illness and been in hospital for psychiatric treatment. That fact is and
was admitted. The circumstances as given in evidence all negative planning and
deliberation and constitute an almost classic case of an impulsive and
senseless killing. In my opinion, any other view of the evidence merely equates
planning and deliberation with ‘intention’. Certainly the appellant had to have
an intention to kill within the meaning of s. 201  of the Criminal Code  otherwise
he could not be guilty of murder at all. This was made clear in More v. The
Queen[4], where
Cartwright J. (as he then was) said at pp. 533-4:

In the circumstances of this case, the
defence of insanity having been expressly disclaimed, there were really only
two questions for the jury. The first was whether the appellant meant to cause
the death of his wife; if this was answered in the affirmative he was guilty of
murder. The second, which arises under s. 202A(2)  (a) of the
Criminal Code , was whether this murder was planned and deliberate on his
part; if this was answered in the affirmative he was guilty of capital murder.

The evidence that the murder was planned
was very strong, but, as was properly pointed out to the jury by the learned
trial judge, they could not find the accused guilty of capital murder unless
they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the murder was
planned but also that it was deliberate. The learned trial judge also rightly
instructed the jury that the word “deliberate”, as used in s. 202A(2) (a),
means “considered not impulsive”.

Other meanings of the adjective given in
the Oxford Dictionary are “not hasty in decision”, “slow in deciding” and
“intentional”. The word as used in the subsection cannot have simply the
meaning “intentional” because it is only if the accused’s act was intentional
that he can be guilty of murder and

[Page 927]

the subsection is creating an
additional ingredient to be proved as a condition of an accused being convicted
of capital murder.

I am of opinion that the verdict of capital murder
should be set aside on the ground that it cannot be supported by the evidence
and the appellant should, accordingly, be acquitted on the charge of capital
murder. The evidence does support a charge of non-capital murder, and I am in
agreement with Rinfret and Brossard JJ. that a verdict of non-capital murder
should be entered.

As my brother Fauteux points out, the appellant
was sentenced to death by the learned trial judge, but the sentence was
commuted to life imprisonment so that, regardless of the outcome of this
appeal, the appellant remains sentenced to imprisonment for life and to that
extent his position is not affected by the result of this appeal except in
regard to an eventual parole, the consideration of which is outside the
jurisdiction of this Court in any event.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Fauteux (now Chief Justice of
Canada) and also of my brother Hall, and I have come to the conclusion that I
would dispose of the appeal in the same fashion as would my brother Hall.

This is an appeal from a conviction of the
appellant by Mr. Justice Paul Ste-Marie on a charge of capital murder
affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) for
the Province of Quebec[5]. The
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada upon this appeal is that outlined
in s. 597A  of the Criminal Code  enacted by Statutes of Canada, 1960‑61,
c. 44, s. 11 , and is as follows:

597A. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Act, a person

(a) who has been sentenced to
death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal, or

[Page 928]

(b) who is acquitted of an
offence punishable by death and whose acquittal is set aside by the court of
appeal,

may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

“Capital murder”, in so far as we are concerned
with it under the circumstances present in this appeal and which have been
outlined in considerable detail in the judgment of the present Chief Justice,
is defined in s. 202A(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code  as enacted in Statutes of Canada, 1960-61, c. 44,
s. 1 , which section reads:

202A. (2) Murder is capital murder, in
respect of any person, where

(a) it is planned and
deliberate on the part of such person,

As pointed out in the reasons of both the
present Chief Justice of this Court and my brother Hall, the whole issue upon
this appeal is whether the murder was a planned and deliberate one. The
evidence bearing upon that issue falls into two classifications: firstly, the
evidence as to the actual circumstances which occurred and, secondly, the
expert evidence given by the psychiatrists in reference to the mental condition
of the accused man. In so far as the evidence as to the circumstances which
occurred are concerned, I adopt the description given by my brother Hall, i.e.,
that such evidence negatives planning and deliberation and describes an almost
classic case of an impulsive and senseless killing.

I turn next to the evidence given by three
psychiatrists as to the mental condition of the accused man. In considering
that evidence, it must be remembered that the defence advanced by counsel on
behalf of the accused person was that at the moment when he fired the shot
which killed his wife the accused was the victim of a mental disease which
deprived him of the ability to distinguish the nature of the act that he
committed and which caused him to act under an irresistable influence without
reflection. It will be seen that, at any rate, the first part of that defence
is one which is aimed exactly at the defence of insanity as dealt with in
s. 16  of the Criminal Code . I am of the opinion that the evidence
of the three psychiatrists, Dr. Pelletier,

[Page 929]

who gave evidence on behalf of the accused, and
Drs. Larivière and D’Aoust, who gave evidence for the Crown, was all concerned
with whether or not the accused had established that defence of insanity under
the provisions of s. 16  of the Criminal Code . The onus of
establishing such defence was upon the accused under the provisions of
s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code . Dr. Pelletier and
Dr. D’Aoust were particularly concerned with the issue of whether the
mental disease had deprived the accused of his ability to distinguish the
nature of his act.

The verdict of the jury finding the accused
guilty of capital murder, of course, implies that the accused was guilty of
murder in the ordinary sense, for without first finding upon that issue the
jury could not continue to determine whether or not the accused were guilty of
capital murder. The evidence, both as to the circumstances and that given by
Dr. D’Aoust, would permit the jury, if they accepted Dr. D’Aoust’s
evidence, to come to that conclusion and neither in the Court of Queen’s Bench
(Appeal Side) nor in this Court was there any issue as to whether the accused
should have been convicted of murder in the ordinary sense. The issue, as I
have said, was whether the jury should have convicted the accused of capital
murder and that involved the finding that the homicide had, in addition to
being intentional, been a planned and deliberate act.

As pointed out by my brother Hall in More v.
The Queen[6], Cartwright
J. (as he then was), at pp. 533-4, defined the additional ingredient which must
be present, in order to find that the act was a deliberate one, was to
determine whether the action was considered and not merely impulsive and that
any definition of “deliberate” as being “intentional” could not be accepted for
such an interpretation would fail to give any meaning to the additional
ingredient required for the offence of capital murder. In arriving at this
conclusion, Cartwright J. (as he then was) quoted only the definition in the
Oxford Dictionary. It would appear that the distinction

[Page 930]

which he sought to make and which I am also
seeking to make is brought out in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary,
1961, where “deliberate” is defined:

(1) characterized by or resulting from
unhurried, careful, thorough, and cool calculation and consideration of effects
and consequences: not hasty, rash or thoughtless.

(2) characterized by presumed or real
awareness of the implications or consequences of one’s actions or sayings by
fully conscious and often willful intent.

(3) slow, unhurried, and steady as though
allowing time for decision on each individual action involved.

and where the learned author proceeds to point
out that “pre-meditated” emphasizes previous planning and intent but does not
necessarily indicate consideration of consequences attributing this distinction
to Mr. Justice Benjamin Cardozo.

The evidence both as to the circumstances which
occurred and as to the mental condition of the accused given by Drs. Pelletier
and D’Aoust failed to provide a basis on which the jury could find the
additional ingredient of deliberation had been present. Dr. Larivière did
deal with such an issue in his evidence. I have read the evidence and I agree
with the conclusion of the present Chief Justice of this court that
Dr. Larivière’s evidence is so indecisive that it does not assist in the
determination of whether or not the ingredient of deliberation was present at
the time the accused acted. Perhaps that conclusion may best be illustrated by
quoting a question put to the doctor by the Court and his reply:

[TRANSLATION]

BY THE COURT:

Q. If the act was committed several hours
after he thought of it, this would no longer be an act committed all of a
sudden?

A. No; this shows cold and deliberate
premeditation on his part, and the existence of a reasonable and conscious
motive;—which is not to be found here.

[Page 931]

I am therefore of the opinion that even if this
Court were confined to consideration of a question of law alone there was no
evidence that the jury could act upon to find that the act of the accused in
the homicide was a planned and deliberate act and that therefore he was guilty
of capital murder. We are, therefore, justified in coming to a conclusion such
as Duff C.J. stated in The King v. Comba[7]:

We have no doubt that the facts adduced have not
the degree of probative force that is required in order to satisfy the test
formulated by this rule; … In this case, the statement would be that we have no
doubt that the evidence including the psychiatric evidence has not the degree
of probative force that is required to satisfy the burden upon the Crown to
prove that the act of the accused was a deliberate act.

For these reasons, I would adopt the view of my
brother Hall that the appeal from the conviction for capital murder should be
allowed and a verdict of non-capital murder should be substituted therefor.

Appeal dismissed, HALL, SPENCE and
PIGEON JJ. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Sentence—Imprisonment—Indeterminate term in addition to maximum in penal
statute—Power of Court—Food and Drugs Act , 1952-53 (Can.), c. 38, as amended—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 {Can.), c. 51, ss. 5(1) (b), 231(2)—Prisons and Reformatories
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 217, ss. 46, 151.

The appellant Turcotte was found guilty on
summary conviction in Vancouver
on two counts under the Food and Drugs Act . On each count, the
magistrate relied on s. 151  of the Prisons and Reformatories Act  to
impose two years less one day indeterminate in addition to the maximum
determinate term, upon summary conviction, for the offence under the Act. On an
appeal by way of stated case, the judge of first instance and the majority in
the Court of Appeal held that the magistrate was correct in imposing the
additional indeterminate sentence. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to
this Court.

The appellant Anderson pleaded guilty in Ontario to the offence of assault causing bodily harm, contrary to s.
231(2)  of the Criminal Code . He was

[Page 844]

sentenced to two years less one day definite
and one year indeterminate. The maximum definite sentence under this
section is two years. Relying on s. 46  of the Prisons and Reformatories
Act , the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The appellant was granted
leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be
dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The plain words of ss. 46  and 151  of
the Prisons and Reformatories Act  allow the imposition of sentences of
definite and indeterminate terms which, in the aggregate, extend beyond the
maximum terms fixed by the penal statute. The limiting conditions are that, in British Columbia, the convicted person must
be apparently within certain age limits and that, in both provinces, the
offence must be one punishable by imprisonment in the common goal for a term of
three months, or for any longer term. If these conditions are met, then the
Court may impose a determinate term and an indeterminate term, subject to the
limits that the term shall be not less than three months and the indeterminate
period not more than two years less one day. Section 5(1) 
(b) of the Criminal Code  does not touch the Prisons
and Reformatories Act .

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall J., dissenting: To argue that Parliament had intended by
s. 151  to subject this youthful class of offenders to periods of imprisonment
far in excess of that which could, by law, be imposed on older and seasoned
criminals for the identical offence is to impute to Parliament a want of
judgment which is unwarranted. Where Parliament intended that sections of
the Prisons and Reformatoires Act should have the effect of extending
the period of incarceration, it said so very specifically. Everything which can
be said respecting the interpretation to be given to s. 151  applies with equal
force to s. 46 .

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The Courts of Appeal
erred in holding that an indeterminate period of imprisonment in the
reformatory was lawfully imposed in addition to a definite period for the
maximum term of imprisonment specified in the statutes creating each offence.
It was submitted that if the provision

[Page 845]

is not read as so providing, then in the case
of an offence punishable by imprisonment for three months, no indeterminate
period can be imposed while the enactment contemplates an indeterminate period
in every case. This contention should be rejected. There is, in ss. 46  and 151 ,
no such distinction. The suggested distinction in fact runs contrary to the
wording of the enactment. There being only a maximum for the indeterminate period,
it is not illogical that at the limit the indeterminate period should reach the
vanishing point. On the principle that penal enactments should be strictly
construed, no provision should be construed as authorizing a greater punishment
if it can fairly be construed as not having such effect. There are other
sections in the Act where provision is made in unmistakable terms for a
sentence additional to the sentence provided in the enactment creating the
offence.

affirming the sentence imposed by the magistrate for offences under the Food
and Drugs Act , Appeal dismissed.

sentence imposed at trial for the offence of assault causing bodily harm.
Appeal dismissed.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

CARTWRIGHT C.J. (dissenting)—I agree with
the reasons of my brothers Hall and Pigeon and, on the assumption that we have
jurisdiction to entertain the appeals, I would dispose of them as proposed by
my brother Pigeon. I agree with the view of all members of the Court that, as
in

[Page 846]

the opinion of the majority both appeals fail on
the merits, it is unnecessary to say anything on the question of our
jurisdiction.

The judgment of FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND,
JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.—This appeal (Turcotte v. The
Queen) from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] raises the question whether s. 151 of the Prisons
and Reformatories Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 217, allows the imposition by
the Court of an indeterminate term in addition to the maximum term of
imprisonment laid down in the penal statute. Turcotte was tried on two charges
under the Food and Drugs Act . The first was one of trafficking in
Methamphetamine contrary to s. 32 . On this charge he was sentenced to a term of
18 months determinate and for an indeterminate period thereafter not to exceed
two years less one day. The term of 18 months determinate was the maximum
sentence, upon summary conviction, for this offence under the Food and Drugs
Act .

The second charge was selling Lysergic Acid
Diethylamide contrary to s. 14A  of the Food and Drugs Act . On this
charge he was sentenced to a term of three months determinate and for an
indeterminate period thereafter not to exceed two years less one day. The
sentence of three months determinate was the maximum, upon summary conviction,
for this offence under the Act.

The authority for the imposition of the
indeterminate part of the sentence is to be found in s. 151  of the Prisons
and Reformatories Act , which reads:

151. Every Court in the Province of British
Columbia, before which any male person apparently over the age of sixteen years
and under the age of twenty-three years is convicted of an offence against the
laws of Canada, punishable by imprisonment in the common gaol for the term of
three months, or

[Page 847]

for any longer term, may sentence such
person to imprisonment for the term of not less than three months and for an
indeterminate period thereafter of not more than two years less one day in New
Haven, instead of the common gaol of the county or judicial district where the
offence was committed or was tried, and such person shall thereupon be
imprisoned in New Haven, until he is lawfully discharged or paroled pursuant to
section 152 or transferred pursuant to section 153, and shall be
subject to all the rules and regulations of the institution as may be approved
from time to time by the Lieutenant-Governor in that behalf.

I will leave aside for the moment the question
whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, and deal with the
appeal on its merits. We have in this case a maximum term under the Food and
Drugs Act  and, in addition, the indeterminate sentence under s. 151  of the Prisons
and Reformatories Act .

Section 151  first appeared in the Act in
the year 1948, Statutes of Canada 1948, c. 26, s. 1. There was no amendment of substance since that
date, up to the date of these convictions.

The appeal came up by way of stated case from
the magistrate, who asked whether he was correct in imposing the additional
indeterminate sentence. The judge of first instance, Dryer J., and the
majority in the Court of Appeal held that he was. I agree with Dryer J. and
Robertson J.A., writing for the majority in the Court of Appeal, and I adopt
their reasons. In my opinion the plain words of s. 151  do allow the imposition
of sentences of definite and indeterminate terms which, in the aggregate,
extend beyond the maximum terms fixed by the penal statute.

The limiting conditions on the application of
the section are:

(a) the convicted person must be
apparently within certain age limits;

(b) the offence must be one
punishable by imprisonment in the common gaol for a term of three months, or
for any longer term.

If these conditions are met, then the magistrate
or judge may impose a determinate term and an

[Page 848]

indeterminate term. The limits then imposed upon
him are that the term shall be not less than three months and the indeterminate
period not more than two years less one day.

The matter is well summarized in the following
extract from the reasons of Robertson J.A.:

Assume a case where the maximum term is
three months: A person may (by the express words of section 151 ) be
sentenced for that maximum definite term “and for an indeterminate
period thereafter of not more than two years less one day.” The language
clearly authorizes an aggregate of the definite term and the indeterminate
period which exceeds the maximum definite term of three months. The same holds
where the maximum definite term is longer than three months.

The indeterminate sentence came into Ontario by way of s. 46  of the Prisons
and Reformatories Act  in the year 1916. The history and purpose of the
legislation are dealt with by Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Bond[4]. The purpose of the legislation is
the reform and training of young offenders. The very point that was argued in
the present appeal came before the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Oldaker[5] and was decided in the same way that
the British Columbia Court of Appeal decided this appeal. The Ontario Court of
Appeal held that the sentence authorized by s. 46  of the Prisons and
Reformatories Act , which was the applicable section for Ontario, was alternative to that fixed by
the Code.

It was further argued in this appeal that s. 5,
subs. (1) of the Criminal Code  prohibits the imposition of definite and
indeterminate sentences. This section reads:

5. (1) Where an enactment creates an
offence and authorizes a punishment to be imposed in respect thereof,

(b) a person who is convicted
of that offence is not liable to any punishment in respect thereof other than
the punishment prescribed by this Act or by the enactment that creates the
offence.

[Page 849]

When the new Criminal Code  was enacted in
1954, s. 5  above quoted in part appeared as a combination of the former ss.
1029, 1030 and 1033 of the previous Code. These former sections had
abolished outlawry, solitary confinement, the pillory, forfeiture of chattels
(deodands) and attainder. Section 5(1)  (b) does not touch
the Prisons and Reformatories Act . It deals with the mode or type of
punishment that can be imposed and recognizes the abolition of the anomalous
punishments at common law.

I have left the question of our jurisdiction to
entertain this appeal to the end. It is unecessary to say anything on this
question, for even if we had such jurisdiction, the appeal fails on the merits.

I would dismiss the appeal.

This appeal (Anderson v. The Queen) raises the same
issue as that in the Turcotte case, namely, the imposition of an
indetermined term in addition to the maximum term laid down by the penal
statute. The appellant, James Robert Anderson, pleaded guilty to the offence of
assault occasioning bodily harm contrary to s. 231(2)  of the Criminal Code . He
was sentenced to two years less one day definite and one year indeterminate.
The maximum definite sentence under this section is two years.

The authority for the imposition of the
indeterminate part of the sentence in Ontario is to be found in s. 46 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 217, which reads:

46. Every court in the Province of Ontario
before which any person is convicted for an offence against the laws of Canada,
punishable by imprisonment in the common gaol for the term of three months, or
for any longer time, may sentence such person to imprisoment for a term of not
less than three months and for an indeterminate period thereafter of not more
than two years less one day in the Ontario Reformatory instead of the common
gaol of the county or judicial district where the offence was committed or was
tried.

This section was enacted in 1916 and has
stood without change to the present date.

[Page 850]

There is no substantial difference between s. 46 
and s. 151  of the Prisons and Reformatories Act  apart from the absence
in s. 46 of the age limit on its application. In the British
 Columbia section it is applicable to any male
person apparently over the age of 16 years and under the age of 23 years. But
the wisdom of the application of s. 46  and of the extent of its application is
open to full review by the Court of Appeal. An example is the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Bond[6].
This Court lacks this power.

The argument that we heard in Turcotte was
repeated in this appeal, namely, that s. 46  does not allow the imposition of
sentences of definite and indeterminate terms which in the aggregate extend
beyond the maximum terms fixed by the penal statute. The Ontario Court of
Appeal heard the same argument and rejected it. It followed Rex v. Oldaker[7], where precisely the same point was
involved. This judgment had stood unchallenged for forty years and the Court
could see no reason for declining to follow it. In my opinion Rex v. Oldaker
was correctly decided.

On the question of our jurisdiction to entertain
this appeal I repeat what I said in the Turcotte appeal. It is
unnecessary to say anything on this question, for even if we had such
jurisdiction, the appeal fails on the merits.

I would dismiss the appeal.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I am in agreement
with my brother Pigeon but wish to add some observations as to the intention of
Parliament in enacting ss. 46 and 151 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 217. Section 151 applies to British
 Columbia only and specifically to “any male person
over the age of sixteen years and under the age of twenty‑three years.”
(lowered to 22 years by 17-18 Eliz. II, c. 38, s. 115). In my view this limited
age application is of profound significance, obviously being aimed at young
offenders. The institutions named in the section, “that portion of Oakalla
Prison Farm 

[Page 851]

known as the Young Offenders Unit or in New Haven”, are provincial institutions.
The Young Offenders Unit of Oakalla Prison Farm appears to have legislative
basis in Order-in-Council No. 1043 of 1967 of the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council of British Columbia. That Order‑in‑Council as amended by
Order-in-Council No. 1258 of 1968 reads:

AND TO RECOMMEND THAT effective April 1st,
1967, Order-in-Council No. 1347, approved May 28, 1963, be amended to declare
that the portion of the land and premises described therein to be used for
young offenders shall be constituted and known as “that part of Oakalla Prison
Farm known as the Young Offenders Unit.”

It will be seen that the institution is declared
to be for “young offenders”.

New Haven stems from c.
45 of the Statutes of British Columbia for 1949 and ss. 2 and 5 read as
follows:

2. The institution known as “New Haven,” situate on Lot 164, Group 1,
New Westminster District, shall exist and continue as a lawful place of
confinement under the name “New Haven” and shall be for the custody and detention, with a view to their
education, training, and reclamation, of such offenders as are lawfully
committed thereto. 

* *
*

5. Every Court in the Province before which
any male person apparently over the age of sixteen years and under the age of
twenty-three years is convicted of an offence against any law enacted by the
Province, punishable by imprisonment in the common gaol for a term of three
months or for any longer term, may sentence such person to imprisonment for a
term of not less than three months and for an indeterminate period thereafter
of not more than two years less one day in New Haven instead of the common gaol
of the county or judicial district where the offence was committed or was
tried, and such person shall thereon be imprisoned in New Haven until he is
lawfully discharged, or paroled pursuant to section 6 or removed pursuant
to section 7, and shall be subject to all the regulations of the
institution that may be approved from time to time by the Lieutenant‑Governor
in Council in that behalf.

[Page 852]

Again the institution is said to be a lawful
place of confinement for male persons over 16 and under 23 “with a view to
their education, training, and reclamation”.

Historically the concept of special correctional
institutions for young and generally first offenders involved their separation
from older and more hardened criminals and the creation of a place where these
young offenders would be educated, trained, reclaimed and assisted to return to
the community as soon as they manifested an intention and ability to avoid
crime and criminal companions. It is obvious that Parliament had this concept
in mind when it restricted the application of s. 151 to those under the age of
23. To argue that Parliament had intended by this section to subject this
youthful class of offenders to periods of imprisonment far in excess of that
which could, by law, be imposed on older and seasoned criminals for the
identical offence is to impute to Parliament a want of judgment that I am not
prepared to do.

Where Parliament intended that sections of
the Prisons and Reformatorties Act should have the effect of extending
the period of incarceration, it said so very specifically as in s. 52 and the
other sections mentioned by my brother Pigeon in his reasons. Any doubt
that Parliament may have, even inadverently, provided for increasing the
sentence of the under-23 male offender in excess of that which the Code provides
for the older male offender is dissipated by the provisions of s. 153(1) which
provide that if an under-23 offender is sentenced to being imprisoned in New
Haven or the Young Offenders Unit of Oakalla Prison Farm the Inspector of Gaols
or such other person as is authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor for that
purpose from time to time may direct by warrant the removal of a person so
imprisoned to the common gaol at Oakalla Prison Farm and a person so
transferred shall be detained in the prison to which he is transferred for the
unexpired portion of the term of imprisonment to which he was originally
sentenced whenever the person so authorized deems it expedient so to do.

[Page 853]

On the interpretation given s. 151 by the Appeal
Court, it would mean that an offender under 23, convicted under a
section of the Code for which he is liable to imprisonment of three months
only but sentenced under s. 151 to the maximum indeterminate period to New
Haven or the Young Offenders Unit of Oakalla Prison, can, in the discretion of
an Inspector of Gaols, forthwith be transferred and kept in the common gaol of
Oakalla Prison Farm for two years less one day, thus frustrating the concept of
sending youthful offenders to a special institution “with a view to their education,
training, and reclamation”. Parliament cannot be said to have transferred the
power to imprison the young 23-year-old male offender to a common gaol for
a term beyond that which the Code imposes in any specific case from the courts
to an Inspector of Gaols or such other officer as may be authorized by the
Lieutenant-Governor. That would be the result if the interpretation argued for
by the Crown is accepted. The proposition has merely to be stated to
demonstrate its absurdity.

Section 46 which applies to Ontario is
similar to s. 151, the only substantial difference being that there is no age
limitation in s. 46 so that everything which can be said respecting the
interpretation to be given to s. 151 applies with equal force to s. 46.

The institution known as the Ontario Reformatory
referred to in s. 46 derived historically from c. 218 of the Revised Statutes
of Ontario, 1877, which was replaced by c. 34 of 43 Vict. (1880) and was
in turn replaced by the Ontario Reformatory Act, 3-4 Geo. V, c. 77
(1913). Sections 8 and 19(1) of 3-4 Geo.V, c. 77 read:

8. The Court before which any male person
is convicted under, or under the authority of, an Act of this Legislature of an
offence, punishable by imprisonment in the common gaol, may sentence such
person to imprisonment in the Reformatory. R.S.O. 1897, c. 308, ss. 14 and
15; see R.S.C. 1906, c. 148, s. 44. Amended.

19. (1) Every person sentenced directly to
the Reformatory shall be sentenced to imprisonment

[Page 854]

therein for a period of not less than three
months and for an indeterminate period thereafter of not more than two years
less one day.

These sections refer only to provincial
offences but they do indicate that there was no intention of the reformatory
sentence being additional to any other sentence because if a person was not
sentenced directly to the reformatory as contemplated by s. 19(1) he could be
transferred to the reformatory under s. 7 for the unexpired portion of the term
of imprisonment to which he was sentenced and thereafter be imprisoned in the
reformatory for the residue of the term. There is no increase in the term in
these circumstances. Section 46 should, I think, be read in pari
materia with the provisions of 3-4 Geo. V, c. 77.

The judgment of Spence and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

PIGEON J. (dissenting)—The questions
raised in these two cases are substantially the same and it will be convenient
to deal with them at the same time.

Appellant Turcotte was found guilty on summary
conviction in Vancouver, British
  Columbia, on two counts:

1. unlawful traffic in a drug contrary to s. 32 
of the Food and Drugs Act  (1960-61 (Can.), c. 37 as amended);

2. unlawful sale of a drug contrary to s. 14A of
the same Act.

The maximum sentence provided for the offence on
the first count is eighteen months’ imprisonment and for the offence on the
second count, three months. The magistrate, relying on s. 151  of the Prisons
and Reformatories Act  (R.S.C. 1952, c. 217 as amended), imposed on count 1.
a sentence of eighteen months determinate and two years less one day
indeterminate, and on count 2. three months determinate and two years less one
day indeterminate. On an appeal by way of stated case, the British Columbia
Court of Appeal[8] upheld
the sentence as authorized by the statute relied on by the magis-

[Page 855]

trate. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted
on motion made under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

Appellant Anderson has pleaded guilty of assault causing bodily harm, an indictable
offence for which under s. 231(2)  of the Criminal Code  he is liable to
imprisonment for two years. The magistrate has sentenced him to two years less
a day definite and one year indefinite. In his report to the Court of appeal he
said: “Obviously the penalty should not have exceeded the two years which is
the maximum penalty for this particular offence… my error is very obvious”
However, relying on s. 46  of the Prisons and Reformatories Act , the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[9]
dismissed the appeal. As in the other case, a motion by the accused for special
leave to appeal to this Court was granted by this Court.

Although the two cases depend on the
construction of two different sections of the Prisons and Reformatories
Act , the question is really identical because, from the point of view with
which we are concerned, there is no material difference between the two
provisions. As amended, these are the following:

46. Every court in the Province of Ontario,
before which any person is convicted for an offence against the laws of Canada,
punishable by imprisonment in the common gaol for the term of three months, or
for any longer time, may sentence such person to imprisonment for a term of not
less than three months and for an indeterminate period thereafter of not more
than two years less one day in the Ontario Reformatory instead of the common
gaol of the county or judicial district where the offence was committed or was
tried.

151. Every court in the province of British
Columbia, before which any male person apparently over the age of sixteen years
and under the age of twenty-three years is convicted of an offence against the
laws of Canada, punishable by imprisonment

[Page 856]

in the common gaol for the term of three
months, or for any longer term, may sentence such person to imprisonment for
the term of not less than three months and for an indeterminate period
thereafter of not more than two years less one day in that portion of Oakalla
Prison Farm known as the Young Offenders Unit or in New Haven instead of the
common gaol of the county or judicial district where the offence was committed
or was tried, and such person shall thereupon be imprisoned in that portion of
Oakalla Prison Farm known as the Young Offenders Unit or in New Haven as the
case may be, until he is lawfully discharged or paroled pursuant to
section 152 or transferred pursuant to section 153, and shall be
subject to all the rules and regulations of the institution as may be approved
from time to time by the Lieutenant-Governor in that behalf.

It is apparent that with reference to an
offender within the description specified for British
 Columbia as with respect to any offender in Ontario, the material part of the enactment
is the following:

Every court… before which any person is
convicted for an offence against the laws of Canada, punishable by imprisonment
in the common gaol for the term of three months, or for any longer time, may
sentence such person to imprisonment for a term of not less than three months
and for an indeterminate period thereafter of not more than two years less one
day in the (reformatory) instead of the common gaol of the county or judicial
district where the offence was committed or was tried.

It was not contended that this should be read as
authorizing any definite term of imprisonment not less than three months,
irrespective of the maximum term specified in the enactment creating the
offence. It was submitted, however, that while the definite term cannot be
longer than the maximum, the indeterminate period may be in addition. It was
pointed out that if the provision is not read as so providing, then in the case
of an offence punishable by imprisonment for three months, no indeterminate
period can be imposed while the enactment contemplates an indeterminate period
in every case. This contention should be rejected for the following reasons.

1. It offends against the rule that no
distinction is to be introduced that is not in the 

[Page 857]

enactment. There is no other distinction between
the determinate and indeterminate periods than the specified minimum and
maximum. Both periods apply to the term of imprisonment that the offender can
be sentenced to serve in the reformatory instead of the common gaol.

2. The suggested distinction in fact runs
contrary to the wording of the enactment. In the case of an offence punishable
by three months of imprisonment, an indeterminate period of imprisonment in the
reformatory, in addition to the minimum determinate period of three months,
cannot be said to be ordered to be served in the reformatory instead of
the common gaol because it cannot be ordered to be served there. Whatever
anomaly there might be in having no indeterminate period possible in such case
is largely outweighed by the consideration that the reading suggested actually
runs contrary to the wording of the enactment.

3. It must also be observed that there is no
minimum for the indeterminate period, only a maximum. Such being the case, it
is not illogical that at the limit the indeterminate period should reach the
vanishing point.

4. It is a fundamental principle that penal
enacments are strictly construed. This certainly means that no provision should
be construed as authorizing a greater punishment if it can fairly be construed
as not having such effect. It is admitted that the two sections with which
we are concerned were not meant to authorize a definite term of imprisonment of
any length exceeding the specified minimum. Therefore, they must be read as
subjecting the length of imprisonment in the reformatory to a limit derived
from the statute creating the offence. It is much easier to read the enactment
as so limiting the total duration of the imprisonment in the reformatory than
to read it as so limiting only the definite period.

5. Finally, it must be considered that in the Prisons
and Reformatories Act  there are other sections such as 52, 99, 110,
111, 136 and 137 where provision is made in unmistakable terms

[Page 858]

for a sentence additional to the sentence
provided in the enactment creating the offence. The existence in the same act
of somewhat similar provisions in which provision for an additional term of
imprisonment is made in such way is a strong reason for not construing as
having such an effect other sections in which such wording is not used.

It does not appear necessary to consider each of
the many cases referred to in the elaborate reasons of Robertson J.A. for the
majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and in those of the two dissenting judges, Nemetz and Taggart.
However, I will refer first to Rex v. Oldaker[10], a decision of the Court of appeal
for Ontario relied on in both
cases. In that case, the prisoner had been found guilty of an offence for which
he was liable to one year’s imprisonment and he had been sentenced to a
definite term of one year in the reformatory and an indeterminate period of two
years less one day. Mulock, C.J.O., after quoting s. 46 , said (at p. 649):

The meaning of this section appears to
me quite plain. Under the circumstances mentioned in said s. 46, the sentence
fixed by the Prisons and Reformatories Act  is alternative of that fixed by the
Code. Whilst s. 242(3) of the Code declares what shall generally be the
sentence throughout Canada, s. 46 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act  enacts
an exception to its generality, the exception being that in the Province of
Ontario every Court may under the circumstances mentioned in s. 46  sentence a
prisoner to imprisonment in the Ontario Reformatory instead of the common gaol
and for the term provided in s. 46  in lieu of that mentioned in s. 242(3) of
the Code.

With great deference it must be pointed out that
s. 46 does not provide for a definite period of any duration between three
months and the maximum for which the offender is liable. What is provided for
is a term of not less than three months. If this is taken by itself together
with 

[Page 859]

the indeterminate period as being an alternative
of the sentence authorized by the enactment creating the offence then it means
three months, no more and no less.

In Re Richard[11], this Court held that an enactment
making an offender liable to a penalty “of not less than fifty dollars does not
authorize the imposition of a penalty greater than $50.”. It is therefore
apparent that if s. 46 was to be read as Mulock J. suggests, that is as
providing for an alternative penalty, it would have to be taken as authorizing
three months definite and not more than two years less one day indeterminate.
In order to justify any other sentence under that provision, it must be read
not as providing for an alternative term of imprisonment but as an alternative
method of imposing the penalty provided by the offence creating statute.

In Regina v. MacDonald[12], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia overruled a magistrate who
had relied on Re Richard, Sheppard J.A. saying (at p. 319):

Under sec. 151 the authority of the
magistrate to impose a determinate sentence in excess of three months does not
depend upon finding in that section  “an intention to authorize the
magistrate to inflict any penalty he pleases,” for the reason that such
authority of the magistrate to impose imprisonment by determinate sentence will
be expressly conferred by “the laws of Canada” referred to in the earlier part
of sec. 151, which will define the offence and will fix the period of
imprisonment. To such period of imprisonment so authorized by the applicable
“laws of Canada” the magistrate
may apply sec. 151 and impose in addition an indeterminate detention up to
two years less one day.

With great deference, one only has to compare
that with s. 151 to realize what is being added to it. Of course, if the section did
say that in addition to the period of imprisonment authorized by the
applicable law, the magistrate may add an indeterminate detention, such would
be its legal effect. However, as previously pointed out, this is not what is
said. Furthermore, such wording is

[Page 860]

found in other sections of the Act and that
is one more reason for not importing it in sections where it is not to be
found.

In view of the above conclusion respecting the
meaning of ss. 46  and 151  of the Prisons and Reformatories Act , it
becomes unnecessary to consider an alternative argument of both appellants
based on s. 5(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code .

For all the above reasons my conclusion on the
merits is that the Courts of appeal erred in holding that an indeterminate
period of imprisonment in the reformatory was lawfully imposed in addition to a
definite period for the maximum term of imprisonment specified in the statutes
creating each offence. It does not appear to me that, in the case of offences
punishable by more than three months, we ought to consider how the period of
imprisonment should have been apportioned by the magistrate between the
determinate and indeterminate periods. As it is clear that all the Courts below
felt that in each case the sentence for the definite period was fully
justified, I would, as the dissenting judges suggested in the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, quash that part of each sentence that imposes an
indeterminate period of imprisonment.

Seeing that in the opinion of the majority in
this Court both appeals fail on the merits, it appears unnecessary to say
anything on the question of our jurisdiction to hear those appeals by special
leave granted under the Supreme Court Act.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Capital murder—Deliberate
shooting of police officer—Defence of insanity—Evidence dealing with that
defence not reviewed by trial judge—Whether misdirection—Power of Supreme Court
to consider other defences raised in notice of appeal or record—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 16, 202A, 583A(3), 592(1)(b)(iii).

The respondent was convicted of capital
murder. As a result of a telephone call, two uniformed police officers were
sent to the respondent’s home. As they approached the house, the respondent
shot one of them from an upstairs window. The defence of insanity was raised.
In a statement admitted in evidence, the respondent said that he had planned to
kill a policeman and had purchased a rifle and ammunition for that purpose. The
defence called two witnesses only, the respondent’s sister

[Page 552]

who testified as to the mistreatment of her
brother by their father when he was a child, and a psychiatrist who saw the
respondent nine months after the crime and six days before the trial. The
psychiatrist expressed the opinion that the respondent had an aggressive,
antisocial, impulse-ridden type of personality and was unable to cope with his
homicidal or sexual impulses. The trial judge did not review the evidence of
the respondent’s sister or that of the psychiatrist. By a majority judgment,
the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that there had been
non-direction as to the defence of insanity amounting to misdirection. The
Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall and
Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the verdict at the
trial restored.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: After considering
all the evidence that had any relevance to the defence of insanity and in the
particular circumstances of this case, the charge on this branch of the matter,
considered as it must be in the light of all the evidence in the record, was
sufficient in law and more favourable to the respondent than it could have been
if the trial judge had made a detailed analysis of the psychiatrist’s evidence.
The Court of Appeal should, therefore, have rejected the ground of appeal on
which it based its judgment.

The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to
consider the other grounds of appeal alleged in the notice of appeal or
disclosed by the record, as it had the jurisdiction to do under s. 583A(3) 
of the Criminal Code . In these circumstances, this Court has the power
to make a final disposition of the appeal. A consideration of any other defence
leads to the conclusion that the trial was conducted with scrupulous fairness
to the respondent, that in its course there was no error in law, that no valid
exception could be taken to the charge of the trial judge and that the verdict
was fully supported by the evidence. There was no need to invoke the provisions
of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.

Per Hall and
Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge misdirected the jury on the
defence of insanity in that he failed to instruct them that there was evidence
that the respondent was suffering from a disease of the mind, and while an
irresistible impulse was not of itself a defence the evidence that the
irresistible impulse was a manifestation of a disease of the mind was evidence
to be considered by them in the light of the psychiatrist’s testimony.
Furthermore, the trial judge should have reviewed in part what the psychiatrist
had said and how the law as to insanity as a defence should be applied to the
facts as the jury found them. If there is medical evidence of disease of the
mind as there was here and yet the only symptoms of that disease are
irresistible impulses, the jury may conclude that the accused is insane. The
evidence of irresistible impulse is also relevant to the issue of whether the
accused is capable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act. A man
operating under an irresistible impulse may have knowledge of the nature and
quality of his act without appreciating its nature and quality. In failing to
point out to the jury that the theory of the defence was that the respondent
had a disease of the mind and that the irresistible impulse was the
manifestation of that disease, the trial judge failed to put the theory of the
defence adequately to the jury. The provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code should not be invoked. This Court has the jurisdiction to do what
the Court of Appeal was required to do by s. 583A(3) of the Code.

Droit criminel—Meurtre qualifié—Coup de feu
tiré de propos délibéré sur un officier de police—Défense d’aliénation
mentale—La preuve se rapportant à cette défense non passée en revue par le juge
au procès—S’agit-il de mauvaises directives—Pouvoir de la Cour suprême de
considérer les autres défenses soulevées dans l’avis d’appel ou le dossier—Code
criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 16, 202A, 583A(3), 592(1)(b)(iii).

L’intimé a été déclaré coupable d’un meurtre
qualifié. A la suite d’un appel téléphonique, deux officiers de police, en
uniforme, ont été envoyés à la résidence de l’intimé. Comme ils approchaient de
la maison, l’intimé, d’une fenêtre située à un étage supérieur, a tiré un coup
de feu sur l’un des officiers. La défense d’aliénation mentale a été soulevée.
Dans une déclaration admise en preuve, l’intimé a dit qu’il avait projeté de
tuer un agent de police et que pour ce faire il avait acheté un fusil et des
balles. La défense a fait entendre deux témoins seulement, la sœur de l’intimé
qui a témoigné des mauvais traitements infligés par leur père à son frère
lorsqu’il était un enfant, et un psychiatre qui a vu l’intimé neuf mois après
le crime et six jours avant le procès. Le phychiatre a exprimé l’opinion que
l’intimé avait une personnalité agressive, antisocial, menée par ses impulsions
et qu’il était incapable de repousser ses impulsions meurtrières ou sexuelles.
Le juge au procès n’a pas passé en revue le témoignage de la sœur de l’intimé
ou celui du psychiatre. La Cour d’appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a ordonné
un nouveau procès pour le motif qu’il y avait eu, quant à la défense
d’aliénation mentale, un manque de directives équivalent à une mauvaise
directive. La Couronne en appela à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être accueilli et la déclaration de culpabilité rétablie, les Juges Hall et
Spence étant dissidents.

Le Juge en Chef
Cartwright et les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Pigeon:
Après avoir examiné toute la preuve se rapportant à la défense d’aliénation
mentale et dans les circonstances particulières de cette cause, les directives
sur cette branche du procès, considérées comme elles doivent l’être à la
lumière de toute la preuve au dossier, étaient suffisantes en droit et plus
favorables à l’intimé qu’elles l’auraient été si le juge avait fait une analyse
détaillée du témoignage du psychiatre. En conséquence, la Cour d’appel aurait
dû rejeter le motif d’appel sur lequel elle a appuyé sa décision.

La Cour d’appel n’a pas jugé qu’il était
nécessaire de considérer les autres motifs d’appel allégués dans l’avis d’appel
ou apparaissant au dossier, comme elle avait juridiction de le faire sous
l’art. 583A(3)  du Code criminel . Dans ces circonstances, cette Cour a le
pouvoir de disposer finalement de l’appel. Un examen des autres défenses mène à
la conclusion que le procès a été tenu avec une impartialité scrupuleuse, qu’il
ne s’est produit aucune erreur en droit, qu’on ne peut s’objecter validement
aux directives du juge et que la déclaration de culpabilité était amplement
supportée par la preuve. Il n’y a aucune nécessité d’invoquer les dispositions
de l’art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code.

Les Juges Hall et
Spence, dissidents: Le juge au procès a donné des mauvaises directives
quant à la défense d’aliénation mentale, à savoir qu’il ne leur a pas dit qu’il
y avait une preuve que l’intimé était atteint d’une maladie mentale, et
quoiqu’une impulsion irrésistible n’est pas en soi une défense la preuve que
l’impulsion irrésistible est une manifestation d’une maladie mentale est une
preuve que le jury devait considérer à la lumière du témoignage du psychiatre.
De plus,

[Page 554]

le juge aurait dû examiner en partie ce que le
psychiatre avait dit et expliquer comment la loi concernant l’aliénation
mentale comme défense doit être appliquée aux faits tels que déterminés par le
jury. S’il existe une preuve médicale d’une maladie mentale, comme c’était le
cas, et cependant les seuls symptômes de cette maladie sont des impulsions
irrésistibles, le jury peut en venir à la conclusion que l’accusé est un
aliéné. La preuve d’impulsion irrésistible est de plus pertinente à la question
de savoir si l’accusé est capable de juger la nature et la qualité de l’acte.
Un homme agissant sous des impulsions irrésistibles peut bien connaître la
nature et la qualité de son acte sans en apprécier la nature et la qualité. En
omettant de faire observer au jury que la théorie de la défense était que
l’intimé était atteint d’une maladie mentale et que l’impulsion irrésistible
était la manifestation de cette maladie, le juge au procès a omis de placer
adéquatement devant le jury la théorie de la défense. Les dispositions de
l’art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code ne doivent pas être invoquées. Cette Cour
a juridiction pour faire ce que la Cour d’appel devait faire sous l’art.
583A(3) du Code.

APPEL par la Couronne d’un jugement de la Cour
d’appel de l’Alberta[1],
ordonnant un nouveau procès. Appel accueilli.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division1, which had ordered a new trial. Appeal
allowed.

J.W.K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the
appellant.

G.A.C. Steer, Q.C., and G.A. Verville for
the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an appeal, brought
pursuant to s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , from a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1,
pronounced on October 31, 1968, setting aside a verdict of guilty of capital
murder and directing a new trial. Allen J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed
the appeal.

The respondent was tried before Milvain J., as
he then was, and a jury. The verdict was rendered on April 11, 1968. The
respondent was sentenced to death.

There is no dispute as to the facts surrounding
the actual killing.

[Page 555]

On June 23, 1967, as a result of a telephone
call made at about 2.40 p.m. to the detachment office of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police at Grande Prairie, Alberta, Corporal Harvey and Corporal Biggar
drove from the detachment office to a residence known as 1006 103rd St., in an
area of the City of Grande Prairie described as Bear Creek Flats. Both were
dressed in the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They enquired at
that address as to the location of the residence of Leonard Otto Borg and Harvey
Lambert, an occupant of the house, came out to show them where Borg lived. Borg
lived in an apartment above a double garage to the rear and slightly to one
side of the residence mentioned. Lambert, Corporal Biggar and Corporal Harvey
walked past the front of that residence and turned into a driveway leading to
Borg’s apartment. They had walked about twelve feet along the driveway towards
Borg’s residence when a head appeared at an open window near the southeast
corner of the apartment and a shot was heard. Corporal Harvey clutched the
upper part of his body and fell to the ground. Corporal Biggar drew his
revolver, fired one shot into the ground, then obtained some assistance and
moved Harvey out of the line of fire. Harvey was mortally wounded and died in a
short time, undoubtedly as a result of the wound caused by the bullet fired
through the open window.

When Corporal Biggar fired into the ground the
head in the window disappeared. A very short time later Corporal Biggar saw
what he believed to be the same head appear at the same open window and he
fired his revolver towards the head. He saw “the head come up and appear to
fall back”. Corporal Biggar radioed to the detachment office for assistance. He
could then see no movement in the house and he fired another shot into the
ground immediately in front of him. He then heard a voice coming from inside
the building “If I throw my gun out you won’t shoot, will you?”. Corporal
Biggar said he wouldn’t and told the man to stand up where he could see him. A
hand with a rifle came over the windowsill and the rifle dropped to the ground.
The man inside said there was no door on the front and that the Corporal would
have to go to the back. The Corporal went to the back and told the man to come
out

[Page 556]

with his hands up; the man, who was Borg, did so
and was placed under arrest; he was found to have been shot and slightly
wounded in one ear.

Following a voir dire, the learned trial judge
admitted in evidence portions of a statement written and signed by the respondent
and two questions out of several asked of him by Corporal Dillabaugh and his
answers thereto.

These are as follows:

I then slept till 9 a.m. Went down town and
bought a cil. 22 for $19.80 and one box of .22 long. I came back home and made
a phone call to the RCMP. I didn’t give them…

(Here a sentence is omitted.)

…I later went up town at 1 am and had one
drink of Vodka strate and one ry and water I came home about 2 30 am and made a
phone call to the RCMP telling them where I lived When the police arrived I
shot one in the chest some ware around the heart, at least thats where I was
aiming shortly after that the second police man shot at me hitting me in the
left ear it knocked me to the floor I then thought whats the use. I caused
enough grief in my life. I then gave myself up.

(It is obvious, and was agreed by counsel, that
“1 am” and “2 30 am” should have read “1 p.m.” and “2.30 p.m.”).

The questions and answers were as follows:

Que. When you made the phone call to the
R.C.M. Police & told them who you were & where they might find you, did
you at that time plan to kill a policeman when he came to see you?

Ans. I planned to kill a policeman before
that, before I ever went up town to buy the gun.

Que. Just when did you first plan to kill a
policeman?

Ans. My plan to kill a policeman first came
into my mind while I was doing 3 years in the B.C. pen for something I didn’t
do.

There is evidence confirming the purchase of the
rifle and ammunition on the 23rd June 1967. Ammunition of the type purchased
was found in the respondent’s apartment in several places. Some blood was
splattered upon the floor in the vicinity of the open window and there were
quite substantial amounts of blood upon the respondent’s shirt.

It should be explained why portions only of the
written statement and the questions and answers were read to the jury.

On the voir dire there had been filed as Exhibit
V.D. 5, three documents, (i) a lengthy statement in the handwriting of the
respondent headed, “To whom it may concern”, (ii)

[Page 557]

a short letter commencing “Mom Dad and Kinfolk”
and (iii) a short document intended to be the respondent’s will. These
documents had been found by Staff Sergeant Chalk, at about 3.10 p.m. on the day
of the killing of Corporal Harvey, in a sealed envelope in the apartment
occupied by the respondent from which the fatal shot was fired. At the time
when these documents were found, the respondent was in a police car outside the
building. In the apartment was the dead body of a woman. It seems obvious that the
three documents were written by the respondent between the time when he killed
the woman and the arrival of Corporal Harvey and Corporal Biggar.

Between 10.15 p.m. and 11.45 p.m. on June 23,
1967, the respondent made a lengthy statement to Corporal Dillabaugh and
Constable Fischer. This statement was written and signed by the respondent. It
was filed as Exhibit V.D. 3 on the voir dire. It described in considerable
detail the killing of a woman by the respondent on December 21, 1966, and the
burning by him of the shack in which her dead body lay with the result that her
death was held to have been accidental. It went on to describe the killing of
another woman by the respondent in the early morning hours of June 23, 1967,
stating that she was dead about 3 a.m. Immediately following this point in the
statement were the words:—“I wrote a letter detailing my part”. This letter
would appear to be item (i) in Exhibit V.D. 5 mentioned above. This sentence
immediately preceded the portion of the statement which was read to the jury
and which has been quoted above. The “sentence omitted” indicated in the quoted
statement, read as follows:

I just told them that I had murdered my
wife, I didn’t give them any details of the place at the time for I was not
sure of my plans.

Following the making of this written statement
by the respondent, he was asked several questions by Corporal Dillabaugh. These
questions and answers of the respondent were taken down in writing and were
signed by the accused and this document was marked as Exhibit V.D. 4.

The two questions and answers read to the jury
have been quoted above.

It would seem that both counsel at the trial
were of the view that, although the learned trial judge had ruled that

[Page 558]

the statements made by the accused were
voluntary, it would be unfair to the accused to show that he had killed two
persons other than the one with whose murder he was charged and that after
discussion, in the absence of the jury, some of which appears to have taken
place in the judge’s chambers, counsel agreed, with the approval of the learned
trial judge, as to what should be read to the jury.

In taking this course I presume the learned
trial judge and counsel had in mind the rule of conduct referred to in such
cases as Noor Mohamed v. The King[2],
that evidence, although legally admissible, should not be tendered if the
prejudice to the accused would far outweigh its probative value relevant to the
issue before the Court.

In my opinion, so far as the statement, V.D. 3,
the questions and answers, V.D. 4 and the documents contained in Exhibit V.D. 5
were tendered to show that the accused had murdered Corporal Harvey it may well
have been proper to exclude the portions which were withheld from the jury; but
it appears to me that they were all clearly relevant to the issue of the
defense of insanity and on that issue could properly have been put before the
jury in their entirety. However, in view of the course taken at the trial, I
propose in deciding how this appeal should be disposed of to consider only the
evidence actually placed before the jury.

In the course of his reasons the learned Chief
Justice of Alberta, who delivered the judment of the majority of the Appellate
Division, after summarizing the facts surrounding the shooting of Corporal Harvey,
said that it was established beyond any room for doubt (i) that the shooting
was the act of the respondent and (ii) that his act amounted to capital murder
and consequently that the only defence open to the respondent was that of
insanity under s. 16  of the Criminal Code . I agree with this
statement; it is supported by conclusive and uncontradicted evidence.

The only issue discussed before us and the only
one of any substance in this case is that regarding the defence of insanity.

[Page 559]

The ground on which the majority of the
Appellate Division allowed the appeal is summarized in the formal judgment as
follows:

AND UPON this Honourable Court finding that
the learned trial Judge failed to review the substantial parts of the evidence
of Mrs. Hartman and Dr. Spaner and to instruct the jury as to how the
law was to be applied to the facts as they found them and thereby misdirected
the jury by such non-direction.

The only evidence at the trial called by the
defence was that of Mrs. Hartman, a sister of the accused, and
Dr. Spaner, a medical practitioner specializing in psychiatry whose
qualifications were not questioned. Their evidence related entirely to the
defence of insanity.

The Crown called no evidence in reply.

The evidence of Mrs. Hartman is sufficiently
summarized by Bruce Smith C.J.A. as follows:

Mrs. Hartman gave a very detailed
description of her and the appellant’s life at home as children. She said he
had been persecuted, beaten and abused by his father and unnecessarily
mistreated in many ways; that he had been shown no affection by his father;
that he would be given conflicting instructions by his father and then brutally
punished because he did not properly carry out the instructions; that his
father cheated him out of a trap line when he became older. She said that on
one occasion, after he had left home, he returned and was very mixed up and
acting strangely. She said that he was ‘sitting there sharpening a knife and
looking at me’ and that she was afraid and got an iron and a knife with which
to protect herself. On another occasion, at the time of Mrs. Hartman’s
wedding, the appellant didn’t remember where he had been for five days. She
said his only association was with Metis women, not white girls, and that he
didn’t feel good enough for white girls.

Dr. Spaner interviewed the accused at Fort
Saskatchewan gaol on April 2, 1968, that is six days before the commencement of
the trial and a little over nine months after the killing of Corporal Harvey.
The interview lasted between 2½ and 3 hours. Dr. Spaner heard the evidence
of Mrs. Hartman and the portions of the accused’s statement and answers
that were read to the jury. It was from these materials that he formed his
opinion.

As was pointed out by Bruce Smith C.J.A.,
Dr. Spaner nowhere in his evidence expressed the opinion, in so many
words, that the accused at the time he shot Corporal Harvey did not know that
what he was doing was contrary to law or that he was incapable of appreciating
the nature

[Page 560]

and quality of his act. The learned Chief
Justice was, however, of the view that either of these conclusions could be
founded on Dr. Spaner’s evidence if accepted. With the greatest respect I
cannot agree with this.

It appears to me that if the view of
Dr. Spaner’s evidence most favourable to the accused were taken by the
jury it could be said to show, (i) that Borg was suffering from a disease of
the mind called a psychopathic state and that he fitted into the classification
of the aggressive, anti-social, impulse-ridden type of personality, (ii) that
he had very few healthy coping mechanisms or ways of defending himself against
impulses such as homicidal or sexual ones, (iii) that this lack of impulse
control is chronic, (iv) that a major characteristic of this impulse type of
personality is being emotionally unbalanced by the illness, that the moral
issues cannot be differentiated, that he does not have the moral ethical part
of his mind functioning most of his life but “most important of all he can have
normal cognitive functioning—that is the knowing part of his mind functioning”,
(v) that the impulse is so powerful his judgment is impaired but he can still
have intellectual functioning, (vi) that the effect of alcohol is
unpredictable; it can wipe away any controls or it might even calm him; it is
impossible to say, (vii) that Borg hates authoritarian figures and under the
influence of his anti-social impulse driven, aggressive impulses, he can kill,
(viii) that if the force of the impulse cannot be resisted “at that moment”,
and this is a symptom of what he suffers from—an impulse—psychotic state—an
irresistible impulse when he neither reasons nor deliberates, (ix) that the
irresistible impulse is both a symptom of the disease of the mind and the
disease itself, (x) that he operates sometimes with normal intellect, sometimes
with a little better than normal intellect and sometimes like a little boy.

An important answer made by Dr. Spaner in
the course of his cross-examination was as follows:

Que. You are unable to say with any degree
of accuracy whether or not the drink of rye—the drink of vodka straight and the
rye and water, aggravated any—what—first of all I would gather you are unable
to say what particular emotional condition he was in at the time.

Ans. No, I just thought he—that the
circumstances that were going on, that it was quite possible that he was
anxiety ridden, panic stricken, under the influence or some catastrophic
disorganization.

[Page 561]

It appears to me that the effect of
Dr. Spaner’s evidence is that, in his opinion, at the time of the shooting
Borg may have been acting under an irresistible impulse such as the Doctor had
described. There is no evidence that Borg himself had that view and the
portions of his statement and of his answers read to the jury far from suggesting
anything in the nature of an impulsive action indicate a careful and deliberate
plan which it took him some hours to carry out. The actions and statements of
Borg after the shooting indicate that he was well aware of what he had done and
that it was wrong. The evidence taken as a whole falls far short of being
sufficient to satisfy the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities which
rests on the defence when insanity is alleged.

The only evidence given on the last day of the
trial was that of Mrs. Hartman followed by that of Dr. Spaner. It
would be fresh in the minds of the jury when they heard the judge’s charge.
That charge in so far as it dealt with the law regarding insanity was clear and
correct. The learned trial judge did not analyze or summarize the evidence of
Mrs. Hartman or that of Dr. Spaner but he did say:

Now in this case I suggest that you can
bear in mind as you weigh the entire evidence in this regard, many things: you
bear in mind, of course, the evidence that was given by the accused’s sister of
his background and life; you bear in mind what we have learned of the man
through the statements, or, to the extent that the statement is before you, and
we bear in mind the evidence that was given by Dr. Spaner. All of those
things together form the evidence that you consider.

* *
*

You weigh in your minds the whole of the
evidence that you have heard because it is your province and your province
alone to conclude whether or not, on a balance of probabilities, the accused
has satisfied you that he was insane within the meaning of the Act that I read
you, and if he has done so, of course, your verdict then would be not guilty
but insane.

It would seem to me, gentlemen, in viewing
the whole of this case, when you retire to consider your verdict, there are
three possible verdicts within the law. One verdict could, of course, be guilty
as charged; he could be found not guilty at all, or he could be found not
guilty because of insanity. Those appear to me to be the only three possible
verdicts.

It is not surprising that the learned and
experienced counsel for the defence did not request the judge to give a further
charge involving a detailed examination of the Doctor’s evidence. Such a
request, if acceded to, would

[Page 562]

have resulted in the judge having to point out
to the jury how far the evidence fell short of indicating that the accused was
other than sane at the time of the shooting.

After considering all the evidence that had any
relevance to the defence of insanity I am satisfied that, in the particular
circumstances of this case, the charge on this branch of the matter, considered
as it must be in the light of all the evidence in the record, was sufficient in
law and more favourable to the accused than it could have been if the judge had
made a detailed analysis of Dr. Spaner’s evidence before the jury.

For these reasons I am, with respect, of opinion
that the Appellate Division should have rejected the ground of appeal on which
it based its judgment and, so far as that ground is concerned, should have
dismissed Borg’s appeal.

This, however, is not the end of the matter.
When the appeal came before the Appellate Division the duty of that Court was
prescribed by subs. 3 of s. 583A  of the Criminal Code  which reads
as follows:

(3) The court of appeal, on an appeal
pursuant to this section, shall

(a) consider any ground of appeal
alleged in the notice of appeal, if any notice has been given, and

(b) consider the record to ascertain
whether there are present any other grounds upon which the conviction ought to
be set aside or the sentence varied, as the case may be.

The Appellate Division having come to the
conclusion that the supposed defects in the charge of the learned trial judge
to the jury relating to the defence of insanity necessitated the quashing of
the conviction and the ordering of a new trial, it became unnecessary for that
Court to consider, and consequently it did not consider, any grounds of appeal
alleged in the Notice of Appeal or which might have been ascertained by a
consideration of the record as required by clause (b), quoted above,
other than the ground on which it decided to allow the appeal.

In these circumstances I have reached the
conclusion that the duty cast upon the Appellate Division by s. 583A(3) 
devolves upon this Court and, while I do not doubt our power to do so, it is my
opinion that it would not be proper for us to refer the matter back to the

[Page 563]

Appellate Division to consider all possible
grounds of appeal other than the one upon which the judgment of that Court was
based.

The question of our power to make a final
disposition of the appeal appears to me to be settled by the decision of this
Court in The Queen v. McKay[3]. In
that case McKay had been convicted before LeBel J. and a jury on the charge
that he and others being armed with offensive weapons did unlawfully assault
one Robson with intent to rob. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed by
a judgment of the majority, Laidlaw and MacKay JJ.A., on the ground of law that
there was no evidence to go to the jury, the conviction was accordingly quashed
and a verdict of acquittal directed; Hogg J.A., dissenting, held that there was
legal evidence against McKay upon which the jury were entitled to find him
guilty. On appeal by the Crown to this Court the majority, Kerwin, Taschereau,
Kellock and Fauteux JJ., held that Hogg J.A. was right in law and that the
appeal should be allowed.

However, McKay in his Notice of Appeal to the
Court of Appeal had asked leave to appeal on questions of fact. The Court of
Appeal after deciding that there was no evidence to go to the jury had not
proceeded to determine whether, even if there was such evidence, the verdict
should be set aside as unreasonable. Kerwin J., as he then was, dissenting in
this regard, was of opinion that the proper order to be made in these
circumstances on an appeal by the Crown (which he differentiated from an appeal
by the accused) was to remit the case to the Court of Appeal in order that it
might, if leave had been given or should be given, pass upon the question as to
whether the verdict was unreasonable in the light of all the evidence. This
view was decisively rejected in the judgment of the other members of the Court
who formed the majority, which was delivered by my brother Fauteux.

After quoting, in abbreviated form, s. 1024 
of the Criminal Code , as then in force, and s. 46 of the Supreme
Court Act as follows:

1024. The Supreme Court of Canada shall
make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of a conviction or for
granting a new trial, or otherwise… as the justice of the case requires.

[Page 564]

46. The Court may… give the judgment… which
the court whose decision is appealed against, should have given…

Fauteux J. examined a number of authorities and
continued, at pp. 6 and 7:

It is true that in each of these cases, the
appeal, contrary to what is the situation in the present instance, was entered
by the accused and not by the Crown. But the suggestion that this difference as
to the person appealing calls for a distinction in law as to the powers of this
Court finds, in my respectful view, no support, either in the enactments
defining them or in the above judicial pronouncements interpreting such
enactments.

* *
*

On an exhaustive review of the evidence, it
does not appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.

In this view, it would not, in my opinion,
be consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of
justice in criminal matters to return this case to the Court of Appeal in order
that it may pass on that question, i.e., whether the verdict is unreasonable,
which this Court is in as good a position as the former to determine.

The power given to this Court by s. 600(1) 
of the Criminal Code , now in force, is at least as wide as that
conferred by s. 1024  above referred to. It reads:

600. (1) The Supreme Court of Canada may,
on an appeal under this Part, make any order that the court of appeal might
have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect to
its judgment.

Having formed the opinion that we have the
necessary authority to make a final disposition of this case and that, to use
the words quoted above, “it would not be consonant with the diligence required
in the proper administration of justice in criminal matters” to do otherwise, I
have not only considered every ground set out in the Notice of Appeal to the
Appellate Division and those referred to in the reasons delivered in that Court
but I have read with care the whole of the record to ascertain whether there
are present any other grounds upon which the conviction ought to be set aside.

As a result, I have reached the conclusion that
the trial was conducted throughout with scrupulous fairness to the accused,
that in its course there was no error in law, that no valid exception could be
taken to the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury and that the verdict
was fully supported by the evidence. I am satisfied that there are no grounds
upon which the conviction ought to be set aside.

[Page 565]

Because there was some discussion in argument as
to the possible application of the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code , which enacts that even where there has been error
in law at the trial the Court of Appeal may dismiss an appeal against a
conviction if of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred, I wish to make it clear that I am not basing my conclusion in any
way upon that clause; there is no need to invoke it.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Appellate Division and restore the verdict at the trial.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J. (dissenting):—The facts are fully
set out in the reasons of my brother the Chief Justice. The only real defence
which was being put forward at the trial on behalf of Borg was that of
insanity. The fact of the killing of the police officer was not in dispute. It
was admitted in Borg’s confession and proved conclusively by the verbal
testimony and that fact was recognized in the reasons of the learned Chief Justice
of Alberta.

With deference to contrary opinion, I would
dismiss the appeal. As I see it, the learned trial judge misdirected the jury
on the defence of insanity in that he failed to instruct them that there was
evidence that Borg was suffering from a disease of the mind, and while an
irresistible impulse was not of itself a defence the evidence that the
irresistible impulse was a manifestation of a disease of the mind was evidence
to be considered by them in the light of Dr. Spaner’s testimony.

I think, too, that the learned trial judge
should have reviewed in part what Dr. Spaner had said and how the law as
to insanity as a defence should be applied to the facts as they found them. The
law in this regard is clear. In Azoulay v. The Queen[4], Taschereau J. (as he then was) said:

On the second point, I agree with the Chief
Justice of the Court of King’s Bench. The rule which has been laid down, and
consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except
in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts
of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may

[Page 566]

appreciate the value and effect of that
evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. (Spencer v. Alaska Parkers, (1905) 35 Can. S.C.R. 362.) As
Kellock J.A. (as he then was) said in Rex v. Stephen et al, (1944) O.R.
339 at 352: “It is not sufficient that the whole evidence be left to the jury in
bulk for valuation.” The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands
must be clearly presented to the jury’s mind. Of course, it is not necessary
that the trial judge should review all the facts, and that his charge be a
minute record of the evidence adduced, but as Rivard, J.A. said in Vincent
v. Regem, Q.R. (1932) 52 K.B. 38 at 46: (Emphasis added)

Il faut admettre que l’adresse du juge est
plutôt brève et que, tant sur les faits que sur les questions de droit, il n’a
dit que l’essentiel, sans développement. Mais la question n’est pas de savoir
si le juge a été court; il faut rechercher plutôt s’il a omis le nécessaire.

Regarding the defence of insanity, the learned
trial judge said to the jury:

Now then, the defence say assuming that all
of this is found to be so as to fact, or a set of facts, that it was in fact
the accused who fired the shot that killed Harvey and that Harvey was a
policeman within the meaning of the section I read you, in the course of his
duty, assuming all those things were found, and that the shot killed him, that
he is not guilty of the charge against him because he was at that time insane.
It is a defence of insanity. Now, I must say to you in that regard that where
the defence places before you a defence of insanity, I must instruct you, as
best I can, of the law that lies behind such defence.

I think I should say to you at the outset
that it is not all forms of insanity which furnish a defence according to law.
It is only that type of insanity which carries with it certain attributes that
will furnish a defence at law, and I refer you immediately to Section 16  of the
Criminal Code  because it is from this section that the law we are about to
consider, comes, and Section 16  says this:

“No person shall be convicted of an offence
in respect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane.”

Section 2:

“For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.”

Then I think I should tell you the
provisions of subsection (3) because they may apply. It says:

“A person who has specific delusions, but
is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or
omission.”

And then subsection (4) of that
section is of extreme importance because it says this:

“Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.”

In other words, when we come to a defence
of insanity, the accused person starts off with a presumption at law that he is
sane, and the obligation rests on him to prove that he is insane within the
meaning of this section, before it will serve him as a defence.

[Page 567]

Now, I told you at the outset that the
Crown was under an obligation to prove all that it must prove, beyond a
reasonable doubt. But when the accused is called upon to establish insanity the
obligation of proof is not that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it is proof
by a preponderance of evidence. In other words, it establishes a set of facts
from which the reasonable probability or the preponderance of probabilities
points towards insanity, and that is to say, insanity within the meaning of
this section, and it is only proof to that extent that the accused is called
upon to establish, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Now, I must tell you that at law a so
called irresistible or uncontrollable impulse of itself is not a defence within
the meaning of this Act unless that uncontrollable or irresistible movement or
impulse stems from the existence of insanity as defined here, and when one
looks to the reasonable rationality of it, it becomes so obvious why it is that
a mere irresistible and uncontrollable impulse is not a defence. Because
everybody would get such impulses with respect to any offence. The man who
breaks a jeweller’s window to steal a diamond, has an irresistible impulse to
do it, and, therefore, is acquitted on the ground of insanity if one is guided
by this mere proposition of irresistible impulse. It must be as this
section says and I repeat it to you:

“For the purpose of this section a person
is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility”

now there is no suggestion of that here—

“or has disease of the mind to an extent
that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or
omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.”

Now in this case I suggest that you can
bear in mind as you weigh the entire evidence in this regard many things: you
bear in mind, of course, the evidence that was given by the accused’s sister of
his background and life; you bear in mind what we have learned of the man
through the statements, or, to the extent that the statement is before you, and
we bear in mind the evidence that was given by Dr. Spaner. All of those
things together form the evidence that you consider.

I explain to you that the evidence of an
expert is merely evidence. Just because an expert says that something is so,
doesn’t mean that it is. The evidence of experts is weighed along with all
other evidence. An expert’s evidence, by a jury or by a Judge, for that matter,
can be accepted in whole or disregarded in whole or accepted in part and
disregarded in part. There is no complete sanctity of evidence because it has
been given by an expert.

But the thing that strikes me as being of
importance to consider, you may not think so, but I think you should bear it in
mind, is that in the statement which the accused gave to the police and to the
extent that it’s before you, he winds up by saying, he speaks of having been
hit by the bullet which the police officer fired at him; he says “It knocked me
to the floor. I then thought what’s the use, I caused enough grief in my life
and then gave myself up.”

This is at least some indication gentlemen,
as to whether or not the mind of the accused was such that he appreciated the nature
and quality of his act and as to whether or not it was wrong, and these things
never are conclusive one direction or another, but it is evidence of some
weight to consider.

You weigh in your minds the whole of the
evidence that you have heard because it is your province and your province
alone to conclude

[Page 568]

whether or not, on a balance of
probabilities, the accused has satisfied you that he was insane within the
meaning of the Act that I read you, and if he has done so, of course, your
verdict then would be not guilty but insane.

As will be seen, his only reference to the
evidence of Dr. Spaner is in the paragraph:

Now in this case I suggest that you can
bear in mind as you weigh the entire evidence in this regard, many things: you
bear in mind, of course, the evidence that was given by the accused’s sister of
his background and life; you bear in mind what we have learned of the man
through the statements, or, to the extent that the statement is before you, and
we bear in mind the evidence that was given by Dr. Spaner. All of
those things together form the evidence that you consider.

(Emphasis added)

There were parts of Dr. Spaner’s evidence
which should have been drawn to the jury’s attention as they related
specifically to whether, when Borg killed Constable Donald Archibald Harvey, he
was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his act or of knowing
that it was wrong. Dr. Spaner had testified in chief as follows:

I felt that Leonard Borg was suffering from
a mental illness, or a disease of the mind which is called a psychopathic
state. There are many types of psychopathic states, and he fits into the
classification of the aggressive, anti-social, impulse ridden type of
personality. Another name for a psychopath is a personality disorder. (Emphasis
added)

* *
*

Q. Now, he has there stated that when the
officers came, he shot one of them. In your opinion how was Borg’s mind
operating at this time? A. Well, in view of what I said at the very beginning,
the impulse to kill can be operating right side by side with the—with the
knowing part of his mind.

Q. Yes, and in your opinion how strong is
this impulse? A. I don’t think that the knowing part played any part at the
moment the impulse comes up. It is swept aside.

Q. Pardon? A. It’s swept aside.

Q. What is swept aside? A. The knowing
part.

Q. The knowing part—? A. Of his mind.

Q. And when you say that, would you clarify
it for us, doctor? A. I mean the impulse is the force that is operating. I
would say to the exclusion of everything else.

Q. In the situation in which he found
himself—and as he has said, he shot one of these men—is he able—. A. I missed a
word there. Is he what?

Q. Is he able—and I’m going to ask you not
to answer until my friend has a chance to say something, if he so wishes—is he
able to resist—I will put it—yes, all right, go ahead. A. Is it all right to
answer?

[Page 569]

MR. MCGURK: IS he able to resist the
impulse?

MR. STEER: Yes.

MR. MCGURK: I have objection.

MR. STEER: Go ahead—with His Lordship’s
permission.

THE COURT: Very good. A. My opinion is that
the force of that impulse cannot be resisted at that moment.

Q. MR. STEER: Now, this irresistible
impulse which you have described, is this a symptom of a disease of the mind,
or is it the disease of the mind itself. A. I would say both.

Q. Pardon? A. Would you mind repeating the
question?

Q. What I am trying to find out is: is this
a symptom, this impulse, is it a symptom of something in Borg’s mind? A. The
answer to that part is yes, it is a symptom of what he suffers from, an
impulse—psychopathic state.

Q. How far had this disease of the mind
that you have described, progressed in Borg at this time? A. Well, I don’t
think there was any—much of anything else operating except the impulse to kill.

Q. How would this impulse that you have
described affect Borg’s mind as to knowing whether he was doing anything wrong?
A. I think I said before, the moral issues of right and wrong are not operating
at—when the impulse is at a certain intensity. That part of the mind is not operating.

Q. Now, had the impulse at this time as far
as Borg is concerned reached that degree of intensity in your opinion, or had
it not? A. Oh, I think by this time it had reached that height.

Q. Intensity? A. Yes.

Q. What is your opinion as to whether Borg
could reason about this act which has been described, or which has been read to
the jury? A. He wasn’t reasoning at all. He was under the influence of this
powerful force, or this irresistible impulse—or if it was, it was so
insignificant that as far as I am concerned, it didn’t play any part.

Q. Now, one other question, doctor: what is
your opinion as to whether the act he has described was a considered act? A.
Does that mean deliberate? That he deliberated?

Q. Yes. A. At the height of the impulse
there is no deliberation.

and on cross-examination:

Q. Doctor, your opinion is that this
irresistible—this impulse which can at its height be absolutely over-powering,
is a symptom of a disease, and not a disease itself? A. It is the most
characteristic symptom of the disease, yes. It is a symptom of a disease.

The learned trial judge’s statement:

Now, I must tell you that at law a so
called irresistible or uncontrollable impulse of itself is not a defence within
the meaning of this Act unless that uncontrollable or irresistible movement or
impulse stems from the existence of insanity as defined here…

although an accurate statement of the law, was
misleading in the context on the case. In order for the defence of

[Page 570]

insanity to be established, the defence must
prove on the balance of probabilities two propositions: (1) that the accused
was suffering from a disease of the mind; and (2) that the disease rendered the
accused incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or knowing
that the act is wrong. When an accused pleads insanity there is a sense in
which it is true to say that irresistible impulse of itself is not a defence.
However, there are two senses in which it is not true to say that irresistible
impulse of itself is not a defence.

There is no legal presumption of insanity merely
from the existence of an irresistible impulse. If an accused presents no
medical evidence of disease of the mind but merely pleads that he was acting
under an irresistible impulse, a jury is not entitled to infer that the man was
insane. In that sense irresistible impulse is not of itself a defence. However,
if there is medical evidence of disease of the mind as there was here and yet
the only symptoms of that disease of the mind are irresistible impulses, the jury
may conclude that the accused is insane. This specific point was dealt with by
Lord Tucker in Attorney-General for South Australia v. Brown[5], when, speaking for their Lordships of the
Privy Council, he said at pp. 449-450:

Their Lordships must not, of course, be
understood to suggest that in a case where evidence has been given (and it is
difficult to imagine a case where such evidence would be other than medical
evidence) that irresistible impulse is a symptom of the particular disease of
the mind from which a prisoner is said to be suffering and as to its effect on
his ability to know the nature and quality of his act or that his act is wrong
it would not be the duty of the judge to deal with the matter in the same way
as any other relevant evidence given at the trial.

In that sense irresistible impulse is of itself
evidence of a disease of the mind.

The evidence of irresistible impulse is also
relevant to the issue of whether the accused is capable of appreciating the
nature and quality of the act. It is not so relevant in England. The reason for
the difference is that there is a difference between the definition of the
defence of insanity in s. 16 of the Canadian Criminal Code and the
State-

[Page 571]

ment of the defence according to M’Naghten’s case[6]. In M’Naghten’s case the judges said
that a man could not be held to be insane unless he did not know the nature and
quality of the act he was doing. Section 16 of the Canadian Criminal Code states
that a man cannot be held to be insane unless he did not appreciate the nature
and quality of the act he was doing. A man operating under an irresistible
impulse may have knowledge of the nature and quality of his act without
appreciating its nature and quality. A man may be aware of an act without
foreseeing and measuring its consequences. That is what Dr. Spaner
testified to here when he said: “I think I said before, the moral issues of
right and wrong are not operating at—when the impulse is at a certain
intensity. That part of the mind is not operating.”

Although what the learned trial judge said as
previously quoted was good law, it was irrelevant law in context. There was no
question of the jury concluding that Borg was insane simply because there was
evidence that he acted under an irresistible impulse because there was medical
evidence that Borg was suffering from a disease of the mind, and in failing to
point out to the jury that the theory of the defence was that Borg had a
disease of the mind and that the irresistible impulse was the manifestation of
that disease, he failed to put the theory of the defence adequately to the
jury.

The Chief Justice, being of the view that there
was no error in law and that no valid exception could be taken to the charge of
the learned trial judge to the jury, saw no need to invoke s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  which authorizes that even when there has been an
error in law at the trial, the Court of Appeal (and this Court has the same
power) to dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that a ground of appeal may be
decided in favour of the appellant, it is of opinion that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice has occurred. Having come to the conclusion that
there was in this case an error in law, I should consider the provision of that
section. I am of opinion that

[Page 572]

the section should not be invoked here. I
agree with Spence J. in Colpitis v. The Queen[7], where he said at 756:

I am of the opinion that this Court cannot
place itself in the position of a jury and weigh these various pieces of
evidence. If there is any possibility that twelve reasonable men, properly
charged, would have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then
this Court should not apply the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) to
affirm a conviction.

There is a further and separate issue which
arises in this appeal and it is as to the power of this Court to make a final
disposition of the appeal notwithstanding that the Appellate Division did not
consider any grounds other than those set out in the reasons of the learned
Chief Justice of Alberta. On this aspect of the appeal, I am fully in agreement
with the Chief Justice that this Court has the jurisdiction to do what the
Appellate Division was required to do by subs. (3) of s. 583A  of the Criminal
Code . My consideration of the record brought me to the conclusion that
there was error in the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury, but I have no
doubt as to this Court’s power under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act to
render the judgment which the Appellate Division could or should have given.

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal and
confirm the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
granting the appellant a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Motor vehicles—Dangerous
driving—Charge to jury—Section of Code read and paraphrased—Must jury be
told that advertent negligence necessary—Effect of previous judgments of
Supreme Court of Canada—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 221(4),
597(l)(a).

The appellant was convicted by a jury of
dangerous driving. The conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in the
Court of Appeal. An appeal was taken to this Court where it was argued that the
directions of the trial judge as to the nature of the offence were inadequate
and that it should have been made clear to the jury that the offence involved
an element of advertent as opposed to inadvertent negligence. The trial judge
simply read and paraphrased s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code .

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The charge was adequate and correct.
Section 221(4)  is straightforward and free of ambiguity. It contains its
own definition of dangerous driving. It was not necessary to instruct the jury
as to the difference between “advertent” and “inadvertent” negligence. The
decision of this Court in Binus v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 594, in
which the opinion was expressed that Mann v. The Queen, [1966] S.C.R.
238, had decided that proof of inadvertent negligence was not sufficient to
support a conviction under s. 221(4) , and that it was necessary to instruct the

[Page 906]

jury to this effect, was not binding as that
opinion was not a necessary step to the judgment pronounced. The Mann case
was concerned with constitutional law. The issue in the present case was as to
the instruction to be put to a jury. There is nothing in the Mann case
which would require the Court, when explaining to the jury the nature of the
offence charged, to do so in terms other than those contained in the
section itself. Parliament has defined the kind of conduct which shall constitute
an offence under that subsection, and this Court, in the Mann case, has
said that such definition is not to be construed as creating a crime of
inadvertent negligence.

Per Pigeon and
Ritchie JJ.: The instructions were sufficient. The actual decision in Mann
v. The Queen was essentially that the offence requires mens rea and
therefore differs in nature from statutory offences aimed at specific acts
irrespective of intention. The majority opinion in Binus v. The Queen that
the jury must be instructed that dangerous driving by inadvertence is not
contemplated by the section, is not binding as that case was decided on
application of s. 592(1) (b) (iii). Only such instructions need be given
as the case being tried actually requires. Although mens rea is always
required on the charge, it is only in exceptional circumstances that the jury
need instructions in this connection. In most cases the fact itself is
sufficient proof of the intention. In this case there was no suggestion of a
circumstance from which the jury might infer that the accused’s manner of
driving was inadvertently dangerous. The only question therefore was whether
the driving was actually dangerous within the meaning of the section. Such
being the case, it was not necessary to instruct the jury that the accused
should not be found guilty if the accident had occurred by his inadvertence.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: Assuming that, on a strict
application of the principle of stare decisis, Binus v. The Queen is not
a binding authority as to the manner in which a judge must instruct a jury on a
charge under s. 221(4) , the combined effect of the judgments of this Court in O’Grady
v. Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804, and Mann v. The Queen, [1966] S.C.R.
238, is to decide that s. 221(4)  does not render “inadvertent negligence” a
crime. The enunciation of that legal proposition was a necessary step to the
judgment pronounced in both cases. Although this Court has power to depart from
the ratio decidendi of both of these cases, there was no ground
sufficient to warrant the refusal to follow them. Such a course could result in
the re-opening of the question of the constitutional validity of the provincial
statutory provisions considered in O’Grady and Mann. So long as
it is the law that a necessary ingredient of the offence of dangerous driving
is “advertent negligence” it is essential that the trial judge should so
instruct the jury in all cases in which on the evidence they might properly
find that the conduct of the accused, while dangerous in fact, did not involve
“advertent negligence”. On the evidence in this case, a properly instructed
jury might well have either convicted or acquitted the appellant.

L’appelant a été déclaré coupable par un jury
d’avoir conduit d’une façon dangereuse. La déclaration de culpabilité a été
confirmée en Cour d’appel par un jugement majoritaire. Sur appel à cette Cour,
l’appelant a prétendu que les directives du juge concernant la nature de
l’infraction avaient été inadéquates et que le juge aurait dû expliquer
clairement au jury que l’infraction contenait un élément de négligence
intentionnelle par opposition à la négligence par inadvertance. Le juge au
procès s’est contenté de lire et de paraphraser l’art. 221(4)  du Code
criminel .

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence étant
dissidents.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: Les directives étaient adéquates
et correctes. L’article 221(4)  est simple et sans ambiguïté. Il contient sa
propre définition de la conduite dangereuse. Il n’était pas nécessaire que le
juge donne des directives sur la différence entre la négligence intentionnelle
et la négligence par inadvertance. L’arrêt de cette Cour dans Binus c. The
Queen, [1967] R.C.S. 594, où l’on exprime l’opinion que Mann c. The
Queen, [1966] R.C.S. 238, avait décidé que, pour obtenir une déclaration de
culpabilité sous l’art. 221(4) , une preuve de négligence par inadvertance n’est
pas suffisante et qu’il est nécessaire de donner des directives à cet effet au
jury, n’est pas un précédent obligatoire parce que cette opinion n’est pas un
élément essentiel du jugement prononcé. Dans l’arrêt Mann, il s’agissait
d’une question de droit constitutionnel. Dans le cas présent, il s’agit des
directives qui doivent être données au jury. Il n’y a rien dans l’arrêt Mann
qui exige que la Cour explique au jury la nature de l’infraction en des
termes autres que ceux de l’article lui-même. Le Parlement a donné une définition
du genre de conduite qui constitue une infraction en vertu de l’alinéa 4, et
cette Cour, dans l’arrêt Mann, a dit qu’une telle définition ne doit pas
être interprétée comme faisant un crime de la négligence par inadvertance.

Les Juges
Pigeon et Ritchie: Les directives étaient suffisantes. L’essence de l’arrêt Mann
c. The Queen est que l’infraction créée par l’alinéa 4 exige la mens rea
et que par conséquent elle diffère par nature des infractions statutaires
visant des actes spécifiques sans égard à l’intention. L’opinion majoritaire
dans Binus c. The Queen que les directives doivent spécifier que la
conduite dangereuse par inattention n’est pas visée par l’article, ne constitue
pas un précédent obligatoire parce que cette affaire a été décidée par application
de l’art. 592(1) (b) (iii). Seules les directives actuellement requises
pour les fins du procès doivent être données. Quoique la mens rea soit
toujours requise sur une inculpation de conduite dangereuse, ce n’est que dans
des circonstances exceptionnelles que des directives à cet égard doivent être
données. Dans la plupart des cas le fait lui-même fait preuve de l’intention.
Dans le cas présent, on ne suggère aucune circonstance de laquelle le jury
pourrait conclure que la manière de conduire de l’accusé était dangereuse par
inadvertance. La seule question est donc de savoir si la conduite était
réellement dangereuse dans le sens de l’article. Tel étant le cas, il n’était
pas nécessaire que le juge donne des directives que l’accusé ne devait pas être
déclaré coupable si l’accident s’était produit par inadvertance.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: Prenant pour
acquis qu’en vertu de l’application stricte du principe de stare decisis, l’arrêt
Binus c. The Queen n’est pas un précédent

[Page 908]

obligatoire au sujet des directives qu’un
juge doit donner au jury sur une accusation en vertu de l’art. 221(4) , l’effet
combiné des arrêts de cette Cour dans O’Grady c. Sparling, [1960] R.C.S.
804, et Mann c. The Queen, [1966] R.C.S. 238, est de décider que l’art.
221(4)  ne fait pas un crime de la négligence par inadvertance. L’énoncé de
cette proposition est un élément essentiel du jugement prononcé dans les deux
causes. Quoique cette Cour ait le pouvoir de s’écarter de la ratio decidendi
de ces deux causes, il n’y a aucun motif suffisant pour justifier le refus
de s’y conformer. Une telle ligne de conduite pourrait avoir comme résultat de
remettre en question la validité constitutionnelle des dispositions
législatives provinciales considérées dans O’Grady et Mann. Tant
que la loi est à l’effet que la négligence intentionnelle est un élément
nécessaire de l’infraction de conduite dangereuse, il est essentiel que le juge
au procès donne des directives dans ce sens dans tous les cas où les jurés
peuvent conclure de la preuve que la conduite de l’accusé, quoique dangereuse
en fait, ne comporte pas un élément de négligence intentionnelle. Dans le cas
présent, un jury ayant reçu des directives adéquates aurait pu tout aussi bien
acquitter l’appelant que le déclarer coupable.

APPEL d’un jugement majoritaire de la Cour
d’appel de l’Ontario[1], confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel rejeté, le Juge
en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence étant dissidents.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the appellant’s conviction. Appeal
dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence J.J. dissenting.

J.C. Eberle, Q.C., for the appellant.

M. Manning, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Hall and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—This is
an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1
pronounced on June 20, 1968, dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the
appellant of the offence of dangerous driving.

The appeal is brought, pursuant to s. 597(1)  (a)
of the Criminal Code , on the questions of law on which Laskin J.A.
dissented in the Court of Appeal.

The appellant was tried before His Honour Judge
Martin and a jury on an indictment containing two counts (i)

[Page 909]

driving a motor vehicle while his ability to
drive was impaired by alcohol (contrary to s. 223 of the Code) and (ii)
dangerous driving (contrary to s. 221(4) ). The wording of these counts is set
out in full in the reasons of my brother Judson. The appellant was acquitted on
the first count and found guilty on the second.

Both charges arose out of the same occurrence.
The facts are summarized as follows in the reasons of McLennan J.A.:

The events giving rise to the two counts
occurred about 6:30 a.m. on
June 29, 1967. It was raining at the time. The appellant was driving his
taxi-cab easterly on the exit lane from the Gardiner Expressway which runs into
Lakeshore Boulevard. Between
the exit lane and the southerly lane of Lakeshore
 Boulevard is a narrow strip separating the two lanes.
This dividing strip is some inches higher than the level of the exit lane and Lakeshore Boulevard. The two eastbound
lanes are separated from the westbound lanes by a median the level of which is higher
than the highway.

The case for the Crown, on the count of
dangerous driving was that the appellant drove his car from the exit lane,
across the dividing strip, then across the two eastbound lanes on Lakeshore
Boulevard and over the median striking a car being driven westerly on the north
side of Lakeshore Boulevard. There is no direct evidence as to the speed at
which the appellant was driving but there was evidence from which it might be
inferred that the speed was high, the strongest being what happened to the
appellant’s car in leaving the exit lane.

The appellant gave evidence stating that as
he was driving down the exit lane the driver of a car ahead of him, who he said
had been driving quite erratically just before the accident, suddenly applied
his brakes and he remembers nothing until after the accident occurred. A
passenger in his car, a friend of the appellant, gave the same evidence. He,
likewise, remembered nothing after seeing the brake lights of the car ahead
illuminate suddenly.

There was conflicting evidence as to whether or
not the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.

In answer to a question from the Bench counsel
stated that the record does not show what is the maximum rate of speed
permitted by law at the point where the appellant’s vehicle went out of
control.

McLennan J.A. who delivered the main reasons of
the majority in the Court of Appeal was of the view that had the appellant
offered no evidence the facts summarized above would have constituted
sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify a conviction of dangerous
driving, that it followed from the verdict of guilty that the jury must have
rejected the appellant’s defence, which was that the real cause of the course
which his car took was that the sudden application of the brakes by the driver
of the car ahead

[Page 910]

caused the appellant to lose control, or,
alternatively, that the jury must have taken the view that the speed at which
the appellant was driving was the cause of the accident.

MacKay J.A. agreed with the reasons of McLennan
J.A. and added that the explanation offered by the appellant having been
rejected by the jury, “there was only one rational conclusion to be reached on
the evidence—that is that the admittedly dangerous manner in which the accused’s
car was driven was due to the advertent negligence on the part of the accused”.

The majority examined and rejected the grounds
on which Laskin J.A. would have allowed the appeal.

The first ground on which Laskin J.A. proceeded
was that this Court has decided in Binus v. The Queen[2] that proof of inadvertent negligence is not
sufficient to support a conviction of dangerous driving under s. 221(4)  of the Criminal
Code  and, that being so, the charge of the learned trial Judge in the case
at bar was inadequate. He concluded his reasons on this point as follows:

…If advertent negligence is the test I do
not see how it can suffice to direct the jury merely in the words of the
Statute without additional elaboration. In these circumstances, and having
regard to the other facts detailed here as to the course of the trial, I am
unable to say that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
of my brother Judson and, for the purposes of this appeal, am prepared to
assume that, on a strict application of the principle of stare decisis,
Binus is not a binding authority as to the manner in which a judge must
instruct a jury on the trial of a charge under s. 221(4) . It appears to me,
however, that the combined effect of the judgments of this Court in O’Grady
v. Sparling[3] and Mann
v. The Queen[4] is to
decide that s. 221 (4)  does not render “inadvertent negligence” a crime.

O’Grady was
decided prior to the enactment of s. 221(4) . My brother Judson, giving the judgment
of seven Members of the Court, said at p. 809:

What the Parliament of Canada has done is
to define ‘advertent negligence’ as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has
not touched

[Page 911]

‘inadvertent negligence”. Inadvertent
negligence is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the
regulation of highway traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament
chooses to define it in the Criminal Code  as ‘crime’, it is not crime.

Mann’s case arose
after the enactment of s. 221(4)  and it was sought to distinguish O’Grady on
the ground that by s. 221(4)  Parliament had made inadvertent negligence a
crime. Of the seven Judges who sat in Mann’s case five decided that s.
221 (4)  did not create a crime of “inadvertent negligence”. It is sufficient to
quote a sentence from the judgment of Ritchie J., concurred in by
Martland and Judson JJ.; he said at pp. 250 and 251:

I have had the advantage of reading the
reasons for judgment of my brothers Cartwright and Spence and I agree with them
that this appeal should be dismissed and that the provisions of s. 221(4)  of
the Criminal Code  are not to be construed as creating a crime of
‘inadvertent negligence’.

The other two judges who sat in Mann’s case
did not find it necessary to express an opinion on this question.

It is quite true that in both O’Grady and
Mann the question to be decided was whether a section of a provincial
Highway Traffic Act was effective, but the conclusion appears to me to be
inescapable that the decision that Parliament has not defined “inadvertent
negligence” as a crime was the enunciation of a legal proposition which was a
necessary step to the judgment pronounced in each case. It follows that unless
we are prepared to depart from the ratio decidendi of both of these
cases we cannot say that s. 221(4)  has created a crime of “dangerous driving”
where the manner of driving is in fact dangerous but the conduct of the accused
does not amount to “advertent negligence” (as that expression was used in O’Grady
and in Mann).

As I said in Binus, with the concurrence
of Ritchie and Spence JJ., I do not doubt the power of this Court to depart
from previous judgments of its own; but I can find no ground sufficient to
warrant our refusing to follow the carefully considered judgments of this Court
in O’Grady and in Mann on the point now under consideration and
to say that a person can be convicted on a charge under s. 221(4)  when his
conduct amounted to “inadvertent” but not to “advertent” negligence. If this
Court should take that course the result might well be to make possible the

[Page 912]

re-opening of the question of the constitutional
validity of those provincial statutory provisions considered in O’Grady and
in Mann which make “careless driving” a punishable offence. It must not
be forgotten that in the two last mentioned cases we had the advantage of
hearing full argument not only from counsel for the parties but also from
counsel for the Attorney‑General of Canada and for the Attorneys-General
of several of the Provinces.

So long as it is the law that a necessary
ingredient of the offence of dangerous driving is “advertent negligence” it is
essential that the trial judge should so instruct the jury in all cases in
which on the evidence they might properly find that the conduct of the accused,
while dangerous in fact, did not involve “advertent negligence”. I do not mean
by this that the judge should employ the adjectives “inadvertent” and
“advertent”; but he must, in my view, bring home to the jury that in order to
convict they must be satisfied that there was “negligence of sufficient gravity
to lift the case out of the civil field into that of the Criminal Code ...something
more than mere inadvertence or mere thoughtlessness or mere negligence or mere
error of judgment” that there was on the part of the accused “knowledge or
willful disregard of the probable consequences or a deliberate failure to take
reasonable precautions”. I have taken the words in quotation marks from the
judgment of Casey J. in Loiselle v. The Queen[5], The passage in which they occur was quoted
in Mann v. The Queen, supra, at p. 245, and I remain of the opinion that
I there expressed that Casey J. has stated the law accurately.

No doubt there may be cases where evidence of
the manner in which an accused did in fact drive may, in the absence of an
acceptable explanation, be sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that his
conduct involved “advertent negligence”. The judgment of Laskin J.A. on this
first ground does not proceed on the basis that there was not evidence on which
it was open to the jury to convict but on the view that in this respect the
charge of the learned trial Judge was insufficient.

Since writing the above I have had the advantage
of reading the reasons of my brother Pigeon. I agree with what

[Page 913]

he says in his analysis of the judgments of this
Court in O’Grady and in Mann and with his conclusion that in
those cases:

The actual decision was essentially that
the offence created by subsection 4 (of section 221) requires mens
rea and therefore differs in nature from statutory offences aimed at
specific acts irrespective of intention.

The reason that I differ from his view as to how
this first ground of appeal should be disposed of is that, in my opinion, on
the evidence in this case a properly instructed jury might well have either
convicted or acquitted the appellant.

As I agree with Laskin J.A. that this appeal
should be allowed on the first ground with which he has dealt, it becomes
unnecessary to examine the other grounds on which he based his decision, but I
wish to say a few words about them.

Laskin J.A. described these grounds as follows:

Second, whether in view of the single trial
on two charges arising out of the same facts the trial judge adequately
separated the issues relating to each charge so as to leave the jury with a
clear understanding of the relevant law; and, third, whether the acquittal of
the accused on the impaired driving charge resulted in an inconsistent verdict
of guilty of dangerous driving in the light of the charge which was in fact
delivered.

While these two grounds raise questions of law
their decision is, of course, closely related to the manner in which this
particular case was presented and to the charge to the jury which was in fact
delivered.

Where both charges arise out of the same
occurrence, the acquittal of an accused on a charge of driving while impaired
and his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving do not necessarily involve
any inconsistency for a person may be perfectly sober and yet drive dangerously.
But when the learned trial Judge had said to the jury in the passage quoted by
both McLennan J.A. and Laskin J.A.:

Now, did the accident happen as the accused
man has related, that is, that he was forced to apply his brakes suddenly by
the sudden stoppage of the car in front of him? Or did the accident happen, did
the accused’s car go out of control—and in my opinion the car was completely
out of control—or did this car go out of control because the accused was
impaired by alcohol and was not in possession of his proper faculties necessary
to keep the car under control? As I see it, that is the question which you have
to decide and which is entirely a matter for you to do so.

it appears to me that it was necessary for him
to tell them that if they found that the ability of the accused to drive

[Page 914]

was not impaired by alcohol they could not
convict of dangerous driving unless the evidence other than that led to show
impairment satisfied them of the guilt of the accused.

With the greatest respect I disagree with the
following statement of McLennan J.A.:

…In any event, a verdict of acquittal does
not mean that there was no impairment—it means only that the Crown has not
established impairment to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable
doubt.

The law in this regard is, in my opinion,
correctly stated by Lord MacDermott giving the judgment of the Judicial
Committee in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor Federation of Malaya[6], where he said:

The effect of a verdict of acquittal
pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is
not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again
for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and
conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the
adjudication. The maxim ‘Res judicata pro veritate accipitur’ is no less
applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having
been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his
possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict
and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And
the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it
might be relevant in his defence.

On the following page Lord MacDermott makes it
clear that the result of an accused having been found not guilty of an offence
is that he is to be taken to be “entirely innocent of that offence”.

If in the case at bar there should be a new
trial on the charge of dangerous driving, the Crown would be precluded from
taking any step to suggest that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by
alcohol and the accused would be entitled to have the jury instructed that they
must take it as conclusively established that, at the relevant time, his
ability to drive was not so impaired. This principle is not altered, although
its application is to some extent complicated, by the circumstance that the two
counts were tried together and were both left to the jury at the same time. I
agree with what I understand from their reasons to be the view of all the
Members of the Court of Appeal that in the case at bar the counts should have
been dealt with separately.

[Page 915]

However, I base my conclusion that the conviction
cannot stand on the first ground upon which Laskin J.A. proceeded.

For the above reasons I would allow the appeal
and quash the conviction. As the view of the majority is that the appeal fails
it is unnecessary for me to consider what further order should have been made
if the appeal had proved successful.

Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.
concurred with the judgment delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant was indicted on two
counts, which read as follows:

1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen
present that Bruno Peda on or about the 29th day of June in the
year 1967 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, while his ability to drive
a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, drove a motor vehicle,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

2. The said jurors further present that
Bruno Peda on or about the 29th day of June in the year 1967 at the
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, drove a motor
vehicle on a street highway or other public place, to wit: The Frederick
Gardiner Expressway and Lakeshore Boulevard at approximately 6:40 a.m., in a
manner that was dangerous to the public to wit: by driving in the wrong lanes,
having regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of
such place and the amount of traffic that at that time was or might reasonably
have been expected to be on such place, contrary to the Criminal Code .

He was tried before a judge and jury. The jury
acquitted him on the impaired driving count but convicted him on the dangerous
driving count. He was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. On appeal[7] his conviction was affirmed by a majority,
with Laskin J.A. dissenting. He now appeals to this Court and although his
appeal was based on a number of grounds, in my view the only one of any
substance is the contention that the jury were not properly instructed on the
meaning of s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code . He contends that the direction of
the trial judge was inadequate with respect to the elements which constitute
the charge of dangerous driving and that it should have been made clear that
the charge involved an element of advertent as opposed merely to inadvertent,
negligence in accordance with what was said by the majority of this Court in Binus
v. The Queen[8].

[Page 916]

The extent of the direction of the trial judge
on this point was to read s. 221(4)  to the jury and then to paraphrase it in
the following words:

So, briefly, it is driving a car on a
street, road, highway or other place in a manner that is dangerous to the
public, and again, gentlemen, there is really no ambiguity in that language, it
is a matter which you will have to decide: was the manner in which the accused
drove the car, under the circumstances which have been related to you was it
dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances?

In my opinion this is adequate and correct. The
section is straightforward and free of ambiguity. As I pointed out in Binus
v. The Queen, it contains its own definition of dangerous driving. The essence
of the offence is the manner or character of the accused’s driving, and the
section instructs the jury to determine whether he was in fact driving in
a manner which was dangerous to the public having regard to all the
circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of such place and the
amount of traffic that at the time was or might reasonably be expected to be at
such place. Their task is to determine the actual behaviour of the driver in
the light of the section and while this will necessarily entail some
consideration of the state of mind of the driver, as a car does not drive
itself, it does not mean that the jury must find that a given state of mind
exists before they can convict. This was the judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Binus v. The Queen[9], and,
as I stated in the same case in this Court, I think that it is the correct one.

The decision of this Court in Binus v. The
Queen is not a binding authority so as to prevent this conclusion being
reached. The accused, in that case, appealed from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario from a
conviction for dangerous driving, under s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code . The
appeal was heard by a Court of five members and was dismissed by unanimous
decision. Three of the five members of the Court did express an opinion which
apparently differs from that which is expressed above, to the extent that they
were of the opinion that Mann v. The Queen[10] had decided that proof of inadvertent
negligence was not sufficient to support a conviction under s. 221(4) , and that
it was necessary to instruct the jury to this effect.

[Page 917]

Nevertheless, Cartwright J., as he then was, who
delivered the reasons of these three members, went on to say, at p. 602:

On the view of the meaning of s. 221(4) of
the Code which I have expressed above, I incline to think that the instruction
given by the learned trial Judge when the jury were re‑called, and
particularly the passages which I have italicized, was adequate in the
circumstances of this case. Be that as it may, on consideration of all the
record I agree with the conclusion of Laskin J.A. that this was a proper case
in which to apply the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal
Code .

It is apparent, therefore, that the opinion
expressed as to the effect of Mann v. The Queen was not a necessary step
to the judgment pronounced, and is not binding.

Mann v. The Queen was a judgment of this Court as to the constitutional validity of s.
60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, which defined the offence of careless
driving. It was held, unanimously, that this section was validly enacted.

The issue was whether this section was in
conflict with s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code , which was not in existence
when the earlier case of O’Grady v. Sparling[11] was decided, and which had affirmed the
constitutional validity of s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954,
c. 112, which created in that province the offence of driving without due care
and attention.

In the O’Grady case, it had been said, at
p. 809:

What the Parliament of Canada has done is
to define “advertent negligence” as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has
not touched “inadvertent negligence.” Inadvertent negligence is dealt with
under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway
traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament chooses to define it
in the Criminal Code  as “crime”, it is not crime.

The contention in the Mann case was that
by s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code , Parliament had defined “inadvertent
negligence” as a crime.

Cartwright J., with whom Spence J. concurred,
held that Parliament had not defined “inadvertent negligence” as a crime, and
that the case was indistinguishable from the O’Grady case.

Fauteux J., with whom Abbott and Judson JJ.
concurred, held that the provisions of s. 221 (4) of the Criminal

[Page 918]

Code and of s. 60
of the Highway Traffic Act differed in legislative purpose and in legal
and practical effect. The provincial enactment imposed a duty to serve bona
fide ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicted with the federal
enactment. There were no obstacles to prevent both enactments living together
and operating concurrently.

Ritchie J., with whom Martland and Judson JJ.
concurred, said that s. 221(4)  was not to be construed as creating a crime of
“inadvertent negligence”. He went on to say:

The purpose and effect of s. 221(4)  is to
make it a criminal offence for anyone to drive to the public danger but,
notwithstanding the careful argument to the contrary addressed to us on behalf
of the Attorney General of Canada, I am satisfied that there is a type of
careless and inconsiderate driving which falls short of being “dangerous”
within the meaning of that section and that the purpose of s. 60 of the Highway
Traffic Act is to provide appropriate sanctions for the regulation and
control of such driving in the interests of the lawful users of the highways of
Ontario.

This case was concerned with the
constitutionality of the provision in the provincial statute. It was held that
it was not in conflict with s. 221(4) . In the reasons of Cartwright J. and of
Ritchie J. it was held that s. 221(4)  did not define a crime of “inadvertent
negligence”.

The issue in the present case is as to the
proper instruction to be put to a jury in a case involving a charge under s.
221(4) . It being accepted that that subsection, as framed, does not create a
crime of “inadvertent negligence”, there is nothing in the Mann case
which would require the Court, when explaining to the jury the nature of the
offence charged, to do so in terms other than those contained in the
section itself. Parliament has defined the kind of conduct which shall
constitute an offence under that subsection, and this Court, in the Mann case,
has said that such definition is not to be construed as creating a crime of
“inadvertent negligence”. In my opinion, therefore, in this case, the charge to
the jury, in the terms of the subsection, was adequate and correct, and it is
not necessary, as the appellant contends, for the trial judge to instruct the
jury as to the difference between “advertent” and “inadvertent” negligence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 919]

Ritchie J. concurred with the judgment delivered
by

PIGEON J.:—The appellant was convicted of
“dangerous driving”. The conviction was affirmed with a dissent in the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[12] and
the main question of substance raised on the appeal to this Court is the
adequacy of the judge’s instructions to the jury concerning the nature of the
offence. He simply read and paraphrased subs. 4 of s. 221  of the Criminal
Code  without telling them that this did not make inadvertent negligence a
crime as this Court has said in Mann v. The Queen[13]. I agree with Judson J. that those
instructions were sufficient in this case and I wish to add the following
observations.

Prior to the enactment of subs. 4 of s. 221  this
Court, in O’Grady v. Sparling[14], dealt
with subs. 1 of the same section, that makes it an offence to be “criminally
negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle”, that is, by virtue of s.
191(1), to drive with “wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
other persons”. Judson J. speaking for the majority of the Court, after stating
(at p. 808) that between “criminal negligence” thus defined and negligence as
contemplated in the enactments of regulatory authorities there is “a difference
in kind and not merely one of degree”, adopted as part of his reasons J.W.C.
Turner’s statement of this difference (Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed.,
p. 34) in which he says:

There are only two states of mind which
constitute mens rea, and they are intention and recklessness.

Therefore the essential basis on which
subsection 1 was held to be aimed at a kind of negligence different from
the negligence contemplated in the enactments of regulatory authorities is that
“criminal negligence” requires mens rea. It follows, of course, that
inadvertent negligence is not criminal. Because negligence in the usual
language includes both advertent and inadvertent negligence, it is obvious that
in charging a jury on an indictment for “criminal negligence” a judge must in
some way explain adequately the kind of negligence that is criminal and make it
clear,

[Page 920]

but not necessarily in those words, that inadvertent
negligence is not criminal. It may well be that he can do it by using the
language of s. 191(1), seeing that “wanton or reckless” undoubtedly exclude
mere inadvertence.

When in Mann v. The Queen this Court had
subsequently to consider subs. 4 making “dangerous driving” a lesser offence,
the question arose whether inadvertent negligence consisting in dangerous
driving had thereby been made a crime. Following the principle established in Beaver
v. The Queen[15] and The
Queen v. King[16] it
was, in effect, decided that mens rea was an element of the offence of
“dangerous driving” as of other criminal offences generally. This was expressed
by Cartwright J. (as he then was) by saying (at p. 246) “that in enacting s.
221(4)  Parliament had not defined ‘inadvertent negligence’ as a crime” and by
Ritchie J. (at p. 251) by saying similarly that “the provisions of s. 221(4)  of
the Criminal Code ” are not to be construed as creating a crime of
“inadvertent negligence”.

In the context of a decision respecting the
constitutional validity of provincial enactments with which subs. 4 was alleged
to be in conflict, this mode of expression was, it appears to me, perfectly
appropriate. However, because “a case is only an authority for what it actually
decides”, one should not read what was thus written as if it was an enactment
but ascertain what was actually decided. It seems clear that the actual
decision was essentially that the offence created by subs. 4 requires mens
rea and therefore differs in nature from statutory offences aimed at
specific acts irrespective of intention.

This construction, it should be noted, does not
deprive subs. 4 of its effect. By virtue of s. 191(1), a conviction for
“criminal negligence” requires “wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons”. As against that, subs. 4 contemplates danger to other
persons only. There is, therefore, ample room for distinction between the two
offences even excluding inadvertence from the lesser.

However, wantonness and recklessness of
themselves clearly imply the exclusion of mere inadvertence while “dangerous
driving” does not necessarily. Does this mean that in a jury trial on that
latter charge the judge must

[Page 921]

necessarily instruct the jurors that dangerous
driving by inadvertence is not contemplated? A majority of the members of this
Court sitting in Binus v. The Queen[17]
expressed that opinion, however as the case was decided by application of s.
592(1)  (b) (iii), this is not binding. With great deference to them, I
must disagree because only such instructions need be given as the case being
tried actually requires. Although mens rea is always required, it is
only in exceptional circumstances that the jury need instructions in this
connection. In most cases the fact itself is sufficient proof of the intention.
It is only when a question arises as to the existence of this element of the
offence that the jury need be bothered with it.

Therefore, in my view, the practical question is
whether, in the circumstances of this case, there was something from which the
jury might reasonably have concluded that, although objectively considered the
accused’s driving was “dangerous”, it could be unconsciously so or be
attributable to inadvertence. The only fact from which such an inference might
be considered possible in this case is the sudden braking of the car ahead on
the exit ramp, assuming accused’s story of how the accident occurred was
believed by the jury. Bearing in mind that the accused admitted being aware of
the presence of the car ahead, his loss of control of his own car could not
possibly be considered the normal result of a sudden application of the brakes
by the other car. This result could only obtain if he was driving dangerously.
When one is not driving dangerously, he does not lose control of his car
because the driver of the car ahead suddenly puts on the brakes especially on
an exit ramp where this is to be anticipated.

I fail to see in the present case any suggestion
of a circumstance from which the jury might infer that the accused’s manner of
driving was inadvertently dangerous. If he had bumped into the car ahead and
said that he had failed to notice that the latter was stopping, a question
would have arisen whether this was inadvertent. It might equally have been so
if he had said that he had not immediately noticed the braking action due to
momentary inattention. Nothing of the kind was suggested and therefore, the
only question was whether the driving was

[Page 922]

actually dangerous within the meaning of the
section. Such being the case, it was not necessary for the judge to instruct
the jury that the accused should not be found guilty if the accident had
occurred by his inadvertence. There was nothing to suggest that the ordinary
rule ought not to be applied, namely that one must be deemed to intend to do
what he is actually doing.

Although this may not be strictly necessary, I
wish to add that, in my opinion, it would not be desirable when there is a need
for instructions on the question of intention, to do it by saying that subsection 4
is not aimed at inadvertent negligence. While this wording was entirely
appropriate in the context of the constitutional question that was decided in
the Mann case, I feel it should be avoided in addressing a jury. My
reason for this is that Parliament has created two distinct offences: one of
“criminal negligence”, the other of “dangerous driving”. Although “dangerous
driving” is admittedly a kind of “criminal negligence” because it is a lesser
offence than that which is described by those words, the use of the word
“negligence” appears to me highly undesirable in any instructions to a jury
with respect to subsection 4 as being apt to create confusion.

Being of opinion that the jury was properly
instructed in the terms of the section creating the offence of dangerous
driving without any reference to negligence, the evidence respecting impairment
became irrelevant to that charge. It was, therefore, unnecessary to add that if
the accused was acquitted on the count of impairment that evidence should be
excluded from consideration on the other count.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Sexual intercourse with girl
under 14 years of age—Whether corroboration of complainant’s evidence—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 138(1).

The respondent was acquitted on a charge of
having sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 14 years, contrary to
s. 138(1)  of the Criminal Code . The complainant, who was admittedly
under 14 years of age, gave evidence that the offence was committed when the
respondent took her, in company with another couple, to a room with twin beds
in a motel. Each couple occupied one of the beds. The lights were turned out
and the complainant says that the respondent lay on one of the beds with her
for more than two hours during which time they had some drinks and were “necking”,
that he undid her clothes and had intercourse with her. The respondent admitted
to “necking” but denied that intercourse took place. The

[Page 467]

second couple confirmed most of complainant’s
story, but they were unable to say whether or not sexual intercourse had
actually taken place. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the
dismissal of the charge on the ground that the evidence of the other couple was
incapable of being corroborative. The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

The corroboration need not be direct evidence
that the accused committed the crime. It is sufficient if it is merely
circumstantial evidence of his connection with it. In the present case, the
evidence of the other couple was capable of being so construed. It was for the
jury to say under all the circumstances whether or not that evidence in fact
amounted to corroboration.

Droit criminel—Rapports sexuels avec fille de
moins de 14 ans—Y a-t-il corroboration du témoignage de la plaignante—Code
criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 138(1).

L’intimé a été acquitté de l’infraction d’avoir
eu des rapports sexuels avec une personne du sexe féminin âgée de moins de 14
ans, contrairement à l’art. 138(1)  du Code criminel . La plaignante qui,
il fut admis, était âgée de moins de 14 ans, a témoigné que l’infraction a été
commise lorsque l’intimé l’a emmenée, en compagnie d’un autre couple, à une
chambre de motel où il y avait deux lits. Chaque couple a occupé un des lits.
Les lumières étaient éteintes et la plaignante dit qu’elle et l’intimé se sont
étendus sur un des lits durant plus de deux heures, qu’ils ont consommé de la
boisson, qu’ils ont fait du «necking», que l’intimé a défait ses vêtements et
qu’il a eu des rapports sexuels avec elle. L’intimé admet avoir fait du
«necking» mais nie avoir eu des rapports sexuels avec la plaignante. Le second
couple a confirmé en grande partie la version de la plaignante mais a été
incapable de dire si en fait il y a eu des rapports sexuels. Par un jugement
majoritaire, la Cour d’appel a confirmé l’acquittement pour le motif que le
témoignage de l’autre couple ne pouvait pas servir de corroboration. La
Couronne en a appelé à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être accueilli et un nouveau procès ordonné.

Il n’est pas nécessaire que la corroboration
soit une preuve directe que l’accusé a commis l’infraction. Il suffit qu’elle
soit simplement une preuve circonstancielle reliant le prévenu à l’infraction.
Dans le cas présent, le témoignage de l’autre couple était capable d’être
interprété de cette manière. Il appartenait au jury de dire si dans les
circonstances cette preuve équivalait à une corroboration.

APPEL par la Couronne d’un jugement de la Cour
d’appel de la Colombie-Britannique[1],
confirmant l’acquittement de l’intimé. Appel accueilli.

[Page 468]

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia1, affirming the respondent’s acquittal. Appeal
allowed.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

J.R. White, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal brought at the
instance of the Attorney General of British Columbia pursuant to s. 598  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia1 (McFarlane J.A. dissenting) whereby that Court
dismissed the Attorney General’s appeal from the acquittal of the respondent
before Mr. Justice Ruttan sitting with a jury on a charge of having sexual
intercourse with a female under the age of 14 years contrary to s. 138(1) 
of the Criminal Code .

The complainant, who was under 14 years of age,
gave evidence that the offence was committed when the respondent took her, in
company with another couple, (Loreen Fischer and Malcolm Gagnon) to a
twin-bedded room in a motel. Each couple occupied one of the beds. The lights
were turned out and the complainant says that the respondent lay on one of the
beds with her for more than two hours during which time they had some drinks
and were “necking”, he undid her blouse, loosened her brassiere and later a
bedspread was pulled over them and he removed her slacks and panties and had
intercourse with her.

The respondent admits going to the motel under
the circumstances described by the complainant but says that as they lay on the
bed they only “started to neck a little bit”, that the bedspread was not pulled
over them, her brassiere was not loosened, her clothes were not removed and no
intercourse took place. In fact, the respondent testified that the complainant
had said she would do anything he wanted but that he replied “Thanks, no
thanks” because he “didn’t want to get into any trouble.”

Fischer and Gagnon confirmed the complainant’s
story as to the drinking and the fact that she and the respondent

[Page 469]

were lying “necking” in the dark for more than
two hours and Fischer confirmed the fact that the complainant’s brassiere was
loosened, but they were unable to say whether or not sexual intercourse had
actually taken place between the respondent and the complainant.

In charging the jury, the learned trial judge
read the provisions of s. 134  of the Criminal Code  respecting the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant and
proceeded to say that:

…evidence in corroboration must be
independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to
connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which
implicates him, which confirms in some material particular not only the
evidence that the crime has been committed but also that the prisoner committed
it.

The learned trial judge then went on to tell the
jury, in effect, that the evidence of Fischer and Gagnon did not fall within
the definition of corroboration that he had given to them, and was not capable
of being treated as corroborative because they “did not know whether the act of
intercourse was taking place, or not”. The learned judge appears to have
regarded this evidence as corroborative only of the fact that there was
opportunity to commit the offence and he clearly thought it necessary, in order
to comply with the requirements of s. 134  of the Criminal Code  that
the corroborative evidence should be direct evidence of the commission of the
offence. He expressed this view to the jury saying:

Now I must tell you, in looking at the
evidence in this case I am unable to point to evidence that falls within the
definition of corroboration that I have given to you. That is, evidence that is
entirely separate from the girl’s story of sexual intercourse. The other
persons in the motel didn’t confirm it. They didn’t know whether the act of
intercourse was taking place, or not.

The only ground of appeal contained in the
Crown’s notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was
expressed in the allegation that:

The learned trial judge failed to charge
the jury that the evidence of Loreen Fischer and Malcolm James Gagnon was
capable of corroborating the evidence of the Complainant.

This is the question upon which Mr. Justice
McFarlane differed from the majority of the Court of Appeal and to which this
Court is therefore limited under the provisions of s. 598(1)  (a) of
the Criminal Code .

[Page 470]

In the course of his reasons for judgment
dismissing the appeal, Mr. Justice Bull agreed with the learned trial
judge that the evidence of the couple in the other bed at the motel did nothing
more than corroborate the fact that there was opportunity for sexual
intercourse which was not denied by anyone and that as it did not amount to
direct evidence of the act having taken place, it was not capable of being
corroborative. His conclusion was expressed in the following terms:

In the case at bar, I consider that the
evidence of Miss Fischer and Gagnon could not possibly do more than support a
mere opportunity for sexual intercourse, and that if it had been put to the
jury as being capable of being corroborative of evidence of the commission of
the crime alleged against the respondent, the jury would have been found wrong
in making those corroborative inferences therefrom. The learned trial judge
determined quite properly that the evidence was not so capable and hence it
would have been an error to put it to the jury as being capable of being
corroborative.

It is true that under certain circumstances
corroboration of the existence of mere opportunity may be no corroboration at
all, and in this regard the statement of Lord Reading made in the course of his
reasons for judgment in Burbury v. Jackson[2] is often quoted. The Chief Justice there
said:

…the question is whether where the parties
by the nature of their employment have opportunity of intercourse that is of
itself corroboration. In my opinion it is not… The evidence here shows nothing
more than that it was possible to have committed the misconduct at the material
date. That is not enough. The evidence must show that the misconduct was
probable.

In the case of Rex v. Reardon[3], McRuer J.A. makes reference to the reasons
for judgment of Lord Dunedin in Dawson v. M’Kenzie[4] where, after saying that mere opportunity
did not amount to corroboration, he went on to say:

…that the opportunity may be of such a
character as to bring in an element of suspicion…

In my view evidence of the circumstances
described by the witnesses Fischer and Gagnon and admitted by the respondent in
this case was a great deal more than evidence of mere opportunity and was
capable of being con-

[Page 471]

strued as an account of preliminary activities
calculated to culminate in the sexual intercourse which the complainant
describes. Whether or not these circumstances amounted to corroboration of the
complainant’s whole story was a question which in my view should have been left
to the jury.

Mr. Justice Norris, who agreed with Bull
J.A. that the appeal should be dismissed, appears to have taken the view that
because the evidence that the complainant and the respondent were lying on a
bed in a darkened motel room “necking” for more than two hours was not denied
by the respondent, it was therefore irrelevant. The learned judge said:

Here the incidental matter, the so-called
“necking” or love play was never in dispute. As it was not in issue, evidence
of it was not “material” to the offence with which the respondent was charged.
As it must “implicate” the respondent it must “involve” him in the offence. However
reprehensible such action may seem, in the circumstances of this case and on a
fair interpretation of a totality of the evidence of all the witnesses, it was
an “innocent” act irrelevant to the issue.

This paragraph seems to be based on the
assumption that the respondent admitted all “incidental matters” by which I
take it that the learned judge means everything except the actual commission of
the offence. The fact of the matter is, however, that the respondent
categorically denied that the complainant’s brassiere was loosened at all or
that he ever had a bedspread or anything else over him. This was vital evidence
and the complainant’s statement that her brassiere was loosened was
corroborated by Fischer whereas both Fischer and Gagnon testified that the
bedspread was pulled over the complainant and the respondent.

It also appears to me that Mr. Justice
Norris proceeded on the assumption that none of the matters admitted by the
respondent were “in issue” and that it followed that corroboration of them “was
not ‘material’ to the offence with which the respondent was charged”. In this
regard I agree with Mr. Justice McFarlane who, in the course of his
dissenting reason for judgment, adopted the views expressed by Curran L.J. in Regina
v. Hodgett[5], where
he said, at page 8:

…we know of no authority for restricting
the requisite corroboration to the part or parts of the accomplice’s testimony
that the accused

[Page 472]

chooses to put in issue. On the contrary,
admissions have for long been held corroborative and it is hard to see how this
could be so if the argument under consideration were sound.

If any other authority be needed to support the
latter proposition, it is to be found in the leading case of The King v.
Baskerville[6], where
the accused was charged with having committed acts of gross indecency with two
boys and it was argued that as they were accomplices their evidence required
corroboration. In the course of his reasons for judgment in that case, Lord
Reading, after pointing out that letters from the accused to the boys had been
put in evidence, went on to say:

The prisoner had admitted to the police
that the boys had been at his flat, that he knew one as a page-boy at the
Trocadero Restaurant, and that this boy had been to see him on several occasions
with another boy, and the appellant suggested to the police that he belonged to
a boys’ club and, therefore, was entitled to invite any of the members to his
place. The appellant was not a member of a boys’ club. The appellant gave
evidence at the trial and admitted that he had given money to the boys on
various occasions, and that, on hearing a peculiar whistle outside his flat, he
had gone downstairs to let the boys in. We entertained no doubt that this
evidence afforded ample corroboration of the boys’ testimony, even if we
assumed that the corroboration required was corroboration “in some material
particular implicating the accused”.

I find myself in full agreement with the
conclusion reached by Mr. Justice McFarlane and I would adopt the views
which he expressed in the following paragraph:

I think evidence which may be corroboration
of the evidence of a female person in such a case is evidence which may, in
law, be considered by the jury as evidence of a material particular implicating
the accused in the commission of the crime alleged. A particular is material in
this sense if it may, in the opinion of the jury, show or tend to show that the
testimony of the female person that the offense was committed and committed by
the accused is true, thus being relevant to the issue which the jury is called
upon to decide. That issue in this case was simply whether or not there was an
act of sexual intercourse. To be capable of being considered corroborative,
evidence need not in itself prove the guilty act.

The last sentence of this paragraph is fully
borne out by what was said in the following statement of Lord Reading in Rex
v. Baskerville, supra:

The corroboration need not be direct
evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely
circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.

[Page 473]

In my view, the evidence of Fischer and Gagnon
was capable of being construed as circumstantial evidence of the respondent’s
connection with the crime of which he was charged. It was for the jury to say
under all the circumstances whether or not it in fact amounted to
corroboration.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal,
set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of the jury and
direct that a new trial should be had.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Sale of drug to procure
abortion—Whether intention to use drug for that purpose an essential ingredient
of the offence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 238.

The appellant was convicted of attempting to
commit the offence of unlawfully supplying a drug knowing that it was intended
to be used to procure the miscarriage of a female person, contrary to
s. 238  of the Criminal Code . The female in question was a
policewoman and had no intention of using the drug. It was argued by the
appellant that he could not have supplied the drug in question “knowing” that
it was intended to be used to procure a miscarriage because in fact it was not
intended that it be so used or employed. The appellant’s conviction was
affirmed by the Court of Appeal and he was granted leave to appeal to this
Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Section 238 of the Code is directed against
the supplying or procuring of poison or noxious things for the purpose of
procuring abortion with the intention that they shall be so employed, and
knowing that it is intended that they shall be so employed. The intention of
any other person besides the accused himself that the poison or noxious thing
should be used to procure a miscarriage is not necessary to constitute

[Page 463]

the offence. In the present case, the
appellant intended that the substance procured by him should be used to procure
a miscarriage. This case was therefore within the words of the statute.

Droit criminel—Vente d’une drogue pour obtenir
l’avortement—Est-ce que l’intention d’employer la drogue pour cette fin est un
élément essentiel de l’infraction—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
art. 238.

L’appelant a été déclaré coupable de la
tentative de commettre l’infraction d’illégalement fournir une drogue sachant
qu’elle est destinée à être employée pour obtenir l’avortement d’une personne
du sexe féminin, contrairement à l’art. 238  du Code criminel . La
personne en question était de la police et elle n’avait pas l’intention
d’utiliser la drogue. L’appelant a soutenu qu’il ne peut pas avoir fourni la
drogue en question «sachant» qu’elle était destinée à être employée pour
obtenir l’avortement parce qu’en fait elle n’était pas destinée à être employée
à cette fin. La déclaration de culpabilité a été confirmée par la Cour d’appel,
et l’appelant a obtenu la permission d’appeler à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être rejeté.

L’article 238 du Code vise le cas d’une personne
qui fournit ou procure un poison ou des substances délétères dont le but est
d’obtenir l’avortement avec l’intention que ces substances soient employées à
cette fin, et sachant qu’elles sont destinées à être employées à cette fin.
L’intention de toute personne, autre que l’accusé lui-même, que le poison ou la
substance délétère sera employé pour obtenir l’avortement n’est pas nécessaire
pour constituer l’infraction. Dans le cas présent, l’appelant avait l’intention
que la substance fournie par lui soit employée pour obtenir un avortement. Le
cas tombe, par conséquent, sous les termes mêmes du statut.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de
l’Alberta[1],
confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel
rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming the appellant’s
conviction. Appeal dismissed.

S.J. Helman, Q.C., and R. Kambeitz, for
the appellant.

E.L. Collins, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Appellate Division of

[Page 464]

the Supreme Court of Alberta1
affirming the appellant’s conviction for attempting to commit the offence of
unlawfully supplying a drug knowing that it was intended to be used to procure
the miscarriage of a female person contrary to s. 238  of the Criminal
Code  which reads as follows:

Every one who unlawfully supplies or
procures a drug or other noxious thing or an instrument or thing, knowing that
it is intended to be used or employed to procure the miscarriage of a female
person, whether or not she is pregnant, is guilty of an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years.

Leave to appeal was granted to this Court under
the provisions of s. 591(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code  on the
following question of law, namely:

Whether in the circumstances of the charge
the Appellate Division erred in the interpretation of the words “knowing that
it is intended to be used or employed to procure the miscarriage of a female
person”, as those words are used in Section 238  of the Criminal Code .

In the reasons for judgment delivered by
Mr. Justice McDermid on behalf of the Appellate Division, it was held
that:

…if the person who supplied the drug
believes that the person to whom he is supplying it intends to use it to
procure a miscarriage that is sufficient for a conviction under the section. It
does not matter that the person to whom the drug was supplied did not in fact
intend to use it.

The appellant was charged as the result of a
policeman and policewoman, dressed in civilian clothes, going to his drug store
in Calgary where the policeman told the appellant that his girlfriend was
pregnant and said: “We were wondering if we could get something to do something
about it”. The appellant then supplied them with a “bean bag” saying that that
was what they needed and that it would cost $10.00. The “bean bag” consisted of
4 boxes of pills and a 2-ounce bottle of castor oil. Neither the policewoman
nor any girlfriend of the policeman was pregnant and neither of them intended
the pills to be used to procure a miscarriage.

At his trial before Chief Justice McLaurin, it
was contended on behalf of the appellant that he could not have supplied the
drug in question “knowing” that it was intended to be used to procure a
miscarriage because it was not intended that it should be so used or employed.
In

[Page 465]

support of this contention, reliance was placed
on the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the case of Reg. v.
Hyland[2], where
it was decided on an equal division of the Court that “the words ‘intended to
be used’ must apply to the person supplied and not to the supplier” and Madden
C.J. said:

Whatever difficulty there may be… arriving
at a knowledge of what another really “intends”, it at least is possible; while
the absurdity of asking a tribunal to be satisfied that a prisoner “knew”, as a
thing intended to be done, what admittedly no one ever did intend, has only to
be stated to be manifest.

The Hyland case runs contrary to a line
of authority starting with the case of Reg. v. Hillman[3], where Erle C.J., speaking of s. 59 of
the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which was virtually the same
as s. 238  of the Criminal Code , said:

The question is, whether or not the
intention of any other person besides the defendant himself, that the poison or
noxious thing should be used to procure a miscarriage, is necessary to
constitute the offence charged under the 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, s. 59. We
are all of opinion that that question must be answered in the negative. The
statute is directed against the supplying or procuring of poison or noxious
things for the purpose of procuring abortion with the intention that they shall
be so employed, and knowing that it is intended that they shall be so employed.
The defendant knew what his own intention was, and that was, that the substance
procured by him should be employed with intent to procure miscarriage. The case
is therefore within the words of the Act.

The Hillman case was followed seventeen
years later in R. v. Titley[4], where
Stephen J. rendered a decision which has been quoted at length and adopted by
Mr. Justice McDermid in the reasons for judgment which he rendered on
behalf of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the present
case.

No Canadian case directly in point was cited to
us and I have been unable to find one, but the authority of the Hillman
and Titley cases is recognized by leading Canadian text writers (see
Tremeear’s Criminal Code , 6th ed., page 385, and Crankshaw’s Criminal Code  of
Canada, 7th ed., pages 361 and 362). These cases also appear to have been
widely followed in other parts of the Commonwealth as indicated by the case of R.
v. Neil[5], which
is a decision

[Page 466]

of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and Rex
v. Noseworthy[6], a
decision of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. The same reasoning appears to
have been followed by the courts in South Africa; see R. v. Freestone[7].

In my view the reasoning of Erle C.J. in the Hillman
case, supra, applies to the construction to be placed on s. 238  of
the Criminal Code  and I agree with the interpretation of that
section adopted by the Appellate Division.

For these reasons, as well as for those
expressed in the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice McDermid, I
would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Indians—Hunting rights of
Manitoba Indians—Possession of game birds prohibited season contrary to
statute—Whether exempt from compliance with statute by virtue of agreement
between Canada and Manitoba—Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149—Migratory Birds
Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179, s. 12(1)—Manitoba Natural Resources
Act, 1930 (Can.), c. 29; 1930 (Man.), c. 30—B.N.A. Act, 1930, c. 26.

The appellant is an Indian from the Province of Manitoba and was convicted of
having game birds in his possession, contrary to s. 12(1) of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. On appeal by way of trial de
novo, the conviction was quashed. On a further appeal to the Court of
Appeal, the conviction was restored by a majority judgment. The appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court. The issue in the appeal is whether
para. 13 of an agreement made on December 14, 1929, between the government
of Canada and the government of
Manitoba (approved by statutes
of the United Kingdom Parliament, the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature
of Manitoba) exempts the appellant from compliance with the Migratory Birds
Convention Act and the regulations made thereunder. Paragraph 13 provides
that… “Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province
from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof,
provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province
hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food
at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands
to which the said Indians might have a right of access”.

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.: Paragraph 13 of the agreement did not
have the effect of exempting the appellant from compliance with the Migratory
Birds Convention Act and the regulations made thereunder. The whole tenor
of the agreement is that of a conveyance of land imposing specified obligations
and restrictions on the transferee, not on the transferor. This applied
particularly to para. 13 which made provincial game laws applicable to
Indians in the province subject to the proviso contained therein. That only
provincial game laws were in the contemplation of the parties, and not federal
enactments, is underscored by the words “which the Province hereby assures to
them” in para. 13. Care was taken in framing para. 13 that the
legislature of the province could not unilaterally affect the right of Indians
to hunt for food on unoccupied Crown lands. The agreement and the legislation
confirm-

[Page 518]

ing it did no more than impose specified
obligations and restrictions upon the transferee province. They did not repeal
by implication a statute of Canada giving effect to an international convention.

Per Pigeon J.:
This was a case for the application of the rule of construction that Parliament
is not presumed to legislate in breach of a treaty or in any manner
inconsistent with the comity of nations and the established rules of
international law. The words in para. 13 of the agreement “Canada agrees that the laws respecting game
in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within
the boundaries thereof” contemplate the laws of Manitoba. It is perfectly possible without doing violence to the language
used to construe para. 13 as applicable solely to provincial laws and thus
to avoid any conflict. Furthermore, it would not only be foreign to the
declared object of the agreement but even inconsistent with it, to provide for
an implied modification of the Migratory Birds Convention Act.

Per Cartwright
C.J., dissenting: The words “which the Province hereby assures to them”
do not cut down the right of hunting which in plain and unequivocal words
para. 13 say the Indians shall have. The rights given to the Indians by
the words of para. 13 have been, since 1930, enshrined in our Constitution
and given the force of law “notwithstanding anything in…any Act of the
Parliament of Canada”. There is no rule which permits to add after the words “Canada” the words “except the Migratory
Birds Convention Act”.

Per Ritchie,
Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The words in para. 13 of the
agreement “which the Province hereby assures to them” do not have the effect of
limiting the rights thereby accorded to the Indians, to provincial rights, but
rather to constitute additional assurance of the general rights described in
that paragraph.

In view of the words of s. 1 of the B.N.A.
Act, 1930, giving the agreement the force of law “notwithstanding anything
in…any Act of the Parliament of Canada”, the agreement takes precedence over
the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the regulations made thereunder,
with the result that these enactments do not apply to Indians in Manitoba when
engaged in hunting migratory birds for food in the areas set out in para. 13.

décembre 1929

[Page 519]

entre le gouvernement du Canada et le
gouvernement du Manitoba (ratifiée par les statuts du parlement du Royaume-Uni,
du parlement du Canada et de la législature du Manitoba) dispense l’appelant
d’obéir à la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs et les
règlements établis en vertu d’icelle. Le para. 13 stipule que…«le Canada
consent à ce que les lois relatives au gibier et qui sont en vigueur de temps à
autre dans la province, s’appliquent aux Indiens dans les limites de la
province; toutefois, lesdits Indiens auront le droit que la province leur
assure par les présentes de chasser et de prendre le gibier au piège et de
pêcher le poisson, pour se nourrir en toute saison de l’année sur toutes les
terres inoccupées de la Couronne et sur toutes les autres terres auxquelles
lesdits Indiens peuvent avoir un droit d’accès».

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Ritchie, Hall et
Spence étant dissidents.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Pigeon: Le paragraphe 13 de la convention
ne dispense pas l’appelant d’obéir à la Loi sur la Convention concernant les
oiseaux migrateurs et aux règlements établis en vertu d’icelle. La
convention est un acte de transmission de propriété imposant des obligations et
des restrictions spécifiques au cessionnaire, mais non pas au cédant. Ceci
s’applique particulièrement au para. 13 qui rend les lois de chasse
provinciales applicables aux Indiens dans la province sous réserve de la
condition y prévue. Les mots «que la province leur assure par les présentes»
dans le para. 13 montrent bien que les parties n’avaient en vue que les
lois de chasse provinciales et non pas les lois fédérales. On a pris soin de
s’assurer que la province ne pourrait pas unilatéralement porter atteinte au droit
des Indiens de chasser pour se nourrir sur les terres inoccupées de la
Couronne. La convention ainsi que la législation la ratifiant n’ont pas d’autre
effet que d’imposer des obligations et des restrictions spécifiques à la
province cessionnaire. Elles n’ont pas eu pour effet d’abroger implicitement un
statut du Canada qui donnait effet à une convention internationale.

Le Juge
Pigeon: Il s’agit d’un cas où l’on doit appliquer la règle d’interprétation
disant que le parlement n’est pas censé légiférer à l’encontre d’un traité ou
d’une manière incompatible avec les convenances et les règles établies du droit
international. Dans le para. 13 de la convention, les mots «le Canada
consent à ce que les lois relatives au gibier et qui sont en vigueur de temps à
autre dans la province, s’appliquent aux Indiens dans les limites de la
province» visent les lois du Manitoba. Sans faire violence aux mots dont on
s’est servi, il est parfaitement possible d’interpréter ce para. 13 comme
s’appliquant uniquement aux lois provinciales et ainsi d’éviter tout conflit.
Interpréter ce paragraphe comme une modification implicite de la Loi sur la
Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs serait non seulement
s’éloigner de l’objet de la convention mais aller à l’encontre.

Le Juge en Chef
Cartwright, dissident: Les mots «que la province leur assure par
les présentes» n’enlèvent rien au droit de chasser qu’en des termes clairs et
non équivoques le para. 13 dit que les Indiens possèdent. Les droits
donnés aux Indiens par le para. 13 ont été, depuis 1930, consacrés par
notre constitution et sont devenus la loi «nonobstant tout ce qui est
contenu…dans toute loi du Parle-

[Page 520]

ment du Canada». Il n’y a aucune règle qui
permette d’ajouter après les mots «Canada» les mots «excepté la Loi sur la
Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs».

Les Juges
Ritchie, Hall et Spence, dissidents: Dans le para. 13 de la
convention, les mots «que la province leur assure par les présentes» n’ont pas
l’effet de limiter aux seuls droits provinciaux les droits qui y sont accordés
aux Indiens, mais au contraire constituent une garantie additionnelle des
droits généraux décrits dans ce paragraphe.

Vu les termes de l’art. 1 de l’Acte de
l’Amérique du Nord britannique, 1930, donnant à la convention force de loi
«nonobstant tout ce qui est contenu…dans toute loi du Parlement du Canada», la
convention a priorité sur la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux
migrateurs et les règlements établis en vertu d’icelle. Il en résulte que
cette législation ne s’applique pas aux Indiens du Manitoba lorsqu’ils chassent
pour se nourrir les oiseaux migrateurs dans les endroits spécifiés au
para. 13.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel du
Manitoba1, rétablissant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel
rejeté, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Ritchie, Hall et Spence étant
dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Manitoba[1], restoring the
appellant’s conviction. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and
Spence JJ. dissenting.

William R. Martin, for the appellant.

D.H. Christie, Q.C., for the respondents.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—The
question to be determined on this appeal, the relevant facts (all of which are
undisputed) and the historical background in the light of which the controversy
must be considered are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.

That the problem is not free from difficulty is
attested by the differences of opinion in the Courts below and in this Court.

Since the decisions of this Court in Sikyea
v. The Queen[2] and The
Queen v. George[3], it
must be accepted

[Page 521]

that, if it were not for the provisions
contained in section 13 of the agreement between the Government of Canada
and the Government of Manitoba which was approved and given the force of law by
Statutes of the Imperial Parliament, the Parliament of Canada and the
Legislature of Manitoba, the conviction of the appellant would have to be
upheld.

Nothing would be gained by my repeating the
reasons which I gave in George’s case for thinking that both it and Sikyea’s
case should have been decided differently. I accept those decisions.

The first question before us is as to the
meaning of the words used in section 13 of the agreement and particularly
the following:

…provided, however, that the said Indians
shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting,
trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all
unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians might
have a right of access.

I share the view of my brothers Ritchie and Hall
that the words “which the Province hereby assures to them” do not cut down “the
right of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of
the year” which in plain and unequivocal words the clause says that the Indians
shall have.

In Sikyea’s case and George’s case
the Court decided that this right, secured to the Indians by treaty, could be,
and as a matter of construction had been abrogated by the terms of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act and the Regulations made thereunder. In George’s
case the Court held that while s. 87  of the Indian Act  preserved
the treaty rights of the Indians against encroachment by laws within the
competency of the Provincial Legislature it had no such effect in regard to an
Act of Parliament.

The situation in the case at bar is different.
The right of hunting, trapping and fishing given to the Indians by the words of
section 13 quoted above has been, since 1930, enshrined in an amendment to
our Constitution and given:

…the force of law notwithstanding anything
in the British North America Act, 1867, or any Act amending the same, or
any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order in Council or terms or
conditions of union made or approved under any such Act as aforesaid.

I find it impossible to uphold the conviction of
the appellant unless we are able to say that, by the application

[Page 522]

of some rule of construction, there should be
inserted in s. 1 of the British North America Act, 1930, immediately
after the words “Parliament of Canada” the words “except the Migratory Birds
Convention Act”. I know of no rule which permits us to take such a course.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my
brother Hall.

The Judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Judson JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant is an Indian within the
meaning of para. (g) of subs. (1) of s. 2 of the Indian
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149. He was convicted on December 7, 1964, of having
in his possession

Migratory Game Birds, during a time when
the capturing, killing, or taking of such birds, is prohibited, contrary to the
Regulations under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, thereby committing
an offence under Section 12(1) of the said Migratory Birds Convention Act.

On an appeal by way of trial de novo his
conviction was quashed. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[4], his conviction was restored and the sentence affirmed by a
majority judgment. He appeals to this Court with leave.

The issue in this appeal is whether by operation
of para. 13 of the agreement made on December 14, 1929, between the
Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the Province of
Manitoba (hereinafter referred to as “the agreement”) the appellant was exempted
from compliance with the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations
made thereunder bearing in mind that at the relevant time and place he was
an Indian who had hunted game for food on land to which he had a right of
access.

There can be no doubt that apart from
para. 13 of the agreement above quoted the appellant was, in the
circumstances of this case, subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act
and Regulations. See: Sikyea v. The Queen[5]; The Queen v. George[6]; Sigeareak v. The Queen[7].

[Page 523]

Paragraph 13 of the agreement provides:

13. In order to secure to the Indians of
the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support
and subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the
Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries
thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which
the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and
fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on
any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.

Paragraph 13 is part of an agreement dated December 14, 1929, between the Government of
Canada and the Government of the Province of Manitoba for the transfer to the province from the Dominion of
all ungranted Crown lands. This agreement was approved by the Manitoba
Legislature and by Parliament. (Statutes of Manitoba, 1930, c. 30; Statutes of
Canada, 1930, c. 29.) It was subsequently affirmed by the British North
America Act, 1930, 20-21 Geo. V., c. 26. Three similar agreements
involving Alberta, Saskatchewan and British
 Columbia were subsequently affirmed.

Section 1 of the British North America Act 1930
provides:

1. The agreements set out in the Schedule
to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law
notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any
Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order
in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act
as aforesaid.

Prior to the coming into force of the agreement,
title to all ungranted Crown lands in the Province of Manitoba was vested in the Dominion.
Briefly, the relevant history is that by the Rupert’s Land Act, 1868,
31-32 Vict., c. 105 (R.S.C. 1952, vol. VI, p. 99) provision was made for
the surrender of Rupert’s Land by the Hudson’s Bay Company and for the acceptance thereof by Her Majesty.
Section 3 of the said Act provided:

that such Surrender shall not be accepted
by Her Majesty until the Terms and Conditions upon which Rupert’s Land shall be
admitted into the said Dominion of Canada shall have been approved of by Her
Majesty, and embodied in an address to Her Majesty from both the Houses of the
Parliament of Canada in pursuance of the 146th Section of the British North
America Act 1867.

By Imperial Order in Council of June 23, 1870,
Rupert’s Land was admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada
effective July 15, 1870—R.S.C.
1952, vol. VI, p. 113. By operation of the Manitoba Act 1870, 33
Vict.,

[Page 524]

c. 3 (Canada), subsequently affirmed with
retrospective effect by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (B.N.A. Act,
1871, 34-35 Vict., c. 28, s. 5, R.S.C. 1952, vol. VI, p. 146),
the Province of Manitoba was carved out of Rupert’s Land and came into being on
the same date Rupert’s Land entered Confederation. By s. 30 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, all ungranted or waste lands in the Province vested in the Crown to
be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of the Dominion.

The Crown in right of the Dominion being the
owner of all Crown lands, including the mines and minerals therein, in the
Province of Manitoba that Province, together with Alberta and Saskatchewan, was
in a less favourable condition than the other Provinces who by operation of
s. 109 of the British North America Act, 1867, retained Crown lands
upon entering Confederation. The purpose of the agreement was to transfer these
lands to Manitoba in order that
it might be in the same position as the other provinces under s. 109 of
the British North America Act, 1867. This is apparent from the preamble
to and paragraph 1 of the agreement and from the following cases where the
matter was under consideration:

Saskatchewan Natural Resources Reference[8]:

Reference concerning Refunds of Dues
paid to the Dominion of Canada in respect of Timber Permits in the Western Provinces[9];

Anthony v. Attorney General of Alberta[10];

Attorney General of Alberta v. Huggard Assets Limited[11]:

Western Canadian Collieries Limited v.
Attorney General of Alberta[12].

The whole tenor of the agreement is that of a
conveyance of land imposing specified obligations and restrictions on the
transferee, not on the transferor. This applies, in particular, to paragraph
13, which makes provincial game laws applicable to Indians in the province
subject to the

[Page 525]

proviso contained therein. That only provincial
game laws were in the contemplation of the parties, and not federal enactments,
is underscored by the words “which the Province hereby assures to them” in
para. 13. As indicated by para. 11 of the agreement and para. 10
of the Alberta and Saskatchewan agreements, Canada, in negotiating these agreements,
was mindful of the fact it had treaty obligations with Indians on the Prairies.
These treaties, among other things, dealt with hunting by Indians on unoccupied
lands. For example, treaties 5 and 6, which cover portions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta,
provide:

Her Majesty further agrees with Her said
Indians, that they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their
avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be
made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such
tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining,
lumbering or other purposes, by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada,
or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said
Government.

Treaty No. 8, which covers portions of Alberta and Saskatchewan, provides:

And Her Majesty the Queen HEREBY AGREES
with the said Indians that they shall have right to pursue their usual
vocations of hunting, trapping and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
heretofore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be
made by the Government of the country, acting under the authority of Her
Majesty, and saving and excepting such tracts as may be required or taken up from
time to time for settlement, mining, lumbering, trading or other purposes.

Treaty No. 7, which covers a portion of Alberta, is to the same effect.

It being the expectation of the parties that the
agreement would be given the force of law by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Paragraph 25) care was
taken in framing para. 13 that the Legislature of the province could not
unilaterally affect the right of Indians to hunt for food on unoccupied Crown
lands. Under the agreement this could only be done by concurrent Statutes of
the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the province, in accordance
with para. 24 thereof.

The majority opinion in the Manitoba Court of
Appeal held that the agreement, affirmed as it was by legislation of all
interested governments, could not be reconciled with

[Page 526]

the Migratory Birds Convention Act and
that the latter Act must prevail. The Migratory Birds Convention Act, being
of general application throughout Canada, ought not to be construed as circumscribed by the restricted
legislation that is to be found in the Manitoba Natural Resources Act. It was desirable
that a matter within the legislative responsibility of Parliament and governed
by international treaty be uniform in application throughout the country unless
specifically provided otherwise.

The dissenting opinion would have held that
para. 13 of the agreement should prevail over the Migratory Birds
Convention Act notwithstanding that such a result gives the Act a different
effect in Manitoba from that
which it has in other parts of Canada.

The Migratory Birds Convention Act was
enacted in 1917. It confirms a treaty made between Canada and the United States. The regulations under the Act go back to 1918. (P.C. 871, April
23, 1918). In my opinion, the agreement and the legislation of 1930 confirming
it did no more than impose specified obligations and restrictions upon the
transferee province. They did not repeal by implication a statute of Canada giving effect to an international
convention.

On this subject I adopt the law as stated in 36
Hals., 3rd ed., p. 465:

Repeal by implication is not favoured by
the courts for it is to be presumed that Parliament would not intend to effect
so important a matter as the repeal of a law without expressing its intention
to do so. If, however, provisions are enacted which cannot be reconciled with
those of an existing statute, the only inference possible is that Parliament,
unless it failed to address its mind to the question, intended that the
provisions of the existing statute should cease to have effect, and an
intention so evinced is as effective as one expressed in terms. The rule is,
therefore, that one provision repeals another by implication if, but only if,
it is so inconsistent with or repugnant to that other that the two are
incapable of standing together. If it is reasonably possible so to construe the
provisions as to give effect to both, that must be done; and their
reconciliation must in particular be attempted if the later statute provides
for its construction as one with the earlier, thereby indicating that
Parliament regarded them as compatible, or if the repeals expressly effected by
the later statute are so detailed that failure to include the earlier provision
amongst them must be regarded as such an indication.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 527]

RITCHIE J. (dissenting):—I have had the
benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by other members of the
Court in which the circumstances giving rise to this appeal are fully recited.

I agree with Mr. Justice Hall that the
words “which the Province hereby assures to them” as they occur in paragraph 13
of the agreement which is a schedule to the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, Statutes
of Canada 1930, c. 29, do not have the effect of limiting the rights thereby
accorded to Indians, to provincial rights, but rather that they constitute
additional assurance of the general rights described in the said paragraph.

Like my brother Hall, I can only read the
provisions of s. 1 of the British North America Act, 1930, as
giving the agreement “the force of law notwithstanding anything in …any Act of
the Parliament of Canada…” and I am therefore of opinion that the agreement
takes precedence over the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 179 and the regulations made thereunder, with the result that these
enactments do not apply to Indians in Manitoba when engaged in hunting
migratory birds for food in the areas set out in section 13.

I would accordingly dispose of this matter in
the manner proposed by my brother Hall.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J. (dissenting):—The facts in this
appeal are not in dispute. The appellant, Paul Daniels, who is a Treaty Indian
of the Chemahawin Indian Reserve in the Province of Manitoba, was convicted by Police
Magistrate Neil McPhee, at The Pas, Manitoba, for an offence contrary to subs. (1) of s. 12 of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. The charge on which he was
convicted was that he, the said

Paul Daniels, of Chemahawin Indian Reserve,
Manitoba, on the 3rd day of July, A.D. 1964, at Chemahawin Indian Reserve,
in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully and without lawful excuse have in
his possession Migratory Game Birds, during a time when the capturing, killing
or taking of such birds is prohibited, contrary to the regulations under the Migratory
Birds Convention Act, thereby committing an offence under Section 12(1) of
the said Migratory Birds Convention Act.

Against the conviction the accused appealed to
the County Court by way of trial de novo. His Honour J.W. Thompson,
sitting as a judge of the County Court of Manitoba,

[Page 528]

allowed the appeal and acquitted the accused.
The Crown then took an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[13] which Court, Freedman J.A. dissenting, allowed the appeal and
restored the conviction. The appellant then applied for and was given leave to
appeal to this Court.

On July 3, 1964, the appellant had in his
possession two wild ducks, one described as a redhead and the other a mallard
or greenhead. At a point along the Saskatchewan River, within the Reserve, he had, on his own admission, shot and killed
the birds for food and they were being cooked over a campfire when two
constables of the R.C.M.P. entered the area. Section 6 of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act provides:

No person, without lawful excuse, the proof
whereof shall he on such person, shall buy, sell or have in his possession any
migratory game bird, migratory insectivorous bird or migratory nongame bird, or
the nest or egg of any such bird or any part of any such bird, nest or egg,
during the time when the capturing, killing or taking of such bird, nest or egg
is prohibited by this Act.

Under s. 3(b)(i) “Migratory Game
Birds” includes wild ducks. Section 12(1) of the Act provides that every
person who violates any provision of this Act or any regulation, is, for
each offence, liable upon summary conviction to a fine of not more than three
hundred dollars and not less than ten dollars, or to imprisonment for a term
not exceeding six months or to both fine and imprisonment.

Section 5(1) of the Regulations provides:

Unless otherwise permitted under these
Regulations to do so, no person shall

(a) in any area described in
Schedule A, kill, hunt, capture, injure, or take or molest a migratory bird at
any time except during an open season specified for that bird and that area in
Schedule A…

Part VII of Schedule A to the Regulations defines
the open season for ducks in Manitoba. In the area north of Parallel 53 which includes the Chemahawin
Indian Reserve, the open season is from noon September 11 to November 28,
inclusive of the closing date.

[Page 529]

It is further provided in s. 5(2) of the Regulations:

Indians and Eskimos may take auks, auklets,
guillemots, murres, puffins and scoters and their eggs at any time for human
food or clothing, but they shall not sell or trade or offer to sell or trade
birds or eggs so, taken and they shall not take such birds or eggs within a
bird sanctuary.

Unless the appellant’s status as an Indian in Manitoba permits him to hunt and possess
migratory game birds at all seasons of the year, he was properly convicted: Sikyea
v. The Queen[14].

The appellant claimed immunity from the
provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act by virtue of the Manitoba
Natural Resources Act, Statutes of Canada 1930, c. 29, which he contends
exempts him from the operations of the Migratory Birds Convention Act because
he is an Indian residing in the Province of Manitoba.

In the year 1929, some twelve years after the
enactment of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the Government of
Canada and the Government of Manitoba reached an agreement respecting the
transfer to Manitoba of the
unalienated natural resources within the Province. The agreement was approved
by the Parliament of Canada in the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, supra, and by
the Legislature of Manitoba by the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 180. The schedule to both statutes contains the terms of the
agreement, in which s. 13 reads as follows:

In order to secure to the Indians of the
Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and
subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the
Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries
thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which
the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and
fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on
any other lands to which the said Indians might have a right of access.

This section of the agreement was dealt
with by this Court in Prince and Myron v. The Queen[15], which held that Indians in Manitoba hunting for food on all unoccupied
Crown lands and on any other lands to which they

[Page 530]

may have rights of access were not subject to
any of the limitations which the Game and Fisheries Act of Manitoba, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, imposes upon
the non-Indian residents of Manitoba. Section 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954,
c. 94, reads as follows:

72(1) Notwithstanding this Act, and in so
far only as is necessary to implement The Manitoba Natural Resources Act, any
Indian may hunt and take game for food for his own use at all seasons of the
year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the Indian
may have the right of access.

The question which falls to be determined in
this appeal is whether the terms of the agreement between the Government of
Canada and the Government of Manitoba as ratified by Parliament and by the
Legislature of Manitoba and confirmed at Westminster in the British North
America Act 1930 take precedence over the provisions of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act and the Regulations made thereunder. If full
effect is to be given to s. 13 of the agreement in question, it must be
held that the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Regulations
made thereunder do not apply to Indians in Manitoba when engaged in hunting migratory birds for food in the areas set
out in the section. On the other hand, if the provisions of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act take precedence, the right of Indians in Manitoba to hunt game for food at all
seasons of the year in accordance with said s. 13 is wiped out.
Accordingly, the decision must be made as to which legislation is paramount.

Freedman J.A., in his dissenting judgment in the
Court of Appeal, dealt with the problem as follows:

At first blush it might be thought that the
reference to Indians and their hunting rights both in the Convention and in the
regulations of the Migratory Birds Convention Act—under which they are
permitted to hunt scoters, auks, auklets, etc.—settles the matter. Obviously
such rights are far smaller than the unrestricted right to hunt all game for
food, which is provided by Sec. 13 of “The Manitoba Natural Resources Act”. The reference
to Indians in the Convention and in the regulations is in general terms, no
exception being made with regard to Indians of Manitoba or elsewhere. It might
accordingly be plausibly argued that the Indians in Manitoba have only such rights with respect to migratory birds as are
conferred by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. But this is not
necessarily so. We must remember that when the Convention of 1917 was entered
into, the agreement relating to the transfer of Manitoba’s natural resources was not yet in existence nor even in
contemplation. Hence no exception with regard to Manitoba Indians could have
been expected in the Convention. As for the regulations of 1958, it is true
that they were enacted subsequent to The Manitoba Natural Resources Act and
that they contain no exception in favour of Indians of Manitoba. But the

[Page 531]

regulations could not enlarge or go beyond
the provisions of the statute pursuant to which they were enacted. Rather they
would conform to the terms of that statute; so no such exception would be
expected in the regulations either.

The parallel argument on the other side
appears to me to be far more cogent. The terms of Sec. 13 contained in The
Manitoba Natural Resources Act are comprehensive and permit the hunting by
Indians of game for food at all seasons of the year. No exception is made with
respect to migratory birds, even though the Migratory Birds Convention Act had
been on the statute books since 1917. Instead of making the provisions of Sec.
13 subject to the terms of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the
legislators did quite the opposite. They enshrined the agreement within the
Canadian constitutional framework by having it confirmed at Westminster in the British North America Act, 1930, and declared it should have the force of law “notwithstanding
anything in… any Act of the Parliament of Canada”. I believe it should be given
that force and not be read as subject to the provisions of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act.

I am conscious of the fact that this
conclusion will give to the Migratory Birds Convention Act a different
effect in Manitoba (and incidentally in Saskatchewan and Alberta, which have
similar provisions to Sec. 13) from that which it has in other parts of Canada.
The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Reg. vs. Sikyea, (1964)
S.C.R. 642, upheld the application of the Migratory Birds Convention Act to
an Indian of the Northwest Territories notwithstanding hunting rights contained in treaties. The decision
of that Court in The Queen vs. George, (1966) 55 D.L.R. (2d) 386, came
to the same conclusion as regards an Indian in Ontario. In neither case, of course, did Sec. 13 of The Manitoba Natural
Resources Act apply. If the application of Sec. 13 gives to the Migratory
Birds Convention Act a disparate result in different parts of Canada, that
is simply an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the conflicting
legislation on the subject.

I am in full agreement with Freedman J.A. and
the fact that the conclusion arrived at by him gives the Indians of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta a latitude while hunting for food on unoccupied crown
lands and on other lands to which Indians might have a right of access greater
than that possessed by other Indians in Canada is not of itself a reason for
putting a strained interpretation on said s. 13 or for failing to give
effect to the very plain language in the British North America Act 1930.
The lamentable history of Canada’s dealings with Indians in disregard of
treaties made with them as spelt out in the judgment of Johnson J.A. in Regina
v. Sikyea[16] and
by McGillivray J.A. in Rex v. Wesley[17]
ought in justice to allow the Indians to get the benefit of an unambiguous law
which for

[Page 532]

once appears to give them what the treaties and
the Commissioners who were sent to negotiate those treaties promised.

I said at p. 646 of my reasons in Sikyea
which were concurred in by the six other members of this Court who heard
the appeal:

On the substantive question involved, I
agree with the reasons for judgment and with the conclusions of Johnson J.A. in
the Court of Appeal, (1964) 2 C.C.C. 325, 43 C.R. 83, 46 W.W.R. 65. He has
dealt with the important issues fully and correctly in their historical and
legal settings, and there is nothing which I can usefully add to what he has
written.

It should be noted that in Sikyea the British
North America Act 1930 had no application because the offence there being
dealt with had occurred in the Northwest Territories, an area wholly within the legislative jurisdiction of the
Parliament of Canada. Parliament has the power to breach the Indian treaties if
it so wills: Regina
v. Sikyea, supra. That point is dealt with by
Johnson J.A. at p. 330 as follows:

Discussing the nature of the rights which
the Indians obtained under the treaties, Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial
Committee in A.-G. Can. v. A.-G. Ont., A.-G. Que. v. A.-G. Ont., (1897) A.C. 199 at p. 213, said:

“Their Lordships have had no difficulty in
coming to the conclusion that, under the treaties, the Indians obtained no
right to their annuities, whether original or augmented beyond a promise and
agreement, which was nothing more than a personal obligation by its governor,
as representing the old province, that the latter should pay the annuities as
and when they became due…”

While this refers only to the annuities
payable under the treaties, it is difficult to see that the other covenants in
the treaties, including the one we are here concerned with, can stand on any
higher footing. It is always to be kept in mind that the Indians surrendered
their rights in the territory in exchange for these promises. This “promise and
agreement”, like any other, can, of course, be breached, and there is no law of
which I am aware that would prevent Parliament by legislation, properly within
s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, from doing so.

However, parliament cannot legislate in
contravention of the British North America Act and that is why the British
North America Act 1930 is decisive in this case.

A reading of Johnson J.A.’s historical review in
Sikyea, particularly at pp. 335-6, where he said:

It is, I think, clear that the rights given
to the Indians by their treaties as they apply to migratory birds have been
taken away by this Act and its Regulations. How are we to explain this apparent
breach of faith on the part of the Government, for I cannot think it can be

[Page 533]

described in any other terms? This cannot
be described as a minor or insignificant curtailment of these treaty rights,
for game birds have always been a most plentiful, a most reliable and a readily
obtainable food in large areas of Canada. I cannot believe that the Government of Canada realized that in
implementing the Convention they were at the same time 1 breaching the treaties
that they had made with the Indians. It is much more likely that these
obligations under the treaties were overlooked—a case of the left hand having
forgotten what the right hand had done. The subsequent history of the Government’s
dealing with the Indians would seem to bear this out. When the treaty we are
concerned with here was signed in 1921, only five years after the enactment of
the Migratory Birds Convention Act, we find the Commissioners who
negotiated the treaty reporting:

“The Indians seemed afraid, for one thing,
that their liberty to hunt, trap and fish would be taken away or curtailed, but
were assured by me that this would not be the case, and the Government will
expect them to support themselves in their own way, and, in fact, that more
twine for nets and more ammunition were given under the terms of this treaty
than under any of the preceding ones; this went a long way to calm their fears.
I also pointed out that any game laws made were to their advantage, and,
whether they took treaty or not, they were subject to the laws of the
Dominion.”

and there is nothing in this report which
would indicate that the Indians were told that their right to shoot migratory
birds had already been taken away from them. I have referred to Art. 12 of the
agreement between the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta signed in 1930 by which that Province was required to
assure to the Indians the right of “hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish
for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands”. (The
amendment to the B.N.A. Act (1930 (U.K.), c. 26) that confirmed this
agreement, declared that it should “have the force of law notwithstanding
anything in the British North America Act… or any Act of the Parliament of
Canada…”) It is of some importance that while the Indians in the Northwest Territories continued to shoot
ducks at all seasons for food, it is only recently that any attempt has been
made to enforce the Act.

confirms what I said in Sikyea and I am
fortified in that view by the judgment of McGillivray J.A. in R. v. Wesley, particularly
at pp. 283-4 where, in dealing with s. 12 of the Alberta agreement,
identical in effect with s. 13 of the Manitoba agreement, he said:

In Canada the Indian treaties appear to have been judicially interpreted as
being mere promises and agreements. See A.-G. Can. v. A.-G. Ont. (Indian Annuities case), (1897) A.C. 199, at p. 213.

Assuming as I do that our treaties with
Indians are on no higher plane than other formal agreements yet this in no wise
makes it less the duty and obligation of the Crown to carry out the promises
contained in those treaties with the exactness which honour and good conscience
dictate and it is not to be thought that the Crown has departed from those
equitable principles which the Senate and the House of Commons declared in
addressing Her Majesty in 1867, uniformly governed the British Crown in its
dealings with the aborigines.

At the time of the making of this Indian
Treaty it was of first class importance to Canada that the Indians who had become restless after the

[Page 534]

sway of the Hudson’s Bay Co. had come to an
end, should become content and that such title or interest in land as they had
should be peacefully surrendered to permit of settlement without hindrance of
any kind. On the other hand it goes without saying that the Indians were
greatly concerned with “their vocations of hunting” upon which they depended
for their living.

In this connection it is of historical
interest although of no assistance in the interpretation of the treaty, that
Governor Laird who with Colonel Macleod negotiated this treaty, said to the
Chiefs of the Indian tribes:—

“I expect to listen to what you have to say
today, but first, I would explain that it is your privilege to hunt all over
the prairies, and that should you desire to sell any portion of your land, or
any coal or timber from off your reserves, the Government will see that you
receive just and fair prices, and that you can rely on all the Queen’s promises
being fulfilled.”

And again he said:—“The reserve will be
given to you without depriving you of the privilege to hunt over the plains
until the land be taken up.”

It is true that Government regulations in
respect of hunting are contemplated in the Treaty but considering that Treaty
in its proper setting I do not think that any of the makers of it could by any
stretch of the imagination be deemed to have contemplated a day when the
Indians would be deprived of an unfettered right to hunt game of all kinds for
food on unoccupied Crown land.

In the case A.-G. v. Metropolitan
Electric Supply Co., 74 L.J. Ch. 145, at p. 150, Farwell J.,
said:—

“I think it is germane to the subject to
consider what the Legislature had in view in making the provisions which I find
in the Act of Parliament itself. As Lord Halsbury said in Eastman
Photographic Materials Co. v. Comptroller General of Patents, Designs, and
Trade Marks, (1898) (A.C. 571) referring to Heydon’s Case (1584), (3
Co. Rep. 7a) ‘We are to see what was the law before the Act was passed, and
what was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided, what remedy
Parliament appointed, and the reason of the remedy.’ That is a very general way
of stating it, but no doubt one is entitled to put one’s self in the position
in which the Legislature was at the time the Act was passed in order to see
what was the state of knowledge as far as all the circumstances brought before
the Legislature are concerned, for the purpose of seeing what it was the
Legislature was aiming at.”

If as Crown counsel contends, s. 12
taken as a whole gives rise to apparent inconsistency and is capable of two
meanings then I still have no hesitation in saying in the light of all the
external circumstances relative to Indian rights in this Dominion to which I
have alluded, that the law makers in 1930 were in the making of this proviso,
aiming at assuring to the Indians covered by the section, an unrestricted right
to hunt for food in those unsettled places where game may be found, described
in s. 12.

It was argued that para. 13 of the
agreement in question is limited in its application solely to provincial laws
because of the presence of the clause “which the Province hereby assures to
them”, in the sentence under consideration. That clause inserted
parenthetically between commas

[Page 535]

cannot derogate from the thrust of the principal
clause which contains the specific declaration “that the said Indians shall
have the right,…of hunting, trapping and • fishing game and fish for food at all
seasons of the year”. In my view it adds emphasis to the declaration by making
manifest the application of the declaration to the Province as though the
clause read “which the Province also hereby assures to them”.

If all that s. 13 of the agreement was
intended to achieve in 1930 was a declaration by the Province that Indians were
to have the right to fish, hunt and trap for food at all seasons of the year,
it was, according to that interpretation, an empty, futile and misleading
gesture. Either the Indians then had those rights or they did not have them for
the Migratory Birds Convention Act had been on the statute books since
1917. The only interpretation that makes sense is the one that acknowledges
that the right of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all
seasons of the year existed in 1930 regardless of the Migratory Birds
Convention Act and the Federal Government wanted those rights to continue
notwithstanding the transfer to the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta of the unalienated natural resources withheld when the Provinces were
formed. What logic could there have been in having the Provinces assure to
Indians non-existing rights?

The Federal authority was already under treaty
obligation contained in Treaties 5 and 6 which read:

Her Majesty further agrees with Her said
Indians, that they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their
avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be
made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such
tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining,
lumbering or other purposes, by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada,
or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said
Government.

to preserve the Indians’ right to hunt and fish
for food at all seasons of the year, and it was merely making certain that the
Provinces would accord the same rights when they got control of the unalienated
Crown lands. The obligation of Canada to preserve the right to hunt and fish for food at all seasons was
an historical one arising out of the rights of Indians as original inhabitants
of the territories from

[Page 536]

which Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta were carved and arising out of the
treaties above mentioned. The subject of aboriginal rights as they apply to
Indians of Western Canada and the effect of the treaties made with the Indians
were dealt with by the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia in Regina v. White and Bob[18]. This Court upheld that decision in an
oral judgment[19] as
follows:

Mr. Justice Cartwright delivered the
following oral judgment:

“Mr. Berger, Mr. Sanders and
Mr. Christie. We do not find it necessary to hear you. We are all of the
opinion that the majority in the Court of appeal were right in their conclusion
that the document, Exhibit 8, was a ‘treaty’ within the meaning of that term as
used in s. 87  of the Indian Act  (R.S.C. 1952, c. 149). We therefore
think that in the circumstances of the case, the operation of s. 25 of the
Game Act (R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 160) was excluded by reason of the existence
of that treaty.”

It follows that if Exhibit 8 in White and Bob
which reads:

Know all men that we the Chiefs and people
of the Sanitch Tribe who have signed our names and made our marks to this Deed,
on the 6th day of February 1852 do consent to surrender entirely and forever,
to James Douglas the Agent of the Hudsons Bay Company, in Vancouver Island that
is to say for the Governor Deputy Governor and Committee of the same, the whole
of the lands situate and lying between Mount Douglas and Cowitchen Head on the
Canal de Arro and extending thence to the line running through the centre of
Vancouver Island north and south.

The condition of, or understanding of this
sale, is this, that our village sites and enclosed fields, are to be kept for
our own use, for the use of our children, and for those who may follow after
us, and the lands shall be properly surveyed hereafter; it is understood
however, that the land itself with these small exceptions, becomes the entire
property of the white people forewer; it is also understood that we are at
liberty to hunt over the unoccupied lands, and to carry on our fisheries as
formerly. We have received as payment—Forty one pounds thirteen shillings
and four pence.—In token whereof we have signed our names, and made our marks
at Fort Victoria, on the seventh day of February, One thousand eight hundred
and fifty two.

(Emphasis added.)

was a treaty within s. 87 of the Indian
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, so are Treaties 5 and 6 aforesaid.

Soon after the agreement in question was entered
into, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Smith[20],

[Page 537]

dealt with the effect of s. 12 of the Saskatchewan agreement which is identical
with s. 13 now under review and in that case Turgeon J.A. (later C.J.S.)
said:

Although this case is of great interest and
importance I do not think it will be necessary in disposing of it to examine
minutely the state of the law existing prior to recent date, nor the Indian
treaty or treaties referred to in the argument. If these treaties, or the
various Dominion or provincial statutes referred to have any present bearing on
the case it is only in so far as they may throw some light upon the
interpretation of certain words in the instrument which, in my opinion, now
governs the relations of these Indians with the game laws of Saskatchewan, and
to which I am about to refer.

The 24th enumeration of sec. 91 of the
British North America Act, 1867, ch. 3, confers upon the parliament of
Canada exclusive jurisdiction upon the subject of “Indians and Lands Reserved
for the Indians,” while, on the other hand, the provinces have power to make
laws concerning the hunting, fishing, preservation, etc. of game in the
province. As a result, controversies have arisen in the past as to the
application of provincial game laws to Indians: Rex v. Rodgers (1923) 2
W.W.R. 353, 33 Man. R. 139, 40
C.C.C. 51.

But in the years 1929 and 1930 something
occurred which, in my opinion, had the effect of recasting the jurisdiction of
the province of Saskatchewan in respect to the operation of its game laws upon our Indian
population. In December, 1929, an agreement was entered into between the
Dominion and the province having for its primary object the transfer from the
one to the other of the natural resources within the province. This transfer
was accompanied by many terms, some of which had to do with matters pertaining
to the Indians. Among these is par. 12 of the agreement, which reads as follows
(L.R. 1929-30, p. 293):

12. In order to secure to the Indians of
the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support
and subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the
Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries
thereof, provided, however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which
the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and
fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on
any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.

It is admitted in this case that the
accused was hunting for food.

This agreement between the Dominion and the
province was made “subject to its being approved by the Parliament of Canada
and the Legislature of the Province” and also to confirmation by the Parliament
of the United Kingdom.
Ratification by the Imperial Parliament was necessary in so far at least as the
agreement purported to make any change in the constitutional powers of the
Dominion or of the province. In a recent decision of this Court, Rex v.
Zaslavsky, ante p. 34, the learned Chief Justice quoted from the remarks of
Lord Watson in the course of the argument in C.P.R. v. Notre Dame de
Bonsecours Parish (1899) A.C. 367, 68 L.J.P.C. 54. The statement quoted by
the learned Chief Justice may fittingly be repeated here:

The Dominion cannot give jurisdiction or
leave jurisdiction with the province. The provincial Parliament cannot give
legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion Parliament. If they have it, either
one or the

[Page 538]

other of them, they have it by virtue of
the Act of 1867. I think we must get rid of the idea that either one or other
can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction.

Consequently no legislative jurisdiction
can be taken from the Dominion Parliament and bestowed upon a provincial
Legislature, or vice versa, without the intervention of the parliament
of the United Kingdom.

The Imperial statute confirming the
agreement is 1930, 20 & 21 Geo. V., ch. 26, sec. 1 of which
enacts that the agreement shall have the force of law “notwithstanding anything
in the British North America Act of 1867 or any Act amending the same,”
etc. It follows therefore that, whatever the situation may have been in earlier
years the extent to which Indians are now exempted from the operation of the
game laws of Saskatchewan is to
be determined by an interpretation of par. 12, supra, given force of law
by this Imperial statute. This paragraph says that the Indians are to have the
right to hunt, trap and fish for food in all seasons “on all unoccupied Crown
lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of
access”.

For the purposes of the present inquiry
we can confine ourselves to Crown lands (excluding lands owned by individuals
as to which some other question might arise) because this game preserve is
Crown land. The question then is (1) is it unoccupied Crown land, or (2) is it
occupied Crown land to which the Indians have a right of access? If it is
either of these no offence was committed by the accused.

(Emphasis added.)

Counsel for the accused, in proposing a
test for the meaning which must be given to the word “occupied” and
“unoccupied” referred to the treaty made between the Crown and certain tribes
of Indians near Carlton, on August 23, 1876, whereby, on the one hand, these
Indians consented to the surrender of their title of whatsoever nature in an
area of which this game preserve forms part and, on the other hand, the Crown
undertook certain obligations towards them and assured them certain rights and
privileges. As I have said, it is proper to consult this treaty in order to
glean from it whatever may throw some light on the meaning to be given to the
words in question. I would even say that we should endeavour, within the
bounds of propriety, to give such meaning to these words as would establish the
intention of the Crown and the Legislature to maintain the rights accorded to
the Indians by the treaty.

(Emphasis added.)

I have already dealt with the meaning of
s. 13 of the Manitoba
agreement. To me it is clear and unambiguous and by s. 1 of the British
North America Act 1930 which reads:

1. The agreements set out in the Schedule
to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law
notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any
Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order
in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act
as aforesaid.

has the force of law, notwithstanding “any Act
of the Parliament of Canada”. The Migratory Birds Convention Act is an
Act of the Parliament of Canada. One would suppose that that should end the
matter, but it is urged

[Page 539]

that s. 1 of the British North America
Act 1930 does not necessarily refer to every provision of the agreement
and, in particular, that s. 13 is outside the plain and unambiguous
language of the Act in that Ottawa and Westminster
could not conceivably have intended s. 13 to take precedence over the Migratory
Birds Convention Act of 1917. One should, I think, be slow to accept the
argument that the negotiators of the Manitoba agreement and Parliament at Ottawa were in 1929 and 1930 totally forgetful of the existence of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act of 1917. Rather is it not more logical that knowing of
the solemnity with which the Indian treaties had been negotiated and how highly
they were regarded by the Indians, neither the negotiators of the agreement nor
the Government at Ottawa had
the slightest intention of breaching those treaties.

If it had been intended that the Migratory
Birds Convention Act should take precedence, it would have been a simple
matter to have said so in the agreement or in the Manitoba Natural Resources Act. Much would have
to be read into s. 13 of the agreement to make it subject to the Migratory
Birds Convention Act. I am not prepared to add exclusions which Parliament
and Westminster did not see fit
to do.

It is argued that this is a case for the
application of the rule of construction that Parliament is not presumed to
legislate in breach of a treaty or in any manner inconsistent with the comity
of nations and the established rules of international law. The rule does not,
of course, come into operation if a statute is unambiguous for in that event
its provisions must be followed even if they are contrary to the established
rules of international law. The case of Inland Revenue Commissioners v.
Collco Dealings Ltd.[21] is a
case in which this very argument was made. In that case the Court was being
asked to read into a section of the Income Tax Act 1952 additional
words which would enlarge the meaning of the section so as to include
persons not included by the precise words of the enactment but which were
included under an agreement between the British Government and the Republic of
Ireland providing for exemption

[Page 540]

from tax where the claimant was a resident in the
Republic of Ireland and was not
a resident in the United Kingdom.

In dealing with the argument, Viscount Simonds
said at pp. 18 and 19:

It has been urged that the general words of
the subsection should be so construed as not to have the effect of imposing
or appearing to impose the will of Parliament upon persons not within its
jurisdiction. This argument, which had influenced the special commissioners,
was not advanced before this House. A somewhat similar argument was, however,
pressed upon your Lordships and was perhaps more strongly than any other relied
on by the appellant company. It was to the effect that to apply
section 4(2) to the appellant company would create a breach of the 1926
and following agreements, and would be inconsistent with the comity of nations
and the established rules of international law: the subsection must,
accordingly, be so construed as to avoid this result.

My Lords, the language that I have used is
taken from a passage at p. 148 of the 10th edition of “Maxwell on the
Interpretation of Statutes” which ends with the sentence: “But if the statute
is unambiguous, its provisions must be followed even if they are contrary to
international law.” It would not, I think, be possible to state in clearer
language and with less ambiguity the determination of the legislature to put an
end in all and every case to a practice which was a gross misuse of a
concession. What, after all, is involved in the argument of the appellant? It
is nothing else than that, when Parliament said “under any enactment,” it meant
“any enactment except…” But it was not found easy to state precisely the terms
of the exception. The best that I could get was “except an enactment which is
part of a reciprocal arrangement with a sovereign foreign state.” It is said that
the plain words of the statute are to be disregarded and these words
arbitrarily inserted in order to observe the comity of nations and the
established rules of international law. I am not sure upon which of these
high-sounding phrases the appellant company chiefly relies. But I would answer
that neither comity nor rule of international law can be invoked to prevent a
sovereign state from taking what steps it thinks fit to protect its own revenue
laws from gross abuse, or to save its own citizens from unjust discrimination
in favour of foreigners. To demand that the plain words of the statute should
be disregarded in order to do that very thing is an extravagance to which this
House will not, I hope, give ear.

I would paraphrase the latter part of this statement
as follows in applying it to the Indians of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta
by saying: But I would answer that neither comity nor rule of international
law can be invoked to prevent a sovereign state (Canada) from taking what steps
it thinks fit to protect its own aboriginal population (Indians) from being
deprived of their ancient rights to hunt and to fish for food assured to them
in Treaties 5 and 6 made with them.

It took those steps when it included s. 13
of the Manitoba agreement,
confirmed by the Manitoba Natural Re-

[Page 541]

sources Act and
petitioned Parliament at Westminster to enact s. 1 of the British North America Act 1930. If
there is inconsistency or repugnancy between the Migratory Birds Convention
Act and the Manitoba Natural Resources Act the later prevails over
the earlier; British Columbia Railway Co. v. Stewart[22] and Summers v. Holborn District Board
of Works[23]. It
is difficult, I think, to find language more forthright and less ambiguous than
s. 1 of the British North America Act 1930. To repeat, it reads:

1. The agreements set out in the Schedule
to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law
notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any
Act amending the same, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any Order
in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act
as aforesaid.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and quash
the conviction. The appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the
Courts below.

PIGEON J.:—The facts are summarized in the
reasons of my brother Judson with whom I am in agreement.

I wish to add that, in my view, this is a case
for the application of the rule of construction that Parliament is not presumed
to legislate in breach of a treaty or in any manner inconsistent with the
comity of nations and the established rules of international law. It is a rule
that is not often applied, because if a statute is unambiguous, its provisions
must be followed even if they are contrary to international law, as was said
recently in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Collco Dealings Ltd.[24], where all relevant authorities are
reviewed. In that case, the House of Lords came to the conclusion that the
intent of Parliament was clear and unmistakable and, therefore, the plain words
of a statute could not be disregarded in order to observe the comity of nations
and the established rules of international law. However, the principle of
construction was recognized as applicable in a proper case.

Here we must not be misled by the clear and
unambiguous provision of section 1 of the British North America Act 1930
into believing that, because it is there said that

[Page 542]

the agreement shall have the force of law
notwithstanding any act of the Parliament of Canada, every provision of the
agreement was intended to override all federal legislation.

The question to be decided is whether in par. 13
of the agreement, the words “Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from
time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof”
contemplate laws of Canada as
well as laws of Manitoba. The
language certainly is not that which one would normally use in referring to
both classes of laws. It is rather the language one would be expected to use in
a provision intended to subject the Indians to provincial game laws. This is
further borne out by the fact that the proviso on which this appeal is based is
in a form of an assurance by the province only. Can it be said that where
Canada stipulates in the agreement: “that the said Indians shall have the
right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and
fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year…” the intention was
expressed in clear language and without ambiguity to amend the Migratory
Birds Convention Act contrary to Canada’s international obligations? In my
view, the least that can be said is that the intention to derogate from the
statute implementing the treaty is not clearly expressed. It is perfectly
possible without doing violence to the language used to construe the provision
under consideration as applicable solely to provincial laws and thus to avoid
any conflict.

It must also be considered that an agreement is
not to be construed as applying to anything beyond its stated scope unless the
intention to do so is unmistakable. Here the purpose of the agreement is stated
in its preamble to be that the Province be placed in a position of equality
with the other provinces with respect to the administration and control of its
natural resources. It is quite consistent with this declared object to provide
that provincial laws respecting the use of some resources, namely fish and
game, shall apply to Indians subject to a restriction the effect of which is to
carry out Canada’s treaty obligations towards the Indians in that respect. On
the other hand, it would not only be foreign to this object but even
inconsistent with it, to provide for an implied modification of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act. The result would be to

[Page 543]

enact a provision having no relation with the
stated purpose of the agreement and also to create a lack of uniformity by
establishing in favour of the Indians in one province an exception that does
not exist in favour of the Indians in other provinces.

In Danby v. Coutts & Co.[25], it was held that a power of
attorney granted in general terms for the purpose stated in the recitals, to
act for the grantor during his absence from England, must be construed as limited to the duration of such absence.
Concerning statutes, Maxwell says (The Interpretation of Statutes, 11th ed.,
p. 79): “General words and phrases, therefore, however wide and
comprehensive they may be in their literal sense, must, usually, be construed
as being limited to the actual objects of the Act.” and he adds quoting Lord
Halsbury in Leach v. Rex[26], “It
would be ‘perfectly monstrous’ to construe the general words of the Act so as
to alter the previous policy of the law.”

On Appeal
From The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan

Criminal law—Care and control of motor
vehicle while intoxicated or under influence of narcotic drug—Whether two
offences—Whether charge bad for duplicity—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 222, 492, 703, 704, 727.

The respondent was convicted on a charge of
having had the care and control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under
the influence of a narcotic drug, contrary to s. 222  of the Criminal
Code . His appeal by trial de novo was dismissed. He then appealed to
the Court of Appeal where his submission that the information charged two
offences was accepted. The Court of Appeal held that the information was bad
for duplicity and that ss. 704(1) and 727(4) of the Code were not applicable.
The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Section 222  of the Criminal Code  does
not create one offence of driving while intoxicated and another offence of
driving while under the influence of a narcotic drug. The essence of the
offence is driving while in a certain condition, there being two different ways
in which the prohibited condition may be brought about. Consequently, there was no duplicity in the information.

Droit criminel—Conduire un véhicule à moteur
ou en avoir la garde, étant en état d’ivresse ou sous l’influence d’un
narcotique—S’agit-il de deux infractions—L’acte d’accusation est-il défectueux
parce qu’il est double—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 222, 492,
703, 704, 727.

L’intimé a été trouvé coupable sur un acte
d’accusation l’accusant d’avoir conduit un véhicule à moteur ou d’en avoir eu
la garde alors qu’il était en état d’ivresse ou sous l’influence d’un
narcotique, contrairement à l’art. 222  du Code criminel . Son appel au
moyen d’un procès de novo a été rejeté. Il en a alors appelé à la Cour
d’Appel où on a accepté sa prétention que l’acte d’accusation imputait deux
infractions. La Cour d’Appel a statué que l’acte d’accusation était défectueux
parce qu’il était double et que les dispositions des arts. 704(1) et 727(4) du
Code ne s’appliquaient pas. La Couronne a obtenu la permission d’en appeler à
cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli et la déclaration de culpabilité rétablie.

L’article 222  du Code criminel  ne crée
pas une infraction de conduire, étant en état d’ivresse et une autre infraction
de conduire, étant sous l’influence d’un narcotique. L’essence de l’infraction
est de con-

[Page 714]

duire alors que la personne est dans un
certain état. Il y a deux différentes manières de provoquer cet état prohibé. Conséquemment,
l’acte d’accusation n’était pas double.

APPEL par la Couronne d’un jugement de la
Cour d’Appel de Saskatchewan mettant de côté une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel accueilli.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan setting aside the respondent’s conviction.
Appeal allowed.

Serge Kujaiva, for the appellant.

Leslie R. Meiklejohn, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—Urgel R. Brunet was convicted by a
magistrate on the charge that he

on the 15th day of October, A.D. 1965, at
Prince Albert, in the said Province, while intoxicated or under the influence
of a narcotic drug, did unlawfully have the care and control of a motor vehicle,
to wit, a 1960 station wagon, on 6th Avenue East, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,
contrary to the provisions of section 222  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

His appeal by trial de novo was dismissed
and he appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan where the only point
raised was that the conviction could not stand because the information charged
two offences.

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan accepted
this submission and held that the information was bad for duplicity, and that
ss. 704(1)  and 727(4)  of the Criminal Code  were not applicable. The
appeal was accordingly allowed.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the
following grounds:

(a) That the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan
erred in law in holding that duplicity is not a defect as contemplated by
s. 727(4)  and s. 704(1)  of the Criminal Code ;

(b) That the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan
erred in law in quashing the conviction herein on the basis that the
information is bad in law there being no such concept in criminal law;

[Page 715]

(c) That the said Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan erred in law in holding that there was in fact duplicity in the
information herein.

The only question that arises on this appeal is
whether there was, in fact, duplicity in this information. In my opinion there
was not. This information follows the wording in s. 222  of the Criminal
Code . That section does not create one offence of driving while
intoxicated and another offence of driving while under the influence of a
narcotic drug. The essence of the offence is driving while in a certain
condition, there being two different ways in which the prohibited condition may
be brought about. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are:

492. (1) Each count in an indictment shall
in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if
it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable
offence therein specified.

(2) The statement referred to in
subsection (1) may be (b) in the words of the enactment that
describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable
offence, or…

703. No information, summons, conviction,
order or process shall be deemed to charge two offences or to be uncertain by
reason only that it states that the alleged offence was committed

(a) in different modes, or

(b) in respect of one or
other of several articles, either conjunctively or disjunctively.

Recent illustrations of the application of this
principle are R. v. Schultz[1]; Cox
and Paton v. The Queen[2]; and
Kipp v. Attorney General for Ontario[3].
The case is distinct from Rex v. Archer[4].

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction. There is provision for the respondent’s costs in the order granting
leave to appeal.

Appeal allowed.

Solicitor for the appellant: The Attorney
General for Saskatchewan, Regina.

Socilitor for the respondent: Koch,
Meiklejohn & Scrivens, Regina.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Evidence—Evidence given by plaintiffs’
former solicitor on behalf of defendants—Duty of solicitor to refrain from
disclosing confidential information unless client waives privilege—Impropriety
of putting to solicitor questions involving disclosure of confidential
information without evidence of proper waiver—Evidence in violation of
privilege should not be received.

Trial—Plaintiffs interviewed by judge in
chambers without counsel being present and without reporter—Interference with
clients’ rights to benefit of advice of counsel—Departure from rule of judicial
conduct.

The defendants brought an application for
judgment in accordance with an alleged settlement with the plaintiffs for
claims made in an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The motion
came on for hearing on February 10, 1966, and the proceedings continued
throughout that day and again on May 27, 1966. Judgment for the adult plaintiffs was granted on May 27 in terms
of the settlement alleged and judgment for an infant plaintiff was reserved. On
appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal and an appeal was
then brought to this Court.

At the hearing on February 10, 1966, the
solicitor who had acted for the plaintiffs until February 8, 1966, appeared under subpoena
and gave evidence on behalf of the defendants. Conflicting sworn statements as
to whether the then counsel for the plaintiffs objected to the giving of
evidence by the former counsel were subsequently made.

On May 27, 1966, after the plaintiffs had
given evidence, the judge requested that he interview the plaintiffs in his
chambers, and he asked counsel to consent that this be done without the
presence of counsel. Such consent was given, and the interview was held but
without a court reporter being present.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed; new trial ordered.

It was improper for a client’s former
solicitor not to claim the privilege of refusing to disclose confidential
information without showing that it had been properly waived. Also, doubt was
expressed about the propriety of putting to a solicitor questions that involve
the disclo-

[Page 665]

sure of confidential information without
first bringing in evidence of a proper waiver. In any case, because the
client’s privilege is a duty owed to the Court, no objection ought to be
necessary and the evidence in violation of the privilege should not be
received.

As to the plaintiffs having been interviewed
by the judge of first instance in his chambers without counsel being present
and without a reporter, this was a serious interference with the clients’
rights to the benefit of advice of counsel and was also a departure from the
rule of judicial conduct that a judge ought never to put himself in a situation
where one of the parties is apt to be induced to look upon him as an adviser
rather than an impartial arbitrator.

An acceptable record as to what happened in
the judge’s chambers was lacking, and in view of the state of confusion as to
whether there had been consent on which to base the judgment of the first
instance, this Court was of the opinion that the plaintiffs should have a right
to have their action tried in open court.

Beer v. Ward (1821),
Jacob 77, applied; Majcenic v. Natale [1968] 1 O.R. 189, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dismissing an
appeal from a judgment of Richardson J. Appeal allowed.

R.N. Starr, Q.C., for the plaintiffs,
appellants.

John J. Fitzpatrick, Q.C., for the
defendants, respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on June 6, 1967. By that judgment, the Court dismissed an appeal from Richardson J.
who had given judgment on May 27, 1966. The appeal was carried in the aforesaid
style of cause but it appears that Marjorie Bell, one of the plaintiffs,
attained the age of 21 years during the course of the litigation. It also
appears that the proper name of the infant plaintiff is David Guy Bell. These
changes should be reflected in the style of cause and the formal order of this
Court should be issued showing the plaintiffs as HELEN BELL, JAMES E. BELL,
MARJORIE BELL and DAVID GUY BELL, infant under the age of twenty‑one
years, by his next friend Kenneth Bell and the said KENNETH BELL and THE
ONTARIO HOSPITAL SERVICES COMMISSION.

The circumstances involved are rather intricate
and of the most unusual nature and it is, therefore, necessary to relate them
in some detail. On August 27, 1962, the plain-

[Page 666]

tiff James Bell, was operating a motor vehicle
owned by the plaintiff Kenneth Bell, his father, and with passengers. the
plaintiffs Helen Bell, his mother, and David Grey Bell (properly called David
Guy Bell) and Marjorie Bell.
The vehicle came into contact with one owned by the defendant John William
Charles Smith due, to what was alleged by the plaintiffs, to be the negligence
of the said defendant Smith. One Commiski, an employee of the Pilot Insurance
Company, recommended that the plaintiffs consult either Mr. Henry Schreiber,
Q.C., or Mr. John Agro, Q.C., to act on their behalf. The plaintiffs chose
to consult Mr. Henry Schreiber. Due, it was said, to the continued serious
physical conditions of the various plaintiffs, a statement of claim was not
issued until November 12, 1965. A statement of defence was issued on December 21, 1965, and issue was joined on
December 22, 1965.

On January 6, 1966, the various plaintiffs were examined for discovery, and on January
11, 1966, the solicitors for the defendants gave notice of motion of an
application for leave to make a payment into court in full satisfaction of the
claims of the plaintiffs. These examinations for discovery and this notice of
application for leave to pay into court seem to have very much increased the
tempo of the discussions for settlement of the action between the solicitors
for the plaintiffs and for the defendants. The solicitor for the plaintiffs
conferred with his client Mrs. Helen Bell by telephone almost immediately
after the examinations for discovery and then the various plaintiffs attended
his office on January 10 and on January 12. During these latter occasions there
were telephone conversations between the solicitors for the plaintiffs and for
the defendants, and the amounts of the settlements were discussed in great
detail. The record contains many long memoranda setting out how various amounts
were arrived at.

The plaintiff Helen Bell has testified that,
after a very long conference on January 12, 1966, she and her co-plaintiffs agreed to the settlement which was
proposed and which her then solicitor, Mr. Schreiber, said was the utmost
he could obtain from the solicitor for the defendants. Mr. Schreiber seems
to have been greatly concerned at the possible penalty in costs which the plaintiffs
would have incurred had the application for leave to pay into court been

[Page 667]

granted and then the payment made thereunder
have exceeded what the plaintiffs would have recovered at trial.

So soon as the plaintiffs had, with great
reluctance, expressed their agreement to settle in the amounts outlined by
Mr. Schreiber in this conference, he telephoned at once to Mr. Agro,
the solicitor for the defendants, to inform him of such agreement, and on the
same day wrote a letter in which he set out the matter in these terms:

This will confirm the settlement in the
above action on the following terms:


 
  
  MARJORIE BELL
  
  
  —inclusive of special and general—
  
  
  $15,550.00
  
 
 
  
  HELEN BELL
  
  
  —inclusive of special and general—
  
  
  10,700.00
  
 
 
  
  GUY BELL
  
  
  —inclusive of special and general—
  
  
  6,900.00
  
 
 
  
  JAMES BELL
  
  
  —inclusive of special and general—
  
  
  4,250.00
  
 
 
  
  COSTS
  
  
  —
  
  
  
  3,740.00
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
  $41,140.00
  
 


It will be noted that the figure of $3,740 for
costs is 10 per cent of the total amount which was payable to the four
different plaintiffs. That amount of $3,740 was to be paid by the defendants to
Mr. Schreiber. It is the evidence of Mrs. Helen Bell, one of the
plaintiffs, that having agreed to this settlement then for the first time
Mr. Schreiber informed the plaintiffs that in addition to that amount of
$3,740 which Mr. Schreiber was to receive from the defendants the
plaintiffs would have to pay another 10 per cent to him on account of solicitor‑and-client
costs and further that since the court would not approve of the deduction of
any amount from that which was to go to the infant Guy Bell the other
plaintiffs would have to divide the 10 per cent deduction on his account from
their shares. This evidence Mr. Schreiber denies, although he does admit
that it was his ordinary practice to charge a solicitor-and-client bill if he
had to prepare for trial and in this case he certainly would have had to
prepare for trial very shortly as the conversation took place on January 12 and
the trial was to take place within a couple of weeks thereafter. It was further
the evidence of Mrs. Helen Bell, and this was also corroborated by the
other plaintiffs, that the whole basis of the settlement was that it should be
accepted and approved in complete form and in fact that one of them could not
settle without the others settling. This was not denied by Mr. Schreiber
and it becomes important when one considers the judgment of the learned judge
of first instance.

[Page 668]

The plaintiff Helen Bell testified that having
attempted on that very day, January 12, 1966, to telephone to Mr. Schreiber
to say that the plaintiffs had recanted from their agreement to settle on the
basis outlined, she succeeded, on January 13, 1966, in giving that message to
Mr. Schreiber’s secretary who undertook to pass it on to her employer. She
continued that then they were telephoned by the said secretary on January 14
and asked to come down to Mr. Schreiber’s office immediately. Helen Bell
continued in her testimony to outline a conference in Mr. Schreiber’s
office on January 20 and her letter later of the same date to
Mr. Schreiber in which she demanded an increase in her claim in the amount
of $75,000 and then her reattendance on Mr. Schreiber on January 21. At
that time, Mr. Schreiber asked her to sign and have her co-plaintiffs sign
a document which I quote hereunder in full:

Mrs. Bell testified that she did not
understand that document and that she refused to sign it. It was never signed
by any plaintiff.

On February 4, 1966, Mr. Schreiber wrote to the plaintiff Mrs. Helen Bell in
the following words:

Please be advised” that your case is No. 10
on the peremptory list of the Supreme Court.

I have told you on numerous occasions the
position you now find yourself in and have asked you on numerous occasions to
sign the document of instruction which I have prepared and which you have had
in your possession for the past two weeks. I must insist you give me your
instructions not later than Monday afternoon, February 7th, 1966, at 4:00 p.m.

On February 7, 1966, a notice of motion was
served on the various plaintiffs. This was for an application to be presented
on February 10, 1966, at 10:00
a.m. for judgment in accordance with the settlement purported to have been made
on January 12, 1966. So soon as
the plaintiff Helen Bell received service of notice of that application, she
wrote to Mr. Schreiber. The last two sentences of that letter read:

The notice of motion contains an affidavit
of John L. Agro setting out certain facts we believe to be incorrect.

The matter is of serious interest and
Unless we receive a reply of your intentions by telephone (No. 772-3224)
arrangements will be made to have counsel defend the motion and have you
removed as solicitor on the record.

On February 8, 1966, that is, the next day,
Mr. Schreiber served a notice of motion on the solicitor for the
defendants

[Page 670]

to be heard at the same time as the motion for
judgment. The relief asked in Mr. Sehreiber’s motion was for an order to
set aside the settlement in the action and to restore the said action to the
list of actions to be tried at this sitting of the Court. Also on that 8th day
of February Helen Bell and the other plaintiffs signed a notice of change of
solicitors from Mr. Schreiber to Messrs. Ballachey, Moore and Hart. I
should add that by a document entitled “Notice of Dispute” and dated February
4, 1966, the various plaintiffs had given notice to both Mr. Schreiber and
Mr. Agro that “out of court settlement offered in full satisfaction of
each of their claims is not acceptable and is refused and further take notice
that it is their desire to proceed to trial by judge and jury for proper and
just assessment for specific and general damages”. On February 10, 1966, the motion for judgment in
accordance with the settlement came on for hearing before Richardson J., in Hamilton. Mr. Agro appeared for the
applicants and Mr. Ballachey for the respondents.

It would appear that the first witness called by
the applicants on the application was Henry L. Schreiber, the solicitor
who had acted, until February 8, 1966, for the plaintiffs. It is
Mr. Ballachey’s recollection that he objected to Mr. Schreiber’s
giving evidence. Mr. Ballachey so testified on examination upon an
affidavit which he had filed and to which reference will be made hereafter. The
record in the appeal case shows no such objection but that record purports to
be only “Extract from Proceedings viva voce evidence submitted on the motion”.
Mr. Agro executed an affidavit on June 2, 1967, and he states in para. 5
thereof:

H.L Schreiber, Esq., the former counsel for
the Plaintiffs, appeared under subpoena and gave evidence on behalf of the
Defendants. Mr. Ballachey raised no objection to giving of evidence by
Mr. Schreiber.

“Counsel should not give a proof of evidence of
what occurred at a hearing in which he was professionally engaged.” This
quotation is from Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 3, p. 68, referring
to the Annual Statement of the General Council of the Bar, 1937, p. 7. Under
the circumstances of this case, counsel for both parties no doubt felt that
they could not properly discharge their duty to their clients without
submitting to the Court of Appeal evidence by affidavit followed on one side by
cross-examination. I am not suggesting that this was improper under the

[Page 671]

circumstances. However, this shows how important
it is to have all court proceedings conducted in such way that there can be no
justification for such a course of action. That this resulted in the Court
being invited to choose between conflicting statements made under oath by
distinguished members of the Bar clearly demonstrates the wisdom of the
aforementioned rule and the desirability of taking every precaution to ensure
that the paramount interests of the clients will not require it to be broken.

This regrettable occurrence was occasioned by
insufficient concern for a fundamental rule, namely, the duty of a solicitor to
refrain from disclosing confidential information unless his client waives the
privilege.

It is rather astounding that Mr. Schreiber
should be subpoenaed to give evidence on behalf of the defendants as against
his former clients and that he should produce his complete file including many
memoranda and other material all of which were privileged as against the
plaintiffs and whether the plaintiffs’ counsel objected or not that he should
be permitted to so testify and so produce without the consent of the plaintiffs
being requested and obtained.

Lord Chancellor Eldon said, in Beer v. Ward[1], at p. 80:

…it would be the duty of any Court to stop
him if he was about to disclose confidential matters…the Court knows the
privilege of the client, and it must be taken for granted that the attorney
will act rightly, and claim that privilege; or that if he does not, the Court
will make him claim it.

Because the solicitor owes to his former client
a duty to claim the privilege when applicable, it is improper for him not to
claim it without showing that it has been properly waived. Especially is this
so when, as here, the circumstances are such as to make it most unlikely that a
waiver would be given. Also, because it is improper to induce a breach of duty,
I have serious doubts about the propriety of putting to a solicitor questions
that involve the disclosure of confidential information without first bringing
in evidence of a proper waiver. In any case, because the client’s privilege is
a duty owed to the Court, no objection ought to be necessary and the evidence
in violation of the privilege should not be received.

[Page 672]

The proceedings continued throughout February 10
and again on May 27, 1966. Mr. Ballachey, in his affidavit, to which
reference has been made above, has testified:

5. That the matter came on again on the
27th of May 1966 and after considerable evidence, had been given by the
plaintiffs, the learned judge requested that he interview the plaintiffs, in
His Chambers, and asked counsel to consent that this be done without counsel
being present, and such interview did take place, but to the best of the
writer’s recollection, the infant, David Guy Bell, was not present at the said
interview.

6. That to the best of my knowledge,
information and belief, no Court reporter was present during the interview in
the learned Judge’s Chambers between the learned trial judge and the
Plaintiffs.

In Majcenic v. Natale[2], Evans J.A., giving judgment for the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, was dealing with a case where certain
conversations with counsel had taken place in judge’s chambers and were not
recorded. At p. 200, he said:

The necessity for filing in this Court the
material to which I have referred would have been eliminated if the procedure
recommended in Berends et al. v. Taylor, an unreported decision of this
Court dated April 5, 1966, had been followed. The procedure recommended therein
(in which the propriety of striking out the jury notice was in question) was
that the trial Judge should either hear argument in open Court in the absence
of the jury panel or have the reporter in Chambers to record the discussion on
the question of whether or not he should dispense with the jury.

That injunction is even more applicable in such
a case as the present where not the counsel but the clients themselves were
interviewed by the learned judge in his chambers without counsel being present
and without a reporter. Indeed it is difficult to understand why counsel should
ever be excluded from the judge’s chambers when their clients are being
interviewed by the judge. Counsel is thereby put in an impossible situation. He
cannot object without risk of offence to the Court and perhaps raising
suspicion in the minds of his clients. Also such a request is apt to reflect
adversely against him, or to be considered in this light by his clients. Even
more serious is the fact that it makes it practically impossible for him to
discharge his duty to advise his clients: how can he tell them that they should
refuse the Court’s invitation? On final analysis, this is nothing less than a
serious interference with the clients’ rights to the benefit of the advice of
counsel besides being a depar-

[Page 673]

ture from the rule of judicial conduct that a
judge ought never to put himself in a situation where one of the parties is apt
to be induced to look upon him as an adviser rather than an impartial
arbitrator. Even if the trial judge was convinced that the proposed settlement
was in the plaintiffs’ best interests and they were apt to suffer great detriment
by refusing it, a commendable concern for the interests of the infant plaintiff
could not justify a departure from the rules of judicial behaviour with respect
to the plaintiffs of full age. The importance of the regrettable lack of any
acceptable record as to what occurred in the learned judge’s chambers is made
plain immediately hereafter.

From what appears in the record in the appeal
case, upon such conference having been completed counsel for the defendants
turned to the question of the quantum of damages of the infant. That was
discussed for several pages and then the learned judge inquired “anything
else?” to which Mr. Ballachey replied, “It is unnecessary to deal with the
motion of the matter of the amendment to the statement of claim under these
circumstances”. His Lordship agreed and then Mr. Ballachey requested “Will
Your Lordship give consideration to the carriage of the matter of the issue of
the judgment?” The learned judge replied “I think the record is here, let
Mr. Agro draft the judgment and send it to you…and it is here in
Hamilton…”

It would appear therefore that at some time
after the recess and conference to which I have referred the learned judge must
have endorsed the record. That endorsement was in these words:

On consent of parties and without prejudice
to the right of the plaintiffs judgment to issue for the adult plaintiffs…

The formal judgment dated May 27, 1966, but not
issued until June 8, 1966, in para. 1 provides:

1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that
the action herein was settled by the solicitors for the parties so far as it
respects the plaintiffs Helen Bell, James E. Bell and Marjorie Bell, who is now
of the full age of twenty-one years, in accordance with the aforesaid minutes
of settlement filed.

A search of the appeal case and also the
original papers shows that the only consent minutes of settlement deal with the
proposed judgment to be given in relation to the claim of the infant David Guy
Bell which, of course, was subject

[Page 674]

to the approval of the Court and approval of
which was reserved by Richardson J. in his judgment of May 27, 1966.

When one considers the wording of the formal
judgment which I have recited above and compares it with the wording on the
endorsement of the record signed by the learned trial judge, it seems quite
plain that the formal judgment is simply an error. There were no consent
minutes filed and the evidence plainly was that the plaintiffs had never signed
any consent. The consent of the then plaintiffs’ solicitor, Mr. Schreiber,
had been in the form of his letter of January 12, 1966, which I have quoted
above. I am of the view that that letter could not, on May 27, 1966, be
accepted as a consent to judgment by the solicitors for the plaintiffs when
counsel for the plaintiffs, who had come upon the record by a notice of change
of solicitors as early as February 8th previous, was in court opposing any
judgment on consent and insisting that the trial should go on. This is not one
of the many cases where a solicitor, either acting without instructions or
contrary to his instructions, had consented to an order which had been made and
then his clients sought, in further proceedings, to have that order set aside.
There had in this case been no judgment of the Court prior to the judgment of
Richardson J. on May 27, 1966, and any consent to such a judgment as was
given by that learned judge was being strongly opposed by the person who was
then counsel, on the record, for the plaintiffs.

If one accepts as final the form of the
endorsement made by the learned judge on the record then, as pointed out, that
endorsement reads: “On consent of the parties…” The import of those words is
not that it was on the consent of Mr. Schreiber but on the consent of the
appellants here Helen Bell, James E. Bell and Marjorie Bell. So understood,
those words avoid what, in my view, is the quite untenable inference that the
learned judge purported to act on the consent of a solicitor when the clients
were in court denying that they consented and doing so through the mouth of a
different counsel. The difficulty is to find the consent of those parties to
such settlement. There is not one word in the record as printed in the appeal
case which would indicate that either the parties or the then counsel,
Mr. Ballachey, made any consent whatsoever. If the consent occurred when
the learned judge conferred with the clients in his chambers, neither counsel
nor reporter being

[Page 675]

present, then certainly the conduct of the
plaintiffs in carrying an appeal, first to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and then to this Court, indicates
that they do not understand that they consented before His Lordship in his
chambers to any such judgment.

When the disposition in the Court of Appeal for Ontario is considered, there arises a similar
difficulty in understanding what occurred. The Court gave no written reasons.
Among the material filed in this Court was the appeal book used by McLennan
J.A., and on the face of that appeal book there are written these words:
“Appeal dismissed without costs on grounds that Mr. Ballachey was
representing his clients in open court. 6th June 1967.” If those words
represent the ground upon which the appeal was dismissed, and there can be no
certainty of this, then they give rise to another basis for understanding the
judgment of the first instance. The inference from those words must be that the
judgment of the learned judge was based not on any consent minutes signed by
Mr. Schreiber, not on any consent made by the parties in the judge’s
chambers, but on Mr. Ballachey’s consent in court. Mr. Ballachey, in
his affidavit, has denied that he gave such consent. Mr. Agro, who
appeared as counsel for the defendants, has testified in his affidavit that
Mr. Ballachey did consent. In the “Extract from Proceedings viva voce
evidence submitted on the motion”, there appear no words of consent attributed
to Mr. Ballachey and certainly he signed no such consent.

In view of this state of most regrettable
confusion, I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs should have a right to have
their action tried in open court and that the appeal must be allowed.

I would award to the appellants the costs in
this Court and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The costs of the new trial and of the application for judgment
from which this appeal arises should be reserved to the judge presiding at such
new trial.

Appeal allowed with costs; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trial—Indictable
offence—Accused electing trial by judge and jury—Magistrate proceeding with
preliminary inquiry—Accused re-electing trial by magistrate and pleading
guilty—Whether magistrate had jurisdiction to permit change of election and
thereupon to try accused—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 468.

The accused was charged under s. 79(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code  that he: “unlawfully did make or construct a
home-made bomb with intent to cause an explosion of an explosive substance that
is likely to cause serious bodily harm or death to persons or is likely to
cause serious damage to property”. He elected trial by judge and jury and the
magistrate proceeded with a preliminary inquiry. After the Crown had adduced
much of its evidence, the accused, through his counsel, addressed the Court and
requested permission to re-elect to be tried by the magistrate, indicating that
he wished to plead guilty to the charge. The magistrate assented to the request
and the accused pleaded guilty. After further evidence was taken as to the
circumstances of the offence charged, the accused was sentenced to six years’
imprisonment. An appeal both as to conviction and sentence was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal, one member of the Court dissenting. An appeal was then brought
to this Court and the submission was made that the magistrate, once he had
proceeded with the preliminary inquiry after the election by the accused
against summary trial, had no jurisdiction to entertain a re-election and then
proceed to convict the accused and sentence him.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

At the conclusion of the argument of counsel for
the appellant, the following judgment was delivered:

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for the Court):—Mr. Meinhardt,
we do not need to call upon you. We are all in agreement with the reasons of
MacKay and McLennan JJ.A. in the Court of Appeal and accordingly the appeal is

contrairement à l’art. 79(1)  (a) du Code criminel . Il a choisi
d’être jugé par un juge et un jury, et le magistrat a procédé à l’enquête
préliminaire. Une grande partie de la preuve de la Couronne avait été présentée
lorsque l’appelant, par l’entremise de son avocat, a demandé à la Cour la
permission d’être jugé par le magistrat, laissant entendre qu’il avait
l’intention de plaider coupable. Le magistrat a accordé cette requête et
l’appelant a plaidé coupable. Après la présentation d’une preuve relative aux
circonstances de l’infraction, l’appelant a été condamné à un emprisonnement de
six ans. Un appel de la déclaration de culpabilité et de la sentence a été rejeté
par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d’appel. L’appelant en a appelé à cette
Cour. Il soutient que le magistrat, ayant commencé l’enquête préliminaire après

BRITISH COLUMBIA

XVI of the Criminal Code —Whether accused entitled to have or to examine
transcript of evidence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 453, 454, 471, 555.

The appellant was tried by a magistrate,
under Part XVI of the Criminal Code , and was convicted of fraud and
false pretences. In order to determine whether an appeal was advisable, he
requested the respondent, the court reporter, to make a transcript of the Court
proceedings available to him without charge and, in the alternative, that he be
permitted to inspect the transcript of the proceedings. His request having been
refused, he applied to the Court for a writ of mandamus. The judge refused the
application and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The accused
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL

Criminal law—Leave to appeal—Whether
question of law—Whether magistrate properly exercised discretion as to sanity
of accused—Whether accused deprived of right to counsel—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 524(1), 597(1)(b)—Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44.

The applicant was convicted of unlawfully
having in his possession an offensive weapon. His appeal was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia. On his application for leave to appeal to this Court, two grounds
were urged by his counsel: (1) that the magistrate should have directed that an
issue be tried to determine whether the accused, because of insanity, was
incapable of conducting his defence; (2) that the accused was deprived of his
right to counsel and to a fair trial.

Held: The
application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.

Under the provisions of s. 597(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code , leave to appeal to this Court may be granted on
any question of law alone. No question of law was involved in the determination
of whether the magistrate had properly exercised his discretion under
s. 524(1) of the Code. In any event, it appeared that the magistrate had
carried on an investigation. The sufficiency of that investigation as well as
the conclusion to which the magistrate came, are not matters involving a
question of law.

[Page 475]

There was no evidence that the applicant was
deprived of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay or was
deprived of the right to a fair hearing.

597(1)(b)—Déclaration canadienne des Droits, 1960 (Can.), c. 44.

Le requérant a été trouvé coupable d’avoir eu
illégalement en sa possession une arme offensive. Son appel fut rejeté par la
Cour d’appel de la Colombie-Britannique. Lors de sa requête pour permission
d’appeler devant cette Cour, deux motifs ont été soulevés par son avocat: (1)
le magistrat aurait dû ordonner que soit examinée la question de savoir si
l’accusé était, pour cause d’aliénation mentale, incapable de subir son procès;
(2) l’accusé a été privé de son droit de retenir un avocat et d’avoir un procès
équitable.

Arrêt: La
requête pour permission d’appeler doit être rejetée.

En vertu des dispositions de l’art. 597(1) (b)
du Code Criminel , la permission d’appeler devant cette Cour peut être
accordée sur toute question de droit strict. Aucune question de droit ne se
soulève dans la détermination de la question à savoir si le magistrat a exercé
proprement sa discrétion en vertu de l’art. 524(1) du Code. A tout événement,
il appert que le magistrat a fait une enquête. La suffisance de cette enquête
ainsi que la conclusion à laquelle le magistrat en est arrivé, ne sont pas des
sujets soulevant une question de droit.

Il n’y a aucune preuve que le requérant a été
privé de son droit de retenir et de constituer un avocat sans délai ou qu’il a
été privé de son droit à une audition équitable.

REQUÊTE pour permission d’appeler devant

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Application dismissed.

F.A. Brewin, Q.C., for the applicant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an application for leave to
appeal from the Order of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia made on November 18, 1966. By that Order the
said

[Page 476]

Court dismissed an appeal by this applicant from
a conviction by Magistrate D. Hume at Vancouver, on July 8, 1966, on the charge
that the accused unlawfully did have in his possession an offensive weapon, to
wit, a knife, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to the form
of the statute in such case made and provided, and from his sentence upon such
conviction.

In this Court, the accused was represented by
counsel who urged two grounds of appeal:

Firstly, that the Magistrate ought to have
directed that an issue be tried to determine whether the accused, because of
insanity, was incapable of conducting his defence. Such an issue is provided
for in s. 524(1)  of the Criminal Code .

Secondly, that the accused was deprived of his
right to counsel and his right to a fair trial, contrary to the provisions of
the Canadian Bill of Rights, Statutes of Canada 1960, c. 44.

As to the first ground of the application, after
consideration of the matter, I have come to the conclusion that the only
question involved is whether the magistrate properly exercised his discretion
to determine whether there was, in the words of the section, “sufficient reason
to doubt that the accused is, on account of insanity, capable of conducting his
defence”. Under the provisions of s. 597(1)  (b) of the Criminal
Code , if leave is granted, an appeal to this Court may be taken on any
question of law alone. I am of the opinion that there is no question of law involved
in the determination of whether the magistrate had properly exercised his
discretion. It would appear that the magistrate did in fact carry on an
investigation to determine whether an issue should be directed. The sufficiency
of that investigation, and the conclusion to which the magistrate came, are not
matters involving a question of law.

As to the second ground, there is no evidence
that the applicant was deprived of the right to retain and instruct counsel
without delay or was deprived of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice.

I would dismiss the application for leave to
appeal

WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Warrant of
committal—Validity—Conditional licence to be at large—Validity of procedures
for recommittal—Ticket of Leave Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 264.

The applicant was imprisoned for armed
robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Several years later he was
granted a conditional licence to be at large pursuant to s. 3(1) of the Ticket
of Leave Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 264. While at large, he committed an armed
robbery for which he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. This
conviction caused the forfeiture of his conditional licence by the sole
operation of s. 6 of the Ticket of Leave Act. Procedures authorized
for the apprehension and committal of a licensee who has lost his licence were
adopted and a warrant for his committal was issued by a justice of the peace.
The applicant escaped but was recaptured and returned to the prison where he
was detained.

The applicant made an informal written
application to this Court for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. He
argued that the only possible authority for his present detention were his very
first convictions by the first judge, and that all the other terms of
imprisonment—including the term imposed upon him for escape—had been fully
satisfied. He challenged (a) the validity of the charges and procedures before
the first judge and contended that the latter had failed to issue a warrant of
committal in the form prescribed by the law, and challenged also (b) the
validity of the procedures leading to his recommittal after he had lost his
conditional licence, especially the warrant of committal issued by the justice
of the peace.

Held: The
application should be dismissed.

As to grounds raised in (a). None of the
points raised with respect to the charges and procedures before the first judge
had any relevancy on an application for the issue of a writ of habeas
corpus. It has been repeatedly held that such a writ could not be converted
into a writ of error or an appeal. The warrant of committal complied with the
law and was valid and effective.

As to the grounds raised in (b). Everyone of
the steps prescribed for the apprehension and committal of one who has lost his
licence has been taken. There was no necessity, in this case, to formally
proceed with the apprehension and recommittal of the applicant who was already
validly confined. While the term of imprisonment, to which the applicant was
sentenced for the offence in consequence of which his licence was forfeited,
may now be said to have been satisfied, he must, according to s. 9 of the Ticket
of Leave Act, further undergo a term of imprisonment equal to the portion
to which he was originally sentenced and which remained unexpired at the time
his licence was granted.

dépôt—Validité—Permis conditionnel d’être en liberté—Validité des procédures
pour réincarcération—Loi sur les Libérations conditionnelles, S.R.C. 1952, c.
264.

Le requérant fut emprisonné pour vols à main
armée et pour conspiration pour commettre ces vols. Plusieurs années plus tard,
il a obtenu un permis conditionnel d’être en liberté en vertu de l’art. 3(1) de
la Loi sur les Libérations conditionnelles, S.R.C. 1952, c. 264. Alors
qu’il était en liberté, il a commis un vol à main armée pour lequel il a été
trouvé coupable et condamné à l’emprisonnement. Cette condamnation lui a fait
perdre son permis conditionnel en vertu de l’art. 6 de la Loi sur les
Libérations conditionnelles. Les procédures autorisées pour l’appréhension
et l’incarcération du porteur qui a perdu son permis ont été adoptées, et un
mandat pour son incarcération a été émis par un juge de paix. Le requérant
s’est évadé mais a été recapturé et retourné à la prison où il est détenu
présentement.

Le requérant a présenté à cette Cour une
requête non formelle, par écrit, pour obtenir l’émission d’un bref d’habeas
corpus. Il soutient que la seule autorité possible pour sa détention
présente se trouve dans la première condamnation qu’il a reçue du premier juge,
et que tous les autres termes d’emprisonnement—y inclus celui imposé pour son
évasion—ont été complètement purgés. Il met en question (a) la validité des
actes d’accusation et des procédures devant le premier juge et prétend que ce
dernier n’a pas émis un mandat de dépôt dans la forme prescrite par la loi, et
met aussi en question (b) la validité des procédures en vertu desquelles il a
été réincarcéré après avoir perdu son permis conditionnel, et spécifiquement le
mandat de dépôt émis par le juge de paix.

Arrêt: La
requête doit être rejetée.

Pour ce qui est des griefs soulevés dans (a).
Aucun des points soulevés relativement aux actes d’accusation et aux procédures
devant le premier juge n’a de pertinence en regard d’une requête pour
l’émission d’un bref d’habeas corpus. Il a été maintes fois décidé qu’un
tel bref ne peut pas être changé en un recours pour cause d’erreur ou en appel.
Le mandat de dépôt est conforme à la loi et est valide et effectif.

Pour ce qui est des griefs soulevés dans (b).
Toutes les mesures prescrites pour l’appréhension et l’incarcération de celui
qui a perdu son permis ont été prises. Il n’y avait aucune nécessité, dans ce
cas, de procéder formellement à l’appréhension et à l’incarcération du
requérant qui était déjà validement en prison. Quoi qu’on puisse dire que le
terme d’emprisonnement, auquel le requérant a été condamné pour l’offense qui
eu comme résultat de lui faire perdre son permis, peut maintenant être
considéré comme ayant été purgé, il doit, selon l’art. 9 de la Loi sur les
Libérations conditionnelles, subir en outre un emprisonnement d’une durée
égale à ce qui restait encore à courir de sa première peine le jour où il a
obtenu son permis.

REQUÊTE devant le Juge Fauteux en chambre
pour obtenir l’émission d’un bref d’habeas corpus. Requête rejetée.

[Page 549]

APPLICATION before Fauteux J. in Chambers for
the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Application dismissed.

No one appearing for the applicant.

D.H. Christie, Q.C., for the Attorney
General for Canada.

André Chaloux for the Attorney General
for Quebec.

The following judgment was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—This is one of these prisoners’
informal applications for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus made, in this
case, by one Adolphe Karchesky, presently detained in the penitentiary of
Kingston, in the province of Ontario. The applicant did not appear nor was he
represented at the hearing, the date of which had been fixed when it appeared,
from the correspondence he exchanged with the Registrar of this Court, that he
had exhaustively stated his grounds and arguments and also indicated his willingness
to submit his application, even if contested, on the basis of his written
presentation. Representatives of the Attorney General for Canada and of the
Attorney General for the province of Quebec appeared at the hearing to contest
this application. The material filed by the latter and the material submitted
by the applicant show the following facts:—(i) on March 29, 1946, at the city
of Montreal, the applicant appeared and pleaded guilty, before Judge Maurice
Tétreau, a judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the district of Montreal, to
seventeen charges of armed robbery and seventeen charges of conspiracy to
commit those armed robberies, for which he was sentenced, on April 4, 1946, to
life imprisonment and seven years respectively on each charge of armed robbery
and conspiracy; (ii) on the same day, to wit on March 29, 1946, at the same
place and before the same Judge, the applicant also pleaded guilty to two
charges of attempting to commit an armed robbery and two additional charges of
conspiracy to commit an armed robbery, for which he was sentenced, on April 4,
1946, to seven years’ imprisonment on each count; (iii) on December 13, 1948,
the Commissioner of Penitentiaries issued a Removal Warrant, pursuant to
s. 52 of the Penitentiary Act (1939), Statutes of Canada 1939, c.
6, for the

[Page 550]

transfer of the applicant from St. Vincent
de Paul Penitentiary—where he had been committed by Judge Tétreau to serve the
above sentences—to the Manitoba Penitentiary; (iv) several years later,
pursuant to subs. 1 of s. 3 of the Ticket of Leave Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 264, a conditional license to be at large, effective May 1, 1957, was
granted to the applicant, notice of which, dated April 11, 1957, was addressed
by the Deputy Minister of Justice to the Warden of the Manitoba Penitentiary;
(v) while being lawfully at large by virtue of this conditional license, the
applicant committed, on November 28, 1958, at the city of Montreal, an
indictable offence, to wit an armed robbery, for which he was arrested, charged
and found guilty on December 1, 1958, by Judge Paul Hurteau, a judge of the
Sessions of the Peace for the district of Montreal, and for which he was
sentenced and committed on December 9, 1958, to five years’ imprisonment in the
penitentiary of St. Vincent de Paul; (vi) consequent upon the latter
conviction, applicant’s conditional license to be at large was forfeited
forthwith by the sole operation of s. 6 of the Ticket of Leave Act.
Procedures authorized for the apprehension and committal of a licensee whose
license has been forfeited or revoked were then adopted by the various
authorities concerned and on February 5, 1959, pursuant to a warrant of
apprehension issued on January 16, 1959, by the Commissioner of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, as provided in subs. 1 of s. 8 of the Ticket
of Leave Act, the applicant, who was then actually incarcerated in the
St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary, where he had been committed by Judge
Hurteau, was brought before Jean-Eudes Blanchard, a Justice of the Peace for the
district of Montreal The Justice of the Peace then issued a warrant of
committal pursuant to subs. 3 of s. 8 of the Ticket of Leave Act; (vii)
on August 12, 1959, the Commissioner of Penitentiaries, under the authority of
s. 52 of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 206, ordered the
transfer of the applicant from St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary to the
Kingston Penitentiary; (viii) on August 14, 1959, the applicant was again
transferred from the Kingston Penitentiary to the Joyceville Institution from which
he escaped on August 18, 1964; and

[Page 551]

upon being recaptured on August 27, 1964, the
applicant was returned to the Kingston Penitentiary where he is, since then,
presently detained.

In support of his application, the prisoner
submitted, in the first place, that the only possible authority for his present
detention must be the convictions registered against him on April 4, 1946, at
Montreal, before Judge Maurice Tétreau,—cf. (i) and (ii) above,—all the other
terms of imprisonment,—including the term imposed upon him for escape,—having
been fully satisfied. He then challenged (a) the validity of the charges and
procedures before Judge Tétreau and contended moreover that the latter had
failed to issue a warrant of committal in the form prescribed by law, and he
also challenged (b) the validity of the procedures leading to a recommittal
after the forfeiture or revocation of a conditional license to be at large, and
more specifically the warrant of committal issued by the Justice of the Peace,
Jean-Eudes Blanchard.

Dealing with grounds mentioned in (a):—It is
unnecessary to recite and deal here with the various points raised by the
applicant with respect to the charges and procedures before Judge Tétreau; for
assuming that, contrary to the opinion I formed after considering them, anyone
of these points would have any merits, none of them has any relevancy on an
application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Indeed, it has been
repeatedly held that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be converted into a writ of
error or an appeal and that its functions do not extend beyond an enquiry into
the jurisdiction of the Court by which process a subject is held in custody and
into the validity of the process upon its face. Bearing that in mind, it is
sufficient to say that as a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the district
of Montreal, Judge Maurice Tétreau had clearly jurisdiction in the matter and
that the warrant of committal he then issued is valid on its face. The
contention that this warrant is not in the form prescribed by law has no
foundation. The applicant has vainly attempted to support this submission on
some of the provisions of the new Criminal Code , assented to on April 1, 1955,
for, at all

[Page 552]

relevant time, the law governing in the matter
was to be found in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. Section
799 of this Code provides that a conviction on a plea of guilty, under Part
XVI, relating to the summary trial of indictable offences, may be in the form
56 or the forms appearing in Part XXV, or to the like effect; and s. 794
provides that a copy of such conviction, certified by the proper officer of the
Court or proved to be a true copy shall be, in any legal proceedings,
sufficient evidence of such conviction. The conviction or the warrant of
committal issued by Judge Tétreau, of which a true copy has been filed before
me, fully complies with these provisions of the law and this warrant is today
as valid and effective a warrant as it was at the time of its issuance.

Dealing with grounds raised in (b):—The various
steps of the procedure related to the apprehension and committal of a licensee,
whose license has been forfeited or revoked, are set forth in s. 8(1), (2)
and (3) of the Ticket of Leave Act and, subject to what is hereafter said
with respect to the warrant of committal issued by Justice of the Peace
Blanchard, I must say that a close examination of the various documents and
affidavits filed on behalf of the Attorney General for Canada and of the
Attorney General for the province of Quebec, has satisfied me that everyone of
the steps prescribed for such an apprehension and committal has been taken in
the present case.

Applicant questioned Blanchard’s authority to
issue a warrant of committal, suggesting, in fact, that he may not have been a
Justice of the Peace, but merely a Commissioner of Oaths. This suggestion has
no foundation. Indeed a certificate, under the signature and seal of a Clerk of
the Peace and of the Crown for the district of Montreal, establishes that
Blanchard was sworn in, as a Justice of the Peace, on June 10, 1958, and the
affidavit of Crown Attorney André Chaloux indicates that this appointment has
not been revoked. Furthermore and as stated by Lord Coleridge C.J., in R. v.
Morris Roberts[1]:

It is laid down in all the text books as a
recognised principle that a person acting in the capacity of a public officer
is prima facie to be taken to be so, …

[Page 553]

As to the substance of the warrant, the
representative of the Attorney General for Canada pointed out that blank spaces
which, in the form of such warrants, are intended to be used for the
designation of the person to whom the prisoner is to be conveyed and the
penitentiary to which he is to be committed, were not, in this case, completed
by Blanchard after the applicant had appeared before him at the
St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary where, again, he was already incarcerated
pursuant to the warrant of committal issued by Judge Hurteau—cf. (v). The
Crown, having considered that these omissions might be said to constitute a
defect on the face of the warrant, secured, two days before the hearing of the
present application, a new warrant from Justice of the Peace Blanchard. In this
new warrant, these omissions were remedied and a direction was given to the Warden
of the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary, to whom such warrant was
addressed, to substitute it to the original one. Needless to say that the new,
as well as the original warrant, contains a recital of the facts referred to in
(i), (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above.

As to the law respecting the issuance of a
substituted warrant of committal for a defective one, the Crown relied on the
authorities collected in Tremeear’s Annotated Criminal Code, 6th ed.,
1964, p. 1373, and in Crankshaw’s Criminal Code of Canada, 7th ed.,
p. 1167, and alternatively placed reliance upon s. 688  of the Criminal
Code  (1955) which provides that:

688. No warrant of committal shall, on
certiorari or habeas corpus, be held to be void by reason only of any defect
therein where

(a) it is alleged in the warrant
that the defendant was convicted, and

(b) there is a valid conviction to
sustain the warrant.

Whatever view might be taken as to the validity
or effectiveness of the original warrant issued by Justice of the Peace
Blanchard or the corrected warrant he substituted thereto, in my opinion, there
was no necessity, under all the circumstances of this case, to formally proceed
with the apprehension and recommittal of the applicant who, at the time he was
brought before the Justice of the Peace at the St. Vincent de Paul
Penitentiary and even before any of the procedures set forth in s. 8(1),
(2) and (3) of the

[Page 554]

Ticket of Leave Act had been resorted to, was then already validly confined by force of
the unimpeached and unimpeachable warrant of committal issued by Judge Hurteau,
as well as by force of the following provisions of s. 6 of the Ticket
of Leave Act which were set in action consequent to and upon the conviction
of the applicant by Judge Hurteau.

6. If any holder of a license under this
Act is convicted of any indictable offence his license shall be forthwith
forfeited. R.S., c. 150, s. 5.

While the term of imprisonment, to which the
applicant was sentenced for the offence in consequence of which his license was
forfeited, may now be said to have been satisfied, he must, according to
s. 9 of the Ticket of Leave Act, further undergo a term of imprisonment
equal to the portion to which he was originally sentenced and which remained
unexpired at the time his license was granted. And, as indicated above in
(i) and (ii), the term of the original sentence in his case is life
imprisonment

Having fully considered the material filed and
all the points raised by the applicant, I have satisfied myself that he is
lawfully detained. His application must therefore be and is dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Extortion—Belief that thing
demanded was due—Whether a defence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 291.

The respondents’ acquittal at trial on a
charge of extortion under s. 291  of the Criminal Code  was affirmed by
the Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the
following question of law: Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that
there was no evidence of an intent to extort or gain anything if the accused
believed that the thing demanded was due and owing at the time the demand was
made?

Held: The
appeal by the Crown should be allowed.

When it is proved that threats have been made
for the making of which there could be no justification or excuse, that the
threats were made with intent to gain something and were calculated to induce
the person threatened to do something, the commission of the crime defined in
s. 291  is established, and it is unnecessary to inquire whether the person
making the threats had a lawful right to the thing demanded or entertained an
honest belief that he had such a right; that inquiry would be necessary only if
the threats were such that there could be a reasonable justification or excuse
for making them. In the present case, as found by the Court of Appeal, the
threats which, according to the evidence were uttered, were of such a nature
that it was impossible as a matter of law for there to have been any reasonable
justification or excuse for making them.

Droit criminel—Extorsion—Croyance que la chose
demandée était due—Est-ce une défense—Code Criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
art. 291.

La Cour d’Appel a confirmé l’acquittement des
intimés lors de leur procès pour extorsion en vertu de l’art. 291  du Code
Criminel . La Couronne a obtenu permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour
sur la question de droit suivante: La Cour d’Appel a-t-elle erré en droit en
décidant qu’il n’y avait aucune preuve d’une intention d’extorquer ou de gagner
quelque chose si l’accusé croyait que la chose demandée était due lorsque la
demande en a été faite?

Arret: L’appel de la
Couronne doit être maintenu.

[Page 540]

Lorsqu’il est prouvé que des menaces ont été
proférées sans justification ou excuse, que les menaces ont été proférées avec
l’intention de gagner quelque chose et dans le but d’induire la personne
menacée à accomplir quelque chose, le crime dont la définition apparaît à
l’art. 291  a été commis, et il n’est pas nécessaire de se demander si la
personne proférant les menaces avait un droit légal à la chose demandée ou
croyait honnêtement qu’elle avait un tel droit; cette enquête ne serait
nécessaire que si les menaces étaient telles qu’il pouvait exister une
justification ou excuse raisonnable de les proférer. Dans le cas présent, tel
que jugé par la Cour d’Appel, les menaces, qui selon la preuve ont été
proférées, étaient telles qu’il était impossible comme question de droit qu’il
y ait eu une justification ou excuse raisonnable de les proférer.

APPEL de la Couronne d’un jugement de la Cour
d’Appel de l’Ontario confirmant l’acquittement des intimés. Appel maintenu.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario
affirming the respondents’ acquittal. Appeal allowed.

appellant.

Volpe.

D.H. Humphrey, Q.C., for the respondents
A. and E. Volpe.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal from judgments
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on June 6, 1966, dismissing appeals by the Attorney
General for Ontario from the
acquittals of the above named respondents in December 1965, after trial before
His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury.

The four respondents were jointly charged; the
indictment contained two counts which read as follows:

1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen
present that Pasquale Natarelli, Paul Volpe and Albert Volpe, in the month of
March in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the
County of York, without reasonable justification or excuse and with intent to
extort or gain seventeen thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money,
more or less, or one hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver
Mines Limited, by threats attempted to induce Richard Roy Angle

[Page 541]

to turn over to them, seventeen thousand,
five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one hundred
thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, contrary to the
Criminal Code ;

2. The said jurors further present that the
said Pasquale Natarelli, Paul Volpe, Albert Volpe and Eugene Volpe, in the
month of March in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in
the County of York, conspired one with the other and with persons unknown, to
commit an indictable offence, to wit, extortion, in that they did, without
reasonable justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain seventeen
thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one
hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, by
threats attempted to induce Richard Roy Angle to turn over to them, seventeen
thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one
hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, contrary
to the Criminal Code .

It will be observed that Natarelli, Paul Volpe
and Albert Volpe were charged in Count 1 and all four respondents were charged
in Count 2.

From these acquittals the Attorney General
appealed to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 584(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code , the grounds stated in each notice of appeal being as follows:

1. The learned Trial Judge erred in law in
instructing the jury that if the accused honestly believed they were entitled
to the 100,000 shares or the $17,500.00 that would constitute a defence.

2. The learned Trial Judge’s charge to the
jury was inadequate in law in that he failed to instruct the jury that the
threat to inflict grevious bodily harm upon someone can never be considered
reasonable or justified.

The appeals were dismissed for reasons delivered
orally by Aylesworth J.A. on the conclusion of the argument.

On October 4, 1966, the appellant was granted
leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that there is
no evidence of an intent to extort or gain anything if the accused believe that
the thing demanded is due and owing at the time the demand is made?

The first count in the indictment follows the
wording of subs. (1) of s. 291  of the Criminal Code . That Section in its
entirety reads as follows:

291. (1) Every one who, without reasonable
justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain anything, by threats,
accusations, menaces or violence induces or attempts to induce any person,
whether or not he is the person threatened, accused or menaced or to whom
violence is shown, to do anything or to cause anything to be done, is guilty of
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

(2) A threat to institute civil proceedings
is not a threat for the purposes of this section.

[Page 542]

After commenting on the fact that the
section was recently enacted and paraphrasing subs. (1), Aylesworth J.A. continued:

In our view, “without reasonable
justification or excuse” as well as “with intent to extort or gain anything”,
applies in the case at bar, to any attempt to induce by threats and the jury
should have been so charged. It is not desirable that any attempt should be
made and indeed judicial observations before this have been made to this
effect—should be made I say, to define what is or is not reasonable
justification or excuse. There may be, although it is somewhat difficult to
visualize such a case, facts which would afford reasonable justification or
excuse in attempting to induce some person to do anything by threats. Upon the
evidence in this case, however, the only evidence of threats was as to threats
to the life or limb of persons and on the facts of the case, those threats, if
they were made, in our view could not be made with reasonable justification or
excuse and therefore the question of reasonable justification or excuse in this
case should have been withdrawn from the jury.

We think, too, that as was the law before
the enactment of present section 291  so is the law under that section with
respect to extortion or intent to extort. We think the law still is that a case
of extortion is not made out if that which it is attempted to secure from the
person threatened, is due or owing to the person who makes the attempted
inducement by threat or if the person making those threats entertains an honest
belief that it is due and owing. With respect to the learned trial Judge, his
charge as a whole is in our view, confusing and must have been as to certain
elements of the crime, confusing to the jury. On the whole, however, it is our
view that a proper charge to the jury on the elements of the crime as I have
attempted to outline them and with respect to the evidence adduced would have
been at least as if not more favourable to the accused persons than the charge
actually made to the jury.

I take the first paragraph of this passage to
mean that the threats, which according to the evidence led by the prosecution
were uttered, were of such a nature that it was impossible as a matter of law
for there to have been any reasonable justification or excuse for making them
and that the learned trial Judge should have explicitly so charged the jury; I
agree with this conclusion.

In the second paragraph the learned Justice of
Appeal expresses the view that an accused who by threats seeks to induce the
person threatened to hand over something to him is not guilty of the offence
defined in s. 291(1) if he is entitled or if he entertains an honest belief
that he is entitled to the thing demanded.

The argument before us was directed chiefly to
the question whether this is a correct statement of the law. Its solution
depends on the true construction of s. 291 .

This section has already been quoted. It was
first enacted as part of the revised Criminal Code  Statutes of Canada,

[Page 543]

1953-54, 2 and 3 Eliz. II, c. 51, which came
into force on April 1, 1955, and by which the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, was repealed.

Section 291  is new in form. It is stated in the
“Table of Concordance Showing Source of Sections in the New Criminal Code”,
prepared in the Department of Justice from tables that accompanied the report
of the Criminal Code  Revision Commission to the Minister of Justice, that its
sources are ss. 450, 451, 452, 453 and 454 of the former Code. While this Table
of Concordance does not have any Parliamentary sanction, a comparison of the
two Codes shows this statement to be accurate.

The crimes defined in ss. 450 to 454 may be
briefly described as follows:

Section 450: Compelling the execution of a
document by violence or restraint of the person of another or by threat
thereof: penalty imprisonment for life.

Section 451: Uttering a letter or other writing
demanding with menaces, and without any reasonable or probable cause, any
valuable thing: penalty 14 years imprisonment.

Section 452: Demanding with menaces anything
capable of being stolen with intent to steal it: penalty 2 years imprisonment.

Section 453: With intent to extort or gain
anything accusing or threatening to accuse a person, whether the person accused
or threatened with accusation is guilty or not, of certain listed crimes:
penalty 14 years imprisonment.

Section 454: With intent to extort or gain anything
accusing or threatening to accuse a person, whether the person accused or
threatened with accusation is guilty or not, of crimes other than those listed
in s. 453: penalty 7 years imprisonment.

It will be observed that under s. 451 it was
necessary that the menaces be in writing and that it was the only one of the
five sections which contained the words “without any reasonable or probable
cause”. Under the other four sections the threats might be either oral or
written.

It appears to me that the wording of s. 291 of
the present Code is so different from that of ss. 450 to 454 of the
former

[Page 544]

Code that little
is to be gained from a consideration of the cases decided under those sections.

The words of Lord Herschell in Bank of
England v. Vagliano Brothers[1] appear
to me to be appropriate to the problem before us. They are accurately
summarized in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 36, p. 406, s. 614, as follows:

In construing a codifying statute the
proper course is, in the first instance, to examine its language and to ask
what is its natural meaning; it is an inversion of the proper order of
consideration to start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then,
assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the
words of the enactment will bear interpretation in conformity with this view.
The object of a codifying statute has been said to be that on any point
specifically dealt with by it the law should be ascertained by interpreting the
language used, instead of roaming over a number of authorities. After the
language has been examined without presumptions, resort must only be had to the
previous state of the law on some special ground, for example for the
construction of provisions of doubtful import, or of words which have acquired
a technical meaning.

In the case at bar there was evidence on which
it was open to the jury to find that the accused named in the first count in
the indictment by threats to cause death or bodily injury to Angle or members
of his family attempted to induce him to turn over to them the money or shares
mentioned in the indictment. The appeal was argued on the assumption that there
was some evidence in the record on which it was open to the jury to find that
the accused had an honest belief that the money or shares demanded were owing
to them.

The question of law raised on this appeal is
whether assuming the threats to cause death or bodily injury were made and that
the accused had the honest belief that the money or shares demanded were owing
to them they were guilty of the offence defined in s. 291 . The answer depends
on what is the true meaning of the words of the section.

For the respondents it is submitted that on the
assumption referred to in the preceding paragraph the accused might well be
guilty of assault or of the offence of threatening as defined in s. 316(1) (a)
of the present Code but that they would not be guilty of extortion as
defined in s. 291 , because the honest belief referred to would constitute
reasonable justification or excuse for making the demand.

In my opinion, this argument should be rejected.
To constitute a defence there must be reasonable justification or

[Page 545]

excuse not only for the demand but for the
making of the threats or menaces by which the accused sought to compel
compliance with the demand.

There are courses of action which a person might
express his intention of taking which would constitute threats within the
meaning of that word as used in the section but which would in some
circumstances be in themselves lawful; an example is the statement of the
intention to place the name of a person on a “stop list” in circumstances such
as existed in Thorne v. Motor Trade Association[2].

That decision indicates that while it was lawful
for the defendant to threaten to put the name of the plaintiff on a “stop list”
it would be criminal to accompany the threat with a demand for the payment of
an unreasonable sum as an alternative. It is not authority for the proposition
that, because a demand is reasonable and there exists reasonable justification
or excuse for the making of it, it is lawful to seek to enforce compliance with
it by making threats which are unlawful and for which there is no justification
or excuse.

I have already expressed my agreement with the
opinion of the Court of Appeal that in the case at bar if the jury found that
the threats alleged were made it was impossible as a matter of law for them to
find that there was any reasonable justification or excuse for making them.

When it is proved that threats have been made
for the making of which there could be no justification or excuse, that the
threats were made with intent to gain something and were calculated to induce
the person threatened to do something, the commission of the crime defined in
s. 291  is established, and it is unnecessary to inquire whether the person
making the threats had a lawful right to the thing demanded or entertained an
honest belief that he had such a right; that inquiry would be necessary only if
the threats were such that there could be reasonable justification or excuse
for making them.

Speaking generally, the essential ingredients of
an offence under s. 291  are, (i) that the accused has used threats, (ii) that
he has done so with the intention of obtaining something by the use of threats;
(whatever meaning be given to the word “extort” the word “gain” as used in the
section is simply the equivalent of “obtain”) and, (iii) that either

[Page 546]

the use of the threats or the making of the
demand for the thing sought to be obtained was without reasonable justification
or excuse; (the question on this aspect of the matter is not whether one item
in the accused’s course of conduct, if considered in isolation, might be said
to be justifiable or excusable but rather whether his course of conduct
considered in its entirety was without justification or excuse).

My view as to the true construction of s. 291 
expressed above is not altered by the circumstance that on the assumption as to
the facts on which the appeal was argued the accused could have been properly
convicted if they had been charged under s. 316(1) (a) of the Code
as it now reads since it was amended by Statutes of Canada 1960-61, c. 43,
s. 10. In this connection, however, it may be observed that from April 1, 1955,
until it was so amended s. 316 applied only to threats which were in writing.

For the reasons given above it is my opinion
that the learned trial Judge should have instructed the jury that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused made the alleged threats
to cause death or bodily injury with intent to induce Angle to hand over to
them the money or shares mentioned in the indictment they should find the
accused guilty regardless of whether the accused had a right to the money or
shares demanded or honestly believed they had such a right.

It follows that, in my opinion, the question of
law on which this appeal is brought should be answered in the affirmative.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders
of the Court of Appeal and the verdicts of acquittal and order a new trial of
all the respondents.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Breaking and entering—Trap laid
by police—Accused solicited by police informer—Whether offence—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
292(1)(a), 597(1)(b).

The accused and another man were solicited by
a police informer to undertake to break and enter a dwelling house in Ottawa where the police were waiting for
them. The police, in order to lay the trap, had secured the key from the owner
of the house, who was willing to cooperate in this scheme. The accused had no
thought of breaking and entering this house until approached by the informer.
The accused was convicted of breaking and entering, and his appeal was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court
on the following question of law: Did the trial judge err in law in not
charging the jury as to whether there was a consent to the breaking and
entering?

Held: The
appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a verdict of acquittal
entered.

On the evidence, it was open to the jury to
find that the owner of the house had placed the police officers in possession
of it giving them authority to deal with it as they pleased and that they had
not merely consented to the informer breaking into it with the assistance of
the accused and others, but had urged him to do so. To break into a house in
these circumstances is not an offence. On the assumption on which this appeal
was argued, mens rea was clearly established but

[Page 493]

it was open to the jury to find that,
notwithstanding the guilty intention of the appellant, the actus which
was in fact committed was no crime at all.

Droit criminel—Introduction par
effraction—Piège tendu par la police—Accusé sollicité par un mouchard—Y a-t-il
eu offense—Code Criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 292(1)(a), 597(1)(b).

L’accusé et un autre homme ont été sollicités
par un mouchard d’entreprendre de s’introduire par effraction dans une
résidence à Ottawa où des policiers les attendaient. Dans le but de tendre le
piège, les policiers avaient obtenu la clef du propriétaire de la maison, qui
avait consenti à coopérer dans le projet. L’accusé n’avait pas eu l’intention
de s’introduire par effraction dans cette maison jusqu’à ce que le mouchard le
lui eut proposé. L’accusé a été trouvé coupable de s’être introduit par
effraction, et son appel a été rejeté par la Cour d’Appel. Il a obtenu
permission d’appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de droit suivante: Le
Juge au procès a-t-il erré en droit en n’adressant pas le jury sur la question
de savoir s’il y avait eu consentement à l’introduction par effraction?

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être maintenu, le verdict de culpabilité annulé et remplacé par un verdict
d’acquittement.

Sur la preuve, le jury était libre de trouver
que le propriétaire de la maison avait mis les policiers en la possession
d’icelle, les autorisant d’en faire ce qui leur plairait et que non seulement
les policiers avaient consenti à ce que le mouchard s’y introduise par
effraction avec l’aide de l’accusé et d’autres, mais qu’ils avaient incité ce
dernier à le faire. Dans ces circonstances, l’introduction par effraction dans
une maison n’est pas une offense. Selon l’hypothèse en vertu de laquelle cette
affaire a été plaidée, la mens rea a été clairement établie mais le jury
était libre de trouver que, en dépit de l’intention fautive de l’accusé, l’actus
qui a été en fait commis n’était pas un crime.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Ontario confirmant un verdict de culpabilité. Appel
maintenu.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming the
accused’s conviction. Appeal allowed.

John F. Hamilton, for the appellant.

C.M. Powell, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—In October of 1964, the appellant,
Florian Lemieux, was tried before a judge and jury on an indictment charging
that he did

on the 17th day of November, A.D. 1963, at
the City of Ottawa in the County of Carleton, unlawfully break and enter the
dwelling house of Benjamin Achbar situated at premises numbered 905 Killeen
Avenue in the said City of Ottawa, with intent to commit an indictable offence
therein, contrary to Section 292(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

[Page 494]

He was found guilty and sentenced to three
years’ imprisonment. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on
February 24, 1965. His appeal to this Court, pursuant to leave granted under s.
597(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code  is on the following question of
law:

Did the learned Trial Judge err in law in
not charging the jury as to whether there was a consent to the breaking and
entering?

The facts of the case which give rise to this
suggested defence are very unusual. In November of 1963, the Ottawa Police were
very anxious to arrest the members of a gang which was known as the “hooded
gang” and which was engaged in a series of break-ins in the Ottawa area. On November 16, 1963, one R.D. Bard telephoned
an officer of the Ottawa Police Department to inform him that he had
information about this gang. The officer immediately visited Bard at his house
and Bard told him that he wanted money for his information. The officer then
summoned another officer, who came to Bard’s house. Then all three went to see
an inspector of the Ottawa Police Department.

Bard and the first two mentioned officers next
drove to the west end of the City of Ottawa to look for a house where a feigned break-in could be staged. They
went to the neighbourhood of Killeen Avenue and Lenester Street
where Bard pointed out a house at 905 Killeen Avenue belonging to Mr. Benjamin Achbar. Bard knew this house because some
time before he had paved the laneway. The Police obtained the key to Achbar’s
house from Achbar himself and then staked out the premises.

On November 17, 1963, at 7.30 p.m., a car owned by Florian Lemieux drove
past the house. There were three men in the car. Lemieux was driving under the
direction of Bard. The third man was Jean Guindon. The car circled the block
and was then parked near the house. Guindon and. Bard got out of the car.
Lemieux remained behind the wheel. Guindon and Bard went to the side door and
Guindon did the actual breaking with a screwdriver. The Police were waiting
inside. Bard was arrested on the spot. Lemieux was arrested in the car. Guindon
escaped and was arrested a short time later.

Bard was called at trial as a witness for the
Crown. On cross-examination he did not remember what was discussed with the
police on November 16, 1963; did not remember if

[Page 495]

he agreed to take part in the break-in; did not
remember if the matter of a reward was discussed and did not remember that he
had picked out the Achbar house for the purpose of breaking and entering.

Guindon was also called as a Crown witness and
testified that Lemieux knew nothing about the break-in and that he thought that
he was driving Bard to the house for the purpose of enabling Bard to collect
money owing to him. Guindon was declared a hostile witness and a previous
inconsistent statement was put to him in which he had said that he had asked
Lemieux to drive him to the house because he and Bard were going to break in.
Guindon sought to minimize the effect of this statement by pleading lack of
understanding of the contents because of language difficulties, but the two
police officers who took the statement both said that Guindon had spoken to
them in English that night.

Both Guindon and Lemieux were convicted by the
jury. Their appeals to the Court of Appeal were also dismissed. Bard, the
informer, pleaded guilty and received a heavy sentence. His appeal to the Court
of Appeal was allowed and he was acquitted.

Lemieux’s appeal to this Court was argued on the
basis that he knew that he was acting as a driver to take Bard and Guindon to a
house that he had never seen and that these two were going to break in. What he
did not know, however, was that he, along with Guindon, was being led into a
trap. It is quite clear that he and Guindon were solicited by Bard, the
informer, to undertake this break-in. The police had secured the key from the
owner of the house, who was willing to co-operate in this scheme. In the
present case Lemieux had no thought of breaking and entering this house until
he was approached by Bard, who was acting under police instruction. The police
had obtained the consent of the owner to use the premises in the hope that they
would be able to arrest certain criminals.

The case is very different from Rex v.
Chandler[1], where
an accused who intended to break into a shop sought a key from the servant of
the owner of the shop. This servant informed his master. The key was supplied
and the police were waiting for the shop-breaker when he arrived. The key

[Page 496]

in this case was supplied by the servant only
for the purpose that the criminal might be detected in the commission of the
offence. The criminal was guilty of shop-breaking.

But in Lemieux’s case, the facts are not at all
similar. The police set the whole scheme in motion through Bard. He was to lead
a man who at first had no intention of breaking and entering, who went to the
scene of the crime at Bard’s instigation and who was led into the trap by Bard.

On the evidence it was open to the jury to find
that the owner of the house had placed the police officers in possession of it
giving them authority to deal with it as they pleased and that they had not
merely consented to Bard breaking into it with the assistance of others, but
had urged him to do so. To break into a house in these circumstances is not an
offence.

For Lemieux to be guilty of the offence with
which he was charged, it was necessary that two elements should co-exist, (i)
that he had committed the forbidden act, and (ii) that he had the wrongful
intention of so doing. On the assumption on which the appeal was argued mens
rea was clearly established but it was open to the jury to find that,
notwithstanding the guilty intention of the appellant, the actus which
was in fact committed, was no crime at all.

In my opinion, if the jury had been properly
charged on this aspect of the matter and had taken the view of the facts which
it has been pointed out above it was open to them to take, they would have
acquitted the appellant.

Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence with
which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act at
the solicitation of an agent provocateur would have been irrelevant to
the question of his guilt or innocence. The reason that this conviction cannot
stand is that the jury were not properly instructed on a question vital to the
issue whether any offence had been committed.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

Hamilton, Toronto.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Possession of housebreaking
instruments—Whether evidence of possession—Instruments normally used for
ordinary purposes—Whether onus on accused to explain—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 3(4), 295(1).

The appellant was convicted of possession of
housebreaking instruments under s. 295(1)  of the Criminal Code . In the
early hours of the morning he had been a passenger in a car which, to his
knowledge, was wrongfully out of the possession of its owner. In the car there
were found three screwdrivers, a flashlight, socks, nylon stockings, a crowbar
and a pair of woollen gloves with leather palms. Some ten days earlier, the
police had seen the appellant and the same driver in the same car at about the
same hour and had found therein similar articles with the exception of the
crowbar. The appellant’s conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was
granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law: (1)
was there any evidence, before the magistrate, of possession by the appellant;
and (2) was the Crown obliged to adduce evidence to show suspicious
circumstances before the onus was cast on the accused to provide an
explanation?

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

There was evidence on which the magistrate,
acting judicially, could convict the appellant of possession.

Once possession of an instrument capable of
being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused
to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for
possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.

Droit criminel—Possession d’instruments
d’effraction—Preuve de possession—Instruments employés normalement pour des
fins ordinaires—L’accusé a le fardeau de donner une explication—Code criminel ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 3(4), 295(1).

L’appelant a été trouvé coupable de
possession d’instruments d’effraction sous l’art 295(1) du Code
Criminel . Aux petites heures du matin, il était passager dans une
automobile qui, à sa connaissance, était illégalement hors de la possession de
son propriétaire, et dans laquelle ont été trouvés trois tournevis, une lampe
de poche, des bas de nylon, un levier et une paire de gants de laine dont les
paumes étaient en cuir. Dix jours auparavant, la police avait vu l’appelant et
le même conducteur dans la même automobile à peu près à la même heure et y
avait trouvé des objets semblables, à l’exclusion du levier. La déclaration de
culpabilité a été confirmée par la Cour

[Page 590]

d’Appel. L’appelant a obtenu la permission
d’en appeler devant cette Cour sur les questions de droit suivantes: (1) Est-ce
qu’il y avait une preuve de possession par l’appelant devant le magistrat; et
(2) la Couronne devait-elle produire une preuve montrant des circonstances
suspectes avant que le fardeau de fournir des explications ne tombe sur
l’appelant?

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

Le magistrat, agissant juridiquement, pouvait
déclarer l’appelant coupable de possession en se basant sur la preuve
existante.

Lorsqu’il a été démontré qu’il y a possession
d’un instrument pouvant servir aux effractions, l’accusé a alors le fardeau de
démontrer par une balance des probabilités qu’il existait une excuse légitime
pour être en possession de l’instrument à ce moment et à cet endroit.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Ontario confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming the
appellant’s conviction. Appeal dismissed.

B.A. Crane, for the appellant.

D.A. McKenzie, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant Jasper Tupper was
charged under s. 295(1)  of the Criminal Code  with possession of
housebreaking instruments. Section 295(1)  reads:

295. (1) Every one who without lawful
excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession any instrument
for house-breaking, vault-breaking or safe-breaking is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

On October 5, 1965, at 1:50 a.m., the police stopped a car at
James and King Streets in Hamilton. One Donald Richardson was the driver and the appellant was a
passenger in the front seat. The police found in the vehicle:

(1) a yellow-handled screwdriver in the rear
seat;

(2) a Phillips maroon-handled screwdriver on the
front seat on the passenger side;

(3) a red flashlight in the glove compartment;

(4) two white socks in the glove compartment;

[Page 591]

(5) two nylon stockings in the glove
compartment;

(6) a seventeen-inch gooseneck crowbar under the
front seat on the driver’s side;

(7) a pair of grey woollen gloves with leather
palms under the front seat on the driver’s side;

(8) a screwdriver with a three and one-half inch
blade which was inserted in the right-hand woollen glove under the front seat
on the driver’s side.

On September 24, 1965, at 1:45 a.m., the same car had been stopped on Birge Street in Hamilton. Richardson was the
driver and the appellant Tupper was a passenger, together with one other
person. The police had found on this occasion similar articles with the
exception of the crowbar. The police did not lay a charge on this occasion.

Both Richardson, the driver, and the appellant,
Tupper, were convicted. Tupper appealed to the Court of Appeal. His conviction
was affirmed and his sentence increased. With leave, he appeals to this Court
on two questions of law:

1. Whether there was any evidence, before
the magistrate, of possession of the instruments by the Appellant;

2. If the instruments found are capable of
and normally used for ordinary purposes, but may also be used for
housebreaking, is the Crown obliged to adduce evidence to show suspicious
circumstances before the onus is cast on the accused to provide an explanation?

Question 1.

On the question of possession, my opinion is
that there was evidence on which the magistrate, acting judicially, could
convict.

This car was owned neither by Richardson nor by Tupper. It had been
leased by a third person, Edward Ryckman, from Snelgrove Motors on September
23, 1965, for one day. They got it back a month later with an extra 3,000 miles
on the car. The articles were not in the car when it was rented to Ryckman.
Ryckman said they belonged to him and his wife.

The car was first stopped the day after it was
leased by Ryckman, that is, on September 24, 1965, at 1:45 a.m., with
Richardson as driver, Tupper as a passenger, together with a third person. It
was stopped again on October 5,

 [Page 592]

1965, and it was in connection with the articles
then found in the car that Richardson and Tupper were charged.

In my opinion, on that occasion, Richardson and
Tupper were both in wrongful possession of the car. The fact that Richardson was driving in these
circumstances does not give him sole possession of the car. They were both in
possession of the car and both as wrongdoers, knowing that the car had been
retained by Ryckman beyond the term of its lease, which was one day.

Richardson and Tupper were not going about their
ordinary business with screwdrivers, flashlights, nylon stockings and a crowbar
in the middle of the day. They were abroad at a highly suspicious time. There
was also evidence that one of the screwdrivers was on the seat on which Tupper
was actually sitting. Screwdrivers are not left haphazardly on the seats of
cars.

On these facts the magistrate could properly
find that both Richardson and Tupper were in possession of these instruments.
Section 3(4)  of the Criminal Code  reads:

(4) For the purposes of this Act,

(a) a person has anything in
possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly

(i) has it in the actual possession or
custody of another person,

or

(ii) has it in any place, whether or not
that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself
or of another person; and

(b) where one of two or more
persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his
custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession
of each and all of them.

Question 2.

Leave was given on this question because of a
conflict in the jurisprudence between some of the provinces. On the one side
there are the cases of R. v. Smith[1];
R. v. Haire[2]; R.
v. McRae[3]. These
cases held that if the tools, although capable of being used for housebreaking,
would normally serve a lawful purpose, the Crown should prove “some event,
overt action, or declaration, to identify the tools with a specific unlawful
purpose”.

[Page 593] 

In my opinion, this statement of the law is
erroneous and ignores the plain wording of the section. The English version
reads: “any instrument for house-breaking”; the French version reads: “un
instrument pouvant servir aux effractions de maisons”. The French version makes
the meaning clear. Both versions mean the same thing. An instrument for
house-breaking is one capable of being used for house-breaking.

The principle contended for here is that there
is no onus on the accused to provide an explanation until the Crown has adduced
some evidence from which an inference might be drawn that the accused intended
to use such instruments for the purpose of house-breaking.

I think the law is correctly stated by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Gilson[4]
and in the earlier judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Kernychne
but unreported; R. v. Singleton[5],
decided in 1956, and in R. v. Jones[6]

Once possession of an instrument capable of
being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused
to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for
possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.

I would dismiss the appeal.

HALL J.:—I have read the reasons of my brother
Judson and, with respect to question 1, I agree that there was evidence upon
which the magistrate, acting judicially, could convict and I would dismiss the
appeal.

Question 2 has given me a great deal of concern.
I am, with reluctance, compelled by the wording of s. 295(1)  which reads:

295. (1) Every one who without lawful
excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession any instrument
for house-breaking, vault-breaking or safe-breaking is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

to agree that, as stated by my brother Judson:

Once possession of an instrument capable of
being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused
to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for
possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.

[Page 594]

Whether Parliament intended it or not, s.
295(1) , as it reads, permits of no other interpretation. It puts the possessor
of many necessary tools of trade, automobile accessories and tools and hundreds
of similar instruments used and carried daily for routine purposes which might
be capable of being used for house-breaking in the position that merely from
being in possession under the most innocent circumstances, he can be brought
into court and put to the proof that he has a lawful excuse for having a
screwdriver, a flashlight or some other such household tool or instrument in
his car, boat, tool kit or on his person at any given time or place which
includes his home. It can be argued and readily accepted that this may not
happen frequently, but it can and may happen if Parliament really intended what
the section says when, without any qualification as to time or circumstance, it
put the burden of proof on the person in whose possession any such item may be
found.

The interpretation which the wording of the
section compels should, I think, be drawn to Parliament’s attention.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Preventive
detention—Whether expedient—Jurisdiction—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61,
s. 660(1).

The appellant, who was 34 years of age, was
convicted on August 10, 1965, of two offences of obtaining goods by false
pretences and two offences of attempting to obtain goods by false pretences.
This was done by

[Page 555]

drawing cheques on non-existent bank
accounts. The amount involved in each offence was under $100. The appellant was
subsequently-found to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive
detention. His record of convictions commenced at age 16 and all but one
included an element of theft. On June 25, 1965, the day of the expiration of a
four-year sentence for theft of an automobile, the appellant received a gift of
money to take him from New Brunswick to Vancouver. On his arrival in Vancouver
the same day, he at once got a job as a labourer and appeared to have been
continuously so employed until his conviction on August 10 of the substantive
offences. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the sentence of
preventive detention. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Cartwright
and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the facts, the magistrate properly concluded that
the appellant was an habitual criminal and this was rightly affirmed by a
majority in the Court of Appeal. If the decision of that Court on that issue
was correct, it is not open to this Court to substitute its opinion on the
question as to whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public
to sentence the appellant to preventive detention. The judgment of this Court
in The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831, is authority for the
proposition that, once the finding as to the status of the accused as an
habitual criminal is not in issue, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain
an appeal against the sentence.

Per Cartwright
and Judson JJ., dissenting: On the assumption that the finding
that the appellant was an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, it has not
been shown that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence
him to preventive detention. Since his convictions in 1959, the appellant has
been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in
1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, he has been sentenced to severe
punishment. There is some evidence of his trying to live a normal life. It has
not been satisfactorily shown that his release at the expiration of the terms
of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences
will constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the public
renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in custody.

The judgment of this Court in The Queen v.
MacDonald, supra, is distinguishable and does not bind this Court to say
that it is without jurisdiction in the case at bar.

[Page 556]

L’appelant, âgé de 34 ans, a été trouvé
coupable le 10 août 1965, de deux offenses d’avoir obtenu des biens par faux
prétexte et de deux offenses d’avoir tenté d’obtenir des biens par faux
prétexte. Il s’agissait de chèques tirés sur un compte de banque qui n’existait
pas. Le montant en jeu dans chaque offense était de moins de $100. L’appelant a
été subséquemment reconnu repris de justice et a été condamné à la détention
préventive. Son dossier de condamnations commence à l’âge de 16 ans et toutes
les condamnations, à l’exception d’une, contiennent un élément de vol. Le 25
juin 1965, le jour de l’expiration d’une sentence de quatre ans pour vol
d’automobile, l’appelant a reçu un don en argent pour lui permettre de se
rendre du Nouveau-Brunswick à Vancouver. A son arrivée à Vancouver le même
jour, il a immédiatement obtenu un emploi comme manœuvre et il semble qu’il a
été continuellement employé de la sorte jusqu’au jour de sa condamnation le 10
août pour les offenses substantives. La Cour d’Appel, par un jugement
majoritaire, a confirmé la sentence de détention préventive. L’appelant a
obtenu permission d’appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, les Juges Cartwright et Judson étant dissidents.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Martland et Ritchie: Sur les faits de cette cause, le magistrat a
conclu correctement que l’appelant était un repris de justice et la majorité
dans la Cour d’Appel a eu raison de confirmer cette conclusion. Si la décision
de la Cour d’Appel sur cette question était la bonne, cette Cour n’a pas le
droit de substituer son opinion sur la question de savoir s’il était opportun
pour la protection du public de condamner l’appelant à la détention préventive.
Le jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965]
R.C.S. 831, est une autorité pour la proposition que, lorsque la conclusion
concernant le statut de repris de justice d’un accusé n’est pas en question,
cette Cour n’a pas juridiction pour entendre un appel de la sentence.

Les Juges
Cartwright et Judson, dissidents: Selon l’hypothèse que la conclusion à
l’effet que l’appelant était un repris de justice ne doit pas être changée, il
n’a pas été démontré qu’il était opportun pour la protection du public de
condamner l’appelant à la détention préventive. Depuis ses condamnations en
1959, l’appelant n’a été trouvé coupable d’aucun crime de violence. Pour le vol
d’une automobile en 1962 et pour les quatre offenses substantives en 1965, il a
reçu des punitions sévères. Il y a une preuve à l’effet qu’il essaie de vivre
une vie normale. Il n’a pas été démontré d’une façon satisfaisante que sa mise
en liberté à l’expiration de l’emprisonnement auquel il a été condamné pour les
offenses substantives aurait pour effet de créer une menace à la société ou que
pour la protection du public il serait opportun qu’il passe le reste de sa vie
sous arrêt.

Le jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de The
Queen v. MacDonald, supra, peut être distingué et ne force pas cette Cour à
dire qu’elle est sans juridiction dans le cas présent.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de la
Colombie-Britannique confirmant une sentence de détention préventive. Appel rejeté, les Juges Cartwright et Judson dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal
dismissed, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.

B.H. Kershaw, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This appeal
is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming, by a majority, a sentence of
preventive detention imposed on the appellant by His Worship Magistrate
G.L. Levey at Vancouver on June 14, 1966. Bull J.A., dissenting, would
have allowed the appeal, quashed the sentence of preventive detention and
restored the sentences imposed in respect of convictions of four substantive
offences in lieu of which the sentence appealed against had been imposed.

The appellant was born on March 3, 1932.

The evidence as to his past record is accurately
summarized by Bull J.A. as follows:

Just after reaching 16 years of age, the
appellant was convicted of a charge of taking an automobile without consent and
stealing four pairs of shoes a day or so earlier, and was fined $20.00 and
given a suspended sentence, respectively. Three years later, at the age of 19 years,
he was convicted of breaking and entering a drug store and was sentenced to two
years in the penitentiary. Upon being released from this imprisonment about 19
months later, he joined the Canadian Army and served with it in Canada and
Korea for about 2 years until he was dishonourably discharged shortly after
having been convicted in Montreal of two

[Page 558]

charges of robbery and sentenced to five
years on each to run concurrently. On his release at expiration of sentence the
appellant had odd jobs in and around his home area in New Brunswick for about
five months, when he again fell foul of the law. This time he was convicted on
four charges of breaking and entering business premises within the space of a
few days, and was awarded various sentences to run con currently, of which the
longest was three years in the penitentiary. The appellant was released from
imprisonment on November 19, 1961, and worked fairly steadily with some success
and employer approval at labouring work for about ten months when he was
convicted of theft of a U-Drive automobile which he had rented. For this
offence he was sentenced to four years in the penitentiary. On his release from
this sentence in June, 1965, the somewhat unusual events occurred which led to
his commission of, and convictions on, the substantive offences. On the day of
release and provided with funds and an airline ticket by his mother in the
Maritimes, he flew to Vancouver claiming to be filled with the admirable
resolution to there start a new honest life away from the associations which he
claimed had always led him into trouble. Although there were many
inconsistencies in his evidence as to exactly what the appellant did for the
next few weeks, it does appear quite clear and uncontradicted that promptly after
arrival he did get a job with a wrecking company, which lasted about two weeks,
followed by a job with a salvage company commencing on July 12, 1965. On July
9, 1965, however, he purchased $41.85, and attempted to purchase a further
$91.37, worth of goods from a department store with cheques signed in his own
name but drawn on a non-existent account in a local bank. The appellant said
the account number used was that of an account that he had in the same bank in
Fredericton, N.B., but quite properly little credence was given to this excuse.
It is clear that some at least of the goods in question were working clothes
and gear needed by the appellant in the new job he was just starting. On the
same day, allegedly to replace one stolen from his room, the appellant
attempted to buy a watch from a jeweller with a cheque for $83.99 drawn on the
same non-existent account. The appellant was released on bail, went back to
work and about ten days later obtained a pipe and some tobacco from a
tobacconist with a cheque for $12.74 drawn on a fictitious account. The
appellant was convicted of these four depredations on August 10, 1965, and
given concurrent sentences aggregating 3 years. Apparently, notwithstanding
these shopping sprees, the appellant did have gainful employment for
substantially the whole time from his release on June 25, 1965, to his
conviction on August 10, 1965. There was no evidence adduced that during this
last period of freedom the appellant associated with criminals or undesirable
characters.

I do not find it necessary to choose between the
conflicting views of Bull J.A. and of the majority in the Court of Appeal as to
whether on the evidence the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal
can safely be upheld; for the purpose of these reasons I will assume that it
can.

[Page 559]

On the assumption that the finding that the
appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, I have reached the
conclusion that it has not been shewn that it is expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

Whether or not in any particular case it is
expedient to so sentence a person found to be an habitual criminal is a
question of fact or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact; it is certainly
not a question of law alone. But, leave to appeal to this Court having been
granted, it is clear that we have jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact.

In Mulcahy v. The Queen[1], this Court in a
unanimous judgment expressly adopted the reasons of MacQuarrie J. who had
dissented from the judgment of the majority in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
(in banco) and set aside the sentence of preventive detention which had been
imposed upon the appellant. The dissenting judgment of MacQuarrie J. is
reported in 42 C.R. at page 1.

In that case the record shewed that, prior to
being convicted of the substantive offence, the appellant had been convicted
between 1941 and 1961 on nineteen occasions of offences, for which he had been
sentenced to a total of fifteen years and six months in the penitentiary and
twenty-six months in prison. None of his convictions were for crimes of
violence; six were for breaking and entering and the remainder for theft or
having possession of stolen goods.

MacQuarrie J. based his judgment on two distinct
grounds. The first of these was that there was no evidence to support a finding
that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. The second ground
was expressed as follows:

While I do not attempt to minimize the
record of the appellant, a perusal of it (apart from the lack of evidence to
justify finding him to be leading persistently a criminal life) indicates that
he is not the type of person of whom it can properly be said “it is expedient
for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention”. In
my opinion the Crown has failed to prove that (even although the accused

[Page 560]

was leading persistently a criminal life) a
sentence of preventive detention was expedient for the protection of the
public.

In the case at bar no exception can be taken to
the terms in which the learned Magistrate instructed himself as to the
applicable principles of law. Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia in Regina v. Charming[2],
he expressed the view that in order to impose a sentence of preventive
detention he must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was
leading persistently a criminal life, that the decision of each case must
depend on its own particular facts, (i) as to whether the finding that a person
is an habitual criminal should be made and, (ii) as to whether that finding
having been made, a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. It is,
I think, implicit in the last sentence of his reasons, read in the light of his
reference to Regina v. Channing, that he held it necessary that he
should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the second of these points as
well as on the first. The sentence to which I refer reads as follows:

I find that the Crown has proved beyond all
reasonable doubt, in my mind, that it is expedient for the protection of the
public to sentence you to preventive detention, and I so do.

In the Court of Appeal Lord J.A., with whom
McFarlane J.A. expressed substantial agreement, dealt with this branch of the
matter as follows:

Nor can I say that he reached the wrong
opinion in finding it expedient for the protection of the public that the
appellant be sentenced to preventive detention.

Bull J.A., having held that the finding that the
appellant was an habitual criminal could not safely be upheld, did not find it
necessary to deal with this question.

In Regina v. Channing, supra, Sheppard
J.A., with whom Norris, Lord and MacLean JJ.A. agreed and Davey J.A. agreed “in
general”, said at page 110:

In the case at bar, the crown must assume
the onus of proving that it is expedient for the protection of the public that
the accused be

[Page 561]

sentenced beyond that imprisonment for the
substantive offence: Mulcahy v. Reg., and that must be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt: Parkes v. Reg. and Kirkland v. Reg.

In the same case at page 101, Davey J.A. said:

Likewise it is undesirable for us to lay
down detailed tests of the sufficiency of evidence to prove either that an
accused is a habitual criminal or that it is expedient for the protection of
the public that he be sentenced to preventive detention. All that is required
is that the evidence be sufficient to prove both these essential matters beyond
a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the magistrate or trial judge.

As already indicated, I am dealing with this
appeal on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual
criminal should not be disturbed and the question to be answered is therefore
whether it can properly be said “that because the accused is an habitual
criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention”.

The answer to this question depends upon the
application to the facts of the case of the words of s. 660(1)  of the Criminal
Code  which reads as follows:

660. (1) Where an accused has been
convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a
sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired, if

(a) the accused is found to
be an habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the opinion that
because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

It will be observed that the section is
worded permissively. Even if both conditions (a) and (b) are fulfilled the
court is not bound to impose the sentence of preventive detention. The wording
may be contrasted with that used by Parliament in s. 661 (3):

(3) Where the court finds that the accused
is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a
sentence of preventive detention.

[Page 562]

The wording of s. 660 may also be
contrasted with that of the corresponding sub-section in the Criminal
Justice Act, 1948, of the United Kingdom, 11 & 12 George VI, c. 58,
s. 21(2) of which reads as follows:

(2) Where a person who is not less than
thirty years of age—

(a) is convicted on indictment of an
offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more; and

(b) has been convicted on indictment
on at least three previous occasions since he attained the age of seventeen of
offences punishable on indictment with such a sentence, and was on at least two
of those occasions sentenced to Borstal training, imprisonment or corrective
training;

then, if the court is satisfied that it is
expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in
custody for a substantial time, followed by a period of supervision if released
before the expiration of his sentence, the court may pass, in lieu of any other
sentence, a sentence of preventive detention for such term of not less than
five or more than fourteen years as the court may determine.

I do not consider that the use of the words “The
court is of the opinion” in s. 660(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  prevents
the Court of Appeal or this Court from substituting its opinion for that of the
learned Magistrate, That course has been followed in Mulcahy v. The Queen,
supra.

In Regina v. Channing, supra, after
stating that what is expedient for the protection of the public is a question
of fact in each case, Sheppard J.A. continued at page 109:

Moreover, as the sentence for the
substantive offence will have considered the protection of the public as one of
the elements, it would follow that preventive detention should not be imposed
unless the crown has proven that the protection of the public is not
sufficiently safeguarded by sentence for the substantive offence, but does
require some additional protection involved in a sentence of preventive
detention: Mulcahy v. Reg., supra; Reg. v. Rose, supra, to the
extent of making that sentence expedient for the protection of the public.

and at page 110 he quoted with approval the
following passage in the reasons of Currie J.A. in Harnish v. The Queen[3]:

The real, essential principle of the
preventive detention provisions of the Criminal Code , s. 660 , and of the
Prevention of Crime Act, 1908,

[Page 563]

8 Edw. VII, ch. 59, is the protection
of the public. It is not enough that the accused is merely anti-social, or is a
nuisance, or that it is a convenience to the police to have a person removed to
a penitentiary.

In R. v. Churchill[4], Lord Goddard, giving
the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at page 110:

The object of preventive detention is to
protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history
that they are a menace to society while they are at large.

and at page 112:

As we have already said, when such
sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has
had no effect. It has become a matter of putting a man where he can no longer
prey upon society even though his depredations may be of a comparatively small
character, as in the case of habitual sneak thieves.

In considering the decisions in England it must
always be borne in mind that the maximum sentence of preventive detention which
can be imposed there is fourteen years and that, as stated by Lord Goddard on
the page last referred to, in the great majority of cases which had come before
that Court the sentence passed had been one of eight years. In Canada if the
sentence is passed at all it must decree imprisonment for the remainder of the
prisoner’s life subject to the possibility of his being allowed out on licence
if so determined by the parole authorities, a licence which may be revoked
without the intervention of any judicial tribunal.

Since his convictions in 1959, the appellant has
been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in
1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, which involved comparatively
trifling sums, he has been sentenced to severe punishment; there is some
evidence of his trying to live a normal life; he is now 35 years of age. While
I cannot say, in the words used by Currie J.A., that he is merely a nuisance I
am not satisfied that his release at the expiration of the terms of
imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will,
to use the words of Lord Goddard, constitute a menace to society or that the
protection of the public

[Page 564]

renders it expedient that he should spend the
rest of his life in custody. Any doubt that I feel in this case arises from the
fact that I am differing from the learned Magistrate and the majority in the
Court of Appeal. In a case in which the consequences of an adverse decision are
so final and so disastrous for the man concerned I think that doubts should be
resolved in his favour.

I had written the above reasons and reached the
conclusion that I would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would have done
before I had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Martland,
holding, on the basis of the reasons of Ritchie J. speaking for the majority of
the Court in The Queen v. MacDonald[5],
that, unless we can say that the finding of the Courts below that the
appellant is an habitual criminal should be set aside, we are without
jurisdiction to interfere with the imposition of the sentence of preventive
detention.

While in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, I
agreed with the conclusion of the majority that the appeal should be quashed it
was for different reasons. The sole question relating to our jurisdiction which
was raised for decision in that appeal was whether the Attorney-General had a
right of appeal to this Court from the order of a Court of Appeal expressly
affirming a finding that an accused was an habitual criminal but deciding that
the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon him should be set aside. The
formal order of the Court of Appeal in that case read as follows:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
appeal of the above-named Appellant from the finding that the Appellant is an
habitual criminal be and the same is hereby dismissed, the Appeal of the
above-named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him
be and the same is hereby allowed, the sentence of preventive detention imposed
on him as aforesaid be and the same is hereby set aside, and pursuant to
section 667  of the Criminal Code , a sentence of imprisonment in Oakalla
Prison Farm, Burnaby, British Columbia, for a term of one year be and the same
is hereby imposed in respect of the said conviction by Magistrate L.H. Jackson
entered on the 20th day of May 1964 on the above-described charge, such
sentence to run from the 20th day of May, 1964.

[Page 565]

This may be contrasted with the order of the
Court of Appeal in the case at bar, the operative part of which reads:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE THAT the
said Appeal of the above‑named Appellant from the sentence of preventive
detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby dismissed;

In my view the present case is distinguishable
from The Queen v. MacDonald. The appeal before us is simply from the
imposition of the sentence, and this is as it should be for the only right of
appeal given to a person sentenced to preventive detention is that set out in
section 667(1)  of the Criminal Code :

667. (1) A person who is sentenced to
preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against
that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

No right of appeal is given from a finding that
an accused is an habitual criminal unless that finding is followed by the
imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. Such a finding unless
followed by a sentence is brutum fulmen. It is a trite observation that
an appeal is from the judgment pronounced in the court appealed from and not
from its reasons. It appears to me that the existence of our jurisdiction
cannot depend upon the grounds upon which we think the sentence should be
upheld or set aside. Our jurisdiction to set aside the sentence in the case at
bar upon the grounds set out in the reasons of Bull J.A. could not be
questioned; I do not think it is destroyed because, as it appears to me, the
same result should be reached by a different line of reasoning. It may be
mentioned in passing that no question of our jurisdiction was raised in the
course of the full and able arguments addressed to us and I would be hesitant
to rule that we have no jurisdiction without giving Counsel an opportunity to
present their views. I have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the
majority in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, does not bind us to say that
we are without jurisdiction in the case at bar.

I would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would
have done, that is to say, I would allow the appeal, quash the

[Page 566]

sentence of preventive detention and restore the
sentences imposed on the convictions of the four substantive offences.

The judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie
JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The facts involved in this appeal
are stated by my brother Cartwright, including the evidence as to the past
record of the appellant as summarized by Bull J.A. in the Court below. On the
basis of that summary I think that the magistrate properly concluded that the
appellant was an habitual criminal and I agree with the views expressed by the
majority of the Court of Appeal on this point.

If the decision of the Court of Appeal on that
issue was correct, it is not open to this Court, even if it wished to do so, to
substitute its opinion for that of the Court of Appeal on the question as to
whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence
the appellant to preventive detention. The judgment of this Court in The
Queen v. MacDonald[6]
is authority for the proposition that, once the finding as to the status of
the accused as an habitual criminal is not in issue, this Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the sentence.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Evidence—Weight—Confessions made to friends—Charge to jury—Whether
adequate.

Charged with the non-capital murder of her mother-in-law, the
appellant was convicted of manslaughter. The medical evidence attributed the
death to a blow or blows on the head. The only direct evidence to connect the
appellant with the death consisted of an alleged confession made by her to her
friend S, and of three statements she is alleged to have made to her friend K.
During the three and a half years between the death and the trial, S gave
several statements to the police and gave evidence under oath at the inquest,
but each of her accounts differed as to her own activities on the night of the
murder. It was not until three years after the night in question that she first
told the police about the alleged confession. The accused was said to have been
intoxicated when she made these statements. The Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial directed on the charge of manslaughter.

Per Cartwright, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The trial
judge said enough to indicate that in weighing the evidence of K and S the jury
should give serious consideration to the inconsistencies in the statements made
by S and to the failure of both women to come forward with their stories at an
earlier date. The theory of the defence that these two witnesses were unworthy
of belief was expressed by the trial judge with sufficient clarity to comply
with the authorities. Deacon v. R. [1947] S.C.R. 531.

There was however a total absence of any direction on the
question of whether, if the appellant did make the incriminating statements attributed
to her by the two women, those statements were in fact true. The evidence of
the appellant's intoxication was such as to make it desirable for the trial
judge to tell the jury that it was a factor to be taken into consideration in
assessing the value of her confession and statements as evidence against her.
Assuming that the inconsistencies between the alleged confession and the
autopsy as to how the victim met her death was not raised by way of defence,
and notwithstanding the fact that defence counsel did not object to the trial
judge's failure to comment on it, the charge to the jury should nevertheless
have contained specific direction to the effect that the truth of the
appellant's alleged admission was to be considered in light of this discrepancy
and in light also of her intoxication at the time when the admission was
alleged to have been made.

Per Abbott J., dissenting: The objections to the
trial judge's charge made by the appellant did not, as found by the Court of
Appeal, constitute sufficient grounds to allow the appeal.

[Page 556]

Droit criminal—Meurtre non
qualifié—Preuve—Poids—Aveu fait à des amies—Suffisance de l'adresse du juge au
jury.

Accusée du meurtre non qualifié de sa belle-mère, l'appelante
fut trouvée coupable d'homicide involontaire coupable. La preuve médicale
attribua le décès de la victime à des coups portés sur la tête. La
seule preuve directe contre l'appelante comprenait un prétendu aveu qu'elle
aurait fait à son amie S, et trois déclarations qu'elle est supposée avoir faites
à son amie K. Durant les trois années et demie entre le décès de la victime et
le procès, S fit plusieurs déclarations à la police et témoigna sous serment à
l'enquête du coroner, mais chacun de ses récits différait quant à ses propres
activités la nuit du meurtre. Ce n'est que trois ans après la nuit en question
qu'elle fit part à la police pour la première fois du prétendu aveu. L'appelante
était supposée avoir été sous l'influence de la boisson lorsqu'elle fit ses
déclarations. La Cour d'Appel confirma le verdict de culpabilité. L'accusée en
appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L'appel doit
être maintenu et un nouveau procès doit être ordonné sur l'accusation
d'homicide involontaire coupable, le juge Abbott étant dissident.

Les juges
Cartwright, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: Le juge au procès en a dit assez pour
indiquer au jury qu'en évaluant la preuve de K et S, il devait prendre en
considération les variances dans les déclarations faites par S et le défaut des
deux femmes de se présenter avec leurs récits à une date antérieure. La théorie
de la défense que ces deux témoins ne méritaient pas d'être crus a été exprimée
par le juge au procès avec assez de clarté pour rencontrer les exigences des
autorités. Deacon v. R. [1947] R.C.S. 531.

Il y a eu cependant une absence totale de directive sur la
question de savoir si, admettant que l'appelante ait fait les déclarations qui
lui étaient imputées par les deux femmes, ces déclarations étaient en fait
vraies. La preuve se rapportant à l'intoxication de l'appelante
était telle qu'il était désirable que le juge au procès avertisse le jury que
c'était un facteur qui devait être pris en considération dans l'évaluation de
la valeur comme preuve contre elle de sa confession et de ses déclarations. En
prenant pour acquis que les variances entre le prétendu aveu et le résultat de
l'autopsie démontrant comment la victime avait succombé n'avaient pas été
soulevées comme moyen de défense, et malgré le fait que l'avocat de la défense
ne s'était pas objecté au défaut du juge de commenter ce point, l'adresse du
juge au jury aurait dû quand même contenir une déclaration spécifique à l'effet
que la véracité de la prétendue admission faite par l'appelante devait être
considérée en regard de cette variance et aussi en regard de son intoxication
au temps où cet aveu était supposé avoir été fait.

Le juge Abbott, dissident:
Les griefs contre l'adresse du juge au procès soulevés par l'appelante ne
constituaient pas, tel que la Cour d'Appel l'a déclaré, des motifs suffisants
pour maintenir l'appel.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], affirming the conviction of the appellant for
manslaughter. Appeal allowed and new trial directed, Abbott J. dissenting.

H. A. D. Oliver, for the
appellant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright,
Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal
brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] by which that Court dismissed the appellant's appeal
from her conviction for manslaughter on an indictment charging her with the non-capital
murder of her mother-in-law, Mrs. Thrine Rustad on June 10, 1960.

It is apparent that the appellant
was on very bad terms with her 80-year old mother-in-law who was her next door
neighbour and who was found lying dead on the floor of her own house on June 10, 1960, and
it is also clear that the old lady had come to a violent end which the medical
evidence attributed to a blow or blows on the head, but the only direct
evidence to connect the appellant with the death consisted of a confession
which she is alleged to have made to her one-time friend, Mrs. Shannon. The
prosecution contends that this confession finds some support in the story told
by a young girl named Koronko of three statements made to her by the appellant
and it is contended also that the evidence of fingerprints found on the back
door by police sergeant Davies is consistent with the appellant having broken
into her mother-in-law's house on the night of 9th-10th of June.

At the trial the appellant's
counsel based the defence in large measure on the contention that the evidence
of Mrs. Shannon and Miss Koronko was not worthy of belief and that without that
evidence there was no case for the Crown.

Mrs. Shannon had spent the
evening of the 9th of June at the appellant's house where she had dinner and
where she and the appellant had a number of drinks together. She did not leave
the house until the early hours of the morning of the 10th of June and on the
following day made

[Page 558]

a statement to the police which
reads, in part, as follows:

Shortly after at about 9:30
p.m. Mr. Rustad packed some of his things and left the house. I didn't see him
going in his car as I wasn't paying attention. During this time a policeman
came and spoke to Mrs. Rustad. At this time I was feeling quite sleepy as a
result of my drink and lied on the couch in the living room and fell asleep.
When I woke up it was about 3:00 a.m., and I saw Mrs. Rustad walking around … She was
ranting and raving about something but I don't know what. At this time Mrs.
Rustad was drinking rye and was very excited and drunk. I then got up and made
her a cup of tea. While she was drinking her tea I washed the dishes. Shortly
thereafter Mrs. Rustad went to bed and she fell asleep right away.

In the course of the more than
three and a half years which elapsed between the death and the trial, Mrs.
Shannon made three additional statements to the police and gave evidence under
oath at the inquest, but each of the accounts which she gave differed as to her
own activities on the night in question and it was not until August 24, 1963,
that she first told the police about a confession saying:

When I awoke on the couch
Olive Rustad was standing in the middle of the living room and she came over to
me and it was then she said: 'I killed the old lady'.

At the trial Mrs. Shannon
described the conversation which she had with the appellant after she woke up
in the following terms:

Well, she came in and then
she told me that she had been over to Mrs. Rustad …And she had words with her
and then she said that she had killed her, and I said, 'Oh' or something like
that. And then I said, 'Oh, no. You didn't'. And then she said that she had
killed her with her own panties.

Q. With what?

A. Her own underwear.

Q. Her own panties; that is,
underwear. Yes?

A. Oh, she said, 'You
wouldn't like to have a murderess for a friend,' She said that to me. So I got
sick and I left—and I went out, right out the back door. It was a warm night
and the doors were open so I went right out to the fence and I got sick over
the fence.

Miss Koronko, who was 20 years
old at the date of the trial, recounted three isolated conversations which she
had had with the appellant. The first was in July 1960 when they were alone
together and Mrs. Rustad brought up the subject of her mother-in-law's death
saying ""that she hated the old lady but she could never kill her.""
Although Miss Koronko went to live with the appellant in the same house in May
1961, she does not appear to recall any other references to the matter until
one night in December 1961, at

[Page 559]

about midnight when she says that
the appellant had been drinking and was ""tight"" and while
""tight"", was discussing her mother-in-law and then she began to cry
very badly and she had her head down on her arms, on the table, and she said,
""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to go that far.""

The only other statement having
any bearing on the matter to which Miss Koronko testified was allegedly made in
February 1962 on an occasion when her boy friend, Len Soloway, was in the house
and was talking about the trouble that his sister had with her mother-in-law.
Miss Koronko says that the appellant at that time said ""that she knew that
mothers-in-law caused a lot of trouble and that Bernice, Len's sister, should
do something about it before it was too late because Mrs. Rustad knew what it
was like and she had to do something about hers"". It is noteworthy that
Soloway, who gave evidence, stated of this conversation, ""I never thought
it meant anything at that time"".

Miss Koronko went on living with
the appellant until November 1962 but does not appear to have made any mention
of these conversations to anyone in authority until May 1963.

The first ground upon which leave
to appeal to this Court was granted complained of the failure of the trial
judge ""to instruct the jury that it was dangerous and unsafe to put much
reliance upon the evidence of Mrs. Shannon because of her numerous prior
inconsistent statements both verbal and in writing and one prior statement that
she testified to under oath"".

I do not think that the
differences in detail between the various accounts given by Mrs. Shannon of her
own activities on June 9 justify the accusation of perjury which was so strongly
urged against her by appellant's counsel, but if she was telling the truth at
the trial about the appellant having confessed to the killing on the morning of
the death, it is singular to say the least of it that when giving evidence at
the inquiry into the same death only fifteen days after the alleged confession
was made, she did not mention it at all and could only explain her failure to
do so by saying, ""I always felt that you could not tell about a murder or
a killing unless you were an eye witness"". This was undoubtedly a

[Page 560]

circumstance bearing directly
upon the weight to be attached to Mrs. Shannon's evidence and constituting a
weakness in the Crown's case which the learned trial judge was bound to draw to
the attention of the jury, and the same considerations apply, although in a
lesser degree, to Miss Koronko whose evidence must be viewed in light of the
fact that the statements which she alleged to have been made by the appellant
were withheld by her from the authorities for nearly three years.

Mr. Justice Mclnnes, who presided
at the trial, pointed out to the jury that there were inconsistencies in the
various statements made by Mrs. Shannon and stressed particularly the fact that
in making three of these statements and in giving evidence at the inquest she
had said nothing about the appellant's confession. In dealing with the evidence
of both these witnesses, the learned trial judge said:

You saw these two women,
Mrs. Shannon and Miss Koronko, under lengthy cross-examination by defence
counsel. You have the fact that neither of them revealed what the accused told
them for a long period afterwards. You will have to decide how they impressed
you as witnesses and whether they are worthy of belief or not. It would be well
for you in considering what degree of credibility you attach to their evidence
to recall the evidence of Sergeant Davies as to the fingerprints and the manner
in which they were put on the door according to Davies' evidence. Of course if
you do not believe the women, then there is no necessity to consider Davies'
evidence.

Although it is true that Mr.
Justice Mclnnes would have been justified in using stronger language to
describe the weaknesses inherent in the evidence of both these witnesses, I am
none the less of opinion that he said enough to indicate that in weighing their
evidence the jury should give serious consideration to the inconsistencies in
Mrs. Shannon's statements and to the failure of both women to come forward with
their stories at an earlier date. I think that the theory of the defence that
these two witnesses were unworthy of belief was expressed in the judge's charge
with sufficient clarity to comply with the requirements indicated by this Court
in Deacon v. The King[4] ,
and in the other cases referred to in the reasons for judgment delivered by
Sheppard J.A. on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal. I would not
quash the conviction on this ground,

[Page 561]

but there are more serious
omissions which require consideration.

The whole tenor of the charge of
the learned trial judge is to the effect that if the jury believed the evidence
of Mrs. Shannon and Miss Koronko they would be justified in convicting, but
there is a total absence of any direction on the question of whether, if the
appellant did make the incriminating statements attributed to her by these
women, those statements were in fact true.

At the trial Mrs. Shannon gave it
as her opinion that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the alleged
confession and in one of her previous statements she had said that she knew the
appellant to be drunk and thought that she had lost her senses. Although the
learned trial judge referred to these comments in instructing the jury as to
the defence of drunkenness, he at no time gave them any instructions as to the
effect of her having been intoxicated on the truth or falsity of what the
appellant was alleged to have said. It is significant also that the nearest
thing to an incriminating statement alleged to have been made to Miss Koronko
was that made in December, 1961, when she says that the appellant was
""tight"". In my opinion in the present case the evidence of the
appellant's intoxication was such as to make it desirable for the trial judge
to tell the jury that it was a factor to be taken into consideration in
assessing the value of her confession and her December 1961 statement to Miss
Koronko as evidence against her.

Counsel for the appellant also
complained that the learned trial judge had omitted to tell the jury that they
should consider the question of the truth or falsity of the appellant's alleged
admission to the killing of her mother-in-law in light of the fact that Mrs.
Shannon represented her as saying that she had ""killed her with her own
panties"" whereas in fact according to the medical evidence the old lady
met her death as a result of a blow or blows on the head and there was no
suggestion that she could have been killed ""with her own panties"". In
this regard it appears to me that the case of Kelsey v. The Queen[5]
is particularly pertinent. That was a case of murder in which the accused
was alleged to have confessed nearly two years after the event to killing the
murdered man by striking him with a

[Page 562]

hammer and using an icepick
""to finish him"". The medical evidence was that the death had been
caused by blows inflicted on the head by a blunt instrument and that there was
also evidence of blows by a rigid, round and pointed instrument. Fauteux, J. in
discussing non-direction by a trial judge as a ground of appeal had this to
say:

The allotment of any
substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance resting on the omission
of the trial Judge from mentioning such argument must be conditioned on the
existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality
in the argument and in the grievance. Had the autopsy, for instance,
revealed poisoning instead of fracture of the skull as the cause of death, this
undoubtedly would have, in this case, been a point of substance relevant to the
theory of the defence. Far from conflicting with the appellant's admissions,
independent proof of certain facts in the case tends to support his material
admission, i.e. his participation in the commission of the murder.

The italics are my own.

In the present case the autopsy revealed
that death was caused by blows on the head instead of the method to which the
appellant allegedly confessed. In my view this was undoubtedly a point of
substance relevant to the theory of the defence upon which the appellant was
entitled to have the jury directed.

I am in agreement with the views
expressed in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Davey in the Court of
Appeal in so far as he says that:

If the statement that
appellant killed the victim with her own panties clearly implied that appellant
strangled her with them, the inconsistency of that statement with the absence
of any evidence of strangulation or that the panties played any part in the
cause of death, would cogently suggest that either Shannon's
evidence or appellant's admission was untrue. In that case I would have had
difficulty in supporting the verdict in the absence of a specific direction to
the jury to consider the truth of the appellant's admission in the light of
that discrepancy and the appellant's intoxication.

The italics are my own.

Mr. Justice Davey, however, took
the view that defence counsel had not raised the defence that the statements
made by Mrs. Shannon were untrue and he accordingly went on to say:

My difficulty is that the
significance of the words 'with her own panties' in this context did not occur
to either counsel at the trial and was not canvassed in the evidence. They
might have meant something quite different from strangulation, and in my
opinion it would be quite wrong to attach that meaning to the words when it was
not suggested below or explored on the evidence.

[Page 563]

With the greatest respect, I do
not share the difficulty expressed by Davey J.A. because I think that the
contentention that the appellant's confession was false was implicit in the denial
of guilt and I am also satisfied that the significance of the words ""with
her own panties"" did occur to both counsel. While it is true that the
references made to these words by defence counsel were primarily directed
towards showing that Mrs. Shannon was not telling the truth, they none the less
illustrate in the clearest terms the inconsistency between the method of
killing described in the alleged confession and the cause of death as revealed
by the medical evidence. On the other hand, it appears to me that Crown counsel
invited the jury to consider that the evidence was consistent with the use of
""panties"" having produced strangulation or some other neck injury and
having been a factor in the killing. I refer to the passage in which Crown
counsel, after quoting the words ""… and she said that she had killed her
with her own panties"" went on to say:

Now may I just stop there
for a moment while the thought crosses my mind. You might remember that bit of
evidence in connection with the evidence of Dr. Harmon in which he testified as
to the injuries to the neck of the deceased and the fingernail marks or
scratches that appeared on the neck of the deceased woman.

As I have indicated, Dr. Harmon's
evidence contained no suggestion that any neck injury caused or contributed to
the death and he was not asked whether such injury as there was to the neck
could have been caused by ""panties"", nor was such a thing suggested
anywhere in his evidence.

I am of opinion that even
assuming that the inconsistency between the alleged confession and the autopsy
was not raised by way of defence and notwithstanding the fact that defence
counsel did not object to the learned trial judge's failure to comment on it,
the charge to the jury should nevertheless have contained specific direction to
the effect that the truth of the appellant's alleged admission was to be
considered in light of this discrepancy and in light also of the appellant's
intoxication at the time when the admission was alleged to have been made.

The case of McAskill v. The
King[6]
was one of murder in which the question of whether the appellant was so
affected by drink as to be incapable of having the intent to kill was

[Page 564]

not directly raised by defence
counsel and was not made the subject of direction by the learned trial judge.
In considering the effect of the failure to put this issue before the jury,
Duff J. said at page 335:

The able and experienced
judge who presided at the trial properly directed the attention of the jury to
the defence as it was put before them by counsel for the prisoner; and, having
done this, he did not ask them to apply their minds to the further issue we
have just defined. It was the prisoner's right, however, notwithstanding the
course of his counsel at the trial, to have the jury instructed upon this
feature of the case. We think, therefore, that there must be a new trial.

I respectfully adopt this
language as having direct application to the circumstances disclosed in the
present case.

In view of all the above, I would
allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial on
the charge of manslaughter.

ABBOTT J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave, from the unanimous judgment of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia[7]
pronounced on August 5, 1964, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from her
conviction on December 5,1963, by the Honourable Mr. Justice McInnis and a jury
at the Court of Assize in the City of Vancouver on a charge of manslaughter
reduced from non-capital murder, on which charge the appellant was, on December 16, 1963,
sentenced to eight years in prison.

The appellant was convicted on
the said charge as a result of the death of her mother-in-law. The principal
evidence identifying the appellant as the one who caused the death consisted of
statements made in conversations which took place on a number of occasions
between the appellant and her friend, Helena A. Shannon and between the
appellant and her friend, Roberta Dale Koronko. The appellant did not give
evidence at the trial.

Since I have the misfortune to
differ from the conclusion arrived at by the other members of this Court that a
new trial should be ordered, and as it is not usual to discuss the details of
the evidence when that course is followed, I shall simply state briefly the
reasons for my dissent.

The contentions of the appellant
upon which leave to appeal was granted are as follows:

1. That the learned trial
judge failed to instruct the Jury that it was dangerous and unsafe to accept or
put much reliance upon the evidence

[Page 565]

of Helena C. Shannon because
of her numerous prior inconsistent statements, both verbally and in writing and
one prior inconsistent statement that was testified to under oath.

2. That the learned trial
judge misdirected the Jury, or alternatively failed to direct the Jury so as to
be a misdirection in law in omitting to leave with them the fact that the
admissions were capable of more than one inference, and in coupling the
conversation as testified to by Dale Koronko of July 1960, with that of
December 1961, so as to give the statement of the December 1961, an inference
of guilt that the words standing alone would not naturally and normally bear.

3. That the learned trial
judge failed to instruct the Jury that even though they believed the evidence
of Helena Shannon, they must still consider whether they would place any
reliance on the admissions of the accused having regard to her state of
sobriety at the time of making the same.

4. That the learned trial
judge failed to instruct the Jury that even though they believed the evidence
of Dale Koronko, they must still consider whether they would place any reliance
on the admissions of the accused having regard to her state of sobriety and her
emotional condition at the time of said statement was made.

5. That the learned trial
judge erred in failing to direct the attention of the Jury to the fact that the
admission alleged to have been made by the appellant indicated that the victim
had been killed in a certain manner and that it was established that the victim
had not been killed in that manner.

The principal argument made
before us by Counsel for appellant related to the first ground, namely, that
the learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury that it was dangerous and
unsafe to put much reliance upon the evidence Helena Shannon because of what he
contended were numerous prior inconsistent statements made by her, both
verbally and in writing, and of one prior inconsistent statement under oath.

Counsel submitted that there is a
duty in law resting upon a trial judge to give such a warning concerning
incriminating evidence of a person who has previously given contradictory
evidence under oath; and that such a warning ought to be given concerning
contradictory statements not under oath when the defence sets up the
unreliability of the evidence given by that witness at the trial.

This contention was fully dealt
with by Davey J.A. in the Court below with whose reasons and conclusions I am
in complete agreement. After carefully reviewing the authorities from Re
Harris[8]—which
decision he points out cannot be taken to correctly set forth the law of Canada—

[Page 566]

up to and including the decisions
of this Court in Deacon v. The Queen[9],Binet
v. The Queen[10] and
Lucas v. The Queen[11] ,
he said:

From these authorities it
seems to me that the obligation to give such a direction arises not from a
distinct rule of law or of practice, but from the obligation resting upon the
trial Judge under Azoulay v. The Queen (1952) 2 S.C.R. 495, and Kelsey
v. The Queen (1953) 1 S.C.R. 220, to review the substantial parts of the
evidence, and to give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of the evidence, and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as they find them; and to present clearly to the jury the
pivotal questions upon which the defence stands.

After a further discussion of the
nature of this obligation and a reference to certain authorities, he continued:

In the present case the
learned trial judge charged most carefully upon the series of conflicting
statements given by Shannon and Koronko, and left it to the jury to consider
their effect, and the long delay in revealing the facts as they gave them in
the box, upon their credibility and the weight of their evidence. In my opinion
the defence was in this respect properly put to the jury without giving a
warning that it would be dangerous to convict on such evidence considering the
explanations and the amount of other confirming evidence.

The serious discrepancies in
the earlier statements were the omission of the incriminating statements made
by the appellant, and some of the surrounding detail. Shannon said she did not
tell the full story in her earlier statements, because she was afraid of the
appellant, and because she was not asked the appropriate questions to bring it
out. But over and above that, both Shannon and Koronko were friends of the
appellant and might well have withheld the incriminating information to help
the appellant. So far as Shannon is concerned, there is no submission that she
bore any enmity or ill will to the appellant that would lead to Shannon
giving false evidence against her. There was no close connection or association
between Shannon or Koronko, although they knew each other, that would cause
Shannon to give false evidence against the appellant to favour Koronko. In view
of the whole of the Crown's case, it would have been wrong for the learned
trial judge to tell the jury that it would be dangerous to convict upon the
evidence of Shannon and Koronko.

As to the other grounds raised by
appellant relating to the truth of the statements made to Shannon and Koronko,
drunkenness and the like, these too were fully dealt with in the Court below. I
am in general agreement with what was

[Page 567]

said by Davey and Sheppard JJ.A.
as to these grounds and have nothing to add.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Counts of conspiracy to defraud and
conspiracy to steal involving six separate transactions—Whether count of conspiracy
to defraud bad as being contrary to s. 492(1) , Criminal Code —Whether facts that
jury returned verdict of guilty on both counts and that this verdict was
recorded fatal to maintenance of either conviction—Charge of making,
circulating or publishing false prospectus—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, ss. 322(1), 343(1), 492, 497, 500(1)(a), 592.

The two accused obtained control of B P Ltd. Their net outlay
for the acquisition of such control was nil. They so arranged the transaction
and so manipulated matters that the moneys invested by bond-holders in B P Ltd.
became the source of the funds wherewith the accused purchased shares and
acquired control of the company. In an indictment containing five counts the
accused were charged, inter alia, with conspiring to steal and
conspiring to defraud B P Ltd. of approximately $460,000, and that they did
""unlawfully make, circulate or publish"" a false prospectus ""with
intent to induce members of the public to advance monies to Brandon Packers
Limited"". They were convicted at trial on all five counts. The Court of
Appeal for Manitoba, the Chief Justice dissenting, affirmed the convictions for
conspiracy to defraud and issuing a false prospectus, but unanimously quashed
the other convictions, including that for conspiracy to steal. The accused
appealed to this Court from the convictions for conspiracy to defraud and
issuing a false prospectus.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed.

The conspiracy to defraud count charged a single conspiracy,
existing over a considerable period of time, the object of which was to defraud
B P Ltd. of large sums of money by such fraudulent means as presented
themselves from time to time. It was not necessary to decide whether each of
the six transactions referred to in the particulars was in itself an indictable
offence separate from the other five or whether the evidence proved in regard
to every one of these items that a crime was actually committed. What the count
alleged was that they were all planned in the course of carrying out the single
conspiracy and there was evidence to justify the jury in so finding. It was the
guilty agreement and not the several acts done in pursuance thereof which
constituted the offence charged.

[Page 501]

It was sufficient to consider the first of the six
transactions set out in the particulars. This transaction constituted an
offence under s. 323(1)  of the Criminal Code  and there was ample evidence on
which the jury could find the accused guilty of conspiracy to defraud as
charged.

The convictions for conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to
defraud could not both be supported, not because they were mutually
destructive, but because if both were allowed to stand the accused would in
reality be convicted twice of the same offence. It was the same conspiracy
which was alleged in the two counts and it would be contrary to law that the
accused should be punished more than once for the same offence. The Court of
Appeal had power under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code , particularly s.
592(1) (b)(i) and 592(3) , to decide that the conviction on the conspiracy to
steal count should be quashed and that on the conspiracy to defraud count
should be affirmed.

Section 343(1) (c) creates only one offence, the essence of
which is an attempt to induce persons to advance moneys to a company by means
of a prospectus known to the accused to be false in a material particular. The
making, circulating or publishing of such a prospectus are not separate
offences, but are modes in which the one offence may be committed. A prospectus
may be ""false in a material particular"" within the meaning of s.
343(1) if it contains a material statement as to the purpose for which the
proceeds from the sale of the securities offered in the prospectus are to be
used and it is found that the person making the statement had never any
intention that the proceeds should be used for that purpose. The test is not
whether the statement amounted strictly speaking to a ""false
pretence"" but rather whether the conduct of the accused in making it was fraudulent.
The expression ""any person"" includes all persons of the class to whom
the prospectus was intended to be given although at the time the false
prospectus was made the identity of none of these persons was known.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—The
appellants Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox were tried before Monnin J. and a jury
on an indictment containing the following five counts:

1. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between
the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and
fifty-six and the thirtieth day of November in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in
the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully conspire together each with the other
to commit an indictable offence, to wit: to steal the monies; valuable
securities or other property of Brandon Packers Limited to the value of
approximately Four hundred and sixty thousand ($460,000.00) Dollars.

2. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between
the first day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and
fifty-six and the thirtieth day of November in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in
the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully steal the monies, valuable securities
or other property of Brandon Packers Limited to the value of approximately Four
hundred and forty-eight thousand ($448,000.00) Dollars.

3. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between
the first day of January in the year of our Lord"" one thousand nine
hundred and. fifty-six and the. thirtieth day. of November in the year of our
Lord one thousand nine hundred. and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of
Brandon, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully conspire together each
with the other to commit an indictable offence, to wit: by deceit, falsehood or
other fraudulent means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited of monies, valuable
securities or other property to the value of approximately Four Hundred and
sixty thousand ($460,000.00) Dollars.

4. That they the said Hugh Paton. and D. Hubert, Cox between
the first day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and
fifty-six and the thirtieth day of November in the year of our Lord one.
thousand nine hundred and sixty both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in
the Province of Manitoba, by ""deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means,
defrauded Brandon Packers Limited of monies, valuable securities or other
property to the value of approximately Four hundred and forty-eight thousand
($448;000,00) Dollars.

5. That they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox between
the first day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and
fifty-six and the first day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine
hundred and-fifty-seven both days inclusive, at the City of Brandon, in the
Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully make, circulate or publish a prospectus
dated July 14th, 1956 for a four hundred thousand ($400,000.00) Dollar issue of
five and one-half (5½%) per centum sinking fund bonds of Brandon Packers
Limited, they the said Hugh Paton and D. Hubert Cox knowing the said prospectus
to be false in a material particular with intent to induce members of the
public to advance monies to Brandon Packers. Limited.

Before the accused had pleaded to the indictment their
counsel moved to quash count 3 on the ground that it was

[Page 503]

void for uncertainty and to quash count 5 on the ground that
it disclosed no offence known to the law since it did not charge an intent to
induce an ascertained person or ascertained persons to advance moneys but
charged an intent to induce ""members of the public"" to advance
moneys. Both of these motions were dismissed by the learned trial judge.

In the course of the argument of these motions, which took
place in the absence of the members of the jury panel and before the jury had
been selected, counsel for the Crown stated that counts 3 and 4 were ""in
effect alternative charges to counts 1 and 2"" ; but this was not at any
stage of the trial pointed out to the jury.

No order, such as is contemplated by s. 497  of the Criminal
Code , that the prosecutor should furnish particulars was made; but it
appears from the transcript of the argument on the motions referred to above
that counsel for the Crown had orally given particulars at the preliminary
inquiry and these he repeated in his opening address to the jury at the trial.
The particulars stated that the amount of ""approximately $460,000""
referred to in counts 1 and 3 was made up as follows:

1.Investment by Brandon
Packers Limited preferred shares of Fropak Limited;..........................................................................                                                                                                                           $200,000.00

2.Reimbursement to the accused
for out-of-pocket expenses; ...................................................................................................                                                                                                                           4,219.41

3.Payment for office space and
services in Toronto;.................                                                                                                                           8,000.00

4.Payment of real estate
agent's commission in respect of purchase of plant at Lakehead;..................................................                                                                                                                           4,000.00

5.Management fees; .................................................................                                                                                                                           208,750.00

6.Loans to companies controlled
by accused...........................                                                                                                                           38,500.00

                                                                                                                           $463,469.41

The particulars also stated that the amount of
""approximately $448,000"" referred to in counts 2 and 4 was made up of
the same six items except that in the case of the management fees, item 5, the
amount actually collected from Brandon Packers Limited was $196,715.24.

At the end of the case for the Crown, counsel for the
appellants moved to quash counts 1 and 3 on the ground that the evidence
disclosed that each of them applied to at least six separate and distinct
transactions and not a single transaction. The motion was denied.

[Page 504]

Towards the end of his charge to the jury the learned trial
judge instructed them that they might find a verdict of guilty or not guilty on
each of the five counts.

At the conclusion of the charge counsel for the accused made
the submission, amongst others, that counts 1 and 2 were alternatives to counts
3 and 4 and that the jury should be instructed that they could not convict on
both count 1 and count 3 or on both count 2 and count 4. Counsel for the Crown
opposed this submission and the learned trial judge did not give the direction
asked for.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty against each of the
appellants on all five counts. The learned trial judge imposed sentences of
seven years imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.

The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.
The appeals were heard by a Court composed of Miller C.J.M., Schultz, Freedman
and Guy JJ.A. and Bastin J. (ad hoc). The Court unanimously
decided that counts 1, 2 and 4 should be quashed and that a verdict of
acquittal should be entered on each of them. The majority of the Court (Miller
C.J.M., dissenting) dismissed the appeals against the convictions on counts 3
and 5; the sentences were reduced to imprisonment for four years on each of
these counts, the sentences to run concurrently.

Miller C.J.M. dissenting as to counts 3 and 5 would have
quashed the convictions and directed verdicts of acquittal to be entered on
both of these counts.

In the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal it is recited
that the Chief Justice dissented ""on the following grounds in law"":

1. That Count 5 in the Indictment is void for uncertainty in
that it charges more than one offence, namely, three separate offences of
making, circulating or publishing a false prospectus which form of charge in a
single count in the Indictment is prohibited by section 492  of the Criminal
Code .

2. That the learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct
the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal on Count 5 in the Indictment when
an application for a directed verdict was made by defence counsel at the close
of the evidence for the Crown since there was absolutely no evidence adduced
that the Appellants made, published or circulated a prospectus, or that the
prospectus was false in a material particular to the knowledge of the
Appellants.

3. That there was no evidence adduced at the trial that the
Appellants made, published, or circulated a prospectus.

[Page 505]

4. That there was no evidence adduced that the prospectus
was false in a material particular to the knowledge of the Appellants.

5. That the verdict of guilty by the jury on Count 5 in the
Indictment was perverse.

6. That Count 3 in the Indictment while alleging a single
transaction involved six separate and distinct transactions and that the
learned trial Judge erred in failing to quash the said Count 3 or direct the
jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal thereon.

7. That the learned trial Judge erred in directing the jury
that they could consider the charging of management fees by Great West Saddlery
Company Limited to Brandon Packers Limited in the sum of $208,750.00 as
indicating a conspiracy to defraud on the part of the Appellants, when there
was no evidence of fraud with respect to the said management fees and when the
charging and collection of the said management fees did not amount to a crime.

8. That the verdict of the jury was inconsistent and
uncertain in bringing in a verdict of guilty on both Counts 1 and 3 in the
Indictment when these were alternative Counts, each containing six separate
transactions and that the verdict of the jury was therefore confusing and
uncertain in that it could not be ascertained on which item or items the jury
had based its finding.

9. That the verdict of the jury was inconsistent and
uncertain and could not be allowed to stand as a conviction on Counts 1 or 3 in
the Indictment since it could not be said that the jury convicted the
Appellants either of conspiracy to steal or conspiracy to defraud, in
connection with the item of $200,000.00 referred to in the particulars of the
Counts supplied by the Crown.

10. Counts 1 and 3 in the Indictment each related to more
than a single transaction and as a result the verdict of the jury was
ambiguous, inconsistent and improper in that no one knows upon which of the
various transactions the jury convicted and upon which of the various transactions
the jury acquitted.

11. Since the jury by its verdict in Counts 1 and 3 found
that each Count contained more than a single transaction, some being theft and
some fraud, and this being contrary to Section 492  of the Criminal Code  all
of the said Counts 1 and 3 must be quashed.

12. The verdict of guilty brought in by the jury on both
Counts 1 and 3 in the Indictment is fatal to the maintenance of both
convictions.

By orders of this Court made on October 29, 1962, leave was
granted to both of the accused to appeal from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal on the following ground:

Does Count 5 in the indictment disclose any offence known to
our law since it does not charge that the appellants published a prospectus
with intent to induce an ascertained person or ascertained persons to advance
monies but charges an intent 'to induce members of the public to advance
monies'.

The notices of appeal to this Court served by both of the
accused were founded on the ground on which leave was granted and on

the grounds in law set forth by Miller C.J.M. in his dissent
from the judgment of the said Court of Appeal which said grounds of dissent in

[Page 506]

law are more particularly set out in the reasons for
judgment of the said Miller C.J.M. and in the certificate of judgment of the
said Court of Appeal.

By orders of this Court made on October 29, 1962, leave was
granted to the Attorney-General of the Province of Manitoba to appeal from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal, in so far as it quashed the conviction on
count 4. The grounds upon which this leave was granted in the case of each
accused were:

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that there were
six separate and ""distinct transactions involved in the offence set forth
in count 4 of the indictment?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that count 4 in
the indictment offended against subsection (1)  of section 492  of the Criminal
Code  in that it did not in general apply to a single transaction?

3. Did the Court of Appeal err in not affirming the
conviction on count 4 in the indictment when it was satisfied that the evidence
disclosed that the respondent had by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
means, defrauded Brandon Packers Limited of monies, valuable securities and
other property?

At the conclusion of the argument in this Court counsel for
the Crown stated, in answer to a question from the bench, that in the event of
the appeals of the accused as to either count 3 or count 5 being dismissed he
did not wish to press the appeals of the Crown as to count 4.

In the course of the trial which occupied thirty-nine days
more than six hundred exhibits were filed. The lengthy and complex history of
the transactions out of which the charges against the appellants arose is
outlined in the reasons of Miller C.J.M. and more briefly in those of Freedman
J.A. and of Guy J.A. I shall endeavour to state the relevant facts as briefly
as is consistent with making clear the questions which arise on these appeals.
I will deal first with the circumstances under which the appellants obtained
control of Brandon Packers Limited.

Brandon Packers Limited was incorporated under the Companies
Act of Manitoba in 1936. In that year it had sold a debenture issue of
$200,000 falling due on December 1, 1956. The indebtedness remaining on this issue
in 1956 was $79,100. Joseph C. Donaldson was the principal shareholder in
Brandon Packers Limited. He and Miss Minnie E. Peary held 12,535 common shares,
of the par value of $5, out of a total issued of 14,530; and Donaldson held
58,120

[Page 507]

preferred shares of the par value of $1. Donaldson had been
president and a director of the company from its inception and Miss Peary had
been a director and secretary-treasurer for a number of years.

Early in 1956 Donaldson was considering selling his shares.
It was clear that a new bond issue would have to be sold to provide the $79,100
required to pay the bonds maturing in December and the company, while solvent,
was in need of additional working capital. Through one Allan Bass, who was
acting as agent for Donaldson, the two accused became interested as possible
purchasers of Donaldson's shares; in March 1956, they went to Brandon,
inspected the company's plant and had a discussion with Donaldson as to the
sale of his shares and the issue of bonds by Brandon Packers Limited.

Following negotiations, to which it is unnecessary to refer
in detail, an agreement under seal dated June 11, 1956, was entered into
between Donaldson as optionor and Paton Corporation Limited as optionee,
whereby in consideration of $10,000 paid in cash the optionor granted an
option, irrevocable up to September 30, 1956, to purchase all the shares of
Brandon Packers Limited ""owned or controlled by the optionor"" namely,
12,535 common shares at a total price of $188,000 and 51,748 preferred shares
at a total price of $51,748. If the option was exercised the transaction was to
be closed on or before December 2, 1956. The common shares were to be paid for
as follows: the $10,000 paid for the option was to be credited on the purchase
price, $78,000 was to be paid in cash on closing, and $100,000 ""in bonds
to be issued by Brandon Packers Limited on the date of closing"". (It was
later arranged between the parties that $178,000 should be paid in cash to
Donaldson on closing and that he should use $100,000 thereof to purchase
$100,000 of the bonds). The preferred shares were to be paid for on or before
December 2, 1957.

The option agreement contained the following paragraph:

It is the stated intention of the optionee to procure that
Brandon Packers Limited will issue bonds to the extent of $400,000.00 for sale
and the optionor agrees to use his best endeavors to promote the sale of such
bonds of the Company.

The evidence is clear that both of the accused were acting
together in taking this option and in the various trans-

[Page 508]

actions which followed. At all relevant times the appellant
Paton owned or controlled all the shares in Paton Corporation Limited, and
similarly the appellant Cox controlled Leomar Investment Corporation Limited
which was described as his personal holding corporation. The $10,000 payable at
the time of the signing of the option agreement was paid by a cheque of Leomar
Investment Corporation Limited.

On September 27, 1956, the appellants exercised their option
under the agreement of June 11, 1956. The transaction was closed on November
21, 1956. In July, under circumstances to be mentioned later, a prospectus
regarding the issue of $400,000 5½ per cent sinking fund bonds of Brandon
Packers Limited had been signed and filed and by November 21, 1956, about
$275,000 of the bonds had been sold. Prior to this date the appellants had
obtained supplementary letters patent amending the charter of Fropak Limited, a
company controlled by them, to permit it to issue preferred shares. On the
evidence it was open to the jury to conclude that Fropak Limited had no assets
of any value.

The purchase of Donaldson's shares was completed in the
following way.

On November 20, 1956, the appellants met with Donaldson at
Brandon in order to close out the transaction.

On November 20, 1956, Donaldson made out a cheque of Brandon
Packers Limited for $200,000 payable to the Imperial Bank of Canada. This
cheque was signed by Donaldson and Miss Peary.

On November 21, 1956, Brandon Packers Limited executed a
contract to which the seal of the company was affixed, whereby Brandon Packers
Limited agreed to purchase from Fropak Limited 2,000 preference shares of the
par value of $100 each. This agreement was signed by the appellants on behalf
of Fropak Limited and by Donaldson and Miss Peary on behalf of Brandon Packers
Limited.

On the afternoon of November 21, 1956, the appellants and
Donaldson met with John English, manager of the Imperial Bank at Brandon, in
his office. At this meeting Donaldson turned over the $200,000 cheque of
Brandon Packers Limited to English with a letter stating that the cheque was in
payment of 2,000 preferred shares of Fropak

[Page 509]

Limited. This cheque for $200,000 was deposited to the
credit of an internal account in the bank, known as a remittance account.
English then drew a cheque on the remittance account for $183,560, in favour of
Donaldson which was endorsed by Donaldson, and deposited to the credit of C his
account. The balance in the remittance account, $16,440, was remitted by the
bank to the Imperial Bank at Toronto to go to the credit of the account of
Fropak Limited.

The difference between the amount of $183,560 and the
$178,000 which, under the option agreement, was to be paid on closing is
accounted for by the fact that on November 21, 1956, Donaldson held a total of
12,904 common shares of Brandon Packers Limited, having acquired an additional
369 shares after June 11, 1956. The purchase price of the 12,904 shares at $15
per share was $193,560. The sum of $10,000 had already been paid as a deposit,
leaving a balance of $183,560.

While at the office of English on November 21, 1956,
Donaldson drew a cheque on his account for the sum of $100,000 payable to
Imperial Bank of Canada and delivered it to English to be used in payment for
the bonds of Brandon Packers Limited purchased by Donaldson in accordance with
the agreement referred to above. Later these bonds were delivered to Donaldson.

English was given a letter signed by Donaldson and Miss
Peary authorizing the bank to turn over to Paton Corporation Limited and Leomar
Investment Corporation Limited the 12,904 common shares of Brandon Packers
Limited on receipt of the said sum of $183,560, and on November 21, 1956,
English delivered these shares to the appellants.

Some time after November 21, 1956, 2,000 preference shares
in Fropak Limited were issued to Brandon Packers Limited and the share
certificates were delivered.

Paton Corporation Limited and Leomar Investment Corporation
Limited each signed a promissory note dated November 21, 1956, for $91,780 in
favour of Fropak Limited making up the sum of $183,560 which Fropak Limited had
advanced to the said two corporations and with which Donaldson's shares were
purchased.

It is to this transaction that the first item of the particulars
of count 3 furnished by the Crown refers. Its true

[Page 510]

substance and effect are described by Freedman J.A. in the
following passage in his reason's, which I wish to adopt:

Paton and Cox obtained control of Brandon Packers Limited.
Their net outlay for the acquisition of such control was exactly nil. Indeed
their corporation, Fropak. Limited, emerged from the transaction with a net
gain of $6,440, being the difference between $200,000 invested by Brandon
Packers Limited in preferred shares of Fropak Limited, less $193,560 paid to
Donaldson. The daylight loan from the bank was the apparent but not the actual
source of the funds making possible the implementation of the scheme. The real
source was the monies in the hands of Brandon Packers Limited that had been
obtained from the sale of bonds. It was the existence of these monies which
guaranteed. the immediate repayment to the bank of its loan so as to enable its
advance safely to be made in the form of a daylight loan. In short, the two accused
so arranged the transaction and so manipulated matters that the monies invested
by the bondholders in Brandon Packers Limited became the source of the funds
wherewith the accused purchased Donaldson's shares and acquired control of
Brandon Packers Limited.

Brandon Packers Limited did acquire preferred stock of
Fropak Limited having a purported value of $200,000. Implicit in the entire
transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a legitimate, bona
fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to make. In fact, however,
Fropak Limited was not an operating company and it was entirely without assets.
Its charter, which had lapsed, was admittedly revived by the accused for the
purposes of this very transaction. At the same time supplementary letters
patent were obtained, creating the preferred shares which were required in the
implementation of the accused's scheme. For its $200,000 Brandon Packers
Limited obtained shares whose worth. was negligible.

We were informed that the phrase ""daylight loan""
denotes a loan which is made and repaid on the same day.

I do not find it necessary to deal in detail with the facts
in regard to the remaining five items in the particulars shewing how it was
alleged that the total of $460,000 mentioned in count 3 was made up. It is
sufficient to say that as to items 2, 3, 4 and 5, the theory of the
Crown was that the appellants, who were then in control of Brandon Packers
Limited, expressly or by necessary implication represented that these sums were
owing by that company to the appellants or to companies controlled by them and
obtained payment thereof when they knew that in fact Brandon Packers Limited
was not under liability to make any of the payments; and that as regards item 6
the loans made to companies controlled by the appellants were not merely
unlawful in the sense that they were unauthorized but that the moneys
""loaned"" were paid over without any intention on the part of the
appellants that they would be repaid.

[Page 511]

Turning now to the grounds on which Miller C.J.M. dissented
as to the conviction on count 3, I would first observe that, in my opinion, the
appellants are entitled to rely on the particulars given orally by counsel for
the Crown to the same extent as if they had been furnished pursuant to an order
made under s. 497  of the Criminal Code . On this point I agree with the
statement of Beck J.A. in R. v. Carswell1:

S.859 (a predecessor of S.497 ) empowers the trial judge to
order particulars.

If he does so it must be clear that the prosecutor is bound
by the particulars which he gives in accordance with the order.

If without order he gives particulars he must be equally
bound.

The grounds of dissent as to count 3 are those numbered 6 to
12 inclusive in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal quoted above. It
appears to me that these, other than number 7 which will be considered
separately, raise in different words the following two questions of law:

1. Was count 3 bad on. the ground that it charged not, one
offence but six separate offences contrary to s.492(1)  of the Criminal Code ?

2. Were the facts that the jury returned a verdict of guilty
on both count 1 and count 3 and that this verdict was recorded fatal to the
maintenance of either conviction so that as a matter of law both must now be
quashed?

On the first of these questions I am in agreement with the
reasons of Freedman J.A. and will not repeat them at length.

Count 3 charges a single conspiracy, existing over a
considerable period of time, the object of which was to defraud Brandon Packers
Limited of large sums of money by such fraudulent means as presented themselves
from time to time. It is not necessary on this appeal to decide whether each of
the six transactions referred to in the particulars was in itself an indictable
offence separate from the other five or whether the evidence proved in regard
to every one of these items that a crime was actually committed. Assuming that
each was separate from the others and that count 4 was therefore bad, what
count 3 alleged was that they were all planned in the course of carrying out
the single conspiracy and there was evidence to justify the jury in so finding.
It was the guilty agreement and not the several acts

[Page 512]

done in pursuance thereof which constituted the offence
charged in count 3.

I agree with Freedman J.A. that for the purpose of dealing
with the appeal as to count 3 it is sufficient to consider the first of the six
transactions set out in the particulars. I have already quoted his summary of
the effect of that transaction. I share the view which he expressed (with the
concurrence of Schultz J.A. and, on this point, of Bastin J.) and which Guy
J.A. expressed in separate reasons that this transaction constituted an offence
under s. 323(1)  of the Criminal Code  and that there was ample evidence
on which the jury could find the accused guilty of conspiracy to defraud as
charged in count 3.

In the course of argument on this branch of the appeal
counsel for the appellants submitted that there was no evidence that the
appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they intended to do so
because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false representation made
to the company or of any official of the company having been deceived into
parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished. Assuming,
without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the meaning of
s. 597(1)  of the Criminal Code , I would reject this argument. I will
examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to the $200,000 which
is the first item in the particulars. I have already indicated my agreement
with the statement of Freedman J.A. that ""implicit in the entire
transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a legitimate bona
fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to make"" and with his view
that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding that this representation was
false to the knowledge of the accused. If it deceived Donaldson, who was still
nominally at least in control of the company, into paying over the $200,000 to
Fropak that would be a fraud on the company. If, on the other hand, it is
suggested that Donaldson was not deceived but paid the money over knowing that
the transaction was not bona fide, that the Fropak shares were worthless
and that their purchase was merely a step in a scheme to enable the accused to
buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with its own money, that would simply
be to say that Donaldson was particeps criminis. If all the directors of
a company should join in

[Page 513]

using its funds to purchase an asset which they knew to be
worthless as part of a scheme to divert those funds to their own use they
would, in my opinion, be guilty under s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of
those funds. Even supposing it could be said that, the directors being
""the mind of the company"" and well knowing the true facts, the
company was not deceived (a proposition which I should find it difficult to
accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case the directors would have
defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood, by ""other fraudulent
means"".

I turn now to the second question whether the recorded
verdict of guilty on both counts 1 and 3 requires that both verdicts be
quashed.

It has already been pointed out that counts 1 and 3 were
expressly stated by counsel for the Crown to be alternative. In my respectful
opinion the learned trial judge should have so instructed the jury in his
charge and when the jury returned their verdict, instead of having it recorded
he should have sent them back to reconsider it, with definite instructions that
they must not return a verdict of guilty on both counts 1 and 3.

On this ground counsel for the appellants rely particularly
on the following decisions: Commonwealth v. Haskins et al.2;
Heinze et al. v. State3; and R. v. Mills4.

The principle stated in the first two of these cases is
summarized in the following passage in the reasons of Delaplaine J., who
delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Maryland in Heinze et al.
v. State, at p. 130:

It is unquestioned that a finding of guilty on two
inconsistent counts is invalid. Thus where a defendant is charged in one count
with larceny and in another count with receiving stolen goods, and it plainly
appears that the property alleged to have been stolen is that also alleged to
have been received, a general verdict of guilty is fatally defective, because
in law a thief cannot be guilty of the crime of receiving stolen goods which he
himself has stolen, and a guilty receiver of stolen goods cannot himself be the
thief, and hence the defendant could not be guilty on both counts.

R. v. Mills is a decision of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in England composed of Byrne, Slade and Salmon JJ. The

[Page 514]

note is brief and I have not been able to find a fuller
report. The whole note reads as follows:

M. was tried at quarter sessions on an indictment containing
four counts, namely, (i) larceny of a motor-car, (ii) taking and driving away
the car without the owner's consent, (iii) receiving the car. knowing it to
have been stolen, and (iv) larceny of two number plates of the car. He was
acquitted of the first two offences and convicted of the last two. The original
number plates on the motor-car had been taken off and false number plates
substituted. On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal:

Held, that the two verdicts of guilty were really
mutually destructive. If M. had, as the jury found (owing perhaps to the
deputy-chairman's unfortunate failure to give a sufficient direction with
regard to possession), received the motor-car, then plainly he had received it
with the substituted plates upon it, and he could not be found to have received
the motor-car knowing it to have been stolen and at the same time to have
stolen the two original number plates, for the two things stood together.
Accordingly, the appeal would be allowed.

In my opinion, these cases rightly decide that the
convictions of an accused (i) of stealing an article and (ii) of receiving the
same article knowing it to have been stolen cannot both stand. But in so far as
they hold that an Appellate Court has no power to uphold either conviction they
appear to be at variance with the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
and of this Court in Kelly v. The King5. In that case the
jury rendered a verdict of guilty on count 1, theft of money, belonging to the
King, count 2, unlawfully receiving money belonging to the King knowing the
same to have been stolen and, count 4, obtaining money by false pretences from
His Majesty. The convictions on these three counts were upheld by a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal.

It appears from p. 228 of the report in this Court that
counsel for the accused argued that the accused could not be guilty of all
three of these offences that he could not, indeed, be guilty of any two of them
and that consequently the whole conviction was bad. This Court was unanimous in
dismissing the appeal.

Anglin J., in whose judgment Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J.
concurred, said at pp. 261 and 262:

Although the conviction of the appellant on three distinct
counts in. an indictment—No. 1, for theft, No. 2, for receiving, and No. 4, for
obtaining money by false pretences—was upheld by a majority of the learned
judges of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the Chief Justice, as we

[Page 515]

understand with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Perdue and
Mr. Justice Cameron, said (35 West L.R. 57):—

It is difficult to see how the
accused should for one crime be found guilty on the first, second and fourth
counts. That he has committed a crime seems by the evidence to be clearly
established, and it is perhaps best established under the fourth count.

I assume that the trial judge in
pronouncing sentence will consider that the accused was found guilty of but one
crime, and in considering the maximum sentence allowed by law I think he should
be guided by the lowest maximum fixed by law for either of the three crimes set
forth in the first, second and fourth counts.

This course being taken, I do not
think such substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned at the trial as
would justify a new trial under sec. 1019 of the Code.

There seems no necessity to
interfere with the finding of guilty on the inconsistent counts. He was
certainly guilty of one of them and as he will be punished on one only, I would
follow the course taken in Rex v. Lockett (1914) 2 K.B. 720, at p. 733.

The formal judgment of the court, however, does not direct
that the penalty to be imposed shall be so limited; but Mr. Coyne, while
vigorously insisting that the conviction on all three counts should be
sustained, stated at bar in this Court that, as counsel representing the Crown
he submitted to the judgment of the Court of Appeal being dealt with as if it
contained a provision under section 1020  of the Criminal Code  limiting the
penalty as indicated by the learned Chief Justice.

Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and
especially to the possible embarrassment which may have been caused by the
trial together of five separate counts, and to the fact that the learned trial
judge, while he carefully defined each of the offences charged, deemed it
advisable to abstain from instructing the jury as to the facts in evidence
bearing upon each branch of the indictment, we think the position taken by
counsel for the Crown eminently proper and that ""we ought to treat the
verdict as a verdict on the lesser charge,"" namely, that of obtaining
money by false pretences.

In the result the convictions on all three counts were
allowed to stand. It seems clear that this Court was of opinion that the
conviction on count 4 could be upheld in spite of its inconsistency with the
convictions on counts 1 and 2.

If, however, it be assumed that the three cases relied on by
the appellants were correctly decided they do not appear to me to be applicable
to the circumstances of the case at bar. I incline to agree with the view
expressed by Freedman J.A. that in the case of each of the six transactions
referred to in the particulars the crime, if crime there was, was fraud rather
than theft. But suppose it were otherwise and that some of the items
particularized constituted fraud and others theft, there may well be a single
conspiracy to com-

[Page 516]

mit a number of different offences; the cases of R. v.
Graham6 and R. v. Rose7,
referred to by Freedman J.A., are apt illustrations. The reason that the
convictions on counts 1 and 3 cannot both be supported is not that they are
""mutually destructive"", as was said of the counts in R. v. Mills,
supra, but rather that if both were allowed to stand the accused would in
reality be convicted twice of the same offence. It is the same conspiracy which
is alleged in the two counts and it would be contrary to law that the accused
should be punished more than once for the same offence.

In my view, the Court of Appeal has power under Part XVIII
of the Criminal Code , particularly s. 592(1) (b)(i) and s. 592(3) ,
to decide that the conviction on count 1 should be quashed and that on count 3
affirmed.

It remains to consider the ground of dissent numbered 7 set
out in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal and quoted earlier in these
reasons.

This ground is based on the premise that there was no
evidence on which it was open to the jury to find that the moneys paid over as
management fees were obtained from Brandon Packers Limited by fraud. In my
opinion, there was evidence to support a finding that the appellants
represented that these fees were owing when to their knowledge Brandon Packers
Limited was under no liability to pay them. It was open to the jury to take the
view that the services for which the fees purported to be paid were negligible
and that the disproportion between the services rendered and the amount paid
was so great as to shew that the transaction was fraudulent. The premise on
which this ground is based is not established and it should be rejected.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeals as to the conviction
on count 3.

The grounds on which the conviction on count 5 is attacked
may be summarized as follows:

1. That the count is void in that it charges not one
offence but the three separate offences of (i) making, (ii) circulating, and
(iii) publishing a prospectus knowing the same to be false in a material
particular with the intent specified in clause (c) of s. 343(1).

[Page 517]

2. That there was no evidence that the appellants made,
circulated or published the prospectus.

3. That there was no evidence that the prospectus was
false in a material particular to the knowledge of the appellants.

4. That the count does not disclose any offence known
to the law since it does not charge that the appellants published a prospectus
with intent to induce an ascertained person or ascertained persons to advance
moneys but charges an intent ""to induce members of the public to advance
moneys"".

As to the first ground it will be observed that the count
follows the wording of s. 343(1) (c) of the Criminal Code  and it
is necessary to consider the effect of s. 492(2) (b) and of s.500(1) (a):

492(2) The statement referred to in subsection (1) may be

* * *

(b) in the words of the
enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an
indictable offence, …

500(1) A count is not objectionable by reason only that

(a) it charges in the alternative
several different matters, acts or omissions that, are stated in the
alternative in an enactment that describes as an indicable offence the matters,
acts or omissions charged in the count …

In my opinion, it is clear since the judgment of this Court
in Archer v. The Queen1 that these provisions do not
render a count good if the words of the enactment which are adopted in framing
the count describe more than one offence, and the question to be decided is
whether the words of s. 343(1) (c) describe one offence or more than one.

I have reached the conclusion that s. 343(1) (c)
creates only one offence, the essence of which is an attempt to induce persons
to advance moneys to a company by means of a prospectus known to the accused to
be false in a material particular and that the making, circulating or
publishing are not separate offences but are modes in which the one offence may
be committed. I would reject this first ground of appeal.

Ground 2 may be shortly dealt with. There is evidence that
the issue and sale of the bonds was an integral part of the scheme of the appellants
from its inception, that the

[Page 518]

portion of the prospectus which the Crown claims to be false
was drafted by the appellant Paton and approved by the appellant Cox, that it
was sent by Paton to Donaldson with the intention that it be incorporated in
the prospectus which was filed and circulated and that it was so incorporated.
This was sufficient evidence to support a finding that both appellants took
part in making the prospectus. I would reject this second ground of appeal.

As to the third ground the portion of the prospectus claimed
by the Crown to be false in a material particular is that reading as follows:

PURPOSE OF ISSUE

The proceeds to be received by the Company from the sale of
$400,000 of First Mortgage Bonds offered by the Prospectus, will be used by the
Company for the redemption of outstanding debentures of $79,000, the expansion
of its existing business and additions thereto, particularly with respect to
the erection of a quick freezing and cold storage plant and for other corporate
purposes.

If in fact at the time they arranged to have this statement
incorporated in the prospectus the appellants had already formed the intention
of using a large portion of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds not for any
of the purposes stated (other than the redemption of the outstanding bonds) but
for the purpose of providing themselves with the funds to purchase the shares
of Brandon Packers Limited then, in my opinion, the prospectus was to their
knowledge false in a material particular. There was evidence on which it was
open to the jury to so find. That such a false statement was likely to induce
and was intended to induce persons to purchase the bonds is obvious. As to this
ground I am in general agreement with the views expressed by Freedman J.A.

Before concluding the examination of this ground of appeal
it is necessary to consider the argument of counsel for the appellants that
even if at the time of drafting the statement as to the purpose of the bond
issue, quoted above, the accused had formed the intention of using a large
portion of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds for the purpose mentioned in
the preceding paragraph of these reasons, this circumstance did not render the
prospectus ""false in a material particular"" within the meaning of
that phrase as used in s. 343(1) . It is said that an offence under this section
is created only if the material particular in which the pros-

[Page 519]

pectus is false amounts to a false pretence, that is to say
is a representation of a matter of fact either present or past ; that, whatever
may be the rule in civil cases, a statement of present intention about future
conduct does not amount to a false pretence in criminal law.

In support of this argument reliance is placed upon the
decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Dent8, and
particularly the following passage in the reasons of the Court, delivered by
Devlin J. and concurred in by Lord Goddard C.J. and Donovan J., at p. 595:

The case for the prosecution is that when the appellant
entered into each of the contracts in this case, he thereby impliedly
represented that he intended to carry it out, whereas in fact he had no such
intention. It is, of course, undisputed that to constitute a false pretence the
false statement must be of an existing fact. The prosecution contend that a
statement of present intention, although it relates to the future, is a
statement of existing fact. That was the view expressed by Bowen L.J. in his
celebrated dictum in Edgington v. Fitzmaurice:

There must be a misstatement of
an existing fact: but the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state
of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state
of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as
much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man's
mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact.

Edgington v. Fitzmaurice was an action for deceit.
Whatever the position may be in civil cases, we are satisfied that a long
course of authorities in criminal cases has laid it down that a statement of
intention about future conduct, whether or not it be a statement of existing
fact, is not such a statement as will amount to a false pretence in criminal
law.

The charges on which the accused were convicted in R. v.
Dent were all of obtaining moneys by false pretences; the convictions were
quashed.

This judgment may be contrasted with that of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in the following year in the case of R. v. Ingram9.
The Court was composed of Lord Goddard C.J., Streatfield and Donovan JJ.
The accused was convicted on six counts of obtaining credit by fraud contrary
to s. 13(1) of the Debtors Act (1869) which reads as follows:

13. Any person shall in each of the cases following be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be liable to be
imprisoned for any time not exceeding one year with or without hard labour;
that is to say,

(1) If in incurring any debt or liability he has obtained
credit under false pretences, or by means of any other fraud;

[Page 520]

Donovan J. delivered the judgment of the Court. He said
at p. 640:

The appellant is an electrician, and the fraud alleged
against him was this: that he obtained contracts from a number of shopkeepers
to erect or renovate electric neon signs at an agreed price. He obtained
payment of part of that price in advance, but did not do the work save for
insignificant matters of a preparatory nature. He was in financial
difficulties, and none of the advance payments was returned.

The jury were properly directed that they could not convict
the appellant unless they were satisfied, inter alia, that in obtaining these
advance payments and then failing to do the work he was acting fraudulently,
that is to say, that he never had any intention to do the stipulated work at
the time when he received payments in advance. The jury, influenced no doubt by
what appeared to be a systematic course of conduct on the appellant's part,
convicted him, and it must accordingly be taken that they found that when he
received part payments at the outset he had no intention to do the work he had
undertaken to do. On any view, therefore, his conduct was fraudulent, but he
argues that it involved no obtaining of credit and thus no offence under s.
13(1) of the Debtors Act, 1869.

The Court then examined and rejected the argument that the
conduct, though fraudulent, did not involve obtaining credit and the
convictions were affirmed.

Since two members of the Court which decided R. v. Ingram
had taken part in the judgment in R. v. Dent given in the previous
year, it can safely be assumed that they were of the view that there was no
inconsistency between the two judgments. The reconciliation is found in the
circumstance that in R. v. Dent to support the conviction it was
necessary to find that there had been a false pretence while in R. v. Ingram
it was sufficient to find that, although there had been no false pretence,
there had been ""other fraud"".

It will be observed that s. 343(1)  does not use the phrase
""a false pretence"". I have reached the conclusion that a prospectus
may be ""false in a material particular"" within the meaning of the
section if it contains a material statement as to the purpose for which the
proceeds from the sale of the securities offered in the prospectus are to be
used and it is found that the person making the statement had never any
intention that the proceeds should be used for that purpose. The test is not,
in my opinion, whether the statement amounted strictly speaking to a
""false pretence"" but rather whether the conduct of the accused in
making it was fraudulent.

I would reject this third ground of appeal.

[Page 521]

As to the fourth ground of appeal which has been set out
above it could not be successfully argued that the use of the words ""to
induce members of the public"" instead of the words of s. 343(1) (c)
""to induce a person"" misled or embarrassed the defence; but counsel
argued that this is of no importance, that the offence created by the section
is statutory and that conduct which does not fall within the words as well as
within the spirit of the section is not an offence at all. The defence contends
that on its true construction s. 343(1) (c) creates an offence only in a
case where the intent of the accused is to induce an ascertained person to
advance something to a company; emphasis is laid on the circumstance that the
words ""whether ascertained or not"" which appear in clauses (a)
and (b) of the subsection are omitted in clause (c). Counsel also
contrasts the wording of clause (c) with that of s. 323(1) of the Code
where the expression is used ""defrauds the public or any person whether
ascertained or not …"".

Section 343(1) (c) is penal and must be strictly
construed in favour of the accused, but in construing it, it is the duty of the
Court to endeavour to give effect to the intention of Parliament as expressed
in the words used. The construction contended for by the defence would render
clause (c) virtually inoperative. The evil sought to be prevented is the
use of a false prospectus to induce persons to advance moneys to a company. The
occasions must be very rare in which a false prospectus is prepared with the
purpose of inducing an ascertained individual to advance moneys. The primary
purpose of a prospectus is to raise moneys from the public. In my opinion on
its true construction s. 343(1) (c) makes it an offence for anyone to
make, circulate or publish a prospectus which he knows is false in a material
particular with the intent to induce any person to advance moneys to the
company on whose behalf the prospectus is issued and the expression ""any
person"" includes all persons of the class to whom the prospectus is
intended to be given although at the time the false prospectus is made the
identity of none of those persons is known. I conclude that count 5 does
disclose an offence against s. 343(1) (c) and that this ground of appeal
should be rejected.

In the result I am of opinion that all the grounds of appeal
which are open to the accused on the appeals to this

[Page 522]

Court must be rejected and that the appeals against the
convictions on both count 3 and count 5 must be dismissed.

In view of the statement of Crown counsel, mentioned above,
that, in the event of the appeals of the accused failing, the Crown did not
wish to press the appeals in regard to count 4 those appeals will be dismissed.

EN APPEL DE LA COUR DU BANC DE LA REINE,
PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC.

Droit criminel—Acceptation d'argent en vue
d'exercer une influence auprès d'un fonctionnaire—Obtention d'un permis de
bière—Employés de la Commission des Liqueurs sont-ils des officiers
publics—Statut de la Commission—Code Criminel , arts. 99(d)(e), 102.

L'intimé a été accusé et trouvé coupable d'avoir
accepté de l'argent en considération d'un exercice d'influence concernant
l'obtention auprès de la Commission des Liqueurs d'un permis pour la vente de
bière, contrairement à l'art. 102(2)  du Code criminel . Devant la Cour
d'Appel, l'intimé a soutenu que la Commission était indépendante du
Gouvernement et par conséquent ne tombait pas sous la définition de
gouvernement de l'art. 102 . La Cour d'Appel a acquitté l'intimé, et la Couronne
appelle devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L'appel de la
Couronne doit être maintenu.

La preuve révèle que l'intimé a véritablement
prétendu avoir de l'influence auprès du gouvernement ou d'un ministre ou d'un
fonctionnaire. En prétendant exercer de l'influence auprès de la Commission des
Liqueurs, l'intimé a violé les dispositions du Code criminel . Il est
vrai que la Commission est une corporation, mais ses activités ne sont qu'un
prolongement des activités gouvernementales. Les employés de la Commission sont
des «officiers publics». Conséquemment, par l'effet combiné des arts. 99 et 102
du Code, toute personne qui prétend exercer de l'influence auprès de ces
employés, moyennant rémunération en considération de l'obtention d'un avantage
ou bénéfice, est coupable d'une offense criminelle.

APPEL de la Couronne d'un jugement de
la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Québec1, acquittant l'intimé.
Appel maintenu.

Jacques Bellemare, pour l'appelante.

Marcel Bourget, pour l'intimé.

Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par

Le Juge
Taschereau:—Le 22 septembre 1961, l'intimé-accusé, Normand
Després, était trouvé coupable par M. le Juge Armand Cloutier, de la Cour des
sessions de la paix,

[Page 441]

pour le district judiciaire de Montréal, sur
l'accusation suivante, à savoir:

NORMAND DESPRÉS, à Ville St-Michel, district
de Montréal, le ou vers le 3 octobre 1960, ayant et prétendant avoir de
l'influence auprès du gouvernement de la province de Québec et des
fonctionnaires dudit gouvernement, d'avoir illégalement accepté pour lui-même
et d'autres personnes une récompense de mille dollars ($1,000.00) en
considération d'une collaboration, d'une aide, d'un exercice d'influence
concernant la conclusion d'affaires avec le gouvernement et un sujet d'affaires
ayant trait audit gouvernement, savoir: l'obtention auprès de la Commission des
Liqueurs de Québec du permis n° 3103-60 pour la vente de bière dans l'épicerie
dudit Antoine Théoret, au n° 2614, Place Bon-Air, Ville St-Michel, district de
Montréal, commettant par là un acte criminel, contrairement à l'article n° 102,
par d, sous-par I, du code criminel.

L'accusé a été condamné par le juge au procès
à un mois de prison. Devant la Cour d'Appel2 il a prétendu, en
premier lieu, que la Commission des Liqueurs de Québec était indépendante du
Gouvernement de la Province, et qu'en conséquence, il ne pouvait être trouvé
coupable en vertu du Code Criminel , art. 102 , para, (d), sous-para.
(1). L'intimé a également demandé à la Cour d'Appel de réduire la sentence qui
a été prononcée contre lui. Les honorables Juges Bissonnette et Taschereau ont
conclu que le jugement de M. le Juge Armand Cloutier était erroné, mais M. le
Juge Owen a enregistré sa dissidence, et ce dernier aurait confirmé le jugement
de culpabilité. Quant à l'appel de la sentence, où cette Cour n'a pas
juridiction, M. le Juge Owen l'aurait rejeté étant d'opinion qu'elle était
raisonnable, mais MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Taschereau n'ont pas cru devoir
se prononcer sur ce point, vu l'opinion qu'ils ont émise sur le jugement de
culpabilité. Ils ont conclu, à cause de l'acquittement, que cet appel devait
être tenu pour non avenu et qu'il devait être rejeté.

La preuve révèle que l'accusé-intimé a reçu
$1,000 d'Antoine Théoret afin de lui obtenir une licence pour la vente de la
bière, de la Régie des Alcools de la Province de Québec. Peu après avoir reçu
les $1,000 l'appelant a fait une confession à la Sûreté provinciale de Québec,
et après avoir été mis en garde, voici ce qu'il a dit:

La sûreté provinciale du Québec—Mise en garde
à une personne détenue comme témoin. Nous devons vous dire que nous sommes des
officiers de police et que vous êtes maintenant détenu comme témoin important
concernant la cause de: perception de $1,000.

[Page 442]

Désirez-vous dire quelque chose en rapport
avec cette cause? Vous êtes entièrement libre, vous n'êtes obligé de rien dire,
à moins que vous désiriez le faire, mais tout ce que vous direz sera pris par
écrit et pourra servir de preuve devant le tribunal.

LE TÉMOIN DIT: Je NORMAND DESPRÉS, 39 ans,
fils de Félix, numéro 7270, rue 7ème avenue, V. St-Michel, déclare
solennellement que: Je suis prêt à vous raconter pourquoi j'ai reçu $1,000
dollars de M. Antoine Théoret et aussi je vais vous dire à qui devait aller cet
argent.

Q. Avez-vous bien
compris la mise en garde?

R. Oui.

Q. Depuis combien
de temps connaissez-vous M. Antoine Théoret?

R. Je le connais
depuis environ 4 ans, car je suis un de ses clients, à sa grocerie à Ville St-Michel,
de plus, j'ai eu l'occasion de le mieux connaître, car un peu après les
élections de l'été 1960, il est venu me voir pour obtenir une licence de bière
pour sa grocerie, je suis allé avec lui rencontrer le secrétaire du député Jean
Meunier, c'est-à-dire M. Raoul Laforte, j'ai recommandé M. Théoret pour avoir
la dite licence. Je dois vous dire qu'auparavant M. Théoret m'avait dit qu'il
me récompenserait, il m'a demandé combien cela lui coûterait et je lui ai dit
que d'habitude, pour avoir une licence de bière, ça coûtait $1,000, il a fait
un signe affirmatif. Par la suite au mois de septembre, j'ai eu des entrevues
avec lui, je lui ai dit que des inspecteurs iraient chez lui pour inspection,
peut-être. Le 28 septembre 1960, M. Théoret m'a informé qu'il avait reçu un
téléphone du département des permis et je lui ai dit d'y aller. Le lendemain
soir, à 6.00 p.m., M. Théoret est venu chez moi à 7270, 7ème avenue, il m'a dit
qu'il n'avait pas d'argent et il m'a dit qu'il viendrait au commencement de la
semaine prochaine pour régler ça. Je lui ai dit que j'avais quelqu'un à rencontrer
en la personne d'un monsieur que je ne lui ai pas nommé.

Q. Voulez-vous nous
dire à qui devait aller l'argent que nous avons saisi chez-vous?

R. Une somme de
$200 devait me revenir et la balance devait aller à un nommé Bélanger dont j'ai
le numéro de téléphone chez moi, celui-ci m'a dit par téléphone que le restant
était pour la caisse du comté.

Je suis d'opinion que l'accusé-intimé, en
prétendant exercer de l'influence auprès de la Commission des Liqueurs ou de
ses fonctionnaires, a violé les dispositions ci-dessus du Code Criminel . Les
fonctionnaires de la Commission des Liqueurs sont nommés pour remplir une
fonction publique. La Commission a été créée par une loi de la Législature. Ses
officiers dirigeants sont nommés par le Gouvernement de la province, et tous
les profits qui sont réalisés par la vente des alcools sont versés dans le
fonds consolidé. Il est vrai que la Commission est une corporation, mais ses
activités ne sont qu'un prolongement des activités gouvernementales. Ce serait
une erreur de penser qu'il existe au point de vue légal une cloison étanche
entre le Gouvernement et la Commission. Cette dernière, évidemment, a plus de
liberté d'action et d'indépendance qu'un autre département gouvernemental. Elle
est une émanation de la Couronne, et toute personne qui y occupe un poste,
tient un emploi dans un département public, au sens de l'article 99  (d)
du Code Criminel .

Le statut de la Commission des Liqueurs de
Québec a été examiné déjà par notre Cour dans la cause de La Commission des
Ligueurs de Québec v. Moore3, alors que Sir Lyman Duff s'est
ainsi exprimé:

That the Commission is an instrumentality of government is
clear from the circumstances that the members of the Commission are appointed
by the Governor in Council and are removable at pleasure (s. 6); that all
property in the possession of or under the control of the Commission is
expressly declared to be the property of the Crown; and that all moneys
received by the Commission at the discretion of the Provincial Treasurer are
remissible to him, and, on receipt by him, become part of the consolidated
funds of the province (s. 18); that the Commission is accountable to the
Treasurer in the manner and at the times indicated by the

[Page 444]

latter (s. 19). The Commission, moreover, exercises
authority respecting the sale of liquor in the province, and infractions of the
law dealing with that subject are prosecuted in the name of the Commission or
of the municipality where the infraction occured. By s. 13, the employees of
the Commission are declared to be public officers, and they are required to
take the oath of public service as such.

De plus, dans Regina v. Gibson4,
la Cour Suprême de la Nouvelle-Écosse, après avoir considéré les
structures, les fins, l'objet et les pouvoirs de la Commission des Liqueurs de
cette province, en est venue à la conclusion suivante:

Applying that test to the present case, it is clear that
the Commission is only a manager for carrying on as an agent or servant of the
Government of the Province what has been made by the Act, the business of the
Government, or, in other words, the Commission is merely an administrative
body appointed by the Government with certain duties and powers entrusted to it
for carrying out the administration of the Act, through the instrumentality of
which the Government exercises government control over transactions in liquor
within the Province.

Je dois donc nécessairement conclure que les
employés de la Commission des Liqueurs sont des «officiers publics», et que par
l'effet combiné des articles 102  et 99  du Code Criminel , toute personne
qui prétend exercer de l'influence auprès d'eux, moyennant rémunération en
considération de l'obtention d'un avantage ou bénéfice, est coupable d'une
offense criminelle.

L'appel de la Couronne doit donc être
maintenu, et le jugement de culpabilité prononcé par le juge au procès doit
être rétabli. Mais comme l'accusé a appelé à la Cour d'Appel de la sentence
prononcée et que, par suite de l'acquittement, la Cour n'a pas cru devoir se
prononcer sur le mérite de ce dernier appel, le dossier est retourné à la Cour
inférieure pour adjudication définitive, si celle-ci le juge à propos.

Appel maintenu.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Arrest—Escaping from lawful
custody—Assistant forest ranger making search of vehicle under Game Act—Whether
a ""peace officer""—Whether escape constitutes escape from lawful
custody—The Game Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 95—The Forest Service Act, R.S.N.B.
1952, c. 93, s. 7, as amended by 1960 (N.B.), c. 34—Criminal Code , ss.
2(30) (c), 29(2) (b), 110 (a), 125 (a), 434 , 437 .

The respondent was charged and convicted of escaping from
custody contrary to s. 125 (a) of the Criminal Code . An ""assistant
forest ranger"" stopped a truck driven by the respondent and stated he was
going to search it. While the ranger returned to his car to get an axe to pry
open a door of the truck, the respondent commenced backing the truck. The
officer followed in his car. When the truck stopped after about half a mile,
the officer got out of his car, pulled out the truck's ignition key and told
the respondent that he was under arrest. The officer had no warrant.

The conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal on the
ground that the Crown had failed to prove that the respondent was lawfully
arrested under the Game Act, and consequently that it could not rely on
the Act to support its contention that the respondent was in lawful custody at
the time of his escape. The contention of the Crown, which appealed to this
Court, was that the assistant forest ranger, being a deputy game warden under
the Game Act, was a peace officer under the Criminal Code .

Held: The appeal of the Crown should be dismissed.

The Game Act gives every game warden, including a
deputy as was ex-officio every assistant forest ranger, the powers of a
constable and therefore of a peace officer within the meaning of the Code. It
is true that these powers are limited to provincial laws and are conferred
solely for the purpose of the Game Act, nevertheless any person who wilfully
obstructs a game warden in the execution of his duties commits the indictable
offence of wilfully obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duties
contrary to s. 110  of the Criminal Code .

However, in 1960, by an amendment to the Forest Service
Act, the words ""assistant forest ranger"" were deleted and
substituted by ""district forest ranger"" or ""extension forest
ranger"". The information described the arresting officer as an assistant
forest ranger, and the Crown's case was closed without any evidence to show
that, in 1961 at the time of the arrest, the officer held any of the positions
upon which the authority of a provincial constable or a game warden was
conferred by the statute then in force. Accordingly, the record failed to
disclose that the officer was a peace officer or that he had any authority to
stop a vehicle for search, or that the respondent in acting as he did committed
any offence for which he could be lawfully

[Page 446]

arrested without a warrant. The respondent was therefore not
proved guilty of escaping from lawful custody.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, setting aside the respondent's conviction.
Appeal dismissed.

L. D. D'Arcy, for the appellant.

Douglas E. Rice, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal, brought with leave of this Court, from a judgment of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside the conviction of
the respondent by the Magistrate for Albert County on the charge that, on the
1st day of December 1961, he did,

being in lawful custody, having been arrested without a
warrant by Assistant Forest Ranger Austin Goggin, escape from such custody
contrary to s. 125 (a) of the Criminal Code .

The Appeal Division found that Austin Goggin was an
""assistant forest ranger"" and that the respondent had escaped from
his custody, so that the only question remaining to be determined was
""whether the evidence established a lawful arrest"". The circumstances
of the arrest are described in the decision appealed from in the following
terms:

The facts are Austin Goggin, accompanied by one Babin,
another Assistant Forest Ranger, while on game patrol during the evening of
December 1, 1961, was driving his car on a highway in the Flint Hill area of
the Parish of Elgin in the County of Albert. At about 8.00 p.m., Goggin and Babin
got out of the car and stopped a half-ton truck approaching them which was
being driven by the defendant who had seated beside him Mrs. Marjorie Robb and
her husband Irvine Robb, the owner of the truck, Mrs. Robb being in the centre.

After stopping the truck, Goggin and Babin told the
occupants they were going to search it. Goggin then went to his car to get an
axe to pry open a plywood door on the truck. While he was doing this, the
defendant commenced backing the truck. Goggin got in his car and followed. The
evidence is that after the truck had backed up on the road about one-half of a
mile it stopped and Goggin placed his car in such a position that the truck
could not pass if it attempted to move forward. He then got out of his car, ran
to the truck, and reaching in from the passenger side, turned off the ignition
switch and pulled out the key. At the same time Goggin said to the occupants
""You're under arrest."" He had no warrant for the arrest of any of
them.

[Page 447]

Under the provisions of s. 19 of The Game Act, R.S.N.B.
1952, c. 95 (as amended), ""every game warden"" may, without warrant,
stop and search any vehicle for evidence of a violation of the provisions of
the Act, and s. 1(u) of the same Act provides that unless the context
otherwise requires ""game warden"" includes an ex officio deputy game
warden under The Forest Service Act.

On the assumption that ""the Forest Service Act sets
forth that every assistant forest ranger is ex officio a deputy game warden
under The Game Act"", Bridges J.A., who rendered the decision of the
Appeal Division, concluded that there was ""no question but that Goggin and
Babin, as ex officio game wardens, had the authority to stop and search the
truck …"", but he went on to hold that ""the Crown failed to prove that
the defendant was lawfully arrested without a warrant under The Game Act and
cannot rely on such Act to support its contention that he was in lawful custody
at the time of his escape"".

It was, however, contended by the Crown that in backing up
the truck after having been told of the proposed search, the respondent was wilfully
obstructing ""a peace officer in the execution of his duty"", contrary
to s. 110 (a) of the Criminal Code , and was therefore committing
an indictable offence and subject to lawful arrest without a warrant by ""any
one"" who found him committing it (s. 437  of the Criminal Code ).

Bridges J.A. found that by backing the truck as he did the
respondent wilfully obstructed Goggin and Babin in the execution of their duty,
but that, although he considered them to be ""game wardens"" under The
Game Act, they were not ""peace officers"" within the meaning of s.
110 (a) of the Criminal Code , and that accordingly no offence had
been committed for which the respondent could have been lawfully arrested
without a warrant.

The application pursuant to which leave to appeal was
granted to this Court is limited to this latter finding as it is based upon the
following grounds:

1. The Court having found that the deputy game warden was wilfully-obstructed
in the execution of his duty was in error in holding that the said deputy game
warden was not a peace officer under s. 2(30) (c) of the Criminal Code .

2. That there is conflict in the judgment of the Supreme
Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, in the above noted case and the

[Page 448]

judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Smith, 1942,
3 D.L.R. 764.

Section 2(30) (c) of the Criminal Code  provides
that:

A peace officer includes a police officer, police constable,
bailiff, constable or other person employed for the preservation and
maintenance of the public peace, or for the service or execution of civil
process.

The general powers and authority of a ""game
warden"" are described in s. 18 of The Game Act, which reads as
follows:

18. Every warden may and shall for the purpose of this Act,
exercise all the powers and authorities of a provincial constable and shall
have the same power to ask and require assistance in the performance and
execution of his duties as a peace officer or constable in the execution of his
duty as such, and every warden shall be ex officio a peace officer within the
meaning of any law for the protection of peace officers.

The decision of the Appeal Division that such a warden is
not a ""peace officer"" as defined by s. 2(30) (c) was expressed
by Bridges J.A. in one part of his decision in the following language:

This section (i.e., s. 18 of the Game Act) does not make a
warden a provincial constable, who comes within the definition of peace officer
under the Code. It only purports to give a warden the powers of such a
constable when enforcing the Game Act. These powers must, in my opinion, be
limited to provincial laws and cannot include the right to arrest for criminal
offences without warrant for, although the Province may appoint constables and
other law enforcement officers it cannot give them the authority to act in
criminal matters, such field of legislation belonging wholly to the Federal
Parliament.

With the greatest respect, it appears to me that this
passage is not altogether clear. In my view, the provisions of s. 18 of The
Game Act not only purport to give but do give to every ""game
warden"" the powers of a ""constable"" and therefore of a
""peace officer"" within the meaning of ss. 2(30) (c) and 110  of
the Criminal Code . I agree that these powers are limited to provincial
laws and are conferred solely for the purpose of The Game Act but this
does not alter the fact that any person who wilfully obstructs a ""game
warden"" in the execution of his duties under that Act is committing the
indictable offence of wilfully obstructing a ""peace officer in the
execution of his duties"", contrary to s. 110  of the Criminal Code .

As has been observed, it is provided by s. 434  of the Criminal
Code  that ""any one may arrest without warrant a

[Page 449]

person whom he finds committing an indictable offence""
(the italics are mine), and it is accordingly apparent that the right to arrest
without a warrant under these circumstances is not conferred by any provincial
law or accorded to a ""game warden"" by virtue of The Game Act but
is a right which stems directly from the Criminal Code  and is, by that
statute, conferred on every citizen.

The situation appears to me to be that although the sphere
of a game warden's authority is limited to the enforcement of a provincial
statute, he is, nevertheless, for that purpose and by that statute, clothed
with all the rights, powers and protections afforded to a peace officer by the Criminal
Code . With all respect, this does not in my view mean that the province is
giving to one of its law enforcement officers ""the authority to act in
criminal matters"" and I cannot see that this legislation gives rise to any
problem or conflict between the provincial and federal fields.

This appears to me to dispose of the question on which the
application for leave to appeal is based but it does not determine the matter.

The case for the Crown, and much of the decision of the
Court of Appeal, is predicated upon the assumption, stated by Bridges J.A.,
that:

The Forest Service Act sets forth that every assistant
forest ranger is ex officio a deputy game warden under The Game Act, and s.
1(u) of the latter states that in it, unless the context otherwise requires,
""warden"" or ""game warden"" includes an ex officio game
warden under The Forest Service Act.

This was a true statement of the law until The Forest
Service Act was amended by c. 34 of the Laws of New Brunswick 1960.

As enacted by R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 93, s. 7 of The Forest
Service Act provided that:

Every district forester, assistant forester, forest ranger
and assistant forest ranger, has hereby conferred on him all the power and
authority of a provincial constable and of a seizing officer under the Crown
Lands Act, and he is also ex officio a deputy game warden under The Game Act
and a fishery guardian under The Fisheries Act.

The 1960 amendment to The Forest Service Act provided
for the employment of temporary officers and servants for the purpose of this
Act, and it also amended s. 7 as follows:

Section 7 of the said Act is amended by striking out the
words ""assistant forester, forest ranger and assistant forest ranger""
in the first

[Page 450]

two lines thereof and substituting therefor the words
""district forester, assistant district forester, inspector, district
forester ranger, extension forest ranger and forest ranger"".

Austin Goggin, who was the informant in this case, is
described in the Information as an ""assistant forest ranger"", he
testified that he was ""an assistant forest ranger"", and the Court of
Appeal made an express finding that he was ""an assistant forest ranger"".

It is conceivable that the 1960 amendment merely evidenced a
change in the title of ""assistant forest ranger"" to that of
""district forest ranger"" or ""extension forest ranger"" but
the Crown's case was closed without any evidence being adduced to show that on
December 1, 1961, the informant held any of the positions upon which the
authority of a provincial constable or a game warden is conferred by the
statute then in force, and the time for explanations is now long past.

Accordingly, the record before us fails to disclose that
Austin Goggin was a ""peace officer"" or that he had any authority to
stop a vehicle for search, or that the respondent in acting as he did was
committing any offence for which he could be lawfully arrested without a
warrant.

It is true that it has been held on more than one occasion
that evidence of a person acting in an official capacity may, under certain
circumstances, raise a rebuttable presumption of his due appointment to that
office, but this is not a rule of universal application and certainly cannot
apply so as to clothe Austin Goggin with the authority of a ""warden""
under The Game Act, since he has testified to the fact that he holds an
appointment which does not carry that authority with it.

In view of the above, I do not find it necessary to consider
the contention that the arrest was unlawful because the respondent was not
given notice ""of the reason for the arrest"", as required by s. 29(2) (b)
of the Criminal Code .

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Special
pleas—Conspiracy—Interference with administration of justice—Six count
indictment—Whether acquittal on conspiracy charge a bar to prosecution on
second conspiracy charge—Autrefois acquit—Res judicata—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 101(b), 518.

The three appellants, W, M and F, were
indicted on six counts. Count 1 related to a conspiracy to commit an indictable
offence by giving money to a peace officer with intent that the said officer
should interfere with the administration of justice. This count was tried
separately. All three were acquitted and the Crown’s appeal was abandoned.

Count 2 related to a conspiracy to effect the
unlawful purpose of obtaining from the same peace officer information which it
was his duty not to divulge. Counts 3, 4 and 5 related only to W and charged
him with paying money to the peace officer with intent that the latter should
interfere with the administration of justice. Count 6 related to the keeping of
a common gaming house by F and M, to which they pleaded guilty at a later
trial.

At the second trial, the conspiracy under
count 2 was tried as well as the substantive offences against W under counts 3,
4 and 5. The special plea of autrefois acquit and the defence of res judicata
were raised not only against count 2 but also by W against the substantive
offences. On the conspiracy charge, the trial judge held against the appellants
on the plea of autrefois acquit, also that the defence of res judicata did not
arise and declined to submit it to the jury. The jury convicted. However, on
the three counts against W, the judge gave effect to the defence of res
judicata and directed the jury to acquit. The appellants appealed against the
conspiracy conviction and the Crown appealed against W’s acquittal. The Court
of Appeal affirmed the conviction on count 2 and ordered a new trial for W on
counts 3, 4 and 5. The appellants were granted leave to appeal to this Court on
count 2 and W appealed as of right from the order setting aside his acquittal.

Held (Cartwright
and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal against the conviction on count 2 should
be dismissed as well as the appeal of W against a new trial on counts 3, 4 and
5.

Per Taschereau,
Fauteux and Judson JJ.: The Court of appeal was right in rejecting the plea of
autrefois acquit and in finding that the trial judge was correct in his ruling
under s. 518  of the Criminal Code . The conspiracies charged in count 1
and in count 2 were not substantially identical. Count 1 involved not only the
payment of money but required proof of the intent that the officer should
interfere with the

[Page 540]

administration of justice. On the other hand,
count 2 did not involve as an element the payment of money with the intent
mentioned in s. 101(a) but charged the appellants with having conspired
for an object which did not necessarily involve an intent that the officer
should interfere with the administration of justice.

The trial judge was right in ruling that
there was nothing to submit to the jury on the defence of res judicata in
respect of count 2. An acquittal on a charge of conspiracy does not pronounce
against every part of it. There was no issue on which it could be said that the
Crown was estopped in the second trial. The two counts charged two conspiracies
with different component elements, and it was impossible to say that the
substantial basic facts common to both counts had been determined in favour of
the appellants in the first trial.

As to counts 3, 4 and 5 relating to W, the
Court of Appeal was right in ordering a new trial. The verdict at the first
trial acquitted W of nothing more than his participation in the conspiracy
charged on count 1 and did not of necessity involve a finding that he did not
commit the substantive offence against s. 101(b) charged in those
counts.

Per Cartwright
and Hall JJ., dissenting: The plea of autrefois acquit was not available
to the appellants at the trial on count 2. On their trial on count 1 the
appellants could not have been convicted on count 2.

It is for the judge to decide as a matter of
law whether the defence of res judicata has been made out, and, therefore, the
trial judge was right in refusing to admit as an exhibit to go to the jury the
complete record of the first trial.

The trial judge should have held that the
defence of res judicata had been established at the trial on count 2. The Crown
was now estopped from questioning that which was (in fact and law) the ratio of
and fundamental to the decision in the first trial. Although the two counts
differed in language and in their essential elements, in reality they dealt
with the same offence. There was only one conspiracy—if there was a conspiracy.
The conspirators were not interested in just getting information or in just
having the officer give information unlawfully, they wanted the information so
as to be forewarned of the impending raids on their gambling clubs. Everything
that could be considered unlawful under count 2 was part and parcel of the
agreement under count 1. Only one agreement was in evidence and it could not be
severed arbitrarily at some point by the Crown so as to create the illusion of
two offences from what was in fact only one.

The Crown was not estopped by W’s acquittal
under count 1 from proceeding to try him for the substantive offences under
counts 3, 4 and 5. McDonald v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 186,
referred to. However, his acquittal under count 1 negatived the essentially
criminal element of these substantive offences—the intent that the officer
should interfere with the administration of justice. It would not now be open
to the jury to find that the money which W admitted having given was given with
that intent. W’s acquittal should be restored.

APPEALS by the three appellants from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1],
affirming their conviction

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson
JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The three appellants were tried
before Spence J. and a jury and acquitted in May 1961 on the first count in an
indictment, which was:

1. ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT
and VINCENT B. FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and
the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario, did unlawfully agree
and conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101 (b)
of the Criminal Code  of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott, a
Peace Officer of the Ontario Provincial Police, with intent that the said
George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to
the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(1) (d).

The Crown abandoned an appeal against the acquittal
and in March 1962, the three appellants were tried before Donnelly J. and a
jury on the second count in the indictment, which was:

2. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT
J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY, between
the first day of January, 1960, and the first day of July, 1960, in the
Province of Ontario, did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an
unlawful purpose, to wit, to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the
Ontario Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge,
contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(2).

The judge held against the accused on a special
plea of autrefois acquit and they then entered a plea of “Not Guilty”
and offered the alternative defence of res judicata. The judge held that
this defence did not arise and declined to submit it to the jury. The jury
convicted and the conviction was sustained by a unanimous judgment in the Court
of Appeal[2].

[Page 542]

I adopt in their entirety the reasons of the
Court of Appeal in rejecting the defence of autrefois acquit, and their
finding that the learned trial judge was correct in his ruling under s. 518  of
the Criminal Code . The matter is summarized by Schroeder J.A. in the
following paragraph:

The conspiracy alleged in count 1 involved
not only the payment of money to Constable Scott, but an essential ingredient
of the offence was the intent of the alleged conspirators that George Scott
should interfere with the administration of justice. Count 2, on the other
hand, accuses the appellants of having entered into an entirely different kind
of conspiracy. It does not involve as an element the payment of money corruptly
to Scott or to any other person with the intent mentioned in s. 101  (a) (iv)
but its object or purpose was stated simply to be the obtainment from Constable
Scott of information which it was his duty not to divulge. It was established
at the trial that the provisions of the Police Act, now R.S.O. 1960, c. 298 and
the Regulations passed pursuant thereto prohibited a police officer from
disclosing such information to anyone, but the procurement of that breach of
duty did not necessarily involve an intent on the part of the procurers that
the police officer should interfere with the administration of justice. Count 2
simply charges the commission of the common law offence of “conspiracy to
effect an unlawful purpose.” The intent with which the parties are alleged to
have entered into the conspiracy charged in count 1, namely, that he (Scott)
should interfere with the administration of justice, is not an ingredient of
the offence charged in count 2, and its absence is a significant point of
distinction between the two offences. They are not substantially indentical or
practically the same, and on that ground alone the defence based on the special
plea of autrefois acquit cannot prevail.

On the defence of res judicata the trial
judge treated the case as one in which there was no evidence to go to the jury
that the first trial had determined in favour of the accused an issue or issues
which would determine the second trial in their favour. But the defence says
that the facts proved at both trials were the same or substantially the same,
the conspirators were the same, the payments of money were the same and the
person to whom the payments were made was the same person in each count. The
defence argues from this that all the issues in count 2 have been litigated in
favour of the accused by their acquittal on count 1, and that the case should
have been submitted to the jury on this basis with an appropriate direction
from the trial judge. The argument is supported by reference to the defence put
forward at the first trial where everything was admitted in the presentation to
the jury except the corrupt intent.

The weakness in this submission is in trying to
read too much into the verdict of not guilty on count 1 where the

two counts charge conspiracy. At the first
trial, the jury found that the proven facts did not amount to the conspiracy
charged. At the second trial, the jury found that the same or substantially
identical facts did amount to the, conspiracy charged in count 2. An acquittal
on a charge of conspiracy does not pronounce against every part of it. On what
issue is there an estoppel against the Crown? Is it on the agreement or the
corruptly giving or the intent in count 1? All that a judge or a jury, if it
becomes fit matter for submission to a jury at the second trial, can determine
is that the evidence fell short of warranting a conviction on the precise
charge. There is no issue on which it can be said that the Crown is estopped in
the second trial. This distinguishes the defence of res judicata in this
case from the comparatively simple examples of its application in cases where
there is an estoppel on issues such as identity of the accused (The King v.
Quinn[3]);
possession (Sambasivam v. The Public Prosecutor[4]), responsibility for the death of two
persons as a result of the same catastrophe, where an acquittal on a charge of
manslaughter of A must result in an acquittal on the same charge for the death
of B, the whole matter having been litigated, adversely to the prosecution in
the first trial (R. v. Sweetman[5]; Gill
v. The Queen[6]).

These simplicities do not arise when the two
counts charge two conspiracies with different component elements. It is
impossible in the present case to say that the substantial basic facts common
to both counts have been determined in favour of the accused in the first
trial. The trial judge was right in his ruling that there was nothing to submit
to the jury on this defence and I agree with the reasons of the Court of Appeal
in affirming his ruling.

Counts 3, 4 and 5 in the indictment relate only
to the appellant Wright. Count 3 reads:

3. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J. WRIGHT
at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on or about
the 29th day of February, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George Scott, a
peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $400.00 in money with
intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of
justice contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 101(b).

[Page 544]

Counts 4 and 5 are in the same terms but refer
to payments on subsequent dates.

On these counts, at the second trial, the
learned trial judge did give effect to the defence of res judicata and
directed an acquittal. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal against this
acquittal and it was there held that there was error in law in giving this
direction. The Court of Appeal set aside the order of acquittal on these counts
and directed that there should be a new trial. I would affirm the order of the
Court of Appeal on this aspect of the appeal for the reasons given by them,
namely, that the verdict at the first trial acquitted Wright of nothing more
than his participation in the conspiracy charged in count 1 and did not of
necessity involve a finding that he did not commit the substantive offence
against s. 101(b) charged in counts 3, 4 and 5.

The result is that the appeal of the three
appellants against their conviction on count 2 is dismissed and the appeal of
the appellant Wright against the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new
trial on counts 3, 4 and 5 is also dismissed.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—I agree with
the reasons and conclusions of my brother Hall and wish to add only a few
words.

In my respectful view the Court of Appeal[7] erred in considering and comparing the
wording of the several counts in the indictment without making a sufficiently
careful examination of the evidence adduced and the directions given by the
presiding judge at each of the trials. The extracts from the transcripts of the
proceedings in the two trials set out in the reasons of my brother Hall appear
to me to make plain, what becomes, if possible, even more plain on an
examination of the complete records, that in the trial on count 2 the jury were
invited to pass upon the very same issue of fact as had already been decided in
favour of the appellants by the jury at the trial of count 1.

The following words of Douglas J. delivering the
unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of the United
 States in Sealfon v. U.S.[8] appear to me to be in accordance with

[Page 545]

our law and applicable to the circumstances of
the case at bar:

It has long been recognized that the
commission of the substantive offence and a conspiracy to commit it are
separate and distinct offences, thus with some exceptions, one may be
prosecuted for both crimes. But res judicata may be a defence in a
second prosecution. That doctrine applies to criminal as well as civil
proceedings and operates to conclude those matters in issue which the verdict
determined though the offences be different.

Thus the only question in the case is
whether the jury’s verdict in the conspiracy trial was a determination
favorable to petitioner of the facts essential to conviction of the substantive
offence. This depends upon the facts adduced at each trial and the instructions
under which the jury arrived at its verdict at the first trial.

Respondent argues that the basis of the
jury’s verdict cannot be known with certainty.

* * *

The instructions under which the verdict
was rendered, however, must be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye
to all the circumstances of the proceedings. We look to them only for such
light as they shed on the issues determined by the verdict.

* * *

So interpreted the earlier verdict
precludes a later conviction of the substantive offence. The basic facts in
each trial were identical.

* * *

It was a second attempt to prove the
agreement which at each trial was crucial to the prosecution’s case and which
was necessarily adjudicated in the former trial to be non‑existent. That
the prosecution may not do.

With the greatest respect for those who hold a
contrary view, after an anxious perusal of the records in the two trials I see
no escape from the conclusion that the trial before Donnelly J. was a second
attempt by the Crown to prove the agreement which was necessarily adjudicated
in the trial before Spence J. to be non-existent. I am in complete agreement
with the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United
 States from which I have quoted above that this the
prosecution may not do.

In The Queen v. King[9], Hawkins J., with the concurrence of Cave,
Grantham, Lawrance and Wright JJ., stated, not as a new rule but as one which
was long established, that “it is against the very first principles of the
criminal law that a man should be placed twice in jeopardy upon the same
facts”. I am unable to see how the judgment appealed from can be upheld without
a violation of those first principles.

[Page 546]

I would dispose of the appeals as proposed by my
brother Hall.

HALL J. (dissenting):—On May 29, 1961,
the appellants came before Spence J. and a jury on an indictment as follows:

1. ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT
and VINCENT B. FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and
the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree
and conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101 (b)
of the Criminal Code  of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott a
peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said
George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to
the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(1) (d).

2. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J.
WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY between the
first day of January, 1960 and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of
Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful
purpose, to wit: to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario
Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary
to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(2).

3. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J.
WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on
or about the 29th day of February, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George
Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $400.00 in money
with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration
of justice contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 101(b).

4. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J.
WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on
or about the 29th day of March, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George
Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $200.00 in money
with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration
of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 101(b).

5. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J.
WRIGHT at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York on
or about the 27th day of April, 1960, did give corruptly to Constable George
Scott a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, $400.00 in money
with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration
of justice, contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 101 (b).

6. AND FURTHER THAT the said JOSEPH P.
McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY at the Township of Toronto in
the County of Peel during the month of May, 1960, and previously, did
unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common gaming house at the
premises situate and known as 2165 Centre Road South in the Township of Toronto
in the County of Peel, contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada,
Section 176(1).

The Crown elected to proceed with the trial of
count 1 only.

[Page 547]

After a trial which lasted nine days, the jury
found the appellants not guilty. An appeal from that verdict was taken by the
Crown but later abandoned, so the acquittal on count 1 stands.

Then on March 12, 1962, the appellants came before
Donnelly J. and a jury to be tried on counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

When called upon to plead to count 2, Wright, by
his counsel, Mr. O’Driscoll, entered a special plea pursuant to s. 516 of
the Code as follows:

I have a special plea for the accused
Wright. Having heard the said indictment read here in Court, the said Robert J.
Wright saith that our said Lady the Queen ought not further to prosecute the
said Indictment against him, the said Robert J. Wright, because he saith that,
heretofore, to wit, on the 9th day of June, 1961, in the Supreme Court of
Ontario, in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, before the
Honourable Mr. Justice Spence and a Jury, he, the said Robert J. Wright,
was lawfully acquitted of the said offence charged in the said Indictment.

Wherefore he, the said Robert J. Wright,
prays Judgment and that he may be discharged from the said premises in the said
Indictment specified.

being a plea of autrefois acquit.

McDermott by his counsel Mr. Brooke entered
the same special plea.

Feeley followed the same course by his counsel
Mr. Sedgwick.

Mr. Milligan for the Crown replied as
follows:

In reply thereto and hereupon I, R.P.
Milligan, Crown Counsel who prosecutes for our said Lady the Queen in this
behalf, says that by reason of anything in the said plea of the said all three
accused above pleaded in bar alleged, our said The Lady, The Queen, ought not
to be precluded from prosecuting the said indictment against the said three
accused; because she says that the said three accused were not lawfully
acquitted of the said offence charged in the said indictment, in manner and
form as the said three accused hath above in their said plea alleged; and this
he, the said R.P. Milligan prays may be inquired of by the country.

The issues of these special plea of autrefois
acquit were fully argued by counsel for the accused and counsel for the Crown.
Intertwined in the autrefois acquit argument were submissions that the plea of res
judicata was also available and that it was being put forward on behalf of
the three appellants.

Donnelly J. gave judgment on the special plea as
follows:

The three accused rely on a special plea of
autrefois acquit. Section 517 of the Code requires that I decide this
issue. The three accused were before

[Page 548]

this Court in May and June, 1961, on the
first count in the indictment at which time the jury acquitted all three on the
charge on which they were then before the Court.

It is now agreed that there will be no new
evidence offered if the trial proceeds on the second count. If there was any
change in the evidence it will simply be that the Crown will not offer all the
evidence which was adduced before. Section 518 of the Code provides that
where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit to a count is tried and it appears
that the matter on which the accused was given in charge of the former trial is
the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in
charge, and that on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been made
that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of all the
offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of
autrefois acquit is pleaded judgment shall be given discharging the accused in
respect of that count.

In considering the matter. I must keep in
mind the statement of Crown counsel that no new evidence will be offered on the
second count. The test is not the similarity of the evidence or the facts in
the particular case. The question is whether the charges are identical, or
substantially identical. It then remains to consider whether the charges under
Count 1 and Count 2 are substantially identical. By Count 1 the accused were
charged that they conspired together to commit an indictable offence under
Section 101 (b) of the Criminal Code  of Canada by corruptly giving
money to George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force,
with intent that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration
of justice, contrary to Section 408(1)  (d). The second count
charges that the accused did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect
an unlawful purpose, to wit, to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the
Ontario Provincial Police Force, information which it was his duty not to
divulge contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(2).

On behalf of the accused it is urged that
the jury having rendered a verdict of not guilty they found that the accused
did not conspire together. People, when conspiring, may conspire to do one or
more unlawful acts. It does not follow that because the jury found the accused
not guilty on a charge of conspiring to do a specific unlawful act that the
jury found the accused did not conspire to do any unlawful act.

On the first trial the jury was instructed
that the essential elements of the offence were, firstly, the agreement to give
money to Scott corruptly; secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with
the administration of justice. It is clear that these are the elements of the
offence charged in the first count. In order to establish the offence charged
in the second count it is not necessary for the Crown to prove any agreement to
give or pay money to Scott corruptly. Section 101  makes it an essential
part of the offence that the person committing the offence intend that the
party offered or receiving the money interfere with the administration of justice.
No such intent is required under Section 482. It was argued by counsel for
Feeley that Count 1 could have been drawn in such a way that it would have
included the second count. If this had been done it is my opinion that the
count would be bad for duplicity. I find that the offence charged in the second
count is not an offence included in the first count and that it would not have
been possible on the former trial, no matter what amendment had been made, to
have convicted the accused of the offence charged in the second count.

It is well established that a person must
not be placed in peril of being convicted twice for the same offence. Here the
offences are not the

[Page 549]

same or substantially the same. The result
is that the accused are not being asked to stand trial a second time for the
same offence notwithstanding that the evidence will be the same as on the
former trial.

The accused have failed to establish that
the offence charged in the second count is substantially the same as that
charged in the first count, or one on which they could have been convicted at.
the first trial and the plea of autrefois acquit fails.

Will you have the prisoners plead, please.

And as to res judicata the record is as
follows:

HIS LORDSHIP: Before leaving the matter I
should deal with the question of res judicata. I am of the opinion that this is
a defence included in a plea of not guilty and should not be dealt with by me
at this time.

Mr. SEDGWICK: SO long as that is
clear, that in pleading not guilty res judicata is pleaded as being an included
plea.

HIS LORDSHIP: That is my view.

Mr. SEDGWICK: It is not provided for
as an included plea. I intend to stress that as part of the defence.

HIS LORDSHIP: As far as I am concerned you
are free to raise it as part of your plea of not guilty.

Following this counsel for the appellants
applied to have count 2 tried separately from counts 3, 4, 5 and 6. Donnelly J.
directed the Crown to proceed with count 2 only and the trial proceeded on that
basis after pleas of Not Guilty had been directed to be entered by
Donnelly J. following similar statements by all three appellants that “I
enter no plea at this time.”

Following the selection of a jury the record of
the trial before Spence J. was tendered. Donnelly J. dealt with the matter as
follows:

HIS LORDSHIP: I am not going to permit the
filing of the evidence. If you wish to file it with the Court I am content that
it be filed, but I do not propose to permit these books of evidence or any
documents which you have asked to file—I do not propose to permit them to go to
the jury. If you wish to file them with the Court for the use of counsel I am
content that they be filed for that purpose, but for that purpose only.

But the record was not then filed.

Mr. Milligan opened for the Crown. In view of
the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants, it is desirable to quote
rather fully from Mr. Milligan’s opening statement. He said in part:

Mr. MILLIGAN: Gentlemen of the jury,
simply put the offence is this, that the three accused agreed and conspired
together to obtain information from a police officer which that constable was
not at liberty to give them.

Now, gentlemen, the Crown alleges that the
accused McDermott and Feeley were gamblers, that they are interested in two
clubs—chartered

[Page 550]

clubs where gambling was allowed, that is
legal gambling, and the Crown alleges it was suspected at times there was
illegal gambling going on in the club. Now, you will appreciate, gentlemen,
that the police would want to check these clubs to see if any illegal gambling
was going on in these clubs, and to check these clubs there is only one way to
do it, and that is not to tell the people they were coming to inspect them
because they would certainly not find anything then, but to raid quickly and
without notice, to swoop down on the club, walk in and then see if there is any
illegal gambling, and if the police did find that there was illegal gambling,
of course the club would be charged and probably put out of business. The
Crown alleges that naturally McDermott and Feeley would be very interested to
know when these clubs would be raided and on what dates so that they would be
ready.

How would they get that information? I
submit to you that the only way they can get the information is to get it from
some person in authority who knew the raid was going to take place—was going to
be conducted. The Crown alleges that for some time the accused Wright in the
year 1953/1954 was in what is known as an anti-gambling squad of the Ontario
Provincial Police. The anti-gaming squad is a branch of the Ontario Provincial
Police which deals almost entirely with the suppression of illegal gambling.
Wright was on that squad, and you can draw your inferences from the evidence of
what connection Wright had with the accused McDermott and Feeley.

In any event, in the early part of 1960, in
January 1960, the accused Wright was transferred out of the anti-gambling squad
to duty in the Town of Belleville. The Crown alleges now that the accused McDermott and Feeley had
lost their contact. Wright was now out of the anti-gaming squad, he would not
be able to tell them when and at what time the raids would be conducted.
Another source of information had to be obtained. The Crown alleges that then
the three accused conspired together to obtain that information from a member
of the anti-gaming squad, namely Constable Scott.

Scott was approached, and how he was
approached will be tendered in evidence, and how information was obtained from
him will be tendered in evidence, but the Crown alleges that they did conspire
to obtain information from Scott, a member of the anti‑gaming squad, that
they did obtain information from Constable Scott, and that Constable Scott—and
I should say the information they obtained from Constable Scott is unlawful for
Constable Scott to give, or for any police officer, of the anti-gaming squad to
give.

Now unfortunately for the three accused
Scott was approached and without letting the accused know he reported to his
superior officers. The superior officer when Scott was first approached by the
accused Wright, who was at that time, as I told you, still a member of the
Ontario Provincial Police, stationed at Belleville—but Wright did not say whom
he was working for, so the superior officers naturally wanted Scott to play
along with Wright because they wanted to find out who Wright was working for.
In other words, may I put it this way, they were not so much interested, or
they were interested in seeing that Wright was arrested and booked, but they
were certainly interested in who Wright was working for, and so Scott was
instructed to play along and he did play along, and eventually contact was
made, particularly with the accused McDermott, eventually directly by Scott to
McDermott, and you will hear evidence of McDermott’s dealings with Scott to
obtain information as to when and what times the raid would be made on these
clubs. You will hear evidence

[Page 551]

of the implication of the accused Feeley
with the accused McDermott in these clubs, that they were partners and had
other dealings together and they were associated together, and the Crown is
alleging that on that evidence, which will be submitted to you, there is only
one inference you gentlemen can draw—that they were all associated together and
that for a common purpose and for a common interest they conspired to obtain
information from Constable Scott of the anti-gaming squad, and that for the
unlawful purpose as set out in the indictment. (The italics are mine.)

The evidence for the Crown was led and received
and was similar to the evidence that had been given in the trial before Spence
J. except that some of the evidence at the first trial was omitted at the
second trial.

The next matter of importance to note is what
transpired at the conclusion of the Crown’s case. Mr. Hartt on behalf of
Wright renewed the application to file as an exhibit the record of the trial
before Spence J. The discussion between Donnelly J. and Mr. Hartt is as
follows:

Mr. HARTT: I understand at the
beginning of this trial an application was made by Mr. Sedgwick, then
counsel for Mr. Feeley, that the copy of the transcript of the evidence of
the former trial of these three accused persons should be entered as an exhibit
in this case. I understand that at that time you made a ruling that you would
not allow it in at that stage as an exhibit, but you would allow it to be filed
with the Court.

I subsequently was informed that the copy
that had been furnished to you was a copy that had been marked by some other
person and I received a copy to-day that was not in that condition from the
Court of Appeal and I would ask your lordship to allow me to file that copy
with the Court.

HIS LORDSHIP: As an exhibit?

Mr. HARTT: My application is as an
exhibit.

HIS LORDSHIP: What have you to say as to
whether it should be filed as an exhibit or not? I am giving you this
opportunity of arguing this. It was argued on behalf of the other accused
earlier. In view of the fact you were not present I consider you should have an
opportunity of making a presentation at this time.

Mr. HARTT: I will be brief.

My submission is that the defence which
arises from a plea of not guilty and res judicata is one which I will submit is
open to us in this case. With regard to that defence it is my understanding
that it is a question, first of all, for your lordship whether or not the
evidence in this trial—whether or not the issue in this trial is identical to
the issue previously and is judicially determined.

HIS LORDSHIP: No, that is the plea of
autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, but not the basis of res judicata. You
may have different issues but some essential fact which is common to the two
issues on which a decision has been given; it is certainly not the basis of res
judicata.

Mr. HARTT: I think res judicata is a
wider matter than autrefois acquit.

[Page 552]

HIS LORDSHIP: In my view it covers the
situation entirely. There is some relation but it is a different principle.

Mr. HARTT: If I may put it this way—it
is a factual issue which was directly placed before a competent tribunal and it
was determined and it is not open to one of the parties to the original inquiry
to raise it again. It is my submission to your lordship by reference to the
charge in the first trial, to the manner of procedure adopted in relation to
that charge, and the issue that eventually went to the jury, the factual issue
that went to the jury, realistically went to the jury, that is the same issue
that this jury is being asked to determine. If I am right in that, it is my
submission that the issue is originally for your lordship, and then if you do
not think the jury should be directed in relation to it then it becomes an
issue for the jury. On that basis it is my submission that this transcript
should be marked as an exhibit in the trial because I see no other way how the
jury can ascertain what the real issue was at the first trial, the real factual
issue.

My application is an alternative one, that
it be marked as an exhibit in the trial for all purposes, and if your lordship
does not accede to that request that it be marked as an exhibit before the
Court in order to allow me to argue the question of defence before your
lordship.

HIS LORDSHIP: Mr. Hartt, I am of the
same opinion I was earlier, that the transcript should not be filed as an
exhibit. It should not be available to the jury in the jury room. In my
opinion that applies even though the evidence in the two trials is exactly the
same. It is quite apparent that in this trial there was not as much
evidence called as there was in the other trial. Witnesses were called in the
other trial who did not testify in this trial. If that evidence was filed as an
exhibit the jury would have the evidence of those witnesses before them. In my
opinion that would be most improper. If the transcript of the proceedings in
the earlier trial went to the jury in their jury room, it is most likely that
the jury would dispose of the matter, not on the evidence which they heard at
this trial and on which they are sworn to examine the matter, but on the
written transcript which they would have before them. Being human beings and
having the written transcript of a previous trial, if their memory is at all
vague as to what a witness said at this trial, they would consider the evidence
which was given at a previous trial.

These accused must be tried on the evidence
tendered during this trial and not on the evidence during the previous trial. I
must refuse your application to have the transcript filed as an exhibit. I told
counsel at the opening of the trial, when this matter was argued, I was quite
content to have the transcript filed with the Court for use of counsel and the
Court but that it would not go to the jury room and I am still content to have
that done if you desire it.

Mr. HARTT: I have given to
Mr. Bradley a fresh copy of the evidence, if your lordship would refer to
that in the course of my argument.

My first submission to your lordship is
that on the authorities, and on the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of
Canada it is clear that res judicata is a defence.

HIS LORDSHIP: I made that clear at the
opening. I consider res judicata was a defence included in a plea of not
guilty, and a defence open to the accused in this case—open to them to argue in
this case.

[Page 553]

Mr. Hartt thereupon applied to have
Donnelly J. hold that the defence of res judicata had been made out and
that the jury be directed to return a verdict of not guilty.

Donnelly J., in the course of the argument, at
p. 1102 of the record, said:

HIS LORDSHIP: I think in view of the
addresses and the charge I must come to the conclusion that the jury in the
first trial either found that there was not the intent to interfere with the
administration of justice or were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of
that ingredient.

Mr. MILLIGAN: Then do I understand
your lordship to say that the intent to pervert the course of justice is res
judicata?

HIS LORDSHIP: I would, on the evidence, on
the charges and on the addresses, I can come to no other conclusion but that
the elements as pointed out by the learned trial Judge, that there must be an
agreement to pay Scott money and an intent to interfere with the administration
of justice—what other finding would you suggest is warranted by the addresses
and the finding of the jury?

and he gave judgment on this application at p.
1111:

HIS LORDSHIP: The accused rely on the maxim
of res judicata and point out that these three accused were earlier acquitted
of an offence that—

between the first day of January, 1960, and
the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario they did unlawfully
conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101 (b) of
the Criminal Code  of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott a peace
officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said George
Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to the
Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(1)(d).

It would appear that the evidence which was
tendered by the Crown on the present charge was tendered together with other
evidence on the earlier charge.

In his charge to the jury on the trial of
the first count in the indictment, the learned trial judge pointed out to the
jury that the essential elements of the offence with which the accused were
charged were, firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly,
secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of
justice. In his address to the jury, counsel for the accused Wright admitted
that Wright had given to Scott sums of money totalling one thousand dollars,
and based his defence solely on the contention that Wright did not have the
intention to interfere with the administration of justice. Counsel for
McDermott spoke to the jury of the necessity of the intent to interfere with
the administration of justice and suggested that McDermott was caught between
the two officers who were spying on each other. Counsel for the accused Feeley
submitted to the jury that Wright did not have the intent to interfere with the
administration of justice, and said that if Wright did not have that corrupt
intent, which was an essential element of the charge against all three men,
then that was the end of the case against Wright and the end of the case
against McDermott and Feeley.

When charging the jury the learned trial
judge discussed the payment of money to Scott by Wright, and pointed out that
it was admitted by

[Page 554]

counsel for Wright that he did pay money to
Scott and in return passed on information to at least McDermott. In dealing
with the question of intention he pointed out to the jury that it was important
that they consider whether Wright did this corruptly in order to interfere with
the administration of justice, because that was the whole gravamen of the
charge.

In order for the defence to succeed on a
plea of res judicata there must have been in the earlier proceeding a finding
adverse to the Crown on some point which it is essential for the Crown to prove
on the second charge. Counsel for the accused contend, while the intention to
interfere with the administration of justice was an essential element in the
first count, it was also an essential element on the second count on which the
accused are presently before the Court, and that the finding of the jury
acquitting the accused on the charge under the first count establishes a lack
of intent on the part of Wright to interfere with the administration of
justice. My reading of the addresses and the charge together with the verdict
of the jury satisfies me that the finding of the jury turned on the essential element
of intention to interfere with the administration of justice. Counsel for the
accused contend the acquittal negatives such intent. If the verdict of the jury
turned on this vital element, it cannot be said that the jury found that there
was no such intent. It may very well have been that the verdict was the result
of a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown had proven such intent. While an
intent to interfere with the administration of justice is an essential element
in the first count of the indictment, in my opinion it is not an essential
element in the second count and the Crown need not prove such intention. I must
therefore hold that there is no finding which can be taken from the verdict of
the jury which deals with any of the essential elements of the second charge.
In my opinion a finding of not guilty which would appear to have been based on
the failure to prove this essential element in the first charge is not
sufficient ground for allowing the motion of the defence on the plea of res
judicata, as this element is not essential in this second charge. I must find
that the defence has failed to establish res judicata.

Mr. Hartt then submitted to Donnelly J.
that he should charge the jury that the Crown was estopped from challenging any
of the findings on the first trial and that counsel for the accused should be
permitted in addressing the jury to point out to the jury what the issues were
in the first trial and the results of the first trial.

Donnelly J. disposed of the submission as
follows:

HIS LORDSHIP: I do not consider that the
accused in their addresses to the jury are entitled to refer to the results of
the first trial, or what inferences they consider can be drawn from the verdict
of the jury in that trial. In my opinion, as I have indicated, the jury were
influenced in arriving at their decision or the verdict at which they did
arrive, by a consideration whether or not the Crown had proven the intent which
was an essential element of the first charge. In view of my finding that this
is not an essential element in the second charge, I find that no reference
should be made on behalf of the accused to the jury finding.

Does that clear up your problem?

[Page 555]

Mr. HARTT: I wanted to make perfectly
clear we are not entitled to any of the issues in the first trial?

HIS LORDSHIP: No, this is a different
trial, a different charge, a different offence.

Mr. HARTT: Your lordship is taking the
defence of res judicata away from the jury?

HIS LORDSHIP: Yes, that is my judgment.

Mr. MILLIGAN: Your lordship is not
saying I am estopped from saying they are related to these clubs?

HIS LORDSHIP: I make no finding on that. I
say the only finding which could reasonably be drawn from the verdict in the
first case is that the jury had some doubt whether the Crown had satisfied the
onus in regard to proving this intent. Anything further than that would be
speculation, as I see it.

and he dealt with the same matter at p. 1125:

Mr. HARTT: Could I refer to the part
of the transcript to show the issues before the last jury and this one?

HIS LORDSHIP: These are entirely different
issues, in my ruling. Possibly I did not make it clear yesterday, but what I
intended was this, that neither you nor Mr. Nasso nor Mr. McDermott
may mention to the jury the issues in the trial of the first charge or the
results of that trial. In my understanding it is my duty to rule on the
question of whether res judicata has been successfully established by the
defence, and that it is not a matter for the jury. You understand that,
Mr. McDermott?

After the judge’s charge to the jury,
Mr. Hartt asked the judge to charge the jury that in view of Wright’s
acquittal on count 1 it should be put to the jury that Wright did not have an
unlawful purpose of conspiring for an unlawful end with McDermott and Feeley.

Mr. Hartt put his request as follows:

I suggest to your lordship if you accept my
premise that I have a rinding he was acting in accordance with the
administration of justice then it is impossible for the jury to find that there
is an illegal agreement in relation to the accused Wright.

* * *

Put it this way, that a previous jury has
found Wright did not have this intent and it is not open to this jury to make a
contrary finding. Therefore it must be put to the jury that it cannot be found
that he had, or Wright had an unlawful intent in relation to what he was doing
and that being an essential to the agreement to bring about an unlawful purpose
that he cannot be found guilty on that indictment.

The Crown’s position was stated by
Mr. Milligan on p. 1174:

I want to comment on Mr. Hartt’s
objection; the main one is that he would like your lordship to put the issue of
res judicata to the jury. He would like your lordship to put to the jury that a
previous jury having

[Page 556]

found that there was no unlawful purpose,
or that Wright did not intend to effect an unlawful purpose they should not
consider that. I submit if your lordship put it to them in that way you might
as well tell the jury to acquit.

The learned judge’s ruling was:

In regard to the objection that I must tell
the jury that they cannot convict Wright unless they find that he obtained this
information or agreed to obtain this information for an unlawful purpose it is
not necessary for the Crown to show any unlawful purpose and it is wrong for me
to so instruct the jury.

The jury found the three appellants guilty as
charged on count 2. That left counts 3, 4 and 5 against Wright only and count 6
against McDermott and Feeley to be dealt with. Wright was tried on counts 3, 4
and 5 by Donnelly J. on March 23, 1962. When the counts were read to him, he
entered a plea of not guilty. A jury was empanelled. Mr. Milligan for the
Crown opened the case to the jury as follows:

May it please your lordship. Gentlemen of
the jury, you have heard the charges read to you by the Clerk of the Assize and
in simple language they simply indicate that the Crown alleges that the accused
Wright, in 1960, a member of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, had been a
member of the Anti-Gaming Squad of that Police and he was transferred to
Belleville. On the Anti-Gaming Squad at the same time with Constable Wright was
Constable Scott who remained and still is a member of the Anti-Gaming Squad
Branch. The Crown alleges that Wright, for the purpose of tipping off gaming houses
as to raids on them by the Provincial Police, approached Scott to get the
information of these raids.

The Crown alleges that he offered Scott
money and that Scott then reported to his superior officers and he was told to
continue the investigation, in other words, as an underhand man, and Scott then
continued his contact with Wright and subsequently Wright on three occasions,
the 29th February, 1960, the 29th March, 1960, and the 27th April, 1960,
the accused Wright gave Scott—gave him on the first occasion $200, $400, and
$200, for payment for tip-offs of raids on gaming houses. Scott took that money
to his superior officers after taking note of the money so that he would be
able later to identify the money.

The Crown alleges that Wright, having
received information from Scott of the dates of the raids, passed that
information on to the operators and the raids were made on the gaming houses
and the gaming houses were ready for the police. The Crown alleges that the
accused, in the terms of the charges laid, bribed corruptly Constable Scott for
the purpose of perverting the course of justice.

Constable Scott was the only witness called by
the Crown. His evidence was substantially the same as he had given before
Spence J. at the first trial in respect of count 1 and

[Page 557]

before Donnelly J. at the second trial in
respect of count 2. The record reads:

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. HARTT:

Q. Mr. Scott, you gave evidence at the
trial which commenced May 29th last before his lordship Mr. Justice
Spence?

A. Yes.

Q. The accused Wright was one of those
accused at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. There was also two other accused, a man
by the name of McDermott, and Feeley?

A. Yes.

Q. I suggest the evidence you gave at the
trial was the evidence you have given us to-day?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also give evidence last week at
a trial?

A. Yes.

Q. In which this man was accused?

A. Yes.

Mr. HARTT: That is all, my lord.

Then Mr. Hartt made the following
admissions on behalf of his client:

My Lord, for the purpose of the record in
this trial I am prepared to admit that Wright, the accused, contacted the
officer Scott and obtained information from him. I am also prepared to make
admissions on behalf of my client that we paid money—or money was paid to
Scott, and a third admission that we are prepared to make for the purpose of
this trial, my lord, that the information was passed on to other persons who
had been interested in relation to obtaining this information. However, I do
wish to make it perfectly clear that we deny the intent which is an essential
ingredient of this charge.

Mr. MILLIGAN: In view of the
admissions of my learned friend the Crown closes its case.

Mr. Hartt then applied to Donnelly J. to
direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the three counts 3, 4 and
5 on the grounds Wright, having been acquitted under count 1, the matter was res
judicata.

Donnelly J. gave judgment on the application as
follows:

Counsel for Wright in his address to the
jury at the trial on the first count in the indictment admitted to the jury
that Wright had paid the various sums of money to Scott, the same sums which
were related by Scott in his evidence to-day. Counsel also admitted that
information was received from Scott by Wright and the sole defence of Wright on
that charge as I understand it on checking the address of his counsel was that
he did not have the intention to interfere with the administration of justice.
Counsel for McDermott in his address contended that McDermott was caught
between two police officers who were spying on each other.

[Page 558]

Counsel for Feeley based his defence on the
contention that there was no intention on the part of Scott to interfere with
the administration of justice, and in fact told the jury that McDermott and
Feeley were gamblers, at least one of them was associated with the club at
Cooksville, that there had been telephone calls from Wright and Scott to
McDermott. The defence of Wright was based on the contention by his counsel
that the Crown had not proved the intent on the part of Wright to interfere
with the administration of justice. The jury were instructed on the law by the
learned trial judge. He outlined the essential elements of the offence as,
firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly, and secondly, the
intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of justice.

Considering the addresses by counsel to the
jury and the admissions that were made by them in these addresses together with
the instruction given by the learned trial judge I must infer that the jury at
least came to the conclusion that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that Wright had the intention to interfere with the administration of
justice. I fail to see how the verdict of not guilty on the first count in the
indictment could have been reached by the jury on any other basis. I must find
that the jury trying the first count did find that the Crown had not proven the
intention which is an essential element in the three offences with which the
accused is charged and on which he is presently on trial.

Will you bring in the jury, please. I
consider that I am bound by Rex v. Quinn, 10 Canadian Criminal
Cases, 412.

His lordship then charged the jury as follows:

Members of the jury, as I informed you very
briefly before you retired to your jury room, you are the sole and only judges
of the facts, but it is my duty to pass on questions of law. Counsel for the
accused has made a motion raising what is known as a plea of res judicata and
it is for me to pass on that motion. The three charges against the accused
Wright, on which he is presently on trial, are the same except that various
amounts of money were paid on different dates. The law in regard to each charge
is the same and the essential elements of each charge are the same. The
essential elements are, first, that Wright corruptly paid money to Scott. That
is admitted. It is also admitted that Scott received money and gave information
to Wright that Wright passed on to one or more persons who were interested in
receiving that information; second, that Wright had the intention of
interfering with the administration of justice, that is an essential element of
each of these charges. Wright and others were tried in May and early June,
1961, on a charge that they conspired to commit an indictable offence by
corruptly giving money to George Scott, a peace officer of the Ontario
Provincial Police Force, the same man who is alleged to have received the money
in this present trial, with intent that the said George Scott should interfere
with the administration. You see that in that charge the same money was
involved and that same intent which is an essential element.

Having read the addresses of counsel to the
jury on that trial, the charge which was delivered to the jury by the learned
trial judge when he instructed them on the law and reviewed the facts with
them, and having considered the verdict of the jury at that trial, I consider
that the only inference which I can draw is that at that trial the jury
considered that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Wright
had this necessary intention of interfering with the administration of justice.
It was a judicial decision on that point and it is not now open to

[Page 559]

the Crown to ask you to come to a different
verdict on that point. There is the verdict of the earlier jury and as I have
said the only inference I can draw from the addresses and the charge to the
jury and the verdict is that the Crown failed to prove the necessary intention.
That is an essential element in this charge and before the accused may be found
guilty the Crown must prove each element of the charge beyond a reasonable
doubt. That burden is on the Crown; it is not on the defence. It is my duty to
instruct you that it is my view that the jury on the earlier trial considered
that the Crown had not proven this essential element. It is therefore my duty
to instruct you that you cannot find the accused guilty on these present
charges because it is not open to you to arrive at a different verdict than the
other jury on this essential element. I would therefore ask that you, without
leaving the jury box, select a foreman and if you agree with my instruction to
you that you find the accused not guilty on each one of these charges on which
he is presently before the Court. Will you select a foreman, please, from among
yourselves.

Have you arrived at your verdict?

The FOREMAN: Yes.

The REGISTRAR: Members of the jury, have
you agreed upon your verdict? On Counts 3, 4 and 5 as charged in this
indictment how do you find the accused as directed by his lordship?

The FOREMAN: My own—the verdict of the
jury—I don’t know.

HIS LORDSHIP: I had suggested to you that
you find the accused not guilty. I had gone further than that; I had instructed
you that in my opinion it was impossible for you to arrive at any other
verdict.

The FOREMAN: We agree he is not guilty.

HIS LORDSHIP: On each of the counts?

The FOREMAN: On each count.

The situation at this stage of the proceedings
may be summarized as follows:

As to count 1: All three appellants had
been acquitted.

As to count 2: All three appellants had
been convicted.

As to counts

3, 4 and 5: The appellant Wright had been
acquitted.

As to count 6: The appellants McDermott and
Feeley had entered a plea of guilty and had been fined. This count does not
appear further in the proceedings.

The three appellants then appealed to the Court
of Appeal for Ontario[10] against their
conviction on count 2. The appeal was taken upon the following grounds:

1. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in
failing to find that the plea of autrefois acquit was properly pleaded in this
case.

2. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in
refusing to place the theory of the defence before the jury.

3. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in
failing to allow to be placed before the jury the fact of the acquittal of the
accused on a previous

[Page 560]

charge in so far as it was relevant to the
issue to be determined by the jury in this case.

4. That the Learned Trial Judge having
found that a previous jury had found that it was not proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that the appellant had the intent that George Scott should interfere with
the administration of justice erred in failing to direct the jury to return a
verdict of not guilty of the conspiracy charge where the facts were admitted to
be the same.

5. That the Learned Trial Judge having
found that a previous jury had found that it was not proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that the appellant had the intent that George Scott should interfere with
the administration of justice erred in failing to place this fact before the
jury as a relevant consideration in determining whether the appellant was
guilty of the conspiracy charged.

6. That the verdict of the jury was
inconsistent with a previous verdict on the same facts.

7. Such further and other grounds as
Counsel may advise and the Court may deem sufficient grounds of appeal.

The Attorney General for Ontario appealed to the
Court of Appeal for Ontario against the acquittal of the appellant Wright on
counts 3, 4 and 5 on the ground that: “The learned trial judge erred in law in
directing the jury to return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ on each charge on the
ground of res judicata.”

These appeals were argued together on September 7, 1962, and judgment was handed down
on October 4, 1962. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the appellants
in respect of count 2 and allowed the Crown’s appeal in respect of counts 3, 4
and 5 directing that the order of acquittal of the appellant Wright upon those
counts be set aside and that there should be a new trial with respect thereto.
Schroeder J.A. wrote the judgment in which Laidlaw and Kelly JJ.A. concurred.

The three appellants applied to this Court and
were given leave on October 22, 1962, to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following
points:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding as a matter of law
that the learned Trial Judge was correct in holding that the defence of res
judicata was not available to the Appellants by reason of their previous
acquittal upon count 1 of the indictment?

2. In the alternative, did the Court of
Appeal for Ontario err as a
matter of law in holding that the learned Trial Judge was correct in not
leaving to the Jury for its determination the defence based upon res judicata?

3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err
as a matter of law in not holding that the learned Trial Judge has misdirected
the Jury when he declined to point out to the Jury that by virtue of the
acquittal

[Page 561]

of the accused on the first count of the
indictment the Jury was precluded from drawing any inferences by way of motive
or otherwise on the matter presented to them at the trial on the second count
from the supposition or view that the accused had conspired together to
interfere corruptly with the administration of justice?

4. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the plea of
autrefois acquit was not properly pleaded in this case?

The appellant Wright appealed to this Court as
of right from the order setting aside his acquittal on counts 3, 4 and 5 and
directing a new trial.

Although they filed separate factums and were
represented by different counsel, all three appellants made common cause in
their appeal from conviction under count 2. Wright was alone in the appeal
under counts 3, 4 and 5.

Ground of appeal no. 4 dealing with the plea of
autrefois acquit may be disposed of under the provisions of ss. 517  and 518  of
the Criminal Code  which read:

517. EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY OF CHARGES. Where
an issue, on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, is tried, the
evidence and adjudication and the notes of the judge and official stenographer
on the former trial and the record transmitted to the court pursuant to
section 462 on the charge that is pending before that court, are
admissible in evidence to prove or to disprove the identity of the charges.

518. (1) WHAT DETERMINES IDENTITY. Where an
issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict to a count is tried
and it appears

(a) that the matter on which the
accused was given in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part
as that on which it is proposed to give him in charge, and

(b) that on the former trial, if all
proper amendments had been made that might then have been made, he might have
been convicted of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count to
which the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict be pleaded,

the judge shall give judgment discharging
the accused in respect of that count.

(2) ALLOWANCE OF SPECIAL PLEA IN PART. The
following provisions apply where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or
autrefois convict is tried, namely,

(a) where it appears that the
accused might on the former trial have been convicted of an offence of which he
may be convicted on the count in issue, the judge shall direct that the accused
shall not be found guilty of any offence of which he might have been convicted
on the former trial, and

(b) where it appears that the
accused may be convicted on the count in issue of an offence of which he could
not have been convicted on the former trial, the accused shall plead guilty or
not guilty with respect to that offence.

[Page 562]

These sections appear to be a code of the
law relating to the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict and I am in
complete agreement with the views of Schroeder J.A. on this point and do not
consider it necessary to review the law on the subject in the light of that
judgment. Shortly put, on their trial on count 1 the appellants could not have
been convicted on count 2.

In dealing with the defence of res judicata as
raised in this instance, it is necessary to deal with a preliminary but
important question which the appellants urged upon the trial judge, in the
Court of Appeal and in this Court, namely, that it was for the jury to decide
the issue and that Donnelly J. erred when he refused to admit as an exhibit to
go to the jury the complete record of the trial before Spence J. At the
beginning of the trial there was some confusion as to what function the jury
performed in respect of a plea of res judicata. When the question was
first raised, Crown counsel took the position that it was a matter for the jury
to decide as stated on p. 47:

If you accept the submission of my learned
friend, I submit you yourself would be deciding res judicata, and I submit that
is a defence which should be submitted to the jury to decide. I submit if your
lordship were simply to impanel a jury and instruct them, you have decided it
is res judicata and therefore they must not convict, you are really treating the
res judicata as a special plea, but doing it indirectly and I submit your
lordship should not do that on the issue of res judicata because that is
something for the jury to decide.

Donnelly J. did not then decide the point but
did hold that res judicata was not a special plea and that it is a
defence included in a plea of not guilty. There the matter rested until at the
conclusion of the Crown’s case when Mr. Hartt again asked that the record
of the first trial be received in evidence to go to the jury. Donnelly J.
refused the application but ordered the record to be filed but not to be
available to the jury. He further held that the question as to whether the
defence of res judicata had been made out was one of law for him to
decide and was not a question for the jury. He thereupon ruled that the defence
of res judicata had not been established.

While there are findings of fact involved in
determining whether or not the defence of res judicata has been made out
in any given case, it is manifest that it would be unrealistic to hand over to
a jury the record of a previous

[Page 563]

trial or to have read to the jury that record
which in any specific case might contain evidence inadmissible in the second
trial and prejudicial to the accused. On balance, therefore, justice requires
that a workable rule consistent with safeguarding the rights of accused persons
be formulated and in that regard I think the procedure followed by Donnelly J.
is the only reasonable course to follow and which should be followed in the
future. It will be for the judge to decide as a matter of law whether the
defence of res judicata has been made out. The case of Cowan v. Affie[11] was cited in support of the position taken
by Mr. Hartt and agreed to initially by Crown counsel. For the reasons
just stated I do not think that Cowan v. Affie, supra, ought to be
followed.

The appellants urge that the defence of res
judicata was available to them and that Donnelly J. and the Court of
Appeal were in error in holding that it had not been established.

The defence of res judicata differs
materially from autrefois acquit or autrefois convict. The principle of res
judicata estops the Crown in a second or later legal proceeding from
questioning that which was in substance the ratio of and fundamental to the
decision in the earlier proceeding. Res judicata is applicable in
criminal as well as civil proceedings. This was aptly stated by Holmes J. in United
States v. Oppenheimer[12] when
he said:

It cannot be that the safeguards of the
person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn reverence, are less than
those that protect from a liability in debt.

and by Lord MacDermott in Sambasivam v.
Public Prosecutor[13] in the
following passage:

The effect of a verdict of acquittal
pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is
not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again
for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and
conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the
adjudication. The maxim “Res judicata pro veritate accipitur” is no less
applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings.

This principle was adopted by this Court in McDonald
v. The Queen[14] in
both the majority and minority opinions.

[Page 564]

In view of the reference by Schroeder J.A. to Rex
v. Bayn[15], it
must now be said that the statement by Haultain C.J.S. in Bayn at p. 90:

…that there is no rule or principle of the
common law, or of the statutory law, on which the principle of res judicata is
applicable to criminal cases, which is not founded on the maxims nemo debet
bis vexari pro una et eadem causa or nemo debet bis puniri pro uno
delicto.

is not good law.

Accordingly, what was in substance the ratio of
and fundamental to the verdict of acquittal on count 1 before Spence J.? Count
1 and count 2 read:

1. ROBERT J. WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT
and VINCENT B. FEELEY, between the first day of January, 1960, and
the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully agree
and conspire together to commit an indictable offence under Section 101 (b)
of the Criminal Code  of Canada by corruptly giving money to George Scott a
peace officer of the Ontario Provincial Police Force, with intent that the said
George Scott should interfere with the administration of justice, contrary to
the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(1) (d).

2. AND FURTHER THAT the said ROBERT J.
WRIGHT, JOSEPH P. McDERMOTT and VINCENT BERNARD FEELEY between the
first day of January, 1960 and the first day of July, 1960, in the Province of
Ontario did unlawfully agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful
purpose, to wit: to obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario
Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary
to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(2).

They are not identical in their essential
elements and for that reason the defence of autrefois acquit was not made out
but the appellants argue that though differing in language and in their
essential elements they do in reality deal with the same offence and that the
basic error made by Donnelly J. at the trial and by Schroeder J.A. was that
they approached consideration of the case from the standpoint of a comparison
of the wording of the two counts and not the realities of the proceedings
before Spence J.

The question really boils down to whether there
were in fact two conspiracies or only one. The appellants argue that what the
Crown has done is to make two conspiracies out of the one agreement testified
to by Constable Scott by splitting off from the agreement alleged in count 1 a
segment and calling it count 2. Accordingly, were there one or two unlawful
agreements or conspiracies? Constable Scott’s evidence at the two trials was
almost identical.

[Page 565]

Before Spence J. he testified as to the
agreement with Wright in a series of interviews and telephone conversations
deposed to from p. 176 to p. 202 of the record culminating in Scott’s statement
on pp. 201-202:

A. Well, Wright said that starting February
15th, he would call me every evening from Belleville between 6.30 and 7.00 p.m.

Q. And did he give you the name of his
alleged contact or the gambler at that time?

A. No, sir, he didn’t.

Q. And what conversation, if any, was there
about disclosing the names of the contacts to you?

A. Well, Wright told me that as we
developed the trust between us, I would be given much information regarding
gambling activities in the Province.

Q. Any further discussion at this time?

A. Yes, sir. He again emphasized that the
gamblers were only interested in the policy of the Branch towards the Clubs and
the time of any raids on the Clubs. He said the only way we could get caught
was if one turned the other in. We talked of using a code for our telephone
conversations and we decided that we would call the Vets Club north and the
Ramsey Club south. Wright said he thought the gamblers should pay the cost of
all the long distance telephone calls. He also told me that he thought we could
get more money in time to come. It was on this date that I agreed to go along
with Wright; that is, I should say accept his proposition as he put it to me.

The proposition which Scott has described is at
pp. 177-179:

Q. Apart from any personal conversation,
was there any conversation with Wright on this occasion about any proposition?

A. Yes, sir, there was.

Q. Yes; what was said?

A. Well, Wright told me that he had stopped
a car for speeding in the Belleville area about two weeks ago. Wright said the driver of this car turned
out to be one of the gamblers from Toronto. He said that the gambler was surprised to see him in uniform and
put a proposition to him. This proposition was that myself, as an officer on
the Anti‑Gambling Branch, would find out, or knowing our policies for
dates of raids respecting two Clubs operating in the Province, would forward
the information regarding policies and raids and dates of raids, I should say,
to Wright in Belleville, who in turn would forward the information to the
gambler in Toronto. Now, for doing this—providing this information, Wright said
that we could obtain—

Q. Who is “we”?

A. Wright and myself.

Q. Yes?

A.—$200 each per month. He said that the
gambler was only interested in raids on two Clubs and the policies of the
Provincial Police

[Page 566]

towards these two Clubs. Wright said he had
been given a number to call in Toronto and he could certify the figure of $200 each per month. When Wright
made this approach to me I showed some surprise and laughed at him, but I said,
“Well, go ahead and make the phone call.” And Wright went to a pay phone
located in the beverage room in the Wallace Hotel and he appeared to dial a number and
carry on a conversation. He completed the apparent phone call and returned to
our table. And he told me, “That is right, we can make $200 each.”

Q. Did you ask him who the gambler or
contact was, at that time?

A. I did, sir.

Q. And did he tell you at that time?

A. He did not, sir.

Q. What else, if anything, was discussed
with Wright at this time with reference to this proposition of his?

A. Well, Wright stated that this
information was required only to protect the clientele frequenting the Clubs in
that they get—they had big shots as customers in the Clubs. He told me that
this would not interfere with my duties and mentioned to me how few raids there
were in the past five years.

Q. You refer to Wright telling you of the
information required about two gaming clubs. Did he at this time make—identify
them by name?

A. Well, he identified the Vets Club which
was located in Cooksville.

Q. Yes; and does that cover substantially
the conversation you had with Wright at this time—what did you tell him about
the proposition?

A. Well, I might say also that Wright said
if I agreed to this proposition we would have a meeting with his contact.

Q. Yes; what did you tell him?

A. I told Wright that I would like some
time to think it over.

Q. Yes; and then did you and he leave the
hotel and you went home?

A. Yes, sir, we did.

Then at the second trial before Donnelly J.,
Scott testified as to the agreement as appears on pp. 276 to 278 in language
almost identical to his testimony on pp. 176 to 179, culminating again in
Scott’s statement at pp. 312 and 313 that he “would be part of this scheme”.

No matter how Scott’s evidence at the two trials
is scrutinized, there is no escaping that he and Wright entered into only one
agreement or proposition and that was as Scott described it at the first trial
as set out above and at the second trial as:

A. Wright explained that the gambler told
him that if I did inform Wright of the dates of raids on these two social clubs
and the policy of the Provincial Police with regard to the clubs, and Wright in
turn forwarded it to the gambler we would each be reimbursed in what he figured
would be two hundred dollars each per month. He explained that the situation
would be handled in this way:—Upon

[Page 567]

my finding out that any of the two clubs
would be raided I would telephone him, Wright, at Belleville and give him the information and he in turn would phone back to Toronto the information. He explained
that—he mentioned how few raids had been made on the clubs in the past five
years, saying that it wouldn’t hinder my work at all and the big reason that
this information was required was to protect people of reputable standing from being
caught in the clubs on a police raid. He wouldn’t name the person with whom he
had dealt and he said he had been given a Toronto telephone number and he could phone this number and certify this
amount for two hundred dollars each per month. Now, at this time I laughed a
bit and said well, he might as well call the number. He went to a pay ‘phone in
the hotel and appeared to dial a number and appeared to carry on a conversation
at the telephone. A couple of minutes later he came back to the table and said
that that was correct, that we could make the amount of two hundred dollars a
month each for this information. I told Wright I wasn’t too keen; I would like
some time to think about this matter at this time.

The conspirators (if there was a conspiracy) did
not agree together just to obtain from Constable Scott information which it was
his duty not to divulge—they were not interested in just getting information or
just in having Scott give information unlawfully—they wanted the information so
as to be forewarned of impending raids on their gambling clubs. That was the
conspiracy, if any.

Therefore, everything that could be considered
unlawful under count 2 was part and parcel of the agreement under count 1.
There was only one agreement deposed to and it cannot be severed arbitrarily at
some point by the Crown so as to create the illusion of two offences from what
is in fact only one.

The verdict of not guilty under count 1, however
unpalatable to the Crown, was a lawful verdict which has not been challenged upon
appeal. That verdict dealt with the realities of the crime these appellants
were charged with having committed. The Crown is now estopped from questioning
that which was (in fact and law) the ratio of and fundamental to the decision
in the first trial.

Crown counsel must have considered the two
counts as covering the same offence. This is evident from the similarity of
counsel’s opening statement on count 1 before Spence J. as follows:

In January, 1960, the Provincial Police
transferred the accused Wright to other duties in the Force in Belleville, not associated with the
anti-gambling unit. At that time Scott then became the second senior constable
under Sergeant Anderson.

[Page 568]

In February 1960, something like a month
following Wright’s transfer, it is alleged that Wright came to see Scott and
told him a story about stopping a Toronto gambler for speeding. He told Scott the gambler had offered to pay
$400 a month to get information about the policy of the anti-gambling unit and
the times of raids. Wright told Scott that here was a chance to make some easy
money. Scott told Wright that he would have to think this over, arranged to
meet him or talk to him later. He immediately reported the incident to his
superiors and was instructed to go along with Wright.

Scott then agreed with Wright to tip him
off on raids as requested and supply what information he could. Wright told him
that the information that the gamblers or his (Wright’s) contacts wanted was as
to raids on what was popularly referred to as the Vets Club at Cooksville and a
new Ramsey Club in Niagara Falls. Those were apparently the two main alleged gaming houses or clubs
then known to be operating in Ontario.

when compared to Crown counsel’s opening before
Donnelly J. previously quoted.

The one conspiracy view is further strengthened
by the similarity of the language used by Spence J. in his charge to the jury
relating to count 1 and Donnelly J’s charge as to count 2.

Spence J. said at pp. 1261-2 of the record of
the first trial:

So what the Crown has here charged, put in
short words, is that Wright, McDermott and Feeley did agree and conspire
together corruptly to give money to Scott, with intent that Scott should
interefere with the administration of justice.

The essential elements of the offence
charged are these. Firstly, the agreement to give money to Scott corruptly;
secondly, the intent that Scott should interfere with the administration of
justice.

The offence is complete with the agreement,
the arriving at the agreement or design. That design need not be carried out,
as the agreement to do the unlawful act is the offence.

and at pp. 1280-1:

Much of the evidence dealt with the
character of these so-called social clubs, the Centre Road Veterans Club and
the Ramsey Club, and with those who were in control there. That evidence is
relevant only to show, if it does show, that the accused McDermott and Feeley
had an interest in the protection of those places from police interference, and
therefore an interest in making the illegal conspiracy with Wright with which
they are charged in this charge. It is relevant only for that purpose. Even if
you are convinced that both of those clubs are illegal gaming houses, it is not
sufficient. You must be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that, with the intent
to protect them and thus interfere with the administration of justice, the two
men agreed to pay Scott money corruptly.

Donnelly J. dealt with count 2 in his charge as
follows at pp. 1144-5 of the record of the second trial:

This indictment covers a period between
January 1st, 1960 and July 1st, 1960. It is not necessary to show that the accused conspired over this
whole

[Page 569]

period, as long as they conspired at any
one time during that period. The conspiracy does not need to cover the whole
period. The evidence is that Scott first contacted Wright about February 5th
and that Wright was arrested on the 28th of May. You do not have to find that
the parties conspired over that whole period; all the Crown has to show is that
sometime in the period the three parties were active in the common
design—associated in a common design for a common unlawful purpose.

Now I propose to review the evidence with
you in regard to the parties individually. The accused Wright, as you have been
told, was a member of the Ontario Provincial Police, and was a member of the
Anti-gambling Squad for some years, Scott being a member of that squad or
branch during a number of years also. The evidence indicates that Wright was on
the Branch before Scott, and in January, 1960, Wright was transferred to Belleville. Scott’s evidence was that on
the 5th of February Wright came to his house and after some conversation they
went to the Wallace Hotel or some hotel and Scott was told by Wright about some
man who had been stopped on the highway by Wright and it turned out he was
interested in gambling and that he was interested in obtaining information as
to the policy of the Anti-gambling Branch and the times when raids would be
made on one or more clubs. Wright told Scott, according to Scott, that if this
information was given each of them would receive two hundred dollars a month.
Wright and Scott parted after Scott had told Wright that he wanted to think it
over. There were subsequent conversations, one or two, very shortly after, in one
of which Scott told Wright that he would be a party to the proposition which
Wright had made…

I am, accordingly, of opinion that Donnelly J.
should have held that res judicata had been established and he should
have directed the jury to acquit the appellants under count 2. The convictions
will, therefore, be set aside and the appellants acquitted.

That still leaves Wright’s appeal from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside his acquittal by Donnelly J. on
counts 3, 4 and 5 and directing a new trial.

I agree with Schroeder J.A. that as to these
counts charging as they do the commission of substantive offences the Crown was
not estopped by Wright’s acquittal under count 1 from proceeding to try Wright
for the substantive offences: McDonald v. The Queen[16], per Martland J.

That does not, however, dispose of the matter
because Wright contends and in my opinion correctly that his acquittal under
count 1 negatives the essentially criminal element of the charges, namely, that
the various sums of money were given corruptly to Constable Scott “with intent
that the said George Scott should interfere with the administration of
justice…” and that if the charges

[Page 570]

under counts 3, 4 and 5 are to be let go to the
jury the trial judge will be obliged to charge the jury in the light of the
admissions made on behalf of Wright before Spence J. that in view of Wright’s
acquittal on count 1 it would not be open to them to find that the money which
Wright admitted having given Scott was given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice. Such being the case in lieu of upholding the
direction for a new trial which must necessarily result in an acquittal, this
Court should allow the appeal as to counts 3, 4 and 5 and acquit Wright on
these charges.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S
BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Obscenity—Lady
Chatterley's Lover—Whether obscene publication—Whether definition of obscenity
in s. 150(8) of the Code exhaustive—Dominant characteristic undue exploitation
of sex—Whether test in R. v. Hicklin still applicable—Evidence by experts as to
purpose of author and as to literary and artistic merits of book—Whether
admissible—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 150(8) (as enacted by 1959,
c. 41, s. 11 ), and s. 150A(4)  (as enacted by 1959, c. 41, s. 12 ).

On an information laid under s. 150A  of the Criminal Code , copies
of a book entitled ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" by D. H. Lawrence, were
seized on the accused's premises on the allegation that the book was an obscene
publication under s. 150(8)  of the Criminal Code . The trial judge found
the book to be obscene and ordered its confiscation. This judgment was
unanimously affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side. The accused
were granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.
dissenting): The book ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" was not an obscene
publication.

Per Cartwright J.: Assuming, without deciding the
point, that the definition of the word ""obscene"" contained in s.
150(8) of the Code is exhaustive, as was contended by counsel for the accused
and conceded by counsel for the Crown, for the reasons given by Judson J., the
book in question was not obscene.

Per Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The definition of
""obscenity"" introduced in 1959 by s. 150(8) , enacted for the purposes
of proceedings under the Code, precludes the application of any other test.
Consequently, the test in R. v. Hicklin, L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, and all the
jurisprudence thereunder was rendered obsolete by the enactment of

[Page 682]

this new and exhaustive definition. Under the definition,
there must be a characteristic which is dominant and this dominant
characteristic must amount to an exploitation of sex which is undue. The search
for such a dominant characteristic involves the reading of the whole book and
also involves an inquiry into the purpose of the author. One cannot ascertain a
dominant characteristic of a book without an examination of its literary or
artistic merit, and this renders admissible the evidence of the author and
others on this point. There was real unanimity in the opinions of the witnesses
that the book was a true and sincere representation of an aspect of life as it
appeared to the author. The phrase ""undue exploitation"" is aimed at
excessive emphasis on the theme of sex for a base purpose. Measured by the
internal necessities of the novel, there was no such undue exploitation. There
was no more emphasis on the theme of sex than was required in the treatment of
such a serious work of fiction. No matter whether ""undue
exploitation"" is to be measured by the internal necessities of the novel
itself or by offence against community standards, this novel does not offend.

Per Ritchie J.: The language of s. 150(8)  does not
constitute an exclusive definition of ""obscenity"" for the purposes of
the Criminal Code . That language cannot be construed as meaning that no
publication can be obscene for the purpose of the Code unless it has undue
exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic. Section 150(8)  has the effect
of expanding the meaning of ""obscene"" to include all publications
which have undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic whether or
not they can be shown to have a tendency to corrupt and deprave. The word
""undue"" carried the meaning of ""undue having regard to the
existing standards of decency in the community"". The inquiry as to whether
a publication is likely to corrupt a significant segment of the population and
as to what is or what is not ""undue"" so as to offend community standards,
involves the reading and consideration of the publication as a whole. It is not
only relevant but desirable to consider evidence of the opinions of qualified
experts as to the artistic and literary qualities of the publication. Although
sex is a dominant characteristic of the book and although there are isolated
passages which, when read alone, unduly exploit sex, it does not follow that
these passages, read as a part of the whole book, have the effect of making the
undue exploitation which they contain a dominant characteristic of the
publication so as to bring it within s. 150(8) . Furthermore, no significant
segment of the population was likely to be depraved or corrupted by reading the
book as a whole. In any event, the defence of the public good was available under
s. 150A  so that any harmful effect which these objectionable passages might
have is counterbalanced by the desirability of preserving intact the work of a
writer who, on the evidence in this case, was regarded as a great artist by
respectable teachers, authors and critics.

Per Kerwin C.J., dissenting: It was unnecessary to deal
with the argument that the Crown having cross-examined the witnesses, could not
now say that their evidence was inadmissible, because Parliament has prescribed
that under s. 150(8)  an objective test be applied. The rule in R. v. Hicklin
is not the one to be followed in applying s. 150(8) of the Code. Under that
subsection, a publication is deemed to be obscene if (a) a dominant
characteristic of the publication is (b) the undue

[Page 683]

exploitation (c) of sex. The claim of the witnesses and of the
judgments in the Courts of England and the United States that the dominant
characteristic of the book is to show the evils of industrialism in England and
the damage it does to the human soul, is not substantiated by a careful reading
of the book. The use of ""four-letter words"" by itself might or might
not make a book one in which sex was exploited unduly so as to make that
feature a dominant characteristic, but they could not be treated in isolation
from the scenes depicted in which they were used. The witnesses called on
behalf of the accused have not succeeded in showing that this is a work of art
in which there is no undue exploitation of sex and that that is not the
dominant characteristic of the book. Although the evidence was competent to
show the merits of the book as a work of art, the tribunals would still have to
determine whether a dominant characteristic of the book was the undue
exploitation of sex. In the present case, the answer must be in the
affirmative.

Per Taschereau J., dissenting: The decision of R. v.
Hicklin is no longer the law of the land. It is unnecessary to determine
whether s. 150(8)  is exhaustive or not, since if there is to be found in the
book a dominant characteristic which is the undue exploitation of sex,
the book must be banned. Without deciding as to its legality or illegality, too
much weight has been attached to the expert evidence adduced. A more objective
legal aspect of the question has to be considered. The author relies on sex and
adultery to dissolve the clouds of social evils that he believes are hanging
over the skies of England. In doing so, he violates s. 150(8) of the Code.
""Undue"" means ""unreasonable"", ""unjustifiable"".
The book comes clearly within the ban of the Code as there is an undue
exploitation of sex which is ""a dominant"" characteristic of the work.
Even if the book were a work of art, art can co-exist with obscenity and does
not exclude it.

Per Locke J., dissenting: The book is an obscene
publication within the definition of s. 150(8)  of the Criminal Code .

Per Fauteux J., dissenting: While s. 150(8) of the Code
is effective to expand the meaning of ""obscenity"" so as to include a
publication a dominant characteristic of which is exploitation of sex,
it does not purport to be an exhaustive definition of obscenity excluding the
test found in R. v. Hicklin and all the Canadian and English
jurisprudence in application of that case. The evidence of experts in
literature has always been excluded under the Hicklin jurisprudence as
irrelevant to the test and there does not appear to be any valid reason why
this rule should be varied with respect to the test under s. 158(8) whether,
having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community, the
exploitation of sex has been carried to a shocking and disgusting point. The
book in question can be accurately described as replete with descriptions in
minute detail of sexual acts with the use of filthy, offensive and degrading
words and terms. Whether admissible or not, expert evidence as to the literary
merit of the book is clearly ineffective to change this view. Whether one
applies the law as it stood prior to or as expanded by the 1959 amendments,
""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" is an obscene publication under the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Fontaine J.
Appeals allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.

F. R. Scott, Q.C., and M.
Shacter, for the appellants.

C. Wagner, André Tessier,
Q.C., and Gabriel Houde, Q.C., for the respondents.

The
Chief Justice (dissenting):—By leave of this Court Brodie, Dansky
and Rubin appeal from judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province
of Quebec2 dismissing their appeals from judgments
of the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal declaring a
certain book ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"", by D. H. Lawrence, to be
obscene and forfeited to Her Majesty in accordance with the provisions of s.
150A  of the Criminal Code  of Canada. The three appeals raise the same
question and it is sufficient to deal with the case of Brodie.

Section 150  of the Criminal
Code  including subs. 8 which was enacted July 18, 1959, by 7-8 Eliz. II, c.
41, and s. 150A of the Code enacted at the same time by the same chapter read
as follows:

150. (1) Every one commits an offence who

(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes,
circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication,
distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model,
phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or

(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or
has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation,
a crime comic.

(2) Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without
lawful justification or excuse,

(a) sells, exposes to public view or has in his
possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture, model,
phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,

(b) publicly exhibits a disgusting object or an
indecent show,

(c) offers to sell, advertises, publishes an
advertisement of, or has for sale or disposal any means, instructions,
medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a method of preventing
conception or causing abortion or miscarriage, or

(d) advertises or publishes an advertisement of any
means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a
method for restoring sexual virility or curing venereal diseases or diseases of
the generative organs.

[Page 685]

(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this
section if he establishes that the public good was served by the acts that are
alleged to constitute the offence and that the acts alleged did not extend
beyond what served the public good.

(4) For the purposes of this section it is a question of law
whether an act served the public good and whether there is evidence that the
act alleged went beyond what served the public good, but it is a question of
fact whether the acts did or did not extend beyond what served the public good.

(5) For the purposes of this section the motives of an
accused are irrelevant.

(6) Where an accused is charged with an offence under
subsection (1) the fact that the accused was ignorant of the nature or presence
of the matter, picture, model, phonograph record, crime comic or other thing by
means of or in relation to which the offence was committed is not a defence to
the charge.

(7) In this section, ""crime comic"" means a
magazine, periodical or book that exclusively or substantially comprises matter
depicting pictorially

(a) the commission of
crimes, real or fictitious, or

(b) events connected with
the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, whether occurring before or after
the commission of the crime.

(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant
characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one
or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence,
shall be deemed to be obscene.

150A. (1) A judge who is satisfied by information upon oath
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that any publication, copies of
which are kept for sale or distribution in premises within the jurisdiction of
the court, is obscene or a crime comic, shall issue a warrant under his hand
authorizing seizure of the copies.

(2) Within seven days of the issue of the warrant, the judge
shall issue a summons to the occupier of the premises requiring him to appear
before the court and show cause why the matter seized should not be forfeited
to Her Majesty.

(3) The owner and the author of the matter seized and
alleged to be obscene or a crime comic may appear and be represented in the
proceedings in order to oppose the making of an order for the forfeiture of the
said matter.

(4) If the court is satisfied that the publication is
obscene or a crime comic, it shall make an order declaring the matter forfeited
to Her Majesty in right of the province in which the proceedings take place,
for disposal as the Attorney General may direct.

(5) If the court is not satisfied that the publication is
obscene or a crime comic, it shall order that the matter be restored to the
person from whom it was seized forthwith after the time for final appeal has
expired.

(6) An appeal lies from an order made under subsecion (4) or
(5) by any person who appeared in the proceedings

(a) on any ground of
appeal that involves a question of law alone,

(b) on any ground of
appeal that involves a question of fact alone, or

[Page 686]

(c) on any ground of
appeal that involves a question of mixed law and fact,

as if it were an appeal against conviction or against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, on a question of law
alone under Part XVIII and sections 581 to 601 apply mutatis mutandis.

(7) Where an order has been made under this section by a
judge in a province with respect to one or more copies of a publication, no
proceedings shall be instituted or continued in that province under section 150 
with respect to those or other copies of the same publication without the
consent of the Attorney General.

(8) In this section,

(a) ""court""
means a county or district court or, in the Province of Quebec

(i) the court of the sessions of
the peace, or

(ii) where an application has
been made to a district magistrate for a warrant under subsection (1), that
district magistrate,

(b) ""crime
comic"" has the same meaning as it has in section 150 , and

(c) ""judge""
means a judge of a court or, in the Province of Quebec, a district magistrate.

It was under the provisions of s.
150A  that an information was laid and a summons issued to Brodie as the
occupant of premises within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Sessions of
the Peace. A copy of the book seized was put in evidence. Under reserve by the
judge of counsel's right so to do, witnesses were called on behalf of Brodie
and were cross-examined to some extent. It has been contended on behalf of the
appellant that having cross-examined the witnesses the Crown cannot now be
heard to say that their evidence was inadmissible. There is a good deal to be
said for this argument but it is unnecessary to deal with the point because, in
my view, by subs. 8 of s. 150  Parliament has prescribed that an objective test
be applied. Before the enactment of subs. 8 the rule laid down by Chief Justice
Cockburn in R. v. Hicklin3 had been applied in England and
in various Courts in Canada. This was to the effect that the test of obscenity
was whether the tendency of the matter charged is ""to deprave and corrupt
those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a
publication of this sort may fall"". I agree with counsel for the appellant
that this is not the rule to be followed in applying the amendment and that the
judge of first instance was in error in so doing. It was argued that
notwithstanding statements of intention to the contrary

[Page 687]

the judges in the Court of Queen's
Bench applied the Hicklin rule. I am unable so to read their reasons,
but, in any event, I desire to make it clear that I do not apply it.

So far as relevant to this appeal,
under subs. 8 of s. 150 of the Code, a publication is to be deemed obscene if
(a) a dominant characteristic of the publication is (b) the undue exploitation
(c) of sex. The witnesses called on behalf of the appellant and some, if not
all, of the judgments in Courts in England and the United States, put in by his
counsel, claim that the dominant characteristic of the book is to show the
evils of industrialism in England and the damage it does to the human soul. A
careful reading of the book satisfies me that this is not so. This view is
based not merely on the comparatively short space allotted to any such thing as
compared with that taken up with sex, but on a comprehensive view of the
publication. Another matter relied on is the alleged preeminence of ""blood
knowledge"" over ""mind knowledge"" in the lives of human beings.
These terms were invented by Lawrence, it is said, to show that the animal
state of man's nature should be in better balance with mind knowledge.

The use of ""four-letter
words"" by itself might or might not make a book one in which sex was
exploited unduly so as to make that feature a dominant characteristic, but they
cannot be treated in isolation from the scenes depicted in which they are used.
The witnesses called on behalf of the appellant have not succeeded in showing
that this is a work of art in which there is no undue exploitation of sex and
that that is not the dominant characteristic of the book. I pay no attention to
the price charged for the book but it is not without significance that on the
cover above the title ""Lady Chatterley's Lover—D. H. Lawrence""
appears: ""Complete Unexpurgated Authentic Authorized Edition"" and that
below the title appears the following: ""'This Signet Edition is the only
complete unexpurgated version of LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER authorized by the
estate of Frieda Lawrence for United States publication' Laurence Pollinger
Literary Executor to the estate of the late Mrs. Frieda Lawrence"". By
themselves these matters might appear insignificant but notwithstanding the
protestations of the representative of the publishers they lend weight to the
conclusion arrived at.

[Page 688]

By reason of war wounds, the
husband of Lady Chatterley was rendered impotent and, in order, as in substance
the author puts it, that the wife should not be frustrated, she approached
Mellors, her husband's gamekeeper, who was separated from his wife. In fact,
she led him to the relationship that is afterwards set out in such great
detail. There is not merely a description of one episode only, but of several,
and it is sufficient to state that all of them are set forth in great detail
that might have been expected in the Greece and Rome of ancient times.

The evidence for the defence was
competent in order to give the opinion of the witnesses as to the merits of the
book as a work of art, but in some parts it is made clear that opinions may
differ. That would entail a comparison of any evidence that might be adduced in
any particular instance and even then the answers on the point would not
determine whether a dominant characteristic of the publication was the undue
exploitation of sex. That would still have to be determined by the tribunals
before which the matter came and in the present case the answers must be in the
affirmative.

The appeals should be dismissed.

Taschereau
J. (dissenting):—I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
written by the Chief Justice and I substantially agree with his reasons, and
concur in the conclusions that he has reached. I wish to add only a few
personal observations.

The original edition of Lady
Chatterley's Lover was first published in Italy in 1928. The other editions
that were published were expurgated and what was thought to be objectionable
was removed from the book. About thirty years later an unexpurgated edition was
published, and in November 1959, several copies of this last edition were
seized on the strength of a complaint laid under s. 150A  of the Criminal
Code  as amended. His Honour Judge Fontaine of the Court of the Sessions of
the Peace sitting in Montreal, ordered these books to be forfeited as being
obscene, and the Court of Queen's Bench4 unanimously upheld the decision of the
trial judge and dismissed the appeal.

[Page 689]

The main section of art. 150  of
the Criminal Code  with which we are concerned is s. 150(8)  which was
enacted in 1959 and which reads as follows:

(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant
characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one
or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence,
shall be deemed to be obscene.

Before the enactment of this
section the law was far from being clear and left the door open to subtle
distinctions, to fine niceties, that too often allowed publishers to continue a
wide diffusion of obscene and immoral literature. It is common knowledge that
the 1959 amendment was to eliminate the distribution of obscene material and to
call a halt to what may be rightly termed legalized assault against morality.
The aim of the Act was without doubt to clean up all news stands of this lewd,
filthy literature, published surely not to serve the public good but merely for
pecuniary gain. I give a cold reception to the suggestion that, if the book is
banned, our Courts will be the only ones to hold in such a way. This Court does
not make the law but its duty is to apply it as enacted by Parliament. The
decisions rendered in England, France and the United States are entirely
immaterial for the determination of the case at bar. Our law enacted in 1959 is
substantially different, and the decision of R. v. Hicklin5
which was formerly applied in England and Canada is no longer, for the
purpose of this case, the law of the land.

The question which is to be solved
is the following: Do we find that there is in this publication a dominant
characteristic which is the undue exploitation of sex? If so, the
book is deemed to be obscene. I find it unnecessary to determine whether
s. 150(8)  is exhaustive or not. It is sufficient, I think, to say that if we
find in the book a dominant characteristic which is the undue exploitation of
sex, it must be banned. The law says a dominant and not the dominant
characteristic. Moreover I believe that, without deciding as to its legality or
illegality, too much weight has been attached to the expert evidence which has
been adduced. The lawful or unlawful circulation of a book cannot be
conditioned by the subjective tastes or propensities of witnesses, whatever may
be their literary aptitudes. A more objective legal aspect of the question has
to be considered.

[Page 690]

This book is the story of an upper
class Englishman who came back paralyzed from the first world war. He operated
his coal mines and occasionally wrote novels particularly noteworthy for their
mediocrity. His wife, Constance, is dissatisfied and frustrated. After having
refused the suggestion of her husband to have a child with one of his friends,
which he would recognize as his own, she meets Mellors, the game keeper, who,
in Lawrence's mind, is the archetype of the ""natural man"". He is an
offspring of the labour class and is quite intellectually independent.
Constance and Mellors then start an intimate relationship, and when she becomes
pregnant, she decides to divorce Chatterley and marry the game keeper.

The author then minutely describes
with unholy satisfaction more than fifteen adulterous scenes in the hen-house,
the brush wood of the nearby fields, or the living quarters of the game keeper.
Nothing is left even to the most vivid imagination. All the episodes are
brutally described, and the conversation between the two lovers is of a low and
vulgar character. Words are used that no decent person would dare speak
without, in my view, offending the moral sense of anyone who believes in the
ordinary standards of decency, self-respect and dignity.

It is said on behalf of the book
that there are three principal characteristics which distinguish this novel:

1. That it is an attack on
industrialism and its evils in England;

2. The emphasis on ""blood knowledge"" rather than
""mind knowledge"";

3. The redeeming power of love when sex is treated as
something beautiful and holy.

It has also been argued that this
novel is placed in a setting which emphasizes its literary qualities and it is
praised as a significant work of a major English novelist. I must say that I
believe that this book has been over-glorified. Lawrence may have given many
fine contributions to English literature; he may have been stamped as a classic
of our modern times, but all the beautiful things that he may have written
cannot legalize what the law forbids. He has, of course, a great gift for
description, for setting forth in words what is the product of his fertile
imagination, but

[Page 691]

all the art he unfolds does not
change the nature of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"". I never thought that
the frame could make the picture.

Even if, as argued, this book were
a work of art, I think that art can co-exist with obscenity and does not
exclude it. A nudity is not an obscenity. The great museums of the world are
filled with paintings of the human body, and it would be a nonsense to hold the
view that Rembrandt, Leonardo de Vinci, Michel-Ange, Raphaël or Renoir have
painted obscenities. There is nothing in those masterpieces which is offensive
to modesty or decency, or that expresses or suggests lewd thoughts, as
""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" does.

It is my view, that if any
industrial ills have existed or do exist now in England, and that if there are
conflicts between capital and labour, the solution of the problem cannot be
found in Lawrence's book. The evidence does not reveal the results obtained by
the publication of the book, and there is nothing to indicate that this
so-called palliative has even momentarily relieved the ills that Lawrence
thought affected the British Isles. In order to improve the social conditions
in England, if they have to be improved, I have more faith and hope in sound
legislation enacted by Parliament, than in the adulterous scenes described by
Lawrence in his book.

Whether the emphasis should be
placed on ""blood knowledge"" or ""mind knowledge"", in order
to purify the social atmosphere of England, or whether sex should be treated as
something beautiful and holy in order to become the redeeming power of love,
are ideologies that may possibly be the guides of future generations. The
diffusion of these patriotic ideas, cherished by Lawrence, are surely not
forbidden by law. What in my view is objectionable, is not the aim pursued by
the author, although I find it an illusory promise of future happiness, but the
means employed for the demonstration of his thesis.

He relies on sex and adultery to
dissolve the clouds of social evils that he believes are hanging over the skies
of England. In doing so, he violates, I think, s. 150(8)  of the Criminal
Code , and I am convinced that we must necessarily find in the book ""an
undue exploitation of sex"", which is ""a dominant"" characteristic
of the work. ""Undue"" in the ordinary English language means of course
""unreasonable"",

[Page 692]

""unjustifiable"". It
conveys the idea that what is said goes beyond what is appropriate or necessary
to prove the proposition that one endeavours to demonstrate to the public. I know
of no one capable of finding words or imagining scenes that could be added to
this publication to make it more obscene. Over three-quarters of the book, or
250 pages deal with filthy, obscene descriptions that are offensive to decency,
and entirely unnecessary for what we have been told is the purpose of the book.
Nobody would seriously think that this novel could be shown on television or
that any respectable publisher would make available to the public in a
newspaper or a magazine the complete story of ""Lady Chatterley's
Lover"", without shocking the feelings of normal citizens. I am not aware
that obscenity is, under the law, the exclusive prerogative of novelists,
whatever may be their outstanding talent.

I have no hesitation in reaching
the conclusion that the book comes clearly within the ban of the Act, and that
the three appeals should be dismissed.

Locke
J. (dissenting):—In my opinion this book is an obscene
publication, as that term is defined in subs. (8) of s. 150  of the Criminal
Code .

I would, therefore, dismiss these
appeals.

Cartwright
J.:—The course of the proceedings in the courts below is set out in the
reasons of other members of the Court.

In opening the appeals in this
Court counsel for the appellants submitted that subs. (8) of s. 150  of the Criminal
Code  now contains an exhaustive definition of the word ""obscene""
for all purposes of the Criminal Code  and that a publication cannot be
held to be obscene unless it falls within the terms of that subsection. Counsel
for the Crown in answer to a question from the bench stated that he agreed with
this submission and consequently counsel for the appellants was not required to
deal further with it in reply.

The orders of forfeiture made by
the learned Judge of first instance are analogous to convictions of a criminal
offence and I do not think that this Court should inquire whether those orders
might be supported on a view of the law which counsel for the Crown expressly
disclaimed. We should, I think, dispose of the appeals on the basis upon which
they were presented to us by all counsel and treat the definition

[Page 693]

of the word ""obscene""
contained in s. 150(8)  as exhaustive. I wish, however, to reserve my opinion as
to the true construction of that subsection in case it should be called in
question in the future.

On the assumption that the
definition is exhaustive, for the reasons given by my brother Judson I agree
with his conclusion that the book in question is not obscene.

I would dispose of the appeals as
proposed by my brother Judson.

Fauteux
J. (dissenting):—This appeal calls for the determination of two
questions. The first, one of law, being what constitutes an obscene publication
under the Criminal Code  of Canada and the other, one of fact, whether
the publication here impeached is obscene under the Code.

Until at least the 1959
amendments, hereafter considered, the Criminal Code  did not give any
definition of ""obscenity"" and for nearly a hundred years, from 1868
to 1959, the Canadian Courts, following the Courts in England, have been guided
by the rule laid down in R. v. Hicklin6. On this
century-old case, the test of obscenity is ""whether the tendency of the
matter charged with obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are
open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort
may fall."" R. v. Stroll7; R. v. National News8;
and R. v. American News9 are, prior to 1959, the more
recent applications of this test by the Canadian Courts.

In 1959, the provisions of the Criminal
Code , appearing under the sub-heading ""Offences Tending to Corrupt
Morals"", were amended by 7-8 Elizabeth II, c. 41, by the addition of subs.
(8) to s. 150  and the further addition of a new section, namely, 150A,
providing the latter, as is the case under the English law, a preventive
measure forestalling the dissemination of obscene publications. While the
proceedings leading to this appeal are taken under the

[Page 694]

preventive provisions, the
substantive law as to obscenity appears in s. 150  which, as amended and
applicable to this case, reads as follows:

150. (1) Every one commits an offence who

(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes,
circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication,
distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model,
phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or

(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or
has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation, a crime comic.

(2) Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without lawful
justification or excuse,

(a) sells, exposes to public view or has in his
possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture, model,
phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,

(b) publicly exhibits a disgusting object or an
indecent show,

(c) offers to sell, advertises, publishes an
advertisement of, or has for sale or disposal any means, instructions,
medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a method of preventing
conception or causing abortion or miscarriage, or

(d) advertises or publishes an advertisement of any
means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a
method for restoring sexual virility or curing venereal diseases or diseases of
the generative organs.

(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this
section if he establishes that the public good was served by the acts that are
alleged to constitute the offence and that the acts alleged did not extend
beyond what served the public good.

(4) For the purposes of this section it is a question of law
whether an act served the public good and whether there is evidence that the
act alleged went beyond what served the public good, but it is a question of
fact whether the acts did or did not extend beyond what served the public good.

(5) For the purposes of this section the motives of an
accused are irrelevant.

(6) Where an accused is charged with an offence under
subsection (1) the fact that the accused was ignorant of the nature or presence
of the matter, picture, model, phonograph record, crime comic or other thing by
means of or in relation to which the offence was committed is not a defence to
the charge.

(7) In this section, ""crime comic"" means a
magazine, periodical or book that exclusively or substantially comprises matter
depicting pictorially

(a) the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, or

(b) events connected with the commission of crimes,
real or fictitious, whether occurring before or after the commission of the
crime.

(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant
characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one
or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence,
shall be deemed to be obscene.

[Page 695]

The primary question to be
determined as to the law is whether, as contended for on behalf of appellants
and conceded by Crown counsel in answer to a question from the Bench, the
provisions of subs. (8) purport to be a definition and an exhaustive definition
of obscene publication. If this be the case, henceforth the Hicklin test
and all the Canadian and English jurisprudence thereunder are rendered obsolete
and subs. (8) becomes the only remaining provision where the constituent
elements of obscene publication may possibly be found and determined. With
deference, I may immediately say that I do not think this Court should rest the
decision of a question of law on an admission of counsel. This is specially so
in a case where, as here, the particular question assumes in this Court, as it
did in the Courts below, a primary influence in the disposition of the case and
where the same question has already been judicially considered and negatively
answered by a provincial Court of Appeal. In R. v. Munster10, the five members of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia in banco were unanimously of the opinion that subs. (8)
does not purport to be a definition of ""obscenity"" and that matters
not included in its provisions may yet become obscene under the Hicklin test.

The purport of the various
amendments successively made in recent years to the law related to obscenity
manifests the well publicized and commonly known intention of Parliament to
strike more effectively at the corruption of public morals by obscene
publications. Evincing such an intent are particularly the provisions of subs.
(8) of the 1959 amendments enacting that:

(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a
dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or
of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror,
cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.

The true significance of the terms here italicized must of
necessity be ascertained.

Generally, the predominant
characteristic of a publication is accepted as the determining feature of its
nature. It is also, in certain jurisdictions, only the predominant
characteristic of a publication which is relevant to the determination of the
specific question whether or not a publication is obscene. If that was a
possible view of the law in this

[Page 696]

country prior to the enactment of
subs. (8), no longer can this view obtain under the Criminal Code  of
Canada. The expression ""a dominant characteristic"" does not
have a meaning equating to that of the expression ""the dominant
characteristic"". Henceforth, sufficient it will be that one of the
prominent features of a publication be that described in subs. (8) to make it
an obscene publication under the Code.

The ascertainment of the true
meaning of the terms ""undue exploitation of sex"", in the context of
the subsection and in the broader context of the whole section, is not free
from difficulties. Standing alone, the word ""undue"" and the word
""exploitation"" are thus defined in The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary, the first:

Not appropriate or suitable; improper; unseasonable.
Unjustifiable, illegal. Going beyond what is appropriate, warranted or natural;
excessive. and the second:

The action of turning to account; the action of utilizing
for selfish purposes.

Read together, the first qualifying the second, these
words indicate that Parliament recognizes that, within some limits,
exploitation of sex in a publication is by no means illegal and never was
indeed so considered. Common in literature, moving pictures and other forms of
entertainment, and even in commercial publications, exploitation of sex, within
or beyond these limits, would entirely be banned by subs. (8) were it not for
the presence of the word ""undue"" in the provision. The word
""undue"" is thus effective and given full scope if the prevention of
such a result is truly the intended purpose and purport of the word. That this
may well be its true significance is suggested by its otherwise unbounded
vagueness and consequential ineffectiveness to indicate per se with any
degree of the certainty required in criminal matters, the limits beyond which
exploitation of sex in a publication is prohibited. On this view,
""undue"" is synonymous to ""illegal"", one of the dictionary
meanings ascribed thereto, and one then must and only has to refer to the other
provisions of s. 150 , which exhaustively states the substantive law of
obscenity, to ascertain the limits beyond which exploitation of sex in a
publication becomes illegal. Thus construed, the subsection still has scope to
bar the defence based on the contention that only the predominant
characteristic of a publication is to be considered

[Page 697]

and has also scope to import in
the concept of obscenity new subjects, namely, ""crime, horror, cruelty and
violence"". On this construction, exploitation of sex is illegal or undue
if it has a, tendency to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such
immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall,
unless it is shown (i) that the public good is served by the publication and
(ii) that the exploitation of sex does not extend beyond what serves the public
good.

Another view of the matter, with
which I am in agreement, is that the enactment of subs. (8) is effective to
expand the meaning of ""obscenity"" so as to include a publication a
dominant characteristic of which is exploitation of sex, if, having regard to
the existing standards of decency in the community, such an exploitation is
shocking and disgusting, though not necessarily shown to have the tendency to
corrupt or deprave.

I am unable, however, to accept
the submission made on behalf of appellants that subs. (8) purports to be an
exhaustive definition of an obscene publication. The merit of this contention
is conditioned by the true significance, in the context, of the words ""shall
be deemed to be obscene"". The expression ""shall be deemed to be""
does not necessarily purport to define. The word ""deemed"" is not
inflexible. In R. v. Norfolk County Council11, Cave J. said at page 380:

Generally speaking, when you talk of a thing being deemed to
be something, you do not mean to say that it is that which it is to be deemed
to be. It is rather an admission that it is not what it is to be deemed to be,
and that, notwithstanding it is not that particular thing, nevertheless …. it
is to be deemed to be that thing.

Our Criminal Code offers many illustrations of a
like significance being given by Parliament to the word ""deemed"" or
the expression ""shall be deemed"". One example will suffice. A person
who, with intent to commit an indictable offence, obtains entrance in a
building by threat or artifice or by collusion with a person within, does not,
in any sense, break and enter. Yet, by force of a legal fiction introduced in
s. 294(b)(i), a person entering a building by either one of the means therein
mentioned, ""shall be deemed to have broken and entered"" for the
purposes of s. 292. It has never been nor can it be suggested that these
provisions of s. 294 purport to define breaking and entering in the true

[Page 698]

sense or in a manner excluding the
ordinary meaning attending breaking and entering under s. 292; they simply
provide that entrance in either one of the circumstances above shall be
considered to be breaking and entering. Likewise, Parliament in enacting the
provisions of subs. (8), for the purposes of criminal law, resorted to a legal
fiction by the force of which (i) the nature of a publication is no longer to
be determined exclusively by its predominant characteristic, and (ii) subjects
hitherto foreign to the colloquial or legal meaning of obscenity, namely,
""crime, horror, cruelty and violence"", are henceforth, when
associated with sex, made subjects relevant to the legal concept of obscenity
as related to publication. Clearly, with respect to these new matters, the
expression ""shall be deemed"" has a like significance to the one
attending the same expression in s. 294 Cr.  . Qualifying as it does the whole
and only phrase of the subsection, under no rule of construction can this
expression be held to have one significance with respect to some of and another
with respect to the other matters dealt with in the provision. I find it
impossible to hold that Parliament intended, by this enactment, to put beyond
the reach of the law a publication having, because of exploitation of sex, the
tendency described under the Hicklin test. In my respectful opinion, the
subsection does not, either in expressed terms or by clear implication, evince
any intention of Parliament to alter the century-old law of obscenity—with
which Parliament is presumed to have been acquainted at the time of the
enactment—otherwise than by specifically adding thereto that when the
particular circumstances described in this amendment are present in a
publication, such publication ""shall be deemed to be obscene"".

For all these reasons, I would say
that, while subs. (8) is effective to expand the law of obscenity, it does not
purport to be a definition of obscenity excluding the definition of the Hicklin
test and all the Canadian and English jurisprudence in application of that
case.

In the consideration of the book
here impeached, one is naturally conscious that criminal law is not meant to
operate in the abstract field of speculation but in the field

[Page 699]

of concrete factual realities. One
is also particularly-reminded that, as stated by Lord Goddard C.J. in Reiter,
Carter, Gaywood Press Limited et al.12:

When it is being considered whether books have a tendency to
deprave and corrupt, naturally every body's mind turns to the depraving and
corrupting of young people into whose hands they may fall.

Allured by the conspicuous indication on the cover of this
book that the particular edition thereof is unexpurgated, juveniles buying
pocket-books thus advertised—it is not unreasonable to think—have a dim
interest in the literary merits, motives or purposes of the writer. Whether the
reading of this book will have upon them or other classes of juveniles the
tendency to deprave or corrupt them cannot be determined by the minute process
of analysis which experts in the art of literature may adopt to lift out of the
book the motives, purposes and literary qualities of its author. An ultimate
consideration of substance is the impact which the reading of this book may
exert upon their mind and whether depravation and corruption, against which
Parliament intends to protect them, may ensue therefrom. This edition of the
book contains no less than fifteen pornographic and adulterous episodes which
decency has always forbidden ministerial or judicial officers to recite
textually in the written opinion they gave as to its character. This edition is
accurately described in the following excerpt from the interdiction pronounced
in respect thereto by the United States Postmaster-General:

The book is replete with descriptions in minute detail of sexual
acts engaged in or discussed by the book's principal characters. These
descriptions utilize filthy, offensive and degrading words and terms. Any
literary merit the book may have is far outweighed by the pornographic and
smutty passages and words, so that the book, taken as a whole, is an obscene
and filthy work.

Whether admissible or not, expert evidence, so much relied
on by appellants, as to the literary merit of Lawrence's works, is clearly
ineffective to change this view of the book. The unexpurgated edition speaks
for itself. While, generally, evidence of experts in literature is relevant to
the literary merit of a publication, it has been excluded under the Hicklin jurisprudence
as irrelevant to the question whether a publication has a tendency to deprave
or corrupt. There does not appear to be any valid reason why this rule should

[Page 700]

vary with respect to the question
whether, having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community,
the exploitation of sex, which is here a dominant characteristic of the
publication, has been carried to a shocking and disgusting point. Whatever be
the outstanding position held by Lawrence as a writer, this book offers no
evidence that an expert in literature necessarily qualifies, for that reason,
as a custos mores.

Whether one applies the law as it
stood prior to or as expanded by the 1959 amendments, I am in respectful
agreement with the unanimous conclusion reached in the two Courts below that
this unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover is an obscene publication
under the Criminal Code  of Canada.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland
and Judson JJ. was delivered by

Judson
J.:—The proceedings against this book, Lady Chatterley's Lover, by D. H.
Lawrence, were taken under s. 150A  of the Criminal Code  enacted in 1959.
A Judge, on an information laid by a police officer, issued a warrant of
seizure for copies of the book on certain premises and then issued a summons to
the occupiers requiring them to appear before the Court and show cause why the
matter seized should not be forfeited to Her Majesty. The owners of the
premises appeared at the trial to show cause in the Court of Sessions of the
Peace for the District of Montreal. This Court, on June 10, 1960, declared that
the publication was obscene and made an order directing the forfeiture of the
seized copies in accordance with s. 150A , subs. (4), of the Code. This judgment
was unanimously affirmed on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench13 on April 7, 1961. On May 29, 1961, this Court
granted leave to appeal and declared that the leave was granted at large.

In 1959 a new definition of
""obscenity' was introduced into the Criminal Code  of Canada by the
enactment of subs. (8) of s. 150 . This reads:

For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant
characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one
or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty, and
violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.

[Page 701]

This section is before this Court
for the first time. It is enacted for the purposes of the Act not merely for
the purposes of the section in which it appears, which is s. 150 . It applies to
proceedings for the seizure of a book under s. 150A  and, in my opinion, in
which I am in agreement with Casey J. in the Court of Queen's Bench, it
precludes the application of any other test and specifically the one that had
been applied in R. v. Hicklin14,
and followed in R. v. American News15;
R. v. National News16;
and R. v. Stroll17.
The Hicklin test was ""whether the tendency of the matter
charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to
such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may
fall."" All the jurisprudence under the Hicklin definition is
rendered obsolete by the enactment of the new and exclusive definition of
obscenity contained in subs. (8) of s. 150 . Under this definition it must be
found that all four elements of obscenity are present before there can be a
condemnation of the book. There must be a characteristic which is dominant and
this dominant characteristic must amount to an exploitation of sex which is
undue. If any of these elements is missing, the charge fails.

The matter is, of course, one of
great importance. A writer who faces a charge of obscenity is entitled to know
by what standard his work is to be judged and what defence, if any, he is
called upon to make. Under the Criminal Code , as amended in 1959, there
is no double standard, that is to say (1) the statutory definition intended to
strike down the obvious, and (2), the Hicklin test still in the
background, although unstated in the Code, for those works that are not within
the statutory definition. If there is to be a double standard, it must be
expressly set out in the Code and I would disapprove of R. v. Munster18, where, in sending the case back for a
new trial, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco held that there was
error when the magistrate directed himself exclusively according to s. 158(8) 
on the ground that the subsection does not purport to be a definition of what
is obscene and because matter not included with its provisions may be obscene
under the Hicklin test.

[Page 702]

If a result such as this is to be
brought about the legislation must define the two standards of obscenity and
tell the Court that the charge is proved if the work offends either standard. I
note that this is the way that the New Zealand legislation is framed, Re
Lolita19,
and also the Australian legislation, although not so clearly, as considered
in Wavish v. Associated Newspapers Ltd.20;
MacKay v. Gordon & Gotch (Australasia) Ltd.21; and Kyte-Powell v. Heinemann Ltd.22. Otherwise, why define obscenity for
the purposes of the Act, if it is still permissible for the Court to take a
definition of the crime formulated 100 years ago and one that has proved to be
vague, difficult and unsatisfactory to apply?

In contrast, I think that the new
statutory definition does give the Court an opportunity to apply tests which
have some certainty of meaning and are capable of objective application and
which do not so much depend as before upon the idiosyncrasies and sensitivities
of the tribunal of fact, whether judge or jury. We are now concerned with a
Canadian statute which is exclusive of all others.

The inquiry then must begin with a
search for a dominant characteristic of the book. The book may have other
dominant characteristics. It is only necessary to prove that the undue
exploitation of sex is a dominant characteristic. Such an inquiry necessarily
involves a reading of the whole book with the passages and words to which
objection is taken read in the context of the whole book. Of that now there can
be no doubt. No reader can find a dominant characteristic on a consideration of
isolated passages and isolated words. Under this definition the book now must
be taken as a whole. It is not the particular passages and words in a certain
context that are before the Court for judgment but the book as a complete work.
The question is whether the book as a whole is obscene not whether certain
passages and certain words, part of a larger work, are obscene.

A search for a dominant
characteristic of the book also involves an inquiry into the purpose of the
author. What was he trying to do, actually doing, and intending to do? Had he a
serious literary purpose or was his purpose one

[Page 703]

of base exploitation? There is no
doubt that English jurisprudence has rejected under the Hicklin test any
evidence that the author or others may wish to give of a book's literary or
artistic merit as distinct from scientific value. One cannot ascertain a
dominant characteristic of a book without an examination of its literary or
artistic merit and this, in my opinion, renders admissible the evidence of the
author and others on this point. Evidence concerning literary and artistic
merit has been excluded in England on the ground of irrelevancy and a supposed
rule excluding evidence of opinion on the very fact which is before the Court
for decision. Wigmore's opinion is that there never was any basis for such a
general rule (3rd ed., s. 1921).

The test of the admissibility of
this kind of opinion evidence under the present definition in the Code must be
whether it is relevant to the determination of a dominant characteristic in the
book. I can well understand that some judges and juries might think that such
evidence would not help them to a decision and that others might be of the
opposite opinion. I would join the second group. I can read and understand but
at the same time I recognize that my training and experience have been, not in
literature, but in law and I readily acknowledge that the evidence of the
witnesses who gave evidence in this case is of real assistance to me in
reaching a conclusion.

The evidence in this case is all
one way. The Crown rested its case on the mere production of the book. Oral
evidence was given by Mr. Hugh MacLennan and Mr. Morley Callaghan on the
literary and artistic merit of the book and the position of Lawrence in the
world of English literature. A third witness who gave oral evidence was Mr.
Harry T. Moore, a teacher and critic. Many reviews were also filed written by
outstanding literary critics in the United States. There is real unanimity in
their opinions that the book is a true and sincere representation of an aspect
of life as it appeared to the author. No objection was taken to the
admissibility of this evidence. The Crown asked for two or three adjournments
for the purpose of refuting it but produced no such evidence. It was then that
objection was taken to its admissibility. Even if objection had been taken at
the time of its tender, I would hold that it was admissible for the purposes
that I have stated.

[Page 704]

Lawrence had certain opinions
about the organization of modern industrial society and its effect upon the
relations between man and woman. He chose to express these opinions in a work
of imagination, written about an adulterous relationship between the wife of an
impotent man of property and that man's servant. Whether his choice of medium
was a good choice for the preaching of his ideas and whether the ideas
themselves were foolish and wrong-headed are matters upon which there may be a
difference of opinion. But a theme of adultery, and what to some readers—and there
must be many of these—appears to be a stilted assertion that there exists an
important connection between the organization of an industrial society and the
sexual relations between man and woman, do not, in themselves, give the book a
dominant characteristic condemned by the section of the Code.

This novel is a complex piece of
writing. It is, in part, but only in part, the story of the development of the
relationship between the man and the woman and an outspoken description of
their sexual relations. This could be described as a dominant characteristic of
the book although such a description could be criticized as an
over-simplification. The objectionable characteristic is, of course, to be
found in the explicit description and the four letter words. With these
qualities, the question is, as I have already stated, whether the book as a
whole has a dominant characteristic of undue exploitation of sex.

The phrase ""undue
exploitation"" suggests, at first sight, an element of tautology but I do
not think that this is a sound view. There is a difference between a statute
which condemns a book a dominant characteristic of which is the exploitation of
sex and one which condemns the undue exploitation of the theme. The use of the
word ""undue"" recognizes that some exploitation of the theme is of
common occurrence. What I think is aimed at is excessive emphasis on the theme
for a base purpose. But I do not think that there is undue exploitation if
there is no more emphasis on the theme than is required in the serious treatment
of the theme of a novel with honesty and uprightness. That the work under
attack is a serious work of fiction is to me beyond question. It has none of
the characteristics that are often described in judgments dealing with
obscenity—dirt for dirt's sake, the leer of the sensualist, depravity in the

[Page 705]

mind of an author with an
obsession for dirt, pornography, an appeal to a prurient interest, etc. The
section recognizes that the serious-minded author must have freedom in the
production of a work of genuine artistic and literary merit and the quality of
the work, as the witnesses point out and common sense indicates, must have real
relevance in determining not only a dominant characteristic but also whether
there is undue exploitation. I agree with the submission of counsel for the
appellant that measured by the internal necessities of the novel itself, there
is no undue exploitation.

Counsel for the appellant also
submits that if ""undueness"" is to be measured by the usages of
contemporary novelists and writers, then this book cannot be condemned. Mr.
Callaghan and Mr. MacLennan both gave evidence on this point, which is really
directed to standards of acceptance prevailing in the community. No matter what
form of words may be used, I doubt whether any tribunal, whether judge or jury,
can get very far in an obscenity case without being influenced, either
consciously or unconsciously, by considerations such as these. The only
judicial examination of ""undue exploitation"" or ""undue
emphasis"" that I have found is in Australia and New Zealand. As I have
already stated the New Zealand legislation begins by telling the court what
matters are to be taken into consideration in determining whether a publication
is indecent. Then four standards are set out, some of which undoubtedly suggest
the Hicklin test. Finally, the next section says: ""Subject to the
provisions of the last preceding section any document or matter which unduly
emphasizes matters of sex, horror, crime, cruelty or violence shall be deemed to
be indecent within the meaning of this Act.""

The first consideration of
""undue emphasis"" appears in the judgment of Fullagar J. in R. v.
Close23.
To me it is very impressive. He said at p. 465:

There does exist in any community at all times—however the standard
may vary from time to time—a general instinctive sense of what is decent and
what is indecent, of what is clean and what is dirty, and when the distinction
has to be drawn, I do not know that today there is any better tribunal than a
jury to draw it. … I am very far from attempting to lay down a model direction,
but a judge might perhaps, in the case of a

[Page 706]

novel, say something like this: ""It would not be true
to say that any publication dealing with sexual relations is obscene. The
relations of the sexes are, of course, legitimate matters for discussion
everywhere. … There are certain standards of decency which prevail in the
community, and you are really called upon to try this case because you are
regarded as representing, and capable of justly applying, those standards. What
is obscene is something which offends against those standards.""

Offence against the standards of
the community as a test of ""undueness"" as outlined by Fullagar J.
seems to have been accepted in subsequent cases in Australia and New Zealand
although it has not been considered by the High Court of Australia. The
principle has not escaped criticism as judicial legislation (24 Mod. L.R. 768).
I am not satisfied that the criticism is altogether valid. Surely the choice of
courses is clear-cut. Either the judge instructs himself or the jury that
undueness is to be measured by his or their personal opinion—and even that must
be subject to some influence from contemporary standards—or the instruction
must be that the tribunal of fact should consciously attempt to apply these
standards. Of the two, I think that the second is the better choice.

But no matter whether the question
of ""undue exploitation"" is to be measured by the internal necessities
of the novel itself or by offence against community standards, my opinion is
firm that this novel does not offend. I would allow the appeals and dismiss the
charge and direct that the seized copies of the book be returned to their
owners.

Ritchie
J.:—The course of these proceedings in the Courts below is set out in
the reasons of other members of the Court and the relevant sections of the Criminal
Code  are reproduced in full in the reasons of the Chief Justice so that it
would be superfluous for me to reiterate them.

While I agree that this appeal
should be disposed of in the manner proposed by my brother Judson, I do not
share his opinion that the language of s. 150(8)  constitutes an exclusive
definition of ""obscenity"" for the purposes of the Criminal Code  and
in spite of the fact that Crown counsel argued the appeal on this basis I find
it necessary to express the contrary view.

[Page 707]

In finding this publication to be
obscene, the learned trial judge did not consider himself to be confined to the
test of obscenity provided by s. 150(8)  and felt free to consider also the
standard set by Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin24, when he said:

… the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the
matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are
open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this
sort may fall

While affirming the decision at
trial, Mr. Justice Casey in the Court of Queen's Bench25 stated himself to be convinced of the soundness of
the appellants' argument to the effect that the provisions of s. 150(8)  exclude
all other tests of obscenity formerly used, and, as has been indicated, it was
on this basis that the present appeal was argued by counsel for both parties
before this Court.

Section 150(8)  provides that:

For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant
characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one
or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence,
shall be deemed to be obscene.

With the greatest respect for
those who hold a different view, I am unable to construe the language of this
section as meaning that no publication can be obscene for the purpose of the Criminal
Code  unless it has undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic.
On the contrary, I share the opinion expressed by Ilsley C.J. in R. v.
Munster26,
when he said of this section at p. 159: ""It does not purport to be a
definition of 'obscene'. Matter not included in its provisions may be
obscene.""

The words ""shall be
deemed"" have a variable meaning depending upon the context in which they
occur, but although they are employed in more than thirty separate instances in
the Criminal Code  and are used in many other statutes, I have been
unable to find any case holding that when it is provided that a given set of
circumstances ""shall be deemed"" for the purposes of the Act in
question to fall into a certain category, Parliament is to be taken to have
intended to exclude from that category all circumstances which would otherwise
have been included in it.

[Page 708]

In the Criminal Code  the
expression ""shall be deemed"" is frequently used to extend the meaning
of a word or phrase so that it is to be treated for the purposes of the Act or
a section of the Act as connoting matters which would not otherwise necessarily
be considered as coming within its ordinary and accepted meaning (e.g., ss.
3(2) , 5A(4) , 38(2) , 41(2) , 42(3) , 269(5) , 294 (b) and 371(1)  and as to the
extension of territorial jurisdiction, s. 419 ). In my view, it is in this sense
that the expression is used in s. 150(8) .

Sections 150  and 150A  are found in
Part IV of the Criminal Code  which bears the heading ""SEXUAL
OFFENCES, PUBLIC MORALS AND DISORDERLY CONDUCT"" and the sub-heading
directly preceding s. 150  reads ""OFFENCES TENDING TO CORRUPT
MORALS"". These headings afford some indication of the fact that this
legislation was initially enacted for the purpose of protecting society against
the corruption of public morals by the publication of obscene material, and
before the enactment of s. 150(8)  the Hicklin test was widely accepted
as the only yardstick by which obscenity was to be measured. But corruption of
morals is only one harmful aspect of the publication of obscene material, and
the Hicklin test leaves out of account publications which are obscene in
the sense of being offensive and shocking to the community standards of decency
unless they can also be said to have a tendency to deprave and corrupt. Under
that test Stable J. in my opinion correctly instructed the jury in R. v. Martin
Secker Warburg, Limited27,
when he said:

The charge is not that the tendency of the book is either to
shock or to disgust. That is not a criminal offence. The charge is that the
tendency of the book is to corrupt and deprave.

In my opinion the enactment of s.
150(8)  had the effect of expanding the meaning of ""obscene"" for the
purposes of the Criminal Code  to include all publications which have
undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic whether or not they can
be shown to have a tendency to corrupt and deprave and thus of protecting the
public against the shocking and disgusting in addition to the depraving and
corrupting aspects of obscenity. In my view it is in this sense that the word
""undue"" is employed in s. 150(8)  and it carries the meaning of
""undue having regard to the existing standards of decency in the
community.""

[Page 709]

I do not think that this Court is
bound by, nor would I follow, those authorities which have tended to construe
the Hicklin definition as meaning that literature available to the
community is to be limited by the standard of what is considered to be suitable
reading material for adolescents, but I do think that in discharging his duty
under s. 150A  if a judge is satisfied that the publication before him is likely
to have a lowering effect on the moral fibre of adolescent boys and girls or of
any other significant segment of the community he would be justified in
declaring such a publication to be ""obscene"" even if it did not
contain all the ingredients specified in s. 150(8) . On the other hand, if the
judge is satisfied that the publication contains all those ingredients, that is
an end of the matter as far as he is concerned and he must make an order
""declaring it to be forfeited to Her Majesty in the Right of the Province
in which the proceedings take place."" (s. 150A(4)).

Under s. 150A the burden of
deciding whether the publication is likely to corrupt a significant segment of
the population and the burden of determining what is or what is not
""undue"" so as to offend community standards is placed upon the judge
before whom the publication is brought, and while it is true that his decision
in either case must be a subjective one and will of necessity be coloured in
some degree by his own predispositions on such questions, this is not a unique
position for a judge under our system of law, and under the Criminal Code  it
is he and he alone who must be ""satisfied that the publication is obscene
…."" if it is to be forfeited. It should be remembered, however, that these
sections of the Criminal Code  are enacted for the protection of the
public and obscenity is not to be determined by the fact that a publication may
offend the prude or excite the frustrated; it must be offensive to community
standards or be likely to deprave or corrupt a recognizable segment of the
public.

I agree with Mr. Justice Judson
that this inquiry necessarily involves the reading and consideration of the
publication as a whole and that it is not only relevant but desirable to
consider evidence of the opinions of qualified experts as to the artistic and
literary qualities of the publication.

[Page 710]

Having read the publication which
is now before us as a whole and having considered the evidence of the experts
called for the defence and the extensive, critical and other material having to
do with the book which has been filed, I have little doubt that D. H. Lawrence
deliberately selected sex as a dominant characteristic of ""Lady
Chatterley's Lover"" and that one of the chief messages which he sought to
convey was that there is nothing shameful or dirty about the natural functions
of the body and that the ultimate physical fulfilment of love between the sexes
is a thing of tenderness and beauty having no aspects of obscenity or
pornography. It may be said with justice that the author has, in several
isolated passages, employed language and depicted scenes which, standing alone,
unduly exploit sex, but the opinion is widely held by men of high literary
qualifications that this book as a whole constitutes an outstanding
contribution to 20th-century English literature and the passages to which I
refer must be regarded as an integral part of the wider theme. Although sex is
a dominant characteristic of the book and although there are isolated passages
which, when read alone, unduly exploit sex, it does not appear to me to follow
that these passages, read as a part of the whole book, have the effect of
making the undue exploitation which they contain a dominant characteristic of
the publication so as to bring it within the provisions of s. 150(8)  of the Criminal
Code . Nor do I think that any significant segment of the population is
likely to be depraved or corrupted by reading the book as a whole.

I agree with counsel for the
appellant that the defence of the public good is available under s. 150A and
while we are not required to pass judgment on the literary or artistic
qualities of the book or its author, it nevertheless seems to me that any
harmful effect which these objectionable passages might have upon those who
seek them out for separate reading is counterbalanced by the desirability of
preserving intact the work of a writer who, according to the only evidence
before us, is regarded as a great artist by teachers, authors and critics whose
opinion is entitled to respect.

I would allow these appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Bribery—Municipal
officials—Charge of attempt—Directed verdict of
acquittal—Evidence—Misdirection—Appeal against order granting new
trial—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 104(1)(b), (e), 584.

The accused H was reeve of the Township of
York and L was a councillor. They were jointly charged under s. 104(1)  of the
Criminal Code  for offering to accept a sum of money to aid in procuring the
passing of a measure, motion or resolution concerning the issue of a building
permit. A second count of indictment contained a separate charge against L of
accepting a sum of money for the same purpose. The evidence related to certain
conversations by M, president of a company, and P, a building contractor, with
the accused. The trial judge directed the jury to acquit on the ground that all
preparations had been made for the issue of the permit before the alleged
conversations had taken place, or before any money had been paid over to L. The
Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It is true that the permit was issued before
the passing of the bylaw but on the evidence it was issued after the
conversations had taken place and it was followed by the passing of the bylaw.
Although there was

[Page 466]

no express mention in the evidence of the
payment of money for the purpose of procuring a vote for the adoption of the
bylaw, the jury was entitled to look at the evidence as a whole—the preliminary
conversations, the issue of the permit and the subsequent passing of the bylaw
with the two accused voting for it. It was an error to isolate the vote from
the issue of the permit and there was, in these circumstances, evidence to go
to the jury on both counts.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, setting aside the verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial.
Appeal dismissed.

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., for the appellant
Linden.

E. Arthur Martin, Q.C., for the appellant
Hall.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—In the year 1956 the two appellants
were municipal officials of the Township of York, Frederick W. Hall being the
reeve and Harold D. Linden one of the councillors. They were jointly indicted
under s. 104(1)  of the Criminal Code  for offering to accept a sum of
money from one Neil J. May to aid in procuring the adoption of a measure,
motion or resolution concerning the issue of a building permit to him. The
second count of the indictment contains a separate charge against Harold D.
Linden of accepting from one Harry D. Payne a sum of money for the same
purpose. At the conclusion of the case for the Crown, on the motion of counsel
for the defence, the learned trial judge directed the jury to return a verdict
of not guilty on both counts. The Court of Appeal held that there was error in
so directing the jury, being unanimously of the opinion that there was some
evidence fit for submission to the jury on both counts. The two accused now
appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the
verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial.

The evidence on which the Court of Appeal acted
is set out in full in its reasons. I do not propose to repeat more than the
following brief summary.

Early in 1956 Neil J. May, the president and
sole shareholder of Carbide Tool Company Limited, decided to extend his factory
building in the Township of York. He first discussed a building permit with the
Township Engineer and, on March 6, 1956, he completed the filing of the
necessary

[Page 467]

documents for the issue of the permit. On March
8, he entered into a building contract with Harry D. Payne for the construction
of the building.

On March 12, at a meeting of the Committee of
General Purposes of the township, May’s application for the permit was approved
subject to a ten-foot set-back of the north wall of the proposed building from
the neighbouring lands. On March 19, the next meeting of the Committee of
General Purposes took place. In the meantime May secured the consent of the
owners of the neighbouring lands to the erection of the building as shown on
the original plans. At this meeting of the Committee the application was
approved unanimously.

The general building by-law of the township provides as follows:

S. 4 A permit shall be obtained from the
Building Inspector by the owner or the legally authorized agent of the owner,
for the erection, alterations, reconstruction, removal or wrecking of, or
repairs to any (or part of any) building or structure.

S. 84 (aa) Notwithstanding anything in this
By-law contained, the Building Inspector shall not grant a permit for nor shall
any person erect, construct or alter, a building or structure within the
Township of York to be used for the purpose of a factory,…unless and until the
plans and specifications have been first submitted to and been approved by
Council after a report thereon has been submitted to Council by the Building
Inspector and by the Chief of the Fire Department.

Evidence was given by the township solicitor
that the usual practice was to issue a building permit without waiting for the
passing of the by-law approving the minutes of the meeting of the Committee for
General Purposes, and that the passing of the by-law authorizing the permit was
regarded as a mere formality. The township engineer gave evidence to the same
effect.

On March 20, 1956, May applied to the township
office for his building permit and was told that it was not ready. On March 21,
May had a meeting with Hall in the latter’s office, having made the appointment
by telephone the day before. May says that at this meeting Hall solicited a
bribe and sent him on to see Linden, who also made the same suggestion. May
also says that Linden called Hall in his presence and discussed the issue of
the permit and stated that May understood what the position was. Following this
conversation, May spoke to his lawyer before he returned to

[Page 468]

speak to Hall. On the second interview with Hall
the township engineer was called in. He said that everything in connection with
the permit was in order. After the engineer had left Hall referred to the
arrangement which May had made with Linden and suggested that the money could
be left in the glove compartment of his car. He pointed out where the car was
parked. May also says that Hall, after a telephone conversation with the
building department, told him that the permit was ready and to go down to the
building department. May says that he did go down to the building department
but the permit was not ready and that he was told to pick it up the following
day. He did attend on the following day at the building inspector’s department
and the permit was delivered to him. May says that he did not give any money
either to Linden or to Hall. He had already spoken to a solicitor and
afterwards he and his solicitor interviewed the Assistant Crown Attorney.

Payne says that he did give the sum of $100 to
Linden for the issue of a permit.

Up to this time, of course, the authorizing
by-law had not been passed. There was nothing except the minute of the General
Purposes Committee and what was referred to as the general practice to support
the issue of the permit.

The grounds on which the learned trial judge directed
the jury to acquit both accused were as follows:

The evidence clearly indicates that
everything had been done as far as finalizing the preparation for the issuing
of the building permit or the authorizing of the issuing of the building
permit, before these alleged conversations took place with the two accused men,
or before any money was paid over to Linden, as is alleged.

So it could not have been paid or could not
have been promised for the purpose alleged against them, because the thing had
already been done, it could not have been agreed to be paid or paid for the
purpose of procuring the passage of a measure authorizing it.

The case for the prosecution is that it is open
to the jury to infer from the evidence that the two appellants made an offer to
accept money for assistance in obtaining a valid building permit and that this
necessarily involved the passing of a by-law upon which each was entitled to
vote and subsequently did in fact vote. I have outlined above the chronology of
the evidence until the building by-law was passed. May, as an applicant, was in
no position to demand of the building inspector that he issue a permit. It is
true that the permit was issued before the passing of the

[Page 469]

by-law but on this evidence it was issued after
the conversations between May and Hall and Linden and between Payne and Linden
had taken place and it was followed by the passing of the by-law. Although
there is no express mention in the evidence of the payment of money for the
purpose of procuring a vote for the adoption of the by-law, the jury is
entitled to look at the evidence as a whole—the preliminary conversations, the
issue of the permit and the subsequent passing of the by-law with the two
accused voting for it. It was error to isolate the vote from the issue of the
permit and there is, in these circumstances, evidence to go to the jury on both
counts.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Capital murder—Offence
committed in 1952—Prosecution in 1961—Evidence of children now grown up
supporting killing—Body never recovered—Whether jury properly
instructed—Jurisdiction of Appeal Court—Criminal Code , s. 597A  as enacted by
1960-61 (Can.), c. 44, s.11.

The accused was convicted in 1961 of the
capital murder of his wife in 1952. The accused, in 1952, was a married man
with five children then 12, 10, 8, 5 and 1½ years old. He was convicted on the
evidence of the three eldest children whose evidence indicated that their
mother had been murdered by their father. The wife’s body was never found. The
evidence given by the children at the trial in 1961 differed materially from
their stories as given in 1952. It was argued by the accused that the evidence
was an unsafe foundation for the conviction. The Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 470]

The contradicting story given by the children
in 1952 and their evidence given in 1961 raised a serious question of
credibility, but this was clearly and adequately put to the jury on evidence
that the children were under fear and intimidation in 1952. The jury was fully
seized of this matter and there could be no attack on the judge’s instruction
on this ground.

The children who gave evidence in 1961 were
testifying as people of mature intelligence to what they had observed as
children. Questions of weight and credibility in these circumstances were
entirely for the jury. It would have been wrong for the trial judge to warn the
jury that they must treat this evidence as though it had been given by children
of immature years and to have warned them of the special risk in acting on the
uncorroborated evidence of a young child, even when sworn.

When the charge is read as a whole, there was
no substance to the argument that the trial judge had failed to instruct the
jury to convict the accused of non-capital murder in case they had any doubt of
his having committed capital murder.

The Court of Appeal could only exercise its
jurisdiction to set aside the conviction on the ground that the evidence was an
unsafe foundation for conviction, if it found that the jury could not
reasonably have convicted of capital murder on the evidence. In this case, there
was very substantial evidence to go to the jury of planned and deliberate
murder, and it would have been unwarranted interference with the function of
the jury to substitute the finding of the Court of Appeal for that of the jury
on this point.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the conviction of the accused on a charge of capital
murder. Appeal dismissed.

C.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant was convicted in the
year 1961 of the capital murder of his wife committed in the year 1952. His
appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed by unanimous judgment and he now
appeals to this Court pursuant to s. 597 (a) of the Criminal Code  enacted
by 9-10 Elizabeth II, Chapter 44.

In 1952 the accused was a married man with five
small children. The three eldest were James, Margaret and Ann, then 12, 10 and
8 years old. There were two other children then 5 and 1½ years old. All these
children were living in a small, one-room cabin with their father and mother on
August 2, 1952, and the three eldest gave evidence in the year 1961 that would
show that their father had killed their mother early in the morning nine years
before.

[Page 471]

In 1952 the appellant was a farmer in the County
of Perth near Listowel. He had lost some of his farm buildings by fire and in
the summer of 1952 he went to work in a sawmill at Johnson’s Harbour, in a
remote part of the Bruce Peninsula, 15 to 20 miles south of Tobermory and 4½
miles in from the highway that runs between Wiarton and Tobermory. He first of
all occupied the small cabin as living quarters with three young men, who were
also working at the sawmill. His wife was still living on the farm 90 miles
away. During this period he began an adulterous association with a married
woman in Wiarton. She knew him as a widower with 5 children. When the school
term ended, the appellant brought his wife and 5 children to Johnson’s Harbour
and they all lived in the small, one-room cabin and for part of the time two of
the three young men also lived there. But some time before August 2, 1952, the
young men went home, leaving as occupants of the cabin Kendall, his wife and
the children. During this period he was continuing his association with the
married woman in Wiarton. It was also during this period that he made a visit
to his farm with this woman and made an attempt to get her installed as a
housekeeper with a neighbouring farmer with whom he had business dealings. When
he made this visit back to the farm his wife remained at Johnson’s Harbour with
the children.

The three elder children gave evidence of what
they saw during the early dawn of the day on which they left the cabin. This
day was August 2, 1952. The submissions on this appeal make some review of this
evidence necessary. Margaret said that she saw her father dragging the limp
body of her mother out of the cabin and past the window, that he rolled up two
blankets from the bed and took them out, that there was blood on the floor at
the foot of the bed and that subsequently, she found that the butcher knife was
missing, and that her father returned to the cabin a short time later and
mopped the floor.

Ann’s evidence is that she heard her mother cry,
“Arthur, please don’t”. She saw her father lay a knife with blood on it on the
table and then drag her mother out of the cabin and down the road. He returned
to the cabin and gathered up a bed sheet and some of her mother’s clothes and
the knife, wiped blood from the floor and left the cabin again. Her sister
Margaret put her hand over her mouth to keep her quiet.

[Page 472]

James, when he awakened, heard his mother cry,
“Don’t Art.” He saw his father drag the limp body of his mother out of the
cabin. He saw the bloody knife on the table and blood on the floor. His father
was wearing hip rubber boots. When the father returned to the cabin he wiped
the blood off the knife and off the floor. He also saw the father take bed
clothes away.

Margaret said she remained quiet because it had
been a strict family rule that the children would not get up or make any noise
until their parents called them. She placed her hand over her younger sister’s
mouth to prevent her from crying out. James said that he was too frightened to
make a noise because he was wondering if his father was going to come back and
“get the rest of them”.

After his return to the cabin the appellant got
the children out of bed, arranged their breakfast and went to work as usual. He
told Margaret that if anybody asked where her mother was she was to say that
she left on Thursday, which was two days before. On his return to the cabin
from his work at the sawmill the appellant put the children in the car and went
to Wiarton to the other woman. He moved in with her along with the 5 children,
of whom this woman had only seen one, on a previous occasion. Next day the
appellant returned to the cabin with his son James and a son of this woman to
collect some of his belongings. He left a note that he was leaving his
employment because he had to get in his flax harvest and had had family
troubles. There is evidence that on this Sunday, August 3, the wife’s purse,
which was the only one that she had with her, was still in the cabin. A few
days later both families moved back to the family farm in the County of Perth.
Some time later Kendall asked the owner of the sawmill to send his wife’s ring
which had been left in the cabin. Nothing was ever heard again of the
appellant’s wife.

There is evidence that the appellant spread word
in his neighborhood that his wife had left him for another man. Those
neighbours who gave evidence indicated disbelief in any such story. When one of
them made it clear to Kendall that he did not believe him, Kendall changed his
story and said that his wife had gone back to her mother. This neighbour then
telephoned the wife’s relatives, who came to inquire about her and reported the
matter to the police. The police made inquiries and searches but never found
the

[Page 473]

body. They also questioned the children at the
time but the children would not give any information about their mother’s
disappearance beyond the fact that she had gone away alone on the Thursday
before they left the cabin. One of them gave evidence in some detail of what
she was wearing at the time she left.

Ann was the first of the children who talked to
the police in 1961. She did so after a disagreement with her stepmother and
after leaving her father’s house. At this time the daughter Margaret was
married and living in Winnipeg. Ann telephoned her sister Margaret and told her
that she had informed the police of what had happened in 1952. James continued
to live with his father until after the preliminary hearing.

The contradiction between what the children said
in 1952 and what they said in 1961 raised a serious question of credibility.
This was clearly and adequately put to the jury on evidence that the children
were under fear and intimidation. They never discussed what they had seen among
themselves and they never mentioned it to any outside person until 1961. The
jury was fully seized of this matter and there could be no attack on the
judge’s instruction on this ground.

The substantial attack on the children’s
evidence was that the trial judge failed in his duty to warn the jury as to the
care with which such evidence should be weighed. The argument is that the
evidence of the children given when they were grown up suffers from the same
frailty which would have attached to it had they given their evidence as
children and that it could not be any stronger when given in 1961 than it would
have been if given in 1952.

The basis for the rule of practice which
requires the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the evidence
of a child, even when sworn as a witness, is the mental immaturity of the
child. The difficulty is fourfold: 1. His capacity of observation. 2. His
capacity of recollection. 3. His capacity to understand questions put and frame
intelligent answers. 4. His moral responsibility. (Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd
ed., para. 506.)

The last point, a sense of moral responsibility,
disappears when the children are of mature years and understand the duty to
speak the truth. When these children gave evidence they were respectively 21,
19 and 17 years of age. They were

[Page 474]

in the same position at that age as any other
witness. Their capacity of communication was likewise the same as that of any
other witness. It is quite clear that they were testifying as mature persons to
what they had observed as children. But they were not testifying to a routine
matter that had happened 9 years before. If they were telling the truth, what
they had seen must have made an indelible impression on their minds at the time
and must have been something that they could never forget. Again, the trial
judge clearly and adequately instructed the jury, if any such instruction was
needed, that these witnesses were mature witnesses testifying to something that
had happened 9 years before. Questions of weight and credibility in these circumstances
were entirely for the jury. It would, in my opinion, have been wrong for the
trial judge to warn the jury that they must treat this evidence as though it
had been given by children of immature years and to have warned them of the
special risk in acting on the uncorroborated evidence of a young child, even
when sworn. This would be a totally unwarranted and undesirable extension of
the rule of practice. The need for this special warning disappears when the
children give evidence as mature persons. It then becomes a matter of weight
and credibility for the jury.

In this case we do not, in fact, know what a
trial judge, sitting in 1952, would have done with the evidence of these
children. What we do know is that in 1961 they were fully competent, testifying
to recollections of revolting events that happened 9 years before and there was
ample instruction given on the question of credibility, testimonial capacity
and recollections.

I turn now to the submission that the learned
trial judge in his charge failed to direct the jury in express terms that if
they entertained any doubt between capital murder and non-capital murder, they
must give the accused the benefit of the doubt and convict of non-capital
murder only. Any force in this submission entirely disappears when the charge
is read as a whole. Counsel for the accused did not question the correctness of
the judge’s charge of capital murder. He told them correctly and clearly what
they must find beyond a reasonable doubt before they could convict of this
offence. He told them that if they entertained any reasonable doubt on any of
the ingredients of the offence, they must acquit of capital murder. He told
them correctly what

[Page 475]

they had to find to bring in a verdict of
non-capital murder and told them correctly that if they entertained a
reasonable doubt on this, they must acquit. When read as a whole there could be
no doubt left in the jury’s mind that if they entertained a reasonable doubt on
capital murder but still found that the accused intended to kill his wife or
meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew to be likely to cause death and was
reckless whether death ensued or not, they must find non-capital murder, and
that if they entertained any reasonable doubt on either score, they must acquit.
There is no substance to this objection.

It was also submitted that this is a case where
the Court of Appeal should have exercised its jurisdiction to set aside the
conviction because of an irresistible conclusion that the evidence was an
unsafe foundation for a conviction. Undoubtedly the Court of Appeal has this
jurisdiction but in order to exercise it here, it would have to find that the
jury could not reasonably convict the appellant of capital murder on the
evidence. It is, of course, no answer to the exercise of this jurisdiction by
an appellate court for the prosecution to say that there was some evidence to
go to the jury and that the appellate court should not interfere. But this is
not such a case. There was very substantial evidence here to go to the jury of
a planned and deliberate murder and it would be unwarranted interference with
the function of the jury to substitute the finding of an appellate court for
that of the jury on this point.

The appellant also seeks a new trial on the
ground that his defence was prejudiced by the introduction into evidence of two
pillows taken from his residence in 1961. The evidence was that there were
bloodstains on these pillows and that such blood had been on the pillows for a
period of from 6 months to 15 years. This objection should be rejected. The
pillows must be considered in relation to the whole of the evidence, including
that of the children. The objection to them is entirely a matter of weight.
They undoubtedly had some relevancy but I notice that in his address to the
jury, counsel for the Crown did not mention them, the learned trial judge did
not mention them but counsel for the defence did deal with them and made his
submission that they had no weight in the circumstances of the case. The evidence
was not improperly admitted. It was not

[Page 476]

unduly emphasized as to weight and it must be
considered, not in isolation, but as part and parcel of a large volume of
evidence given during the course of a lengthy trial.

At the conclusion of the argument in the Court
of Appeal, Laidlaw J.A., in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court,
noted that the charge was complete and correct in all matters touching the
issues to be determined by the jury and that there was no room for
misunderstanding or want of understanding on the part of the jury as to the
principles of law properly applicable to the evidence and that the verdict was
given according to law. I respectfully agree with this conclusion.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
