GROUNDS OF DECISION
These two appeals arose out of two applications by way of Notice for Further Directions taken out by the respective Defendants in these two actions. I shall refer hereinafter to Suit No. 1112 of 1996 as the first action and Suit No. 2323 of 1996 as the second action.
2 In the first action, the Defendants sought the following orders in their application taken out on 29 April 1998:
 
""1. That the trial of Suit No. 2323 of 1996 be heard immediately after the trial in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 by the same Judge;
 
2. That consequently the trial dates fixed for Suit No. 2323 of 1996 from 16
th
 June 1998 to 26
th
 June 1998 be vacated; and
 
3. Such further or other relief as this Honourable Court shall deem fit.
 
The grounds of this application are -
 
 
(a) There are some common questions of law or fact which arise in both Suits;
 
(b) There are at least four principal witnesses of fact who would testify in both Suits, namely, Patrick Chan Hing Kuen, Kevin Chau Kwok Fun, Chang Kung Git and Poon Sau Yuk;
 
(c) The common question of fact in both Suits, and the testimony of the principal witnesses described above, are of significant importance to the rest of the subject matter in both actions, so that it is desirable that both actions be heard and disposed of one immediately following the other; and
 
(d) It would be more expedient for Suit No. 1112 of 1996 to be heard before Suit 2323 of 1996 because:-
 
 
(i) in terms of chronology, the events in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 started earlier;
 
(ii) the dispute in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 involves a much larger amount; and
 
(iii) the disposal of Suit No. 1112 of 1996 by the Court may lead to a settlement of Suit No. 2323 of 1996.""
 
 
 
The first action has been fixed for hearing for 12 days from 11 to 26 August 1998.
3 In the second action, the Defendants sought, in their application taken out on 9 April 1998, similar orders based on broadly similar grounds as follows:
 
""1. That the time for service of this application be abridged, if necessary.
 
2. That time may be extended for the exchange of all affidavits of evidence in chief by a further 1 month from the date of the Order made herein and objections to the contents of the affidavit evidence shall be taken within 1 week after the exchange of the affidavit evidence;
 
3. That time for setting down this action for trial be extended by a further 2 weeks after the exchange of the affidavit evidence;
 
4. That the trial of Suit No. 2323 of 1996 be heard immediately after the trial in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 by the same Judge’
 
5. That consequently the trial dates fixed for Suit No. 2323 of 1996 from 16
th
 June 1998 to 26
th
 June 1998 be vacated;
 
6. Such further or other relief as this Honourable Court shall deem fit.
 
The grounds of this application are:-
 
 
(1) There are some common questions of law or fact which arise in both Suits;
 
(2) There are at least four principal witnesses of fact who would testify in both Suits, namely, Patrick Chan Hing Kuen, Kevin Chau Kwok Fun, Chang Kung Git and Poon Sau Yuk;
 
(3) The common question of fact in both Suits, and the testimony of the principal witnesses described above, are of significant importance to the rest of the subject matter in both actions, so that it is desirable that both actions be heard and disposed of one immediately following the other; and 
 
(4) The making of the order sought will save costs and time.
 
 
Further grounds of this application are set out in the affidavit of Raistlina Kwek to be filed herein.""
 
4 The basis on which these two applications were taken is Order 4 rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court which provides:-
 
""1. (1) Where two or more causes or matters are pending, then, if it appears to the Court -
 
 
(a) that some common question of law or fact arises in both or all of them;
 
(b) that the rights to relief claimed therein are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions; or 
 
(c) that for some other reason it is desirable to make an order under this Rule,
 
 
the Court may order those causes or matters to be consolidated on such terms as it thinks just or may order them to be tried at the same time or one immediately after another or may order any of them to be stayed until after the determination of any other of them.""
 
The Defendants emphasized that they were not applying for consolidation of the two actions.
5 The learned Assistant Registrar heard both applications together on 6 May 1998 and made the following orders:
 
""Affidavits to be exchanged by 3 June 1998. Objections by 10 June 1998. Matter to be set down by 15 July 1998. Trial dates - to be heard by the same Judge after Suit No. 1112 of 1996 from 27 August 1998 to 8 September 1998. Costs in the cause.""
 
6 The next day (7 May 1998), the Plaintiffs in both actions lodged these appeals against the orders made by the learned Assistant Registrar. I heard and allowed both appeals on 14 May 1998 and ordered that costs be in the cause. I also made consequential directions for the second action in view of the reinstatement of the trial dates from 16 June to 26 June 1998.
7 On 15 May 1998, the Defendants in the first action lodged an appeal against my decision. On Saturday 16 May 1998, the Defendants in both actions, by separate letters of the same date, asked that I certify that no further arguments were required pursuant to Section 34 (1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. I certified on the same day that I required no further arguments. Immediately, on that day, the Defendants in the second action lodged their Notice of Appeal.
8 I should state at the outset that I am not entirely sure that the Defendants in the first action, by lodging a Notice of Appeal first and asking for the certificate the next day, have complied strictly with the requirements of Section 34(1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which states:-
 
""34. (1) No appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following cases:
 
 
(a) …
 
(b) …
 
(c) subject to any other provision in this section, where a Judge makes an interlocutory order in chambers unless the Judge has certified, on application within 7 days after the making of the order by any party for further argument in court, that he requires no further arguments;"".
 
 
However, it does not really matter in substance as the appeal of the Defendants in the second action is properly before the Court of Appeal.
9 I shall now set out very briefly the allegations in the two actions. In the first action, the Plaintiffs say that they entered into a joint venture with certain Chinese parties to develop three projects in Shanghai, China. The Plaintiffs allege that Patrick Chan acted as agent for the Defendants and negotiated the Defendants’ involvement in the three projects. They also claim that certain obligations were imposed on the Defendants in respect of their involvement in the projects and that the Defendants did not meet those obligations. The Plaintiffs therefore seek an order for specific performance of those obligations and/or damages for the alleged breach of contract.
10 The Defendants deny that the terms of the oral agreements were as spelt out in the Plaintiffs’ claim. They also deny that Patrick Chan was their agent at any time. They claim that Patrick Chan was in fact the Plaintiffs’ agent and that he sought them out in the hope of persuading them to invest in the projects. Two of the projects were to be developed in a joint venture with the Chinese parties and the Defendants agreed to invest in the projects only on the basis that they would be given shareholding interests in the company designated as the Chinese parties’ joint venture partner. The Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs failed to ensure that they were given such interests. The Defendants therefore counterclaim for damages for the Plaintiffs’ alleged breach of contract. Their counterclaim also raises matters pertaining to two other agreements. More details of the first action are set out in the judgment of the Honourable Chief Justice Yong Pung How where His Honour allowed an application by the Defendants to admit Mr Jonathan Michael Caplan QC for the purpose of appearing in the action (see 
Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC
 (No. 2) 
[1998] 1 SLR 440
).
11 In the second action, the Plaintiffs are suing the Defendants in respect of fees due to them for having acted as consultants in two land acquisition projects in Shanghai. These two projects are not related to the projects in the first action. The First Defendant, Patrick Chan, is the eldest son of the two Plaintiffs here. It should be noted that the First Plaintiff in this action is also the Third Plaintiff in the first action. 
12 The Plaintiffs claim that they had two plots of land for potential development in Shanghai and were looking for parties to invest in the development. DBS Land indicated interest in one of the projects and an agreement was reached for a consultancy fee to be paid to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs claim that as between themselves and Patrick Chan, the fee would be shared in the ratio of 60:40. Patrick, however, asked that the agreement with DBS Land be signed by his company, the Second Defendant here, as he wanted his company to gain a reputation as a deal maker for projects in China. The Plaintiffs agreed. The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants failed to pay them their portion of the fees paid by DBS Land.
13 In respect of the second project, the Plaintiffs claim that Patrick Chan played no role in the negotiations with DBS Land although he signed the deal with DBS Land in the name of the Second Defendant again. The Plaintiffs aver therefore that neither of the Defendants was entitled to any part of the fees paid by DBS Land.
14 On the other hand, the Defendants aver that the said two projects were acquired through their own efforts and no agreement existed for the sharing of fees.
15 Having outlined the broad factual parameters of the two actions, it is now useful to study the sequence of relevant events set out compendiously in the Plaintiffs’ Chronology of Events:-

It is pertinent to note that an application for identical orders as those sought here was filed by the Defendants in the second action on 24 December 1997 but was subsequently withdrawn on 8 January 1998.
16 Two issues emerge from all the above:
 
(1) Is there some common question of law or fact in both actions which justifies an order that the actions be tried one after the other? Alternatively, is there ""some other reason"" rendering it ""desirable"" that such an order be made (see Order 4 rule 1(1)(a) and (c))?
 
(2) Is it desirable that the above order be made when its effect is to vacate 9 trial dates?
 
17 Counsel for the Defendants in the second action tells me that the desirability of having the two actions heard together became apparent after the Honourable Chief Justice delivered his judgment in respect of the admission of Mr Jonathan Michael Caplan QC on 1 November 1997. The Defendants’ solicitors were under the impression then that the second action would be heard in January 1998. They did not know then that the first action’s trial dates had been pushed back because of the difficulties in marshalling the evidence. According, they filed the earlier application in December 1997 and on discovering that the first action was not to be heard in January 1998, withdrew the application. With respect, the question why they did not nevertheless pursue the prayer that the second action be heard immediately after the first action remains unanswered.
18 When the Registrar gave the present hearing dates for the second action at the Pre-Trial Conference on 4 March 1998, the Defendants had asked for late dates as they wanted the first action to be tried first. The Plaintiffs opposed the application on the basis that the two actions were unconnected. I am told that the Registrar informed the parties that he was compelled to give the available trial dates and that if the parties wished, they could take out a formal application. However, this still does not explain why the Defendants took out this application only on 9 April 1998, more than a month after the said Pre-Trial Conference. The delay was exacerbated in that the application was served on the Plaintiffs only on 22 April 1998. The fact that the deadline for the exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief (8 April 1998) had just expired when the application was taken out lends support to the Plaintiffs’ contention that the real reason for the application was because the Defendants could not get their affidavits ready in time.
19 On the factual allegations, it appears to me that the central figure in both actions is Patrick Chan. The undercurrent in the disputes seems to be that the father (Mr Chan Kung Git) and his eldest son, Patrick Chan, do not see eye to eye. I am told that there is in fact a third unrelated action between father and son which is part-heard in the High Court. The focus, therefore, will not be so much on the other witnesses in both actions as it will be on Mr Chan Kung Git and his eldest son. If that is so, it appears to me more logical that the second action, which is essentially between father and son, be disposed of first. Hopefully, when the muddy waters in the unfortunate familial conflict have cleared, their true legal positions vis--vis the other parties will also emerge and a long drawn out battle in Court between erstwhile comrades in commerce may be averted. Apart from the facts that father and son feature strongly in both actions and that the stage is Shanghai, I see no other common question of law or fact warranting an order that the actions be tried one after the other.
20 Although the first action involves much larger claims and deals with events which started earlier, it is not necessarily better that it be the vanguard of the two suits. I quote here some of the words used by the Honourable Chief Justice Yong Pung How (in His Honour’s judgment on the admission of the Queen’s Counsel) to describe the first action - ""factually, it was extremely complex""; ""the intricacy of the parties’ business arrangements is plain""; ""the convoluted web of facts which will need to be unraveled""; ""the moneys remitted pursuant to the agreements apparently followed an elaborate route; and the process by which these moneys were disbursed seems to be no less bewildering""; ""the documents given in discovery are far in excess of the norm"". It is clear, and none of the parties before me disputes this, that the first action is much more complicated factually than the second. There is also the issue of the counterclaim there. Good sense dictates that the relatively simpler task be undertaken first. The less complex second action should therefore be heard before the first action.
21 The fact that several witnesses are common to both actions does not take the matter very much further as they will be testifying on different projects and different agreements. As they also appear to be either professionals or business people, I am not persuaded that having them cut off from their work or business for one prolonged stretch of time is necessarily better than two separate but shorter periods. As I have said earlier, one hopes that the second trip from abroad will be obviated after the action between father and son has been disposed of.
22 The related issue here is of course the question of vacating the 9 days of trial in June. In a recent judgment delivered on 20 April 1998 in 
Chan Kern Miang v Kea Resources Pte Ltd
, the Court of Appeal said:
 
""13. We shall first deal with the issue of vacating hearing dates. In recent years, in the interest of prompt administration of justice and efficiency and to avoid wastage of judicial time, the High Court adopted a strict view on the question of vacating hearing dates. Strong compelling grounds must exist before the Court will consider the exercise of its discretion.""
 
23 In the case of 
Kuah Kok Kim and others v Ernst & Young
 (Suit 193 of 1997), I had cause to borrow the words of the Honourable Chief Justice used on another occasion that:
 
""Trial dates are a very precious commodity …""
 
24 It is possible that other cases may be found to fill all the trial dates if they are vacated since the first date of hearing is more than one month away at the time of the hearing of the applications and of the appeals before me. However, it must be borne in mind that the trial dates fall within the mid-year court vacation and the school holidays. It is probable that many solicitors (and their clients) would have made holiday plans and be unable to capitalize on the vacated trial dates. Above all, I do not think the facts of this case amount to ""strong compelling grounds"" justifying a vacation of the trial dates.
25 Accordingly, I allowed the appeals by the Plaintiffs in both actions.
